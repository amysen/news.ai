What do you say about a man who invalidates 86.4 percent of a country's currency overnight, and then keeps coming up with explanations over the next one year to tell the citizens that it was a success?

You don't need to be an economist to realize that if the bulk of currency in a country where transactions are largely carried out in cash (80 to 98 percent, depending on which estimate one takes), is suddenly invalidated, the results will largely be disastrous, a few benefits here and there, notwithstanding.

It has almost been a year since Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a late evening broadcast to the nation, invalidated Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. The idea was to attack black money and fake currency which were used to finance terrorism.

As the press release accompanying the demonetisation decision put it: ""Use of high denomination notes for storage of unaccounted wealth has been evident from cash recoveries made by law enforcement agencies from time to time.""

Modi invalidated Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, which he said were used to store black money, and then decided to introduce a Rs 2,000 note, making it even more easier for those who have black money, to store some of it, in the form of cash.

Let's look at a few points one by one.

1) The total value of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes that were invalidated stood at Rs 15.44 lakh crore. On November 15, 2016, a week after Modi announced the demonetisation decision, the Attorney General, Mukul Rohatgi told the Supreme Court that the government expected that around Rs 4-5 lakh crore of the invalidated notes won't make it back into the banking system.

The hope was that those who have black money in the form of cash will not deposit it in the banks because they would end up creating an audit trail. This would end up destroying black money. Of course, nothing of that sort happened.

Around 99 per cent of the invalidated currency made it back into banks. This basically meant that what was supposed to be an attack on black money became a big money laundering scheme.

2) Why did this happen? This happened primarily because no basic research was carried out to check if demonetisation could really attack black money. In May 2012, the ministry of finance had published a White Paper on black money. As per data offered in this White Paper, it can be calculated that on an average around 4.9 percent of the black money is held in the form of cash. A bulk of the black money is held in the form of real estate and gold. Hence, by attacking cash/currency, Modi ended up sending the entire country on a merry-go-round. This is what happens when you make a decision that goes against the data that is on offer.

3) In August 2014, Raghuram Rajan, the then governor of the Reserve Bank of India, whom the Modi government let go by not offering a second term, said: ""In the past, demonetisation has been thought of as a way of getting black money out of circulation. Because people then have to come and say 'how do I have this 10 crores in cash sitting in my safe and they have to explain where they got the money from. It is often cited as a solution. Unfortunately, my sense is, the clever find ways around it.""

Rajan further said: ""Black money hoarders find ways to divide their hoard into many smaller pieces...I think there are ways around demonetisation. It is not that easy to flush out the black money.""

Thus, a decision which was supposed to destroy black money, helped people launder it.

This is precisely what happened. Those with black money found various ingenious ways to divide their black money into smaller amounts and exchange it. Thus, a decision which was supposed to destroy black money, helped people launder it.

This was before any such proposal for demonetisation was on the table. As Rajan writes in his recently released book I Do What I Do: ""I was asked by the government in February 2016 for my views on demonetization, which I gave orally. Although there might be long-term benefits, I felt the likely short-term economic costs would outweigh them, and felt there were potentially better alternatives to achieve the main goals. I made these views known in no uncertain terms.""

Of course, PM Modi decided not to listen to the best economist he had at his disposal.

4) No country in a reasonably good economic position has demonetised currency in the past, at the same level that India did. This is primarily because the economics of demonetisation is very complex. This was also overlooked. In short, there was enough evidence available which said that demonetisation as a tool to weed out black money, would not work.

5) Demonetisation was also supposed to ""to curb financing of terrorism through the proceeds of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN)."" Take a look at Table 1, which basically lists out the number of fake currency notes that were detected in the banking system.

Table 1: Denomination-wise Counterfeit Notes Detected in the Banking System

(April to March)

(Source: Annual report of the Reserve Bank of India)

The number of fake Rs 500 (old) and Rs 1,000 notes that were detected during the financial year stood at around 5.74 lakh. The total number of demonetised notes stood at around 2,400 crore. This basically means that as a proportion, the fake notes identified between April 2016 to March 2017 stands close to 0 percent of the demonetised notes.

Demonetisation failed to achieve its second big objective. In fact, if you look at Table 1 carefully, fake notes of the new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 hit the market, soon after demonetisation.

6) In a matter of few weeks it was clear that demonetisation would not achieve its two main objectives. Hence, a third objective was introduced. This was to move towards a cashless society through digital transactions.

As Modi said in the November 2016 edition of the Mann Ki Baat radio programme: ""The great task that the country wants to accomplish today is the realisation of our dream of a 'Cashless Society'. It is true that a hundred percent cashless society is not possible. But why should India not make a beginning in creating a 'less-cash society'? Once we embark on our journey to create a 'less-cash society', the goal of 'cashless society' will not remain very far.""

Indeed, a very noble motive, but at what cost?

How are things looking on this front? Let's first look at the total value of digital transactions. Data for total digital transactions is available up to August 2017 and has been adjusted for real time gross settlement, which can only be used for transactions of Rs 2 lakh or more. Take a look at Figure 1.

(Source: Reserve Bank of India)

The total value of digital transactions in August 2017 was more or less similar to the total value of digital transactions before demonetisation. As Figure 1 tells us, digital transactions by value kept increasing between January and August 2016. After that they have gone up and down. This also reflects the overall slowdown of the economy post demonetisation.

How do things look, when it comes to volume of digital transactions? Take a look at Figure 2.

Figure 2:

(Source: Reserve Bank of India)

While, there was a huge one time jump when it comes to the volume of digital transactions post demonetisation, things have remained flattish since then. The initial jump wasn't surprising given that there was barely any cash going around in the financial system. But that growth hasn't sustained.

Hence, the digital goal has not been achieved either. Such a fundamental behavioral change cannot be made overnight. People have to be nudged towards it and not forced, as was the case.

7) In the game of changing goal posts, an increase in the income tax base, has been highlighted as another benefit of demonetisation. The question is, has this increase translated into higher direct tax collections? For the period, April to September 2017, ""Net Direct Tax collections represent 39.4% of the total Budget Estimates of Direct Taxes"". For the same period last year, ""38.65% of the Budget Estimates of direct taxes for FY 2016-17 has been achieved.""

Yes, there has been a marginal improvement in direct tax collection. But this still does not justify the destructive effect that demonetisation had on the economy.

Another point made in the game of changing goal posts is that income tax notices have been sent to many people. So, what? People with black money have access to the best CAs and the best lawyers, and know how the system functions. They aren't exactly sitting there waiting to pay fines and hand over their money to the government.

Also, take a look at Table 2. This tells us very clearly, the limited processing capacity of the Income Tax department.

Table 2:

(Source: Annual Report, Ministry of Finance)

8) There is enough evidence going around by now to say that the informal part of the economy, which dealt in cash, received a huge blow, from which it is yet to come out. The tragedy is that much of this is not reflected in the GDP numbers, given that the GDP numbers tend to measure the formal part of the economy, and not the informal one.

Also, there is a huge contradiction here. The Modi government has been saying that self-employment is the way forward when it comes to jobs. If self-employment is the way forward, then the informal sector needs to be handled with care.

In fact, as former prime minister Manmohan Singh, put it in an interview to Bloomberg Quint: ""The value created by the informal sector will be captured in the form of income, wealth or consumption effects. Hence, we must be cautious about sweeping generalisations about the informal economy and passing moral judgments about the entire sector.""

9) One of the claimed successes of demonetisation has been that the cash to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio has come down. In a speech made on October 4, 2017, Modi said: ""Demontisation के बाद Cash to GDP Ratio अब 9 प्रतिशत पर आ गया है। (after demonetisation, the cash to GDP ratio has come down to 9 per cent.""

This fall in cash to GDP ratio is being passed off as an achievement and the fact that nation as a whole has become more honest. As Modi said in the speech referred to earlier in the piece: ""भाइयों और बहनों, इस सरकार ने देश में संस्थागत ईमानदारी को मजबूत करने का काम किया है। ये सरकार के अथक परिश्रम का ही परिणाम है कि आज देश की अर्थव्यवस्था कम Cash के साथ चल रही है। (Brothers and sisters, this government has worked to strengthen the institutional honesty of the country. It is due to the tireless hard-work of this government that today the country's economy is running on less cash.)""

For the period of three months ending March 2017 and June 2017, the non-government part of the GDP (which forms around 90 per cent of the GDP) has grown by a little over 4 per cent. When growth in economic activity slows down, the growth in currency in circulation is bound to be impacted as well.

So, yes, the hard work of the government has led to a lower cash to GDP ratio, but at the cost of slowing down economic activity. Hence, claiming this as success, is more of trying to build a narrative around demonetisation being successful, rather than being an actual success of any sort.

10) Another point that is being made is that a lower cash to GDP ratio means that the country has become more honest. Take a look Figure 3. It basically plots the cash to GDP ratio of different countries.

Figure 3:

(Source: https://scholar.harvard.edu/rogoff/curse_of_cash_data)

Japan has the highest cash to GDP ratio at 19.4 per cent. India is nearly half of that at around a little over 10 per cent. Is India a more honest nation than Japan? As per the Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index for 2016, Japan is the twentieth least corrupt country in the world. India stands at the 79th position, despite having a much lower cash to GDP ratio.

To conclude, one year after demonetisation, all the destruction that was unleashed in its aftermath, could have been avoided, if PM Modi had heard the best economist he had at his disposal, and not an accountant masquerading as one.

Or take the case of Brazil, which has a cash to GDP ratio of 3.31 per cent. Like India, it is the 79th least corrupt country in the world. Then there is the Eurozone (country's which basically use euro as their currency). Their cash to GDP ratio is higher than that of India. Is the Eurozone more corrupt than India?

Hence, the link between a low cash to GDP ratio and low corruption is basically very weak. It is basically something that the Modi government has invented in order to build a positive narrative around demonetisation.

To conclude, one year after demonetisation, all the destruction that was unleashed in its aftermath, could have been avoided, if PM Modi had heard the best economist he had at his disposal, and not an accountant masquerading as one.

Vor seiner Hochzeit dachte er, er wisse schon alles über Sex

Erst nach und nach hat er gelernt, was guten Sex wirklich ausmacht

Ich bin 41 Jahre alt und schon seit fast zwei Jahrzehnten mit der gleichen, wunderschönen Frau verheiratet. Über die Jahre hinweg musste ich mich mit einigen Mythen und Irrtümern über Sex auseinandersetzen.

Die meisten dieser falschen Vorstellungen hatte ich schon, bevor ich verheiratet war und es hat Jahre gedauert, bis sie sich aufgelöst haben. Wenn ich zehn Tipps für guten Sex an mein unverheiratetes Ich schicken könnte, wären das diese:

1. Sex läuft nicht wie im Fernsehen oder in Filmen ab

Das meiste, was du über Sex weißt, kommt aus der Werbung, aus dem Fernsehen oder aus Filmen.

Anders ausgedrückt: Sex sieht aus wie spontanes, makelloses Liebemachen, voller Romantik - Marvin Gaye läuft und Kerzen sind auf dem Fensterbrett drapiert.

Sexuelle Intimität funktioniert in einer Ehe definitiv NICHT so. Im seltensten Fall läuft Marvin Gaye.

Aber sei nicht enttäuscht: Sex in der Ehe ist anders als im Film, aber es ist auch viel besser.

2. Eine Randnotiz zur Häufigkeit - bereite dich darauf vor

Im Moment denkst du noch, dass man in einer Ehe ständig Sex haben wird, so gut wie jede Sekunde am Tag und tausendmal in der Woche - denn, warum denn auch nicht!?

Lebe diesen Traum, so lange du kannst und reite dein getreues Einhorn in den Süßigkeiten-bedeckten Sonnenuntergang, wo du dann deinen wilden Ewok streicheln kannst und über die Brücke nach Terabithia gehst.

Glaub an deinen Traum. So lange du kannst. Das ist alles.

3. Sex ist wie ein guter Wein - er wird besser im Alter

Sexuelle Intimität ist etwas, in dem du immer besser werden wirst. Es braucht Kommunikation, Übung und Zeit.

Im Moment denkst du, dein Sex-IQ ist auf dem Level eines Genies, aber du würdest in einer Sex-Abschlussprüfung komplett versagen mit dem, was du weißt.

4. Sex ist nicht nur ""bekommen"", sondern auch ""geben""

Es ist tatsächlich schön, dem anderen etwas zu geben. Sei nicht die ganze Zeit über ein ""Nehmer"".

Sexuelle Intimität ist wunderbar, um Verzicht und Anstrengung zu vereinen. Wenn du das jetzt in deinen Kopf bekommst, wird das ""bekommen"" nur noch besser.

Im ""geben"" liegt eine unfassbare Schönheit und viele Geheimnisse. Sei großzügig.

5. Männer und Frauen denken nicht auf die gleiche Art über Sex

Für dich ist Sex körperliche Anziehung und es ist sehr visuell und augenblicklich.

Vielleicht ist es besser, wenn du dich jetzt erst mal setzt: Frauen empfinden Sex als Teil einer Beziehung, als Sicherheit und als Anzeichen, wie sehr sie geliebt und verlangt werden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Sex-Experten raten: Diese 9 Dinge solltet ihr mit eurem Partner viel öfter machen

Für dich ist Sex wie ein Lichtschalter ohne Dimmer. Du bist sowas von bereit, jederzeit (außer du schläfst... aber das muss dann schon eine Todesschlaf sein).

Für sie ist Sex wie ein Schmorbraten, der viel Zeit braucht, um zu köcheln.

Das wird euch beide sehr frustrieren. Aber das ist ok. Das bringt euch näher zusammen, auf einer viel tieferen Ebene.

6. Sex macht dein Leben nicht vollkommen

Momentan legst du wahnsinnig viel Wert auf Sex. Lass uns ehrlich sein: Du denkst ständig daran.

Du sollst wissen, sexuelle Intimität ist fantastisch und sehr befriedigend und unglaublich auf die schönsten Art und Weisen - aber es darf kein Götzenbild sein. Es ist ein Geschenk, das man in der Ehe genießen sollte.

7. Sex kann Spaß machen, lustig und verspielt sein

Es gibt so viele Blickwinkel, was sexuelle Intimität betrifft und die meisten davon sind dir jetzt noch nicht bewusst. Du denkst zu eindimensional über Sex.

Sexuelle Intimität ist auch Verletzlichkeit und Authentizität und wenn du jemanden wirklich liebst, hast du nichts zu verstecken - und ich meine wirklich nichts.

Du kannst dein ehrlichstes Ich sein.

8. Sie zu verführen ist wie eine legale Sexdroge für ihre Seele

Ich habe es vorhin schon angedeutet, aber das ist wahrscheinlich das beste Geheimnis, dass ich dir mit auf den Weg geben kann: Verführe sie.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Diese Paare haben mit dem Sex bis zur Hochzeit gewartet - jetzt verraten sie, ob es sich gelohnt hat

Zeig ihr, dass du sie nicht nur körperlich willst. Verführe ihren Geist. Verführe ihr Herz. Verführe sie auf jede mögliche Weise.

Denk daran, sie denkt nicht so an Sex, wie du es tust - du bist Haut und Haar und sie ist Herz und Seele.

9. Es ist geheimnisvoller als du denkst

Und noch mal: Gerade sind deine Ansichten über Sex ziemlich simpel.

Es ist schwer zu erklären und ich verstehe es auch heute noch nicht so ganz, aber es passiert etwas Magisches, wenn zwei Menschen Sex haben. Es ist etwas fast Kosmisches, das zwei Seelen aneinander bindet,

10. Sex in der Ehe ist eine Art der Verehrung

Wenn ich sage Sex ist Verehrung, denkst du wahrscheinlich, ich bin verrückt. Aber es ist wahr.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 8 Angewohnheiten von Paaren, die ein erfülltes Sexleben haben

Der Akt ist eine Art der Verehrung, schlicht und einfach. Es ist wie alte Lieder singen, nur mit Körpern. Okay, das hat sich jetzt unheimlich angehört. Lass es uns einfach Verehrung nennen.

Ich hoffe wirklich, dass du dir diese Gedanken zu Herzen nimmst. Denn letzten Endes ist Sex in der Ehe noch viel schöner, als du es dir vorstellen kannst.

Last weekend, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned to an unscheduled court hearing at which Johnson’s remarks were cited as proof that she had been engaged in “propaganda against the regime”. Meanwhile, the mother-of-one’s family maintain she was simply on holiday in the country to show her infant daughter Gabriella to her grandparents. “You’re so incredibly vulnerable in there - you can’t control what people are saying on the outside or how that might affect you,” Parvaz said. “The fact is, if she hears this is happening, it will be devastating. If one thing you have said is found to be what they consider to be a lie or inconsistent, everything you say is a lie.”

Chris J Ratcliffe via Getty Images Zaghari-Ratcliffe has already been sentenced to five years in prison for 'propaganda against the regime'

According to Parvaz, detainees face daily cross-examinations, with interrogators constantly changing conditions in an attempt to trip prisoners up and get them to admit to their alleged crimes. “You have to wage a big psychological battle everyday to try and keep your mind straight, to get through interrogation, to convince the people questioning you that you’re not what they’re accusing you of being,” she said. “You have no interaction with anybody else. If you happen to pass somebody in the courtyard, you’re absolutely not allowed to say a word.” Before she was released from the prison after two and a half weeks without charge, the journalist, who worked for Al Jazeera at the time, was held in solitary confinement and blindfolded almost constantly when allowed out of her cell.

Una grana per uno dei clan più potenti i cui affari sono in mano al 26enne Hugh Grosvenor, il miliardario più giovane del Paese.

L'inchiesta sui Paradise Papers è condotta da un consorzio di giornalisti investigativi che stanno esaminando un database di 13,4 milioni di documenti che tirano in ballo diversi personaggi di spicco coinvolti in investimenti nei cosiddetti paradisi fiscali, tra cui membri dell'amministrazione Trump oltre ad aziende di primario rilievo mondiale come Uber e Apple e sportivi come Louis Hamilton.

Great America, de Guy Hervier (29,90 €) est publié aux éditions Macha publishingÀ voir également sur Le HuffPost:","Donald Trump aura bientôt terminé la première année de son mandat, et on en serait presque aussi étonné qu'à l'annonce de sa victoire aux élections présidentielles. Celui qui a contesté la légitimité de son prédécesseur pendant plusieurs années au motif qu'il ne serait pas né aux Etats-Unis, a été mis en question dès son élection. Et plus encore quand il est entré dans le Bureau Ovale le 20 janvier 2017. Il est vrai qu'il doit son élection aux bizarreries du système électoral américain. Une marge de 77 000 voix réparties entre le Wisconsin, la Pennsylvanie et le Michigan ont donné à Donald Trump la totalité des voix des Grands Electeurs de ces trois Etats, et lui ont permis de rafler la majorité au niveau national. Et tout ça malgré un déficit de près de 3 millions de voix populaires par rapport à sa concurrente Hillary Clinton.

Le candidat qui se veut avant tout provocateur, comme un antidote au politiquement correct, allait-il se transformer en un président respectable et se présidentialiser? A 71 ans, après avoir passé sa vie à n'avoir de compte à rendre à personne, sans aucune expérience de la gouvernance politique ou d'entreprise - Donald Trump dirigeait une PME familiale sans aucun contre-pouvoir - était-il raisonnable de penser qu'il pouvait changer? C'est ce comportement anti-establishment et cette soi-disant volonté de ""drainer le marécage"" (""drain the swamp"") qui l'a conforté dans cette attitude, inédite pour un président, et qui l'a rendu si populaire auprès de 35 % d'Américains constituant ce que l'on appelle sa base. Les conditions étaient donc réunies pour une présidence tout sauf ordinaire. Et sur ce point, le résultat est tout sauf décevant.

Avec une majorité au Sénat (52 sur 100, qui n'empêche pas les opérations de filibuster) et à la Chambre des Représentants, Donald Trump avait les mains libres pour mettre en œuvre son programme, entre autres remplacer l'Obamacare, construire un mur pour empêcher les ""hordes de violeurs mexicains"" de passer la frontière, engager une grande réforme fiscale et lancer un vaste programme de construction d'infrastructures. Sur tous ces sujets, le résultat est inexistant.

Quatre projets législatifs majeurs en panne

La première initiative a concerné la réforme de l'assurance maladie. Depuis que l'ACA (Affordable Care Act), alias Obamacare, a été votée en 2009, les Républicains n'ont eu de cesse de la critiquer sous le slogan Repeal and Replace. Donald Trump leur a emboité le pas déclarant que, dès sa nomination, il soutiendrait une réforme qui remplacerait l'ACA, qu'il qualifie régulièrement de catastrophe. Les Républicains de la Chambre des Représentants ont surmonté leurs différences pour voter une nouvelle loi (ACHA, pour American Health Care Act), mais quelques voix dissonantes au Sénat ont suffi pour bloquer leurs efforts. La date limite du 30 septembre ayant été dépassée, toute nouvelle loi nécessitera la supermajorité de 60 voix et est donc vouée à l'échec. Donald Trump ne s'est pas gêné pour exprimer son énervement, rejetant la faute de son échec sur le Sénat.

Ce couac à demi-digéré, il fallait donc passer à autre chose. Ce fut alors la réforme fiscale dont l'objectif est de doper l'économie, selon la bonne vieille théorie du ruissellement (trickle down economics). Selon ce schéma qui n'a jamais fait ses preuves, une forte réduction des impôts des riches et des entreprises profite à tout le monde. La version actuelle envisagée par les Républicains est d'une envergure bien plus large que celle engagée par Ronald Reagan il y a une trentaine d'années. Toutefois, si neuf mois n'ont pas permis de mener à bien la réforme de la santé, on peut s'interroger si la réforme fiscale verra le jour avant les élections de mi-mandat (midterms). Quant au fameux mur et aux infrastructures, faute de financement, ils sont simplement remis aux calendes grecques.

Si cette première année a été blanche sur le plan législatif, ce n'est pas pour autant qu'elle ait été inactive. Obsédé par son prédécesseur, Donald Trump n'a eu de cesse de vouloir effacer l'héritage de Barack Obama, en signant des décrets faisant sauter des réglementations dans tous les domaines, notamment environnementaux, économiques et sociaux. Il a aussi nommé un juge conservateur à la Cour Suprême et pourrait bien être en mesure d'en nommer un ou deux autres durant son mandat, façonnant ainsi la société américaine pour les vingt années, voire trente, à venir. Car faut-il rappeler que ces nominations sont à vie?

Jeu à somme nulle

Fort de son principe ""America First"", Donald Trump a mis un terme au TPP (accord transpacifique), engagé une renégociation du NAFTA avec le Canada et le Mexique qui s'avère âpre, s'est retiré de l'accord de Paris sur le Climat signé par 191 pays lors de COP21, rejoignant ainsi la Syrie et le Venezuela, et mis en doute l'intérêt de l'OTAN. Il a fait entendre sa voix toujours dans le même sens: les Etats-Unis vont tout revoir à l'aune de leurs seuls intérêts. ""Et comme beaucoup de démagogues avant lui, Donald Trump perçoit la vie comme un jeu à somme nulle où, si certains gagnent, d'autres doivent perdre"", écrit Hillary Clinton dans son livre What Happened.

Après avoir bombardé la Syrie et lancé la ""mère de toutes les bombes"" sur l'Afghanistan, deux actions isolées sans véritable stratégie, il a été contraint de concentrer son attention sur la Corée du Nord et ses provocations répétées. Mais les marges de manœuvre restent faibles étant donné le risque d'une frappe nucléaire ordonnée par Kim Jong Un sur son voisin du Sud ou sur le Japon. Donald Trump a multiplié les menaces sans grande efficacité jusqu'ici laissant planer le doute nucléaire. Mais il n'a pas réussi à faire bouger la Chine, principal acteur de cet épineux problème. Il ne s'est pas gêné pour remettre en cause les démarches de son secrétaire d'Etat, Rex Tillerson, sur ce sujet comme sur celui de l'Iran où il a refusé de signer la certification de l'accord sur le nucléaire. Le problème est que cet accord a été signé avec la Chine, la Russie, la France, le Royaume-Uni, l'Allemagne. Là encore, il a laissé au Congrès la décision sur d'éventuelles nouvelles sanctions. C'est donc un saut dans l'inconnu que fait Donald Trump.

Sur le plan économique, la situation est plutôt bonne avec le taux de chômage le plus faible depuis plus de 15 ans, des entreprises placées sous le signe du dynamisme, des marchés financiers très (trop? Certains observateurs parlent d'un nouvelle bulle) actifs... Cette vigueur n'est que la suite de la politique menée par Barack Obama après la crise de 2008. Qu'à cela ne tienne, Donald Trump n'était pas encore entré à la Maison Blanche qu'il s'attribuait déjà le mérite des bons résultats engrangés par l'économie américaine.

Au-delà de l'imprévisibilité et de l'incohérence, le mandat de Donald Trump est placé sous haute surveillance, avec l'investigation en cours du procureur spécial Robert Mueller sur l'intervention russe pendant les élections, la possible collusion avec l'équipe de campagne de Donald Trump et la possibilité d'une obstruction pour étouffer cette enquête, avec notamment le limogeage de James Comey, le directeur du FBI. Si cette menace qui pèse sur le président faisait émerger des preuves, elle pourrait ouvrir la voie à l'impeachment. Mais la route vers la destitution est longue et les démocrates ont plutôt intérêt à se mettre en bon ordre de marche pour les élections de novembre 2018 s'ils veulent être en mesure de reprendre le contrôle.

En attendant, ces personnalités, parmi lesquelles figurent le célèbre milliardaire Al-Walid ben Talal, dorment en prison. Enfin, une prison particulière. Et même très particulière, puisqu'il s'agit du Ritz-Carlton de la capitale Riyad, qui figure parmi les ""plus majestueux des hôtels cinq étoiles"".

Selon son site internet, ses clients peuvent profiter de dizaines d'hectares de jardins ""somptueusement aménagés"", de 500 chambres ""spacieuses et somptueuses"", d'un spa de ""classe mondiale"" et d'une ""superbe"" piscine intérieure.

A moins, bien sûr, que vous ne fassiez donc partie du groupe de la trentaine de membres de la famille royale et des élites saoudiennes arrêtés dans cette ""élégante oasis"", qui fait désormais office de prison la plus luxueuse au monde.

Le fait de détenir de telles personnalités dans une cellule de prison pendant qu'elles font l'objet d'une enquête aurait été considéré comme profondément insultant dans ce pays très conservateur. Le prince héritier Mohammed ben Salmane ""n'aurait pas pu les mettre en prison, a déclaré un haut responsable saoudien, cité par le Guardian. C'est la solution la plus digne qu'il pouvait trouver"".

Les clients ont eux été expulsés samedi soir du palace et envoyés dans d'autres hôtels pour faire place aux nouveaux occupants récalcitrants, rapporte encore le Guardian.

Par ailleurs, un message posté sur le site du Ritz-Carlton se lit comme suit: ""En raison de circonstances imprévues, les lignes Internet et téléphoniques de l'hôtel sont actuellement déconnectées jusqu'à nouvel ordre.""

Par le passé, des invités du palace se sont nommés Donald Trump -qui a exprimé son soutien à la purge saoudienne-, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama ou encore un certain nombre de milliardaires saoudiens.

Er bricht Tabus – und die Menschen feiern ihn dafür

Witze über Behinderte? Ein Tabu. Witze über Schwarze? Oder Schwule? Auch nicht gern gehört. Zumindest nicht in der Öffentlichkeit.

Es gibt gute Gründe dafür. Minderheiten sind ein viel zu einfaches Ziel. Behinderte etwa können sich oft nicht wehren. Und es fühlt sich einfach nicht richtig und anständig an, über Menschen zu lachen, die es ohnehin nicht so leicht haben in der Gesellschaft.

Gefühlt denkt die Mehrheit der Menschen in Deutschland, Behinderte, Schwarze oder Homosexuelle gewissermaßen in Schutz nehmen zu müssen.

Der deutsche Comedian Chris Tall sieht das anders. Er sagt: ""Wir sollten in Deutschland viel mehr lachen – und zwar über alles und jeden."" Für ihn sind das ""Gags auf Augenhöhe"".

Tall ist kein Unbekannter. Er wurde 2013 mit dem RTL Comedy Grand Prix ausgezeichnet. 2016 bekam er den deutschen Comedypreis als Bester Newcomer.

""Die Leute sind ausgerastet vor Freude""

Er findet: Man muss Witze über Minderheiten machen, weil man sie gerade so – und nur so – nicht ausgrenzt.

In einer Show erzählte er von einem Erlebnis, das dazu geführt habe, dass Behinderte und Nicht-Betroffene unverkrampfter miteinander umgegangen seien. Eben weil er über einen Rollstuhlfahrer vor tausenden Menschen gewitzelt habe (siehe Video):

""Die Leute sind ausgerastet vor Freude, dass wir ihn alle normal behandelt haben"", sagt Tall. Leider habe er dieses Aha-Erlebnis erst gegen Ende der Tournee gehabt.

Mehr als 50.000 Menschen gefällt der Show-Ausschnitt auf Facebook. Das spricht dafür, dass er mit seiner Meinung nicht alleine dasteht.

Bei Tall klingt das nicht nur vorgeschoben oder wie eine einfache Rechtfertigung für billigen Spaß. Weil Tall sich selbst und jeden anderen genauso gnadenlos auslacht. Gleichberechtigung sozusagen. Für ihn gibt es nur einen einzigen Grund, nicht über Minderheiten zu lachen: wenn der Witz nicht gut ist.

""Nachher sind sie ganz locker""

Die Menschen zusammenbringen, das ist der Punkt. Dass das Behinderte selbst so sehen, zeigt Phil Hubbe. Der Comiczeichner ist an Multiple Sklerose erkrankt. Trotzdem oder gerade deswegen zeichnet er Karikaturen über Menschen mit Behinderungen und macht Witze über Gehandicapte.



Er sagt: ""Als ich angefangen habe, war auch der Punkt: Naja, Witze über Behinderte, muss man da vielleicht irgendwas reinbringen, irgendwas Pädagogisches? Das funktioniert nicht. Den Zeigefinger da rein, das ist völliger Quatsch.""

Und weiter: ""Wenn man zeichnen will, muss erst der Witz funktionieren und bei einigen, die regen dann auch zum Nachdenken an. Und deshalb freue ich mich zu sehen, wenn in Ausstellungen Betroffene und Nicht-Betroffene dann zusammenstehen. Also erst dieses Verkrampfte und dann nachher sind sie ganz locker.""

When did it become okay for men to tickle their female colleagues or give them a full-body hug from behind or sandwich them between each other in the workplace? I don't think even wrestlers do so, right?

But hey, it seems a little slap and tickle is more than kosher on the sets of 'The Great Indian Light Molestation', sorry, I meant 'Laughter Challenge'.

Far more disturbing than the alleged sexist slur on The Great Indian Laughter Challenge and the ensuing controversy between Mallika Dua and Akshay Kumar, are the opening credits of the show – as I found out over the last two weekends. For all of you who've missed the show, let me bring you up to speed. The Great Indian Laughter Challenge is a show on Star India which has a celebrity judge in the form of Akshay Kumar, who has done his share of comedy. And had three mentor judges — Zakir Khan, Hussain Dalal and Mallika Dua — who would choose 12 stand-up comics as finalists for the show. The show's anchor is Katrina Kaif-doppelganger and Bigg Boss contestant Eli Avram.

All good till now. It's not a manel, there's female representation, and the judges and mentors are all directly connected to comedy. (The three mentor judges have been removed as of last week, to be replaced by that doyen of comedy, Sajid Khan and the saving grace that is Shreyas Talpade.) The format of the show is that if you want to choose a contestant, you have to ring a bell or ""bell bajao"" – a take on the Hindi aesthetic phrase, ""bell bajaana"". Or to take the mickey out of someone.

The week of the three mentors being summarily removed from the show, there was a brouhaha because journalist Vinod Dua wrote a Facebook post about the sexist remarks made by the ""cretin"" Akshay Kumar about his daughter Mallika when she was ringing the bell for a contestant. Kumar said, ""Tum uska bell bejao, mein tumhara bell bajaata hu"" (literally translating to - you ring his bell and I'll ring yours). Mallika posted about it, got trolled by Akshay fans, and deleted the post soon after.

This was followed by a video being released of a comic who imitated Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi to wide applause (and was the same person Dua was ringing the bell for). This comic's act was deleted from the show and he was asked to perform a new act. Everyone cried censorship, blue murder, we love comedy - the usual noises were made and forgotten.

Which is what made me tune into this show to see what the kerfuffle was all about.

And I must admit none of these controversies match up to what were the opening credits of the show, or how the female mentors and anchors (I'm sure with their permission) are physically treated in the programme.

The opening credits of the episodes with Dua, Dalal and Khan had Akshay Kumar repeatedly tickle Mallika Dua. Because that's what grown men are supposed to do to grown women on a show about comedy. Tickle them. Not tickle the male mentors, though. That would be too 'gay', right? If there was something to be offended by, one would think it would be this. But these are concessions one must make for getting a toehold in mainstream entertainment, I suppose.

None of these controversies match up to what were the opening credits of the show, or how the female mentors and anchors (I'm sure with their permission) are physically treated in the programme.

Now this treatment wasn't reserved for Mallika Dua. In the episode in which Sajid Khan and Shreyas Talpade came on as judges, there was no one to tickle in the credits. But the producers, director and I'm assuming Kumar thought outside the box and came up with a routine which left me goggle-eyed. Eli Avram, the anchor, came on the stage only to have Sajid Khan hold a red heart-shaped balloon against her chest, while Talpade held it against her back. They then sandwiched her between them, with Khan facing her and jumping to and fro while holding the said balloon to her bosom. Through it all, Akshay Kumar laughed uproariously. Avram also giggled. And finally, Kumar hugged Avram from the back.

This is a workplace which seems tailor-made for Harvey Weinstein, Dustin Hoffman, Shakti Kapoor, and Brett Ratner.

We all know that jokes about Mr Modi may not pass muster on most channels. But that really is the least of our concerns right now. Going by 'The List' being released, and the unending stories of powerful men who have gotten away with sexually harassing women at the workplace, there are far greater worries than not being able to crack a joke about Modi. The rampant sexism and manhandling of women, which seems to pass off as normal in Hindi films and TV shows, is actually what we should be concerned about while discussing The Great Laughter Challenge. What's worse is that the women seem to be loving the inappropriate touching and attention, much like in horrendous films like Grand Masti and Judwaa 2 and so on. This is the sexual and sexist tripe that male audiences watch and then emulate. The one thing you can be sure of, there was nothing to laugh at by the end of it. A pity, since the comedy acts were quite good. But when you have a lewd and sexist sideshow headlined by a superstar, it's hard to pay attention to the main act.

If you'd like a lesson in how not to behave with female colleagues, do watch The Great Indian Laughter Challenge on Saturday and Sunday at 8pm on Star India.

But $45 billion, as a former Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grantee put it, is ""a 1,000-pound gorilla.""
It also demonstrates that how Zuckerberg gives away his money will be just as important as what he gives it to.
Giving away a trickle of money each year is unlikely to live up to the verbs—transform, reimagine, revolutionize—the new philanthropists use to describe their goals.","For a long time, the way philanthropy worked was simple: Rich people gave their money to museums and churches and opera houses and Harvard. Their names went up on buildings, charities gave them made-up awards, their grandkids went to rehab, the Earth went around the sun. But philanthropy is changing. Today's billionaires are less interested in legacy institutions, less obsessed with prestige and perpetuity. Part of this is a function of their age: In 2012, 4 percent of America’s biggest charitable donations were made by people under 50 years old. In 2014, a quarter of them were. The other factor driving the new philanthropists is how they earned their money in the first place. Last year, six of the 10 largest charitable donations in the United States came from the tech sector, solidifying Silicon Valley’s place as the epicenter of the newer, bigger, disrupty-er philanthropy. There, tech billionaires form “giving circles” to share leads on promising charities, and they hire the same consultants to vet them. They use terms like “hacker philanthropy” and “effective altruism.” These guys—they are mostly guys—believe that they became successful businessmen by upending existing institutions, by scaling simple ideas, by ""breaking shit."" And, with few exceptions, that is how they plan to become successful philanthropists, too. All of this became much more relevant in December, when Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced that they were giving 99 percent of their wealth to charity. The total amount they pledged, around $45 billion in Facebook shares at current valuation, exceeds the endowments of the Rockefeller, Ford and Carnegie foundations combined. If Zuckerberg gives away the upper limit of what he announced in December, $1 billion per year for the next three years, he will likely become the world’s second-largest charitable donor after Bill Gates. He is 31 years old.

Rockefeller, generally considered the most generous industrialist in history, launched his foundation when he was 76, and only gave away around half his fortune. If he wanted to, Zuckerberg could eradicate polio, or de-neglect half a dozen tropical diseases, or fix all the water pipes in Flint, or give $9,000 to every single one of the world's refugees. But $45 billion, as a former Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grantee put it, is ""a 1,000-pound gorilla."" You don't give away that much money without changing the places and institutions and people you give it to, sometimes for the worse. Zuckerberg should already know this. In 2010, he donated $100 million to the Newark Public Schools on a promise from Cory Booker that he could, according to Dale Russakoff's The Prize, ""flip a whole city."" Zuckerberg rode into Newark with the suddenness of a software update. He was determined to end the stalemate between the teachers’ union and the district, establish dozens of new charter schools and close down failing public ones. Oh, and establish a model that could be replicated in urban school districts all over the country. All in just five years. Needless to say, it didn't happen. Up to $20 million of the donation went to consultants, scrappy little MBAs charging $1,000 a day to develop, among other things, an algorithm that assigned thousands of children to new schools. And nobody bothered to ask parents or teachers whether they wanted to be flipped, causing a ton of resentment that ultimately slowed everything down. By 2015, Zuckerberg was touting Newark's charter schools, with 14,000 students, as a success. Meanwhile, its public schools, with 35,000 students, were announcing a budget deficit of $65 million and layoffs of up to 30 percent of their staff. As Antony Bugg-Levine, the CEO of the Nonprofit Finance Fund, told me, the hard part about social change “is that it doesn’t scale like a social network.” I’ve spent the last few months talking to more than 40 researchers, development practitioners, foundation employees and other Silicon Valley philanthropists, asking them about the difficult business of giving money away. They told me about their own Newarks: Promising ideas scaled into oblivion, donations that disappeared into corrupt governments, groupthink disguised as insight. But they also told me about projects that worked, that scaled, that matched the ambitions of the new philanthropy while avoiding its blind spots. And it turns out that some of the best ideas are the ones Zuckerberg is the least likely to hear in Silicon Valley.

Don’t Be Seduced By Technology

Since December I've been studying Zuckerberg’s Facebook posts like a Talmudic scholar, looking for hints of what he's interested in, trying to figure out the investments and bets and mistakes he's going to make. So far he’s light on specifics, mostly speaking in gushy bromides about ""connecting people"" and ""building strong communities."" But if there is one clear, undeniable, overriding theme that emerges, it is this: Zuckerberg believes in the power of technology to transform the world. ""We must build technology to make change,"" he wrote last fall. ""Many institutions invest money in these challenges, but most progress comes from productivity gains through innovation."" He's not wrong. Nearly every social advance in history has technology somewhere near the center of it—the aqueduct, the steam train, the birth control pill. And whenever you start asking people about the life-altering potential of Mark Elliot Zuckerberg and the tech-based philanthropy he represents, the first words you're likely to hear are “The Green Revolution.” In 1975, nearly three out of five people in Asia lived on less than $1 a day. Rains at the wrong time of year meant the difference between starvation and survival. Then, researchers funded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations created new crops—varieties that grew taller, needed less water and could be planted year-round. Over the next 30 years, this innovation radically improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Rice yields spiked by 1,000 percent. Wheat got cheaper, healthier and more abundant. Norman Borlaug, the scientist who developed the new wheat varieties, won the Nobel Prize.

Before and After the Green Revolution Per-capita income in Southeast Asia: $351 $1,027 Cereal production in Southeast Asia: 33.8M metric tons 73.6M metric tons +193 +118 1970 Go to 1970 |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| 1995 Go to 1995

It's understandable to be seduced by this story. America spent more than 100 years going from a poor agrarian society to a rich urban one. Technology, the development agencies and the foundations tell you, has the potential to ""leapfrog"" this process for the next batch of countries, to boost poor communities into the middle class without all the messy slave labor and cholera we went through on the way. But as Kentaro Toyama, a former Gates Foundation consultant and the author of Geek Heresy: Rescuing Social Change from the Cult of Technology, points out, it’s not the development of technology that leads to social change, but the application of it. The Green Revolution, he says, wasn't just a case of ""new crops, big changes."" At the same time the farmers were planting the higher-yield crops, governments were dramatically reforming their agricultural policies. Between 1972 and 1990, Asian countries nearly tripled their investments in agriculture. They provided subsidized loans for farmers to buy fertilizer, trained them in how to plant the new crops and built roads and canals to get their produce to markets. In 1970, only 12 percent of the agricultural land in Bangladesh was irrigated. By 1995, 38 percent of it was. ""Technology,"" Toyama says, ""is the easiest part of any solution."" The hard part is everything that comes afterward. Take car crashes, which kill more people every year than tuberculosis or pulmonary disease. The technology to prevent these deaths—seat belts, motorcycle helmets—is not rocket science. It's just that no one has figured out how to make it appeal to the people who need it, especially in the developing world, where 90 percent of these deaths occur. Sometimes technological solutions aren't up against indifference, but outright resistance. In the ’80s, a global health NGO called PATH got a grant to develop Uniject, a pre-filled, single-use syringe designed for midwives or birth attendants to inject patients in their homes. The syringe was ready in the mid-1990s, but more than 15 years later, it had only been rolled out in one developing country. The others had laws that prohibited anyone but doctors from giving injections. ""Lots of new technologies require policy changes to be effective,"" says Michael Free, the former director of product development for PATH. ""Getting buy-in for that takes a lot longer."" All these snags, though, are too complicated for the clean ""leapfrogging"" narrative you hear from the techno-utopians—and from Zuckerberg himself. ""A few months ago I learned about a farmer in Maharashtra called Ganesh,"" Zuckerberg wrote in an op-ed in the Times of India in December. ""Last year Ganesh started using Free Basics [Facebook's no-cost Internet service for developing countries]. He found weather information to prepare for monsoon season. He looked up commodity prices to get better deals. Now Ganesh is investing in new crops and livestock."" This, too, is tempting to swallow whole. If farmers knew the prices they'd get for their produce, they could choose the market offering the highest price, or plant more profitable crops in the first place. Entire communities could be changed by the simple injection of information. The only published evidence of this effect in the real world, though, is a 2007 study that showed fishermen in Kerala, India, checking prices for their fish before deciding which port to sell them to. These fishermen sell a perishable good. They have to sell it to someone, they have to sell it today and it's the same distance back to the shore regardless of which port they pick. But the typical African or Indian farmer does not live perfectly equidistant from several produce markets. One might take an hour to get to, the other 10. And when farmers in developing countries buy seeds, they are not comparison-shopping between dozens of stores. They have just a few options, and often have to go through village middlemen or loan sharks. ""Even when you have the information,"" Toyama says, ""you're not in a situation where you can get any benefit from it."" Also, when “leapfrogging” happens, it can be less of a jump and more of a step. The Kerala study, which sounds so transformative, only boosted incomes for fishermen by around 8 percent, and reduced the price of fish for consumers by 4 percent. It didn’t turn poor fishermen into white-collar workers, and it didn’t give a broad swath of the population access to more nutritious food. And guess what? That's fine! If there's one piece of advice that emerges from the last 50 years of the tech-for-the-poor hope and disappointment cycle, it is this: Chase the 8 percents. Zuckerberg has interest and expertise in technology, and there's nothing inherently wrong with making bets on gadgets or innovations that have the potential to help the poor. But as he does so, he should acknowledge that the silver-bullet promise of technology only works at changing the world when it's combined with political will and popular demand. Until he finds a way to engineer those (please don't), he should focus on the small ways, at the margins, where technology can improve people's lives, 8 percent at a time.

$45 Billion Isn't That Much Money

In 2001, the Gates Foundation gave PATH and the World Health Organization $70 million, 10 years and a simple objective: Develop a vaccine for meningitis A and make it affordable for every single person who needs it. At the time, meningitis A was concentrated in one part of the world, a stripe across the middle of sub-Saharan Africa known as the ""meningitis belt."" The disease mostly affected children, causing them to die or become paralyzed in minutes. The yearly outbreaks were predictable. Where they would happen, and how severely, were not. Eventually, PATH developed a vaccine that gave patients 15 years of immunity. At a cost of around 50 cents a dose, public health departments in every country in the meningitis belt could afford to procure it at scale. By 2013, less than a decade after an outbreak killed 25,000 people, the meningitis belt had just four reported cases. Marc LaForce headed the team in charge of bringing the vaccine to market. He says it wasn't just the scale of the Gates donation that mattered, but its duration. In those days, most grants were capped at two or three years, with check-ins every six months. Years of work could be wiped away if a donor decided progress was moving too slowly and pulled out. ""If you want to do something major,"" LaForce says, ""you need the ability to go two steps forward, then one step back."" Plus, the Gates team left LaForce alone. Back then, the foundation only employed about a dozen people who worked out of a small office in a residential neighborhood of Seattle. Staffers spent their time making lists of diseases, ranking them by annual fatalities, then calling around to find out which ones were closest to being cured. “We didn’t need to be specialists,” says Gordon Perkin, the foundation’s first director of global health. “We just needed to know which organizations had the judgment and the infrastructure, and we gave them money.” This story doesn't just illustrate the potential of philanthropy. It also demonstrates that how Zuckerberg gives away his money will be just as important as what he gives it to. Because one way to look at his $45 billion is that it's a lot of money. Another way to look at it is that it's about what the United States spends on prisons every six months. Or education every four weeks. Or health care every five days. Even at a scale that large, efficiency matters. It’s shocking just how unusual that early Gates grant was. Most legacy foundations pay consultants millions of dollars to study and re-study problems before they give grants toward solving them. The Ford Foundation spends nearly $1 for every $4 it gives away. In 2013, the Rockefeller Foundation’s largest grant recipient (other than its offshoot, Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors), was Dalberg Global Development Advisors, a consulting firm. “All the work was to provide advice on internal decision-making,” a former Rockefeller employee told me. “To make it seem charitable we'd ask them to write a blog on our website, and that would frequently be the only public or charitable thing to come out of these multimillion-dollar so-called grants.” (In a statement, the Rockefeller Foundation defended its approach, saying that it “has developed a rigorous model on how to determine the problems we support, and ultimately the solutions that we believe will create the most impact.”)

Won't Somebody Please Think of the Consultants? $146.4M What the Ford Foundation spent in 2013 deciding how to give its money away $539.1M What the Ford Foundation gave away

The Gates Foundation, as it's expanded to more than 1,300 employees, has become prone to the same bloat, the same ""expert-itis,"" as a former grantee calls it. ""They hired Ph.D.s in biotech and all they wanted to do was the science that the grantees were doing."" As the staff proliferated, so did the conditions on the donations. The foundation started requiring grantees to keep track of baggage fees and told them they couldn't buy laptops or let their overhead go above 15 percent. ""Grant approval processes went from 48 hours to 48 months,"" the former grantee told me. (The Gates Foundation responded, too: “While each grant agreement is unique, we have policies in place to help ensure that our funds are spent as effectively as possible."") It’s hard to overstate just how un-Silicon Valley all of this is. ""Money is sitting there to make the world a better place, and to dole it out cautiously is antithetical to why it’s there,"" says Freada Kapor Klein, a partner at the Kapor Center for Social Impact, a foundation set up by Mitch Kapor, an early investor in Uber and other unicorns. I heard similar arguments from almost all the tech people I talked to: Zuckerberg shouldn't be afraid to fail; he should approach philanthropy like a venture capitalist, testing out ideas to scale up later on. Bypassing legacy institutions is what Silicon Valley CEOs are good at, right? All those consultants must strike them as the charity equivalent of taxi medallions. Still, running a charity does require fully understanding problems before you try to solve them. ""Move fast and break things"" is a fine mentality for Facebook, where the consequences of a few bad lines of code are mostly limited to a drop in revenue or an exodus of users to Snapchat. Applying the same philosophy to health or education or criminal justice has consequences that can't be shrugged away. In the 1990s, Western donors' emphasis on HIV/AIDS in Africa resulted in chronic under-funding of less-visible conditions like pneumonia, anemia and diarrhea. Zuckerberg's donation in Newark resulted in public schools being closed and some kids having to walk through rough neighborhoods to charter schools far from their homes. And it’s this neglected zone, somewhere between bloat and ""break things,"" where Zuckerberg has the opportunity to do something quietly, unsexily awesome. The U.S. has more than 85,000 foundations and 1.5 million charities. Most major charitable causes, things like curing cancer, regularizing immigration and providing early education, are already covered by dozens of capable—and overlapping—organizations. In its annual survey of philanthropists, Grantmakers for Effective Organizations reported that 80 percent of donors wanted to see more collaboration between their grantees. But only 13 percent were willing to consistently pay for it. The need for coordination is obvious when you look at the scale of the problems that philanthropists want to solve. Again, studying Gates’ early years is instructive. When he decided he wanted to vaccinate hundreds of millions of African kids, he didn't set up an organization that would replace WHO or UNICEF or all the other agencies already handing out vaccines. Instead, he founded something called Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance—a funding pipeline designed to help those agencies work more effectively. Gavi pays pharmaceutical companies to research tropical diseases, it issues ""vaccine bonds"" so poor countries can buy millions of treatments on layaway, it orders medications in such bulk that the cost comes down to pennies. In short, it connects a network of actors who have similar interests—something Zuckerberg knows a thing or two about. So if he really wants to leverage the limited funding he has, Zuckerberg shouldn't think of himself as a venture capitalist. He should think of himself as a mutual fund manager. Find promising organizations, perform due diligence, link them to a portfolio of other agencies doing good work—then give them money and get out of their way. Or, as Patricia Stonesifer, the current CEO of Martha's Table and the former CEO of the Gates Foundation, puts it, “Don’t expect to be the only solution out there.”

Capitalism: The Cause of, and Solution to, All of Life’s Problems

What Zuckerberg actually announced last December wasn't a big fat donation to charity. All he did was establish a limited liability company (LLC) and issue a promise that he would use it for good. Much of the reaction at the time was suspicious, speculating that an LLC was a scheme for Zuckerberg to avoid taxes (which isn't true) or that it would allow him to spend mountains of money without disclosing how he was doing so (which is). But the corporate approach actually makes a lot of sense. Under the standard philanthropic model, billionaires set up a foundation and give it a huge endowment. Every year, the foundation has to give away at least 5 percent of its total value. Meanwhile, the other 95 percent gets invested in blue chip stocks, hedge funds, foreign currencies, whatever will keep the total endowment the same size. That's how foundations like Rockefeller and Ford exist in perpetuity: Do-gooders work on one side of the building finding things to donate to, while bankers work on the other side, making sure there's more to donate next year. Recently, though, donors have started to reject this model. Giving away a trickle of money each year is unlikely to live up to the verbs—transform, reimagine, revolutionize—the new philanthropists use to describe their goals. Besides, why should 95 percent of your money just sit there in hedge funds and Halliburton stock, especially if you think you can do just as much good with the money you invest as the money you give away? ""This idea that philanthropy is only about nonprofits is an outdated model,"" says Paula Goldman, a vice president at the Omidyar Network. Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, was one of the most prominent tech billionaires to merge his investing and grant-making. The foundation still gives donations, but the LLC provides loans and seed capital and invests in things like solar-powered lighting startups, Brazilian test-prep companies and funds that discover Indian entrepreneurs. Zuckerberg is going even further, giving up on a foundation entirely and putting all of his charity money in a corporate form with no limits on how to spend it. He’s not interested in making his money back. He just wants the flexibility to fund charities or companies or both. Which explains why one of Zuckerberg’s most recent donations wasn’t a donation at all. It was $10 million in seed capital for an education startup called Bridge International Academies, a chain of private elementary schools that wants to deliver education to the world's poorest students. Bridge’s model, which has only been rolled out in Kenya so far, is based on standardization and accountability. Teachers get a centralized curriculum from Bridge experts, then deliver it to kids from an e-reader. Students—and teachers—are tracked in real time, principals notified of everything from attendance rates to busted pipes. The latest class of Bridge students just took their exams. Sixty percent passed, compared to the national average of 49 percent

It's tempting to say capitalism perverts philanthropy, full stop, and advise Zuckerberg to go back and form a foundation. But that's not right either.

The primary appeal of Bridge, especially to investors like Zuckerberg, is the $6 per month it says it charges its students. Operating as a business rather than a charity gives each school an incentive to deliver a decent education and ensures that it’s not going to wither away when development agencies or donors move on to the next idea. But the problem with dispatching private companies to supply basic services is that they replace the public systems already tasked with providing them. Last year, 116 African NGOs signed an open letter to Bridge International Academies and the World Bank, pointing out that $6 per month is in fact a lot of money for a lot of Kenyans. Bridge schools charge extra for uniforms and lunch. Its teachers earn around $90 per month, teaching classes as large as 70 students. Those pass rates 11 percent higher than the national average are great, but the letter also noted that Bridge, with 400 schools, has attracted more than $100 million in international investment. Meanwhile, Kenya's public system, with almost 20,000 schools, has gotten just $88 million. Lucy Bradlow, Bridge's global director of public relations, counters that the majority of Kenyan kids already attend private schools, many of which cost even more than Bridge and provide even less. In public schools, teacher absentee rates are so high that the average kid only gets two hours of instruction per day. She’s right: Bridge is a little bit better than what's already there. But the troubling part about the company isn't the service it provides now, but the one it wants to provide later. Bridge sees itself as a “model,” one that its backers believe can be spread across the entire developing world. It plans to be profitable once it serves 500,000 students. Eventually, it hopes to reach 10 million. Bridge's own marketing materials describe it as “a scalable Academy-in-a-Box solution.” But the history of philanthropy is littered with projects that helped the poor at a small scale, then made them worse off at a larger one. Microfinance started out small, too. The early trials were non-profit, and revenues were invested back into services that would help borrowers pay back their loans. Then, in the late 2000s, responding to donor pressure to be “sustainable,” microlending went private. Citibank, Barclays and Deutsche Bank established microfinance divisions. In 2007, one of the largest microlending banks, Mexico’s Compartamos Banco, even had an IPO, its executives earning millions loaning out money to women and poor farmers and charging interest rates as high as 195 percent. Since most loans were capped at a few hundred dollars, borrowers could only get enough money to set up informal businesses, stuff like selling fruit on the side of the road or giving rides on a scooter. As microloans flooded the market, small-scale services flooded entire economies. In Bangladesh, nearly 25 percent of the population took out a microloan. In Mexico, Compartamos’ customers were taking out new microloans to pay back the ones they already had. By scaling up too fast, microfinance ended up trapping people in the exact cycle—informal work, bottomless debt, low productivity—from which it was designed to free them.

How Microfinance Traps the Poor *As illustrated by someone we’ll call Joey Joey lives in a village. He earns $5 a day working on a farm. He doesn't want to do that anymore. One day, he takes out a microloan for $100. He opens a fruit stand that sells apples for 50 cents each. He sells around 20 a day, so now he’s earning $10. Success! But then the bank starts giving loans to lots of other people in the village, too. Suddenly everyone is selling apples, and Joey has to sell his for 25 cents each to compete. Now, he’s earning $5 a day again. And starting tomorrow, he owes the bank $10 every week to pay off his loan.

It's tempting to stop there, to say capitalism perverts philanthropy, full stop, and advise Zuckerberg to just go back and form a foundation. But that's not right either. One of the most successful private-sector development projects of the last 10 years is M-PESA, the mobile-money system that allows people in Kenya to transfer money via their cell phones. Before the system launched, Kenyans sent money to each other by mail, or by giving envelopes full of cash to bus drivers. Replacing an inefficient, expensive system with a regularized one made everybody better off. That's not as easy to argue, in the long run, about education. So, when Zuckerberg hears pitches from companies seeking to solve the world's problems, he shouldn't ask them if they have a plan to grow, or an ambition to exist in perpetuity. He should ask himself whether he really wants them to replace the systems that already exist, or simply make them better. Because successful companies don't just disrupt other companies—they disrupt economies, governments and the people who depend on them. That's not something that Zuckerberg ever had to worry about, but he has to start.

Go Beyond Giving Directly

In 2009, four grad students came up with an audacious idea: Instead of giving poor people the things we think they need—bags of food, stacks of clothing, a pair of goats—what if we gave them enough money to decide for themselves? They called their charity GiveDirectly, and in 2011 they started doing exactly that. They went to villages in Kenya, found the poorest people living there and transferred $1,000 straight to their cell phones. Later, they came back to ask the villagers what they did with the money. Mostly, it turns out, the villagers spent it on better roofs, better food, paying off debts, starting up businesses. All the stuff the development system used to buy for them—but without any overhead. At first, no one wanted to fund an idea this outlandish. But then, GiveDirectly went to Silicon Valley. Google got in early, awarding the charity its Global Impact Award and dispatching the head of Google.org to sit on GiveDirectly’s board. Since then, GiveDirectly has grown like a Y Combinator startup, its budget ballooning from $700,000 in 2012 to $17.4 million in 2014. In 2013, Chris Hughes, Zuckerberg’s Harvard roommate and Facebook co-founder, hosted a coming-out party for the charity with the heads of Dropbox and General Catalyst Partners. Dustin Moskovitz, Zuckerberg's other Harvard roommate and Facebook co-founder, just handed GiveDirectly $25 million. At five years old, GiveDirectly is the most buzzed-about charity in Silicon Valley. What all this hype ignores, though, is that GiveDirectly's audacious idea has been around for decades. Post-disaster charities have been experimenting with cash transfers since the 1990s. In 2010, when floods deluged one-third of Pakistan, aid workers handed out 1.7 million debit cards pre-loaded with $230. As early as the 1980s, Latin American countries were handing out ""conditional"" cash grants, paying parents to send their kids to school or feed them balanced meals. Even the World Bank, not exactly a laboratory of revolutionary thinking, has poured more than $25 billion into ""social safety nets""—unemployment and pension benefits, basically—in developing countries. ""Welfare"" sounds a lot less “break shit” than transferring money to people via their cell phones, but it is, sorry everybody, the same thing. And that's exactly why Zuckerberg should be excited about giving money directly to poor people: Not because it is a new and revolutionary idea, but because it is an old and effective one—that’s only fulfilling a fraction of its potential. The challenge with direct cash payments, says Owen Barder, the director of Europe for the Center for Global Development, is getting them to all of the people who need them. The places where this strategy has worked well already had functioning banking sectors and national identification systems in place before a disaster struck. In Pakistan, humanitarian agencies used government data to identify the areas with the worst damage, then checked IDs to make sure the debit cards got to the people living there. Most poor countries, though, don't have these pipes laid down. Kenya's Hunger Safety Nets program, which gives cash to people at risk of starvation, took months to establish because payouts were distributed through local agents, whom people didn't trust, or ATMs, which people had never used before. Barder describes a scenario where, 10 minutes after an earthquake hits Nepal, all the people within five miles of the epicenter get $500 on their cell phones. That's a great idea. But it is, he says, a lot harder than it sounds. After the 2005 tsunami, low-caste populations in India were almost entirely excluded from cash transfers because they weren't registered in the national welfare system. In Indonesia, cash transfers were distributed through community leaders who had to come to a central planning center, then travel back to their constituencies with an envelope full of cash. In at least one case, bandits were waiting for them on the bus. The need for modernizing these systems is obvious. In 2009, India launched an ambitious—and largely unheralded—project to issue a 12-digit identification number to all 1.3 billion of its citizens. So far, it has spent around $880 million and registered 970 million people. The numbers are already being used to distribute unemployment checks and disaster relief. But as this effort moves to more remote populations, registering them gets harder. Some farmers have hands so worn the scanners can’t read their fingerprints. Laying down the pipes to get cash transfers to the first 75 percent of a population, the people who have birth certificates and cell phones, is relatively easy. Getting to the last 25 percent, the people one charity could never reach, is technical, slow, expensive and absolutely critical—a perfect project for Zuckerberg.

""Les personnes qui ont confiance en elles savent apprécier les occasions qui s'offrent en permanence à chacun de nous.
Mieux vaut se concentrer sur les aspects positifs, chez soi comme chez les autres.
Cet article, publié à l'origine sur Le HuffPost américain, a été traduit par Lise Garond pour Fast for Word.","PSYCHOLOGIE - Alors qu'elle atteint la cinquantaine, Nathalie, professeure de lettres en khâgnes, devient brusquement jalouse de tous ceux qui l'entourent: ses collègues, ses amis... et surtout sa fille.

À partir de ce scénario, les frères David et Stéphane Foenkinous déroulent les fils de leur comédie grinçante, ""Jalouse"", qui sort dans les salles obscures ce mercredi 8 novembre.

Les petites pointes d'envie ne sont probablement pas très grave mais la jalousie excessive peut avoir de sérieuses conséquences. Sur les autres, comme l'illustre cette comédie, mais aussi sur nous, et sur notre santé. La jalousie augmenterait le taux d'hormones responsables du stress, et favoriserait même l'Alzheimer chez les femmes.

Interrogé par Le Huffington Post US, Scott Bea, psychologue à la clinique Cleveland, explique: ""Quand on a confiance en soi, on n'envie généralement pas les autres. Les jaloux ont tendance à ruminer et à vouloir tout contrôler.""

Certaines techniques peuvent être utiles pour se débarrasser de ce monstre vert qui nous empoisonne l'existence. Vous trouverez ci-dessous une liste de neuf choses que les personnes bien dans leur peau ont mises en œuvre, et des solutions toutes simples pour faire taire la jalousie.

S'entourer de gens de confiance

Cela peut sembler évident, mais c'est un point essentiel : nous sommes directement influencés par notre environnement, et notamment par les gens qui nous entourent, souligne le Dr. Bea. Etre en bonne compagnie influe sur nos émotions.

Mais il est tout aussi important d'être là pour les autres. Par exemple en se montrant bienveillant(e) vis-à-vis de nos amis, ou de notre moitié, quand ils souhaitent passer du temps avec d'autres amis. ""En adoptant régulièrement ce genre d'attitude, on développe un sentiment de confiance en soi"", ajoute-t-il.

Avoir une bonne opinion de soi

Ce qui caractérise avant tout la confiance en soi, c'est le fait de s'aimer tel que l'on est, note le Dr. Bea. Quand on est bien dans sa peau et que l'on a une bonne opinion de soi, on n'envie pas la vie des autres.

D'après une étude menée en 2005 auprès de 500 jeunes, c'est particulièrement vrai à l'adolescence. Les chercheurs ont constaté que les adolescents qui n'avaient pas confiance en eux se disaient assez jaloux, surtout dans leurs amitiés.

Se réjouir de la réussite des autres

Qu'il s'agisse de la promotion d'un collègue ou des fiançailles de votre meilleure amie, il est important de ne pas oublier que leur histoire n'est pas la vôtre. ""La réussite d'un autre ne signifie pas que vous avez échoué"", souligne Richard Smith, professeur de psychologie à l'Université du Kentucky, et spécialiste de la dimension sociale des émotions.

Ce sentiment de frustration n'a pas de prise sur les gens qui ont une bonne image d'eux-mêmes parce qu'ils choisissent de ne s'attacher qu'aux aspects positifs, précise le Dr. Bea: ""Ils veulent que les autres soient heureux, qu'ils réussissent dans la vie. Quand on se concentre sur sa propre vie, au lieu d'envier celle des autres, ça fait toute la différence.""

Savoir apprécier ce qui nous arrive

""Si on est capable d'apprécier ce que l'on a, on cherchera moins à regarder dans l'assiette du voisin, et on aura moins tendance à être en proie à la jalousie"", explique M. Smith.

Tenir un journal où l'on note tout ce que l'apprécie dans sa vie peut être une bonne manière de se recentrer sur les bons moments. Le Dr. Bea recommande de consigner les événements positifs de chaque journée, et de décrire la manière dont ils sont survenus, ce qui permet de voir à quel point notre comportement et nos actions y sont pour quelque chose. ""Les personnes qui ont confiance en elles savent apprécier les occasions qui s'offrent en permanence à chacun de nous. L'idée est de se concentrer sur sa propre réussite, plutôt que d'envier celle des autres"", ajoute-t-il.

Savoir décrocher

Ce n'est un secret pour personne : les médias sociaux servent en grande partie à se faire valoir. On y met les meilleures photos de nous, et des endroits les plus en vue, et lorsqu'on met à jour notre profil, c'est plutôt pour faire part d'événements heureux et importants dans notre vie. Or des études montrent que la publication incessante de ce genre de nouvelles peut avoir un effet écrasant sur ceux qui les lisent. Certains chercheurs pensent que l'utilisation fréquente des médias sociaux peut provoquer des émotions négatives, telles que la solitude et – surprise ! – la jalousie. Prendre un peu de distance avec son écran est peut-être l'une des solutions les plus efficaces pour retrouver confiance en soi.

Ne pas être à l'affût du regard des autres

Dans son livre Embracing Envy: Finding the Spiritual Treasure in Our Most Shameful Emotion, Josh Gressel se penche sur notre désir de susciter l'envie. Le désir qu'on lit chez l'autre nous procure un sentiment d'autosatisfaction. Mais ce comportement est le signe d'un manque de confiance en soi, comme le souligne l'auteur. Sans compter que la satisfaction est de courte durée...

""Chercher à susciter la jalousie, c'est se retrouve piégé dans le mécanisme de toutes les addictions: on cherche chez l'autre ce qui, en fin de compte, ne peut venir que de soi"", écrit-il. Ceux qui parviennent à contrôler leur jalousie finissent par s'en rendre compte et n'ont plus besoin d'être enviés.

Ne pas accorder d'importance aux signes de réussite

C'est valable pour la manière dont nous nous présentons, comme pour la manière dont nous percevons les autres, explique le Dr. Bea : ""Personnellement, je me suis débarrassé des pièges de la réussite et du statut. L'ambition révèle parfois une certaine insécurité. La modestie peut aussi être un signe de confiance en soi.""

En résumé : on ne se réduit pas aux titres ou aux récompenses qu'on a pu décrocher.

Ne pas se comparer aux autres

Comme l'a dit un jour Théodore Roosevelt, ""la comparaison est une voleuse de joie"". En jaugeant sans cesse sa vie à l'aune de celle des autres, on finit toujours par trouver la petite bête. Mieux vaut se concentrer sur les aspects positifs, chez soi comme chez les autres.

""L'herbe est toujours plus verte ailleurs"", explique M. Smith. ""La jalousie relève vraiment de la perception. Les éternels insatisfaits se laissent piéger par la comparaison.""

The so-called Paradise Papers may sound familiar -- leaked documents from a law firm that specialises in offshore services reveal how the global elite avoids paying taxes. Even the name has the same ring to it as last year's Panama Papers expose. But the Paradise Papers are different, reflecting the complexity of the global offshore tax system.

Panama is generally considered among tax-haven experts as one of the least reformed corners of the offshore world. International rules regarding tax evasion and avoidance are intended to help national governments to pursue their own offenders, but the Panama Papers revealed that the country was being used primarily by the business and political elites of countries like Russia, China and many more in Latin America and Asia; countries where the governments are closely linked to business and which are less likely to use tools provided by new international rules to pursue offenders. Hence, relatively few Americans or Europeans were caught in the Panama story. And Mossack Fonseca, the law firm at the centre of the leak has since been discredited.

The Paradise Papers reveal the goings on of the elites of the offshore world -- this time in the supposedly highly-regulated havens of the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Singapore and the like. All places that received a fairly clean bill of health during the OECD peer-review process only a few years ago. The law firm at the centre of this new leak, Appleby, insists there is ""no evidence of wrongdoing"" in any of the revelations.

Nonetheless, the Paradise Papers will tell us a lot about the activities of business and political elites of well-regulated countries like the U.S. and UK -- implicating big multinationals such as Nike and Apple, and individuals including the British Queen.

1. Tax avoidance is a booming industry.

Clearly, jurisdictions such as the Caymans Islands and Bermuda that levy no income tax, capital gains tax, VAT, sales, wealth or corporate tax, still attract a great deal of businesses. Why, for instance, has the Duchy of Lancaster, the Queen's private portfolio, invested in two offshore funds, in Cayman and Bermuda? After all, the Queen pays tax only voluntarily.

A more charitable interpretation is that any big investor who is seeking to diversify their portfolio would inevitably end up using offshore funds. The papers show that about £10m (U.S. $13m) of the Queen's private money was invested offshore -- a very small percentage of her wealth. There is nothing illegal about this but the ethics of it have been questioned.

Practically, the entire wealth investment industry -- the industry that invests for the rich and the wealthy of our world -- operates through the offshore world. And the reason why is simple. Each fund or transaction, or aeroplane or yacht, or whatever that one cares to register in the Caymans or Bermuda, is not subject to tax. And it's hidden from public view.

2. Secrecy prevails through trusts.

Despite a spate of new regulations, the Paradise Papers show that anyone who wishes to conceal their affairs from competitors, allies, governments or the public can still do so with great ease. And they can do so through the facilities of a ""trust"", an archaic Anglo-Saxon instrument that serves as a foolproof shield from scrutiny.

We have learned, for instance, that Wilbur Ross, the U.S. secretary of commerce, had commercial links to Vladimir Putin's family, which operated through a system of linked trusts located in various offshore jurisdictions. I do not think that even the Mueller inquiry in the U.S. into the Trump administration's links with Russia could have pierced the veil of secrecy offered by offshore trusts.

But the leaked documents from law firm Appleby reveal that any complex business deals that would involve concealment and subterfuge would work their way through trusts. It is high time we do something about these trusts.

3. Highly complex tools are used.

The Paradise Papers show how complex financial innovations such as the use of derivatives and financial swaps arrangements, can be used for tax avoidance. This is an area of avoidance that is normally not well understood and scantily studied.

New research colleagues and I are conducting, however, has found that cross-currency interest rate swaps are used pervasively in tax minimisation mechanisms. It is difficult to detect and involves a parent and subsidiary companies swapping a loan in one currency to another. This swaps the risks and the interest rate of the original currency for the subsidiary's -- a legitimate risk minimisation instrument. At the same time, this facilitates moving funds offshore to low tax jurisdictions.

4. The law needs to change.

Many professional service firms operate through offshore jurisdictions. They all claim to be highly professional, following not only the letter, but also the spirit of the law.

But if these firms are not directly liable for the activities of their clients, the offshore world will continue to thrive. These firms take advantage of regulatory loopholes to arbitrate between different rules and jurisdictions in order to minimise taxation. The question is for how long such practices are going to be considered legitimate.

The Paradise Papers reveal how little the world really knows about the level of tax avoidance that takes place. UK citizens, for instance, can legally invest in offshore funds and set up companies in those havens. But they must reveal these holdings to the tax man. We do not know whether those named in the papers did, and we do not know whether the tax authorities will do something about those who did not. We only know that a lot is going through offshore. The Paradise Papers show that, despite promises of the opposite, opacity is still pervasive in the offshore world.

Dabei hatten sie zunächst abgelehnt, in das dänische Startup einzusteigen

Der junge Gründer Thomas stimmte die Löwen um

""Too Good to Go"" heißt ihre App. Was sie bietet: Kostengünstiges Essen aus Restaurants, Supermärkten und Hotels – und die Möglichkeit, Lebensmittelverschwendung zu bekämpfen. Es war der größte Deal, den die TV-Show ""Die Höhle der Löwen“ bislang gesehen hat.

Eine Millionen Euro bekamen die fünf Gründer der App von den Löwen geboten. Dabei hatte es am Anfang schlecht ausgesehen für die""Too Good to Go""-Jungs.

► Doch noch einmal von vorne: Die Dänen Peter Wiedeking, Julian Stützer, Thomas Björn Momsen, Klaus Pedersen und Stian Olesen präsentierten in der Vox-Show ""Die Höhle der Löwen"" ihre Smartphone-App, über die Gastronomen Essen, das droht, in die Tonne zu wandern, günstiger an Kunden verkaufen können.

Die App zeigt den Usern an, wo sie die Gerichte zu einem reduzierten Preis bekommen und zu welchem Zeitpunkt sie diese abholen können. Dann können sie per Klick zuschlagen. ""60- bis 70-Prozent reduziert"", wie die Gründer erklären.

Für fünf Prozent ihres Unternehmens wollten die Dänen 1 Million Euro. Auf rund 19 Millionen Euro bezifferten sie ihren Firmen-Wert. Den Löwen war das zu viel – auch wenn alle von der Idee der App begeistert waren. ""Eins Plus mit Sternchen“, schwärmte Löwe Carsten Maschmeyer gar.

Das Unternehmen wächst, doch es braucht Überzeugung

Trotz guten Wachstumsaussichten, die die Gründer vorrechneten, stiegen alle fünf Investoren nacheinander aus.

Dann ergriff Gründer Thomas noch einmal das Wort – und plötzlich kam alles anders. Der 24-Jährige appellierte an die Investoren, mit ihnen ""etwas Cooles"" auf die Beine zu stellen. Es gehe nicht nur um Geld. ""Man kann Teil von etwas Größerem sein."" Im Verbund: Alle fünf Löwen sollten zusammen die Millionen locker machen.

Nach einer kurzen Beratung, für die sich alle zurückzogen, kam der Deal dann tatsächlich zustande. 200.000 Euro pro Kopf gegen 1,8 Prozent des Unternehmens für jeden, also etwas unter 10 Prozent der Anteile.

So einen Mega-Deal hatte es in der Vox-Show noch nie gegeben. Maschmeyer erklärte zurecht feierlich: ""Wir haben heute Löwen-Geschichte geschrieben.""

Update: Nachdem die Kameras aus waren, soll der Deal doch wieder geplatzt sein. Der Grund: Die dänischen Unternehmer überlegten es sich offenbar anders. Nicht nur traten mehrere der fünf Gründer, die in der Fernsehshow zu sehen waren, plötzlich aus dem operativen Geschäft zurück, auch die Zusammenarbeit mit den Investoren wurde eingestellt.

""I said: 'Comrades, Jacob Zuma is not a working class hero, Jacob Zuma does not have revolutionary morality, Jacob Zuma is backward, ethnic and tribal'.
""The impatience with the media started growing, a move to curtail the media started growing.""","Former intelligence minister Ronnie Kasrils says he asked former president Thabo Mbeki to contest for the role of ANC president in the lead up to the party's Polokwane conference in an attempt to stop President Jacob Zuma from taking over the position.

He made the comments last night at metalworkers' union Numsa's Vincent Mabuyakhulu conference centre during the launch of his book, A Simple Man – which focused on his relationship with Zuma during the 80s while in exile.

""It's not that I went out [to] proclaim Mbeki a savior, but it was certainly to oppose Zuma,"" Kasrils told the audience.

He said there was nothing wrong with asking Mbeki to run for a third term in the party as nothing in the ANC's constitution barred him from such, while he could only serve as leader of the country for two terms.

He explained the reason behind his decision to write a book about Zuma and said that he had tried to warn South Africa's first democratic president Nelson Mandela about the leader after noticing several worrying traits.

""I was still feeling worried about this guy and [had] seen other faults in Zuma in exile and I warned Madiba about this.

""Those faults are quite a range in terms of the tribal aspect, the conservatism which he tries to hide when it comes out, in terms of attitudes on gender, women, homosexuality and tremendous social backwardness, [and] secret in terms of he was always setting up secret structures,"" said Kasrils.

The former Umkhonto weSizwe leader also tried to warn his comrades about Zuma in the lead up to the Polokwane conference, in the hope of turning them against supporting the current president's bid to become leader of the liberation movement.

""I challenged, before the rape charge which came in 2005, after Mbeki dismissed Zuma for the corruption issue related to Schabir Shaik's corruption charges, as I could see Cosatu and the party [SACP] were getting behind Zuma,"" recalled Kasrils.

""I said: 'Comrades, Jacob Zuma is not a working class hero, Jacob Zuma does not have revolutionary morality, Jacob Zuma is backward, ethnic and tribal'. I explained it all on the basis [of experience] from exile and from what we started seeing of his behaviour in South Africa.""

But Kasrils said his warnings fell on deaf ears as his comrades ""despised"" Mbeki.

""In the end Blade (Nzimande) said to me: 'Comrade Khumalo (Kasrils' MK name) we hear what you say but we see in Zuma the best opening for the left, for the party, for socialism in our country'.

""Then I said to him: 'Comrade Blade, you are making a major mistake, you are going to live to regret it',"" said the former minister.

Nzimande, the general secretary of the SACP, was sacked as higher education minister by Zuma in October's Cabinet reshuffle.

Kasrils, in responding to a question from the floor, said the media in the country was accused of furthering a foreign agenda not only by Zuma, but those around him.

""In terms of where we are as a country, it's been creeping up on us. Whatever we think of the Mbeki period there were no threats at that point, and up to that point, against the media... though Mbeki at times made it clear that he was not too excited about the critique,"" remarked Kasrils.

He said this has been increasing under Zuma's administration.

""The impatience with the media started growing, a move to curtail the media started growing.""

He said it's been a process and a struggle as some turned on the media.

""At every point, intelligence ministers [and] security ministers immediately defend themselves on the basis of [claims that] the media is following a foreign agenda and are representatives of [an] international, Western chapters cause,"" he said.

Kasrils also said that often the criticism of media was done in a way of seeking sympathy from the working class in the country. He warned that they should be careful of this trend.

He also reminded the crowd of Nzimande's comments – when he had a close relationship with Zuma – seeking to have a media tribunal established and punish anyone who criticised the president.

Kasrils however praised journalists who continued to do their job under the current conditions.

""I believe sections of the media are really standing up in a correct and defiant manner and a very helpful manner to expose the misdeeds of government,"" said Kasrils.

He also praised SACP first deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila who recently stood up for The President's Keepers author Jacques Pauw, who has been receiving death threats and was slapped with a cease and desist letter over the book by the state security department.",Kasrils Asked Mbeki To Stand For A Third Term To Stop Zuma,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/11/08/kasrils-asked-mbeki-to-stand-for-a-third-term-to-stop-zuma_a_23270259/

Kouzoukas will die Krankheit mit ihren Bildern bekannter machen - und anderen betroffenen Frauen Mut machen

Endometriose ist eine weit verbreitete Frauenkrankheit, die oft erst nach langer Leidenszeit diagnostiziert wird

Eigentlich wollte die junge Amerikanerin Thessy Kouzoukas die intimen Bilder von sich nicht veröffentlichen. Aber es war ihr wichtig, anderen Frauen zu zeigen, dass sie mit ihren Schmerzen nicht alleine sind. Das war im Juli. Aber die Bilder haben nichts an ihrer Bedeutung verloren.

Denn: Kouzoukas leidet an Endometriose, einer Frauenkrankheit, bei der sich ein gutartiges Gewebe im Unterleib wie zum Beispiel in den Eierstöcken oder der Blase ansiedelt.

Diese Gewebeherde rufen Entzündungsreaktionen hervor, außerdem können sich Zysten und Verwachsungen bilden. Die betroffenen Frauen leiden während der Regel unter heftigen Schmerzen und können unfruchtbar werden.

Endometriose bleibt oft unerkannt – während die Betroffenen unter heftigen Schmerzen leiden

Das Problem ist jedoch, dass die Krankheit oft unerkannt bleibt. Dabei ist Endometriose eines der häufigsten gynäkologischen Leiden weltweit. Kouzoukas wendet sich deshalb mit drastischen Bildern und Worten an die Instagram-User.

Sie schreibt:

""Für die meisten Leute ist das schockierend. Das bin ich. Das ist Endometriose. Ich hatte nie vor, das zu veröffentlichen, ich bin darauf ja nackt zu sehen – aber ich kann einfach nicht glauben, wie viele Mädchen mir private Nachrichten geschickt haben, weil sie auch an Endometriose leiden und sich allein gelassen fühlen. Auf dem linken Bild ist mein Bauch zu sehen, drei Wochen, nachdem eine Zyste geplatzt ist (das war vor fünf Wochen). Auf dem rechten Bild könnt ihr sehen, wie ich jetzt aussehe. Ich nehme gerade ein Medikament namens Synarel. Es hemmt meine Hormonproduktion und schickt mich im Alter von 27 Jahren in die Wechseljahre. Aber dieses Medikament und meine baldige Reise nach Griechenland sollen mich körperlich und psychisch auf eine Operation vorbereiten, die Ende August stattfinden wird. Endometriose ist kein Witz. Ich werde wahrscheinlich länger als sieben Stunden operiert und eine Woche im Krankenhaus bleiben müssen. Bitte, macht diese Krankheit bekannt. Und wenn ihr eine Frau kennt, die unter heftigen Regelschmerzen leidet, dann sagt ihr bitte, dass sie sich untersuchen lassen soll. Und ich will allen Frauen und Mädchen, die daran leiden, sagen: Ihr seid nicht allein.""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Diese Frauenkrankheit hat schreckliche Folgen - und sie wird oft viel zu spät diagnostiziert

In Deutschland sind zwei bis sechs Millionen Frauen betroffen

Auch in Deutschland wird Endometriose oft erst spät diagnostiziert – teilweise erst zehn Jahre nach dem Auftreten der ersten Symptome. Schätzungen zufolge leiden etwa sieben bis 15 Prozent aller Frauen im geschlechtsreifen Alter unter der Krankheit. Das sind in Deutschland ungefähr zwei bis sechs Millionen Frauen.

In einem Artikel für die HuffPost USA schreibt Kouzoukas, wie wichtig es deshalb ist, die Symptome – wie zum Beispiel heftige Regelschmerzen – ernst zu nehmen:

""Als ich als Teenager zum ersten Mal meine Periode bekommen hatte, nannten sie mich 'faul', weil ich beim Sportunterricht in der Schule nicht mit machen konnte oder 'Drama Queen', weil nicht in die Schule kam – ich krümmte mich in der Dusche vor Schmerzen, während ich verzweifelt versuchte, mein Leiden zu lindern.""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Italien will Frauen ""Menstruationsurlaub"" geben

""Niemand sagt dir, wie viel Schmerz okay ist""

Wenn sie früher von der Existenz der Krankheit gewusst hätte, würde es ihr heute besser gehen, da ist sich Kouzoukas sicher. Sie will deshalb ein Bewusstsein dafür schaffen, dass Frauen oder Mädchen sich bei heftigen Regelschmerzen nicht schämen, sondern unbedingt zum Arzt gehen sollten.

Sie schreibt: ""Es wird dir gesagt, dass du Menstruationsschmerzen haben könntest, wenn du deine Regel bekommst, aber niemand sagt dir, wie viel Schmerz okay ist oder ob zu viel Schmerz ein Anzeichen von etwas Schlimmerem sein könnte, wie Endometriose.

Warum hat uns niemand gesagt, dass dieser lähmende Schmerz nicht normal ist? Wenn ich das vor 14 Jahren gewusst hätte, als ich meine erste Periode bekam, dann wäre ich jetzt viel besser in der Lage, die Krankheit zu kontrollieren und ihre Auswirkungen auf meine Fruchtbarkeit.“

Palmer wirft dem Parteilinken Lügen vor

Als seien die Sondierungsgespräche zur Jamaika-Koalition nicht schon zäh genug, funkt jetzt das nächste Störfeuer dazwischen. Oder besser gesagt: Grünen-Politiker Boris Palmer. Der Bürgermeister von Tübingen, in den eigenen Reihen wegen seiner gezielten Provokationen berüchtigt, arbeitet sich in einem wütenden Facebookpost ausgerechnet an einem Parteikollegen ab.

Das Ziel von Palmers Angriff: Partei-Urgestein Jürgen Trittin. Es sei ein ""Trauerspiel“, dass Trittin, ""ein Schatten der Vergangenheit“, über die Koalition mitverhandle.

""Eine glatte Lüge""

""Was macht so jemand in einer Verhandlungsgruppe?"", fragte Palmer bei Facebook. Der Konservative in den Reihen der Grünen kritisierte vor allem Trittins Aussagen in Interviews. Trittin habe ""keine Angst vor der Unwahrheit""“ und sei stets darauf bedacht, ""den Verhandlungspartner schlecht aussehen"" zu lassen.

Trittin hatte kürzlich im ""Spiegel"" kritisiert, Union und FDP wären sich einig, dass die Grünen in den Verhandlungen möglichst wenige ihrer Punkte durchsetzen sollten. Palmer glaubt: ""Wer sowas behauptet, kann die Verhandlungen doch gleich lassen."" Dann warf er dem Parteilinken gar eine Lüge vor.

NEW DELHI -- The all-powerful GST Council may consider lowering tax rates on a host of goods such as handmade furniture, plastic products and daily use items like shampoo, and simplify return filing rules in its meeting this week.

The council, headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, is scheduled to meet on November 10 to consider lowering of the 28% GST rate on certain common use items, government officials said.

In further relief to small and medium enterprises, the panel is likely to rationalise tax rate in sectors where the total incidence of taxation has gone up because the goods were earlier either exempt from excise or was attracted lower VAT rates in the previous indirect tax regime.

The council has been meeting every month since the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, which amalgamated over a dozen central and state taxes, was introduced on July 1.

The meetings have resulted in an array of changes to ease compliance burden on businesses as well as provided relief to consumers.

""A rationalisation of items in the 28% tax bracket is expected. Most of the daily use items could be lowered to 18%. Also tax rate on items like furniture, electric switches, plastic pipes could be relooked,"" an official said.

All types of furniture attract a 28% tax under GST. Wooden furniture is handmade by unorganised sector artisans and is mostly used by middle class families and there have been demands for lowering tax incidence on them.

Also, some items of plastic attract 18% GST but goods like shower baths, sinks, wash basins, bidets, lavatory pans, seats and covers, flushing cisterns and similar sanitary ware of plastics attract 28% levy.

There is a need for rationalisation of tax rates on these items, officials said. The plastic manufacturers in their representation to the revenue department had said that 80% of the industry is in MSME category.

Besides, the GST rate on weighing machines, compressors may also be rationalised to 18% from 28%.

Officials said 90% of the manufacturers are from small and medium industries who in the pre-GST era were exempt from excise duty on manufactured value of less than Rs 1.5 crore.

Hence, such machines only attracted VAT of 14.5%. With regard to compressors, the total pre-GST incidence was 17.5% (12.5% excise duty and 5% VAT), they said stressing on need to rationalise the tax incidence.

The GST Council, which comprises of representatives of all states, have already rationalised tax rates for over 100 items. The Council has last month approved an Approach Paper to be followed by the fitment committee while deciding on future rate revisions.

Under GST various goods and services have been bracketed in 5, 12, 18 and 28%. GST has subsumed over a dozen taxes, including excise, service tax and VAT, and transformed India into a single market.",GST Council May Consider Lowering Tax Rates On Common Goods Like Plastic Products And Shampoo,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/05/gst-council-may-consider-lowering-tax-rates-on-common-goods-like-plastic-products-and-shampoo_a_23267121/

TERRORISME - Un homme et une femme ont été interpellés ce mardi 7 novembre à Clermont-Ferrand et Marseille, soupçonnés d'avoir été en relation avec deux hommes suspectés d'un projet d'attentat jihadiste déjoué en avril à Marseille, a-t-on appris mardi de source judiciaire et proche de l'enquête.

Les gardes à vue des deux personnes ""visent à préciser la nature des relations qu'elles pouvaient entretenir"" avec les suspects Clément Baur et Mahiedine Merabet, arrêtés à Marseille, puis mis en examen et écroués le 23 avril, a dit la source judiciaire.

Les enquêteurs cherchent encore à déterminer la nature exacte des projets de Merabet et de Baur, connu pour être un proche d'islamistes tchétchènes au contact desquels il s'est converti à l'islam en 2007 à Nice.

Aucune cible précise n'a été à ce jour identifiée, mais les enquêteurs ont notamment trouvé, dans les téléphones des deux hommes, des photos prises dans des lieux de rassemblement ou des rues de Marseille, et des recherches internet sur certains bars marseillais.

Arrêtés à Marseille le 18 avril, cinq jours avant le premier tour de l'élection présidentielle, ils avaient aussi effectué des investigations en lien avec des meetings de partis politiques. Le meeting de la présidente du FN, Marine Le Pen, le 19 avril à Marseille, figurait notamment parmi ces recherches internet, d'après une source proche du dossier.

""Aussi méfiants que déterminés"", ils se préparaient à agir ""de manière imminente sur le territoire français"", avait affirmé le procureur de Paris, François Molins, à la tête du parquet antiterroriste.

Laboratoire

Un important arsenal avait été découvert dans l'appartement marseillais loué par Clément Baur composé d'un fusil-mitrailleur, deux armes de poing, des sacs de munition, trois kilos d'explosifs de type TATP, dont une partie prête à l'emploi, et d'une grenade artisanale.

L'habitation avait été transformée en véritable laboratoire. Tenues de chimistes, seringues, doseurs et sacs de boulons avaient été saisis, ainsi que de l'acétone, de l'eau oxygénée, de l'acide sulfurique et des balles de ping-pong. Tous ces éléments entrent dans la composition du TATP, un explosif artisanal souvent utilisé par les jihadistes.

Trois Serbes du Kosovo et un réfugié tchétchène sont déjà mis en examen dans le cadre de l'enquête. Les quatre hommes sont soupçonnés d'avoir apporté un soutien logistique à Baur et Merabet, en leur fournissant une partie des armes trouvées.

Avec ce projet d'attentat déjoué, la menace terroriste avait fait irruption dans la campagne électorale, bouleversée deux jours plus tard par une nouvelle attaque jihadiste au cours de laquelle un policier avait été tué sur les Champs-Elysées.",Attentat déjoué à Marseille en avril: un homme et une femme interpellés à Clermont-Ferrand et Marseille,http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/11/07/attentat-dejoue-a-marseille-en-avril-un-homme-et-une-femme-interpelles-a-clermont-ferrand-et-marseille_a_23269745/

In August 2015, Whitney shared a bikini snap of herself after she decided to wear a two-piece to the beach for the first time in five years. Left with a protruding stomach due to diastasis - a condition that causes two muscles that run down the middle of your stomach to separate during pregnancy - Whitney was had been too embarrassed to wear it previously. Especially because her own anxieties were compounded by strangers asking if she was pregnant. “I accept their apologies, usually respond with some self-loathing type comment to lighten the mood but afterwards there are always a flurry of thoughts that run through my head- an internal debate that consequently alters my mood,” she said. “No joke, it got so bad at one point that I started wondering if I was in fact pregnant.”

I am ready to say to society - it’s you, not me.”

But now Whitney is “done feeling guilty” and wants other mothers to also feel good in lingerie or bikinis. She already has a whole group of mothers who are sharing their stories: Tiara: “This body has done some thangs. I mean really we been carrying these hips, these thighs, the whole damn package since time immemorial...

What do you say about a man who invalidates 86.4 percent of a country's currency overnight, and then keeps coming up with explanations over the next one year to tell the citizens that it was a success?

You don't need to be an economist to realize that if the bulk of currency in a country where transactions are largely carried out in cash (80 to 98 percent, depending on which estimate one takes), is suddenly invalidated, the results will largely be disastrous, a few benefits here and there, notwithstanding.

It has almost been a year since Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a late evening broadcast to the nation, invalidated Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. The idea was to attack black money and fake currency which were used to finance terrorism.

As the press release accompanying the demonetisation decision put it: ""Use of high denomination notes for storage of unaccounted wealth has been evident from cash recoveries made by law enforcement agencies from time to time.""

Modi invalidated Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, which he said were used to store black money, and then decided to introduce a Rs 2,000 note, making it even more easier for those who have black money, to store some of it, in the form of cash.

Let's look at a few points one by one.

1) The total value of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes that were invalidated stood at Rs 15.44 lakh crore. On November 15, 2016, a week after Modi announced the demonetisation decision, the Attorney General, Mukul Rohatgi told the Supreme Court that the government expected that around Rs 4-5 lakh crore of the invalidated notes won't make it back into the banking system.

The hope was that those who have black money in the form of cash will not deposit it in the banks because they would end up creating an audit trail. This would end up destroying black money. Of course, nothing of that sort happened.

Around 99 per cent of the invalidated currency made it back into banks. This basically meant that what was supposed to be an attack on black money became a big money laundering scheme.

2) Why did this happen? This happened primarily because no basic research was carried out to check if demonetisation could really attack black money. In May 2012, the ministry of finance had published a White Paper on black money. As per data offered in this White Paper, it can be calculated that on an average around 4.9 percent of the black money is held in the form of cash. A bulk of the black money is held in the form of real estate and gold. Hence, by attacking cash/currency, Modi ended up sending the entire country on a merry-go-round. This is what happens when you make a decision that goes against the data that is on offer.

3) In August 2014, Raghuram Rajan, the then governor of the Reserve Bank of India, whom the Modi government let go by not offering a second term, said: ""In the past, demonetisation has been thought of as a way of getting black money out of circulation. Because people then have to come and say 'how do I have this 10 crores in cash sitting in my safe and they have to explain where they got the money from. It is often cited as a solution. Unfortunately, my sense is, the clever find ways around it.""

Rajan further said: ""Black money hoarders find ways to divide their hoard into many smaller pieces...I think there are ways around demonetisation. It is not that easy to flush out the black money.""

Thus, a decision which was supposed to destroy black money, helped people launder it.

This is precisely what happened. Those with black money found various ingenious ways to divide their black money into smaller amounts and exchange it. Thus, a decision which was supposed to destroy black money, helped people launder it.

This was before any such proposal for demonetisation was on the table. As Rajan writes in his recently released book I Do What I Do: ""I was asked by the government in February 2016 for my views on demonetization, which I gave orally. Although there might be long-term benefits, I felt the likely short-term economic costs would outweigh them, and felt there were potentially better alternatives to achieve the main goals. I made these views known in no uncertain terms.""

Of course, PM Modi decided not to listen to the best economist he had at his disposal.

4) No country in a reasonably good economic position has demonetised currency in the past, at the same level that India did. This is primarily because the economics of demonetisation is very complex. This was also overlooked. In short, there was enough evidence available which said that demonetisation as a tool to weed out black money, would not work.

5) Demonetisation was also supposed to ""to curb financing of terrorism through the proceeds of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN)."" Take a look at Table 1, which basically lists out the number of fake currency notes that were detected in the banking system.

Table 1: Denomination-wise Counterfeit Notes Detected in the Banking System

(April to March)

(Source: Annual report of the Reserve Bank of India)

The number of fake Rs 500 (old) and Rs 1,000 notes that were detected during the financial year stood at around 5.74 lakh. The total number of demonetised notes stood at around 2,400 crore. This basically means that as a proportion, the fake notes identified between April 2016 to March 2017 stands close to 0 percent of the demonetised notes.

Demonetisation failed to achieve its second big objective. In fact, if you look at Table 1 carefully, fake notes of the new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 hit the market, soon after demonetisation.

6) In a matter of few weeks it was clear that demonetisation would not achieve its two main objectives. Hence, a third objective was introduced. This was to move towards a cashless society through digital transactions.

As Modi said in the November 2016 edition of the Mann Ki Baat radio programme: ""The great task that the country wants to accomplish today is the realisation of our dream of a 'Cashless Society'. It is true that a hundred percent cashless society is not possible. But why should India not make a beginning in creating a 'less-cash society'? Once we embark on our journey to create a 'less-cash society', the goal of 'cashless society' will not remain very far.""

Indeed, a very noble motive, but at what cost?

How are things looking on this front? Let's first look at the total value of digital transactions. Data for total digital transactions is available up to August 2017 and has been adjusted for real time gross settlement, which can only be used for transactions of Rs 2 lakh or more. Take a look at Figure 1.

(Source: Reserve Bank of India)

The total value of digital transactions in August 2017 was more or less similar to the total value of digital transactions before demonetisation. As Figure 1 tells us, digital transactions by value kept increasing between January and August 2016. After that they have gone up and down. This also reflects the overall slowdown of the economy post demonetisation.

How do things look, when it comes to volume of digital transactions? Take a look at Figure 2.

Figure 2:

(Source: Reserve Bank of India)

While, there was a huge one time jump when it comes to the volume of digital transactions post demonetisation, things have remained flattish since then. The initial jump wasn't surprising given that there was barely any cash going around in the financial system. But that growth hasn't sustained.

Hence, the digital goal has not been achieved either. Such a fundamental behavioral change cannot be made overnight. People have to be nudged towards it and not forced, as was the case.

7) In the game of changing goal posts, an increase in the income tax base, has been highlighted as another benefit of demonetisation. The question is, has this increase translated into higher direct tax collections? For the period, April to September 2017, ""Net Direct Tax collections represent 39.4% of the total Budget Estimates of Direct Taxes"". For the same period last year, ""38.65% of the Budget Estimates of direct taxes for FY 2016-17 has been achieved.""

Yes, there has been a marginal improvement in direct tax collection. But this still does not justify the destructive effect that demonetisation had on the economy.

Another point made in the game of changing goal posts is that income tax notices have been sent to many people. So, what? People with black money have access to the best CAs and the best lawyers, and know how the system functions. They aren't exactly sitting there waiting to pay fines and hand over their money to the government.

Also, take a look at Table 2. This tells us very clearly, the limited processing capacity of the Income Tax department.

Table 2:

(Source: Annual Report, Ministry of Finance)

8) There is enough evidence going around by now to say that the informal part of the economy, which dealt in cash, received a huge blow, from which it is yet to come out. The tragedy is that much of this is not reflected in the GDP numbers, given that the GDP numbers tend to measure the formal part of the economy, and not the informal one.

Also, there is a huge contradiction here. The Modi government has been saying that self-employment is the way forward when it comes to jobs. If self-employment is the way forward, then the informal sector needs to be handled with care.

In fact, as former prime minister Manmohan Singh, put it in an interview to Bloomberg Quint: ""The value created by the informal sector will be captured in the form of income, wealth or consumption effects. Hence, we must be cautious about sweeping generalisations about the informal economy and passing moral judgments about the entire sector.""

9) One of the claimed successes of demonetisation has been that the cash to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio has come down. In a speech made on October 4, 2017, Modi said: ""Demontisation के बाद Cash to GDP Ratio अब 9 प्रतिशत पर आ गया है। (after demonetisation, the cash to GDP ratio has come down to 9 per cent.""

This fall in cash to GDP ratio is being passed off as an achievement and the fact that nation as a whole has become more honest. As Modi said in the speech referred to earlier in the piece: ""भाइयों और बहनों, इस सरकार ने देश में संस्थागत ईमानदारी को मजबूत करने का काम किया है। ये सरकार के अथक परिश्रम का ही परिणाम है कि आज देश की अर्थव्यवस्था कम Cash के साथ चल रही है। (Brothers and sisters, this government has worked to strengthen the institutional honesty of the country. It is due to the tireless hard-work of this government that today the country's economy is running on less cash.)""

For the period of three months ending March 2017 and June 2017, the non-government part of the GDP (which forms around 90 per cent of the GDP) has grown by a little over 4 per cent. When growth in economic activity slows down, the growth in currency in circulation is bound to be impacted as well.

So, yes, the hard work of the government has led to a lower cash to GDP ratio, but at the cost of slowing down economic activity. Hence, claiming this as success, is more of trying to build a narrative around demonetisation being successful, rather than being an actual success of any sort.

10) Another point that is being made is that a lower cash to GDP ratio means that the country has become more honest. Take a look Figure 3. It basically plots the cash to GDP ratio of different countries.

Figure 3:

(Source: https://scholar.harvard.edu/rogoff/curse_of_cash_data)

Japan has the highest cash to GDP ratio at 19.4 per cent. India is nearly half of that at around a little over 10 per cent. Is India a more honest nation than Japan? As per the Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index for 2016, Japan is the twentieth least corrupt country in the world. India stands at the 79th position, despite having a much lower cash to GDP ratio.

To conclude, one year after demonetisation, all the destruction that was unleashed in its aftermath, could have been avoided, if PM Modi had heard the best economist he had at his disposal, and not an accountant masquerading as one.

Or take the case of Brazil, which has a cash to GDP ratio of 3.31 per cent. Like India, it is the 79th least corrupt country in the world. Then there is the Eurozone (country's which basically use euro as their currency). Their cash to GDP ratio is higher than that of India. Is the Eurozone more corrupt than India?

Hence, the link between a low cash to GDP ratio and low corruption is basically very weak. It is basically something that the Modi government has invented in order to build a positive narrative around demonetisation.

To conclude, one year after demonetisation, all the destruction that was unleashed in its aftermath, could have been avoided, if PM Modi had heard the best economist he had at his disposal, and not an accountant masquerading as one.

Even as the government in India has campaigned to save the girl child with its Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana, ground reality has changed little. To this day mothers and girl children continue to be abandoned by families because of the baby's gender.

The in-laws, Sangeeta has claimed, has stopped speaking to her after the birth of her baby in June.

While she is in Amravati, in her maternal home, the trio have gone missing from Virar (West). She used to live in Pune with her husband who is a graphic designer.

""This is absolutely unacceptable,"" Jayant Sinha, India's junior minister for civil aviation told the Times Now news channel.

The airline has been asked to submit a report on the incident to the aviation ministry by Wednesday, after which the government will see what action needs to be taken, Sinha said.

IndiGo, which is owned by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd and flies about one in every two passengers in the country, said it had apologised to the passenger after the incident, which local media said occurred on Oct. 15.

We are what we eat or so the famous saying goes. For those living in countries with poor population nutrition like India, this saying has more ironic significance than we can imagine. In India, it is estimated that half of Indian women age 15-49 (48 percent) and 43 percent of Indian men age 15-49 are undernourished. Arguably, a third of women of reproductive age in India is undernourished. In children under 5, statistics reveal that stunting is seen in 48 per cent while 43 per cent are underweight and wasting is common in close to 20 per cent. Hence, India is what it eats. It seems either hungry or without sufficiently nutritious food.

While governments ignore or dismiss these statistics, what they often do not realise is that poor nutrition is a leading cause of vulnerability to diseases. Nutrition has a critical role in both determining immunity and the ability to recover from diseases. Take the case of Tuberculosis of TB- one of India's top killers.

TB is easily diagnosed and treated, yet it kills lakhs of Indians each year. Several studies globally, and in India, illustrate that social, behavioural, economic and environmental factors like undernutrition, indoor air pollution, smoking and alcohol addiction act as facilitating factors to the spread of TB.

Nutrition has a critical role in both determining immunity and the ability to recover from diseases

Of these, undernutrition is the single-most important predisposing factor for TB in India. Hence, a significant section of India's population has poor nutrition and resultantly poor immunity to the TB bacteria. Not surprisingly, like undernutrition, TB exists in India at an epic scale, most often affecting those among the age group of 15-55 — an individual's most productive age.

With undernutrition we essentially create large masses with increased vulnerability to TB and other diseases. This, along with poor infection control and limited awareness, creates disease epidemics such as TB in India. Nutrition also affects recovery from disease. In the case of TB, poor nutrition also affects recovery from TB and increases drug toxicity, relapse and death once TB develops. As a result patients with poor nutritional levels are likely to show poorer performance on TB treatment because of poor muscle strength. There is always a higher risk of TB relapse among such patients as well. Appropriate nutritional intake is critical to ensure treatment completion as well as a faster road to recovery.

When considering India's significant TB crisis, it is clear that new technologies, quick and early diagnosis and less toxic treatments are critical to address India's TB epidemic. With a vast number of people affected, this is needed urgently. An accompanying though more fundamental question, what about addressing hunger and nutrition? How can we comprehensively address TB in the long-term without addressing the nutritional status of the population and ensuring immunity? Until we do so, are we not setting a near-impossible task for ourselves with a large and vulnerable population? Unless we address the root cause, will faster diagnosis and improved treatment alone end TB in India?

India needs food security for increased immunity for all diseases including TB. Why? The answers are simple. First and foremost, hunger and poor nutrition should be morally unacceptable in largely poor countries like India. If the state cannot feed its people, it loses all moral right to exercise authority. Without food, words like vikas are meaningless. Also, continued malnutrition and hunger increase vulnerability, thereby increasing disease prevalence, and consequently human suffering, burdening the health system and society at large. This has staggering human, economic and social consequences that perpetuate inequity—something that should be unacceptable as well. From a purely economic view, it causes increased suffering, loss of wages, unemployment, debt and financial desperation — undesirables in India's fantastic march towards vikas.

If the state cannot feed its people, it loses all moral right to exercise authority

It's time India thought of significant investment in nutrition as the foundational basis of a population's well-being, social justice, economic growth and as a preventive strategy for all diseases. Some solutions that India must consider are universal food security. This, of course, is fraught with challenges both in relation to implementation and in funding. However, these challenges cannot be used as the basis of reneging on this essential and beneficial strategy.

Too often there are too many ineffective schemes.We need to re-examine, link and innovate programmes run by various ministries, including health and women & child development among others. This is possible if we mainstream nutrition and food security for all beneficiary groups and not just those affected by diseases. For those affected by diseases, we need to provide long-term specialised nutritional support and supervision through programmes that ensure sufficient nutrition.

It's time to go back to basics and recognise that nutrition is the fundamental building block not just for disease prevention but the nation itself. Until we do so our claims to eliminate TB or any other disease will remain hollow. And our march towards vikas will be like a never-ending one to a mythical heaven.

Nature, you're just showing off.

This image of a wave crashing over Mornington Pier in Port Phillip Bay was taken while a strong cold front roared across the bay and southern Victoria.

As usual, the calendar features a range of pics from locations around Australia, some taken by professional photographers, others taken by people who just happened to be in the right spot at the right time.

One of our favourites is this magnificent sunset shot out the back of the Mt Hotham ski resort in Victoria, taken by from hobby photographer John Bagge (you can see more of his work here). He'd been having a family day in the snow and simply HAD to stop and take this on the way home.

Want another sunset? Try this one in the West MacDonnell Ranges near Alice Springs. It was taken by photographer Peter Nunn (more here) who was returning to Alice Springs from a photography trip to Simpsons Gap. When he saw this storm cell, he just had to climb a nearby hill and capture it.

Here's a change of pace. It's a gorgeous brooding pic of a plane on approach to Adelaide Airport taken by Adelaide local Asbjorn Kanck. Here's what the Bureau said of those unusual clouds:

This rare cloud type is called altocumulus stratiformis opacus asperitas. The altocumulus refers to the height and cloud type (cumulus cloud in the middle level of the atmosphere); stratiformis indicates it has formed in a layer; and opacus denotes the cloud is thick enough to mask the sun. Asperitas, from the Latin for roughen, refers to the wave-like feature underneath the cloud. One theory of how these clouds occur is that when mammatus clouds sink into an area of strong winds, it causes these rough, lumpy formations.

All we know is we'd rather not be on a plane landing in it. Very bumpy ride, we suspect.

How gorgeous is this one? It's fog in the valley at sunrise, as taken from Mt Buninyong near Ballarat. Local snapper Andrew Thomas (more of his work here) goes out most mornings looking for great imagery in his area. You got a good one that frosty July day, Andrew.

The calendar has several more pics and is available to buy at the Bureau's online shop.

Es hätte ein ""Die Höhle der Löwen""-Rekorddeal werden sollen. Alle fünf Löwen wollten in die App ""Too Good to Go"" investieren, die Usern stark reduziertes Essen von Gastronomen bietet, die es sonst entsorgt hätten.

Eine Millionen hätten die fünf jungen Dänen für fast 10 Prozent ihrer Unternehmensanteile bekommen sollen. ""Ein Stück Löwen-Geschichte"", wie Investor Carsten Maschmeyer über den Deal sagte.

Doch als die Vox-Kameras aus waren, platzte das Geschäft doch noch. Der Grund: Die dänischen Unternehmer überlegten es sich offenbar anders. Nicht nur traten mehrere der fünf Gründer, die in der Fernsehshow zu sehen waren, plötzlich aus dem operativen Geschäft zurück, auch die Zusammenarbeit mit den Investoren wurde eingestellt.

Wie ""Focus Online"" berichtet, hätten die Gründer eine Mail an die Maschmeyer-Group geschickt. Darin die Bitte, mit Maschmeyer und ohne die vier anderen Löwen weiterzumachen.

Was kann ""Too Good to Go""? Die App zeigt den Usern an, wo sie Gerichte zu einem reduzierten Preis bekommen und zu welchem Zeitpunkt sie diese abholen können. Dann können sie per Klick zuschlagen. ""60- bis 70-Prozent reduziert"", wie die Gründer erklären.

E-Mails zeigen den neuen Plan des Unternehmens

Das Unternehmen ""würde es vorziehen, genügend Anteile zurückzuhalten, um richtig gute Investoren in den USA und Großbritannien anzuziehen"". Man sei besorgt, dass ""fünf Investoren zu viel Unruhe in das Tagesgeschäft bringen könnten"".

Maschmeyer sagte ""Focus Online"", ein Deal komme nur in Frage, wenn alle weiter im Boot seien. Doch die ""Too Good to Go""-Gründer hatten offenbar andere Pläne. ""Wir glauben, dass der größte Mehrwert von einem der Investoren, nämlich Carsten Maschmeyer, kommt. Der gemeinsame Mehrwert der anderen Löwen ist relativ gering"", soll es in der Mail weiter geheißen haben.

Löwe Frank Thelen bestätigte der Nachrichtenseite, dass er daraufhin ausstieg. Der Deal platzte.

In einer weiteren Mail sollen die Gründer Maschmeyer mitgeteilt haben, keine weiteren finanziellen Mittel zu benötigen. Zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt werde man aber womöglich wieder auf den Investor zukommen.

Ein Sprecher des Unternehmens dementierte: ""Too Good To Go hat Herrn Maschmeyer zu keinem Zeitpunkt einen exklusiven Investment-Deal angeboten.""

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s rescue cat Paddles, who rose to fame last month following her owner’s election victory, died on Tuesday night after being struck by a car.

An unnamed neighbor found the ginger and white puss in the road outside Ardern’s home, the New Zealand Herald reported. A veterinarian later declared the animal dead.

“I’m pretty upset,” said the neighbor. “She’s very much part of the neighborhood. Most people around here would know who she is.”

Ardern paid tribute to her late pet on Facebook:

Ardern’s partner, Clarke Gayford, expressed similar sentiments on Twitter:

Paddles, who had six toes on each foot, became an internet sensation in October when the @FirstCatofNZ Twitter feed launched. Both Ardern and Gayford denied running the account, which posted pictures of Paddles posing with her powerful owner. The account also interacted with other important felines from around the world.

The person behind the account honored Paddles with this tweet:

Dans ""Tout nous sépare"", en salle ce mercredi 8 novembre, Nekfeu fait ses premiers pas au cinéma aux côtés de Catherine Deneuve. Un face à face unique en son genre.

Dans le film, Rodolphe (Nicolas Duvauchelle), un jeune homme sans projet vivant dans un quartier populaire du sud de la France, et Julia (Diane Kruger), jeune bourgeoise très fragile psychologiquement, sont amoureux. Une relation qui dégénère très vite à cause de problèmes d'argent. C'est là qu'intervient Nekfeu alias Ben, ami d'enfance de Rodolphe, qui se retrouve, par la force des choses, contraint de faire du chantage financier à Louise, la mère de Julia incarnée par Catherine Deneuve.

Avant la sortie de ""Tout nous sépare"", Catherine Deneuve a raconté au HuffPost sa relation avec Nekfeu lors du tournage et commenté l'affaire Weinstein.

Le HuffPost: Comment avez-vous entendu parler de ce projet ?

Catherine Deneuve : Je savais que Thierry Klifa avait écrit ce rôle pour moi. Lorsque j'ai su que le scénario était écrit, Thierry et moi avons beaucoup parlé du script car je trouvais le sujet vraiment intéressant.

Qu'avez-vous pensé de Nekfeu après le premier jour de tournage ?

Déjà lors des essais, j'était tout à fait pour qu'il obtienne le rôle. Je l'ai tout suite trouvé très bien. Je dois dire qu'après le premier jour de tournage j'étais assez impressionnée. Il avait un coach qui l'aidait, mais j'ai senti qu'il avait beaucoup travaillé. Je l'aime beaucoup, c'est quelqu'un de très émouvant. Ce fût une expérience très agréable. Et pour un premier film, je trouve qu'il a une présence formidable.

Comment définiriez-vous votre relation avec le personnage de Ben dans le film ?

C'est une relation qui commence mal, dans un tête à tête très exacerbé. Il a en apparence une certaine violence à mon égard mais avec le temps, je vais m'apercevoir qu'il n'est pas vraiment ce petit voyou qu'il semble être. Finalement, c'est une relation amicale qui se noue petit à petit.

Même si tout vous sépare dans le film, on a l'impression que vous êtes attirée par le mode de vie de Ben et sa bande...

Elle n'est pas attirée par ça, Ben l'attendrit, c'est différent. En revanche, toute sa bande et ce qui l'entourent ne sont pas du tout dans son goût.

Nekfeu n'est pas acteur de métier, quels conseils pourriez-vous lui donner pour la suite de sa carrière dans le cinéma ?

Je n'ai franchement pas de conseils à lui donner! (rires) La carrière de Nekfeu n'a rien à voir avec la mienne. Il faut qu'il se fie à son instinct, il n'a pas besoin de conseils. C'est un garçon très déterminé et assez intelligent. Il sait très bien ce qu'il veut faire mais aussi ne pas faire. Si je devais le décrire en quelques mots, je dirais que c'est quelqu'un de beau, émouvant, et mystérieux.

Le monde du cinéma est actuellement terni par l'affaire Weinstein, souhaitez-vous commenter ces évènements ?

On n'arrête pas de me demander si cela existe en France mais je n'en sais rien! Je ne me sens pas concernée mais je comprends très bien ce qui s'est passé, je trouve cela abominable. Et je trouve que le déferlement qu'il y a actuellement avec le hashtag #balancetonporc est ignoble. Ignoble pour les femmes qui n'ont que ça pour témoigner. Est-il intéressant d'en parler comme ça? Est ce que ça soulage? Est ce que ça apporte quelque chose? Est ce que ça va régler le problème d'une certaine façon? Est ce que les choses seront encore plus cachées?

""Pour l'instant, le président Donald Trump n'est pas invité"", car les chefs d'Etat conviés sont ceux ""des États engagés dans la mise en oeuvre de l'accord"", a ajouté la présidence de la République, qui conviera cependant des représentants du gouvernement américain.

Donald Trump avait effectivement annoncé en juin le retrait des États-Unis de l'accord de Paris, qui ne sera toutefois effectif qu'en 2020. Adopté fin 2015 et ratifié à ce jour par 169 pays, ce pacte historique vise à limiter le réchauffement mondial sous 2°C, voire 1,5°C, par rapport au niveau d'avant la Révolution industrielle.

Mais l'annonce du retrait américain est venue porter un coup à un processus complexe, qui demande notamment de se détourner des énergies fossiles (charbon, pétrole, gaz) pour réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre.

Pas de nouveaux engagements chiffrés

A ce stade, les engagements volontaires pris par les États à Paris poussent encore le thermomètre mondial à plus de 3°C. En dépit de progrès comme la stabilisation des émissions de CO2, l'écart entre l'action et les besoins est ""catastrophique"", prévenait l'ONU dans un rapport publié la semaine dernière, appelant alors les pays à renforcer leur contribution.

Interrogé sur l'utilité concrète d'un rendez-vous climatique supplémentaire et sur la possibilité d'obtenir des résultats en une seule journée, l'Elysée a affirmé qu'il était ""nécessaire et important"" pour renforcer la mobilisation internationale.

NEW DELHI -- The Supreme Court today sought the government's response on four petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act and linking of bank accounts and mobile numbers with the 12-digit biometric identification number.

The apex court did not pass any interim order in the matter saying that final hearing in all Aadhaar-related issues would start before another bench in the last week of this month and the Centre has already extended the deadline till December 31.

A bench comprising Justices A K Sikri and Ashok Bhushan, however, said that the banks and telecom service providers should indicate the last date of linking bank accounts and mobile numbers with Aadhaar in the messages sent by them to their customers.

""We make it clear that in the messages sent by banks and telecom service providers, the date of December 31, 2017 and February 6, 2018, shall also be indicated as the last date of linking Aadhaar with bank accounts and mobile numbers,"" the bench said.

Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for one of the petitioners, referred to a recently filed affidavit by the Centre and said the government has said the deadline for linking Aadhaar may be extended till March 31, 2018.

The bench, however, said the petitioners can raise this issue before the court which would hear all Aadhaar-related matters in the last week of November.

""There is no doubt that these arguments need consideration. The matter is going to come up in the last week of November and the time (to link Aadhaar with bank accounts) has been extended till December 31,"" the bench said.

On October 30, a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra had said that a constitution bench would be constituted and Aadhaar-related matters would come up for hearing before it in November last.

Several petitions challenging the Centre's move to make Aadhaar card mandatory for availing various services and benefits of welfare schemes have been filed in the apex court.

Recently, a nine-judge constitution bench of the apex court had held that Right to Privacy was a Fundamental Right under the Constitution. Several petitioners challenging the validity of Aadhaar had claimed it violated privacy rights.

The Centre had on October 25 told the top court that the deadline for mandatory linking of Aadhaar to receive benefits of government schemes has been extended till March 31, 2018 for those who do not have the 12-digit unique biometric identification number and were willing to enroll for it.

Some petitioners in the top court have termed the linking of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) number with bank accounts and mobile numbers as ""illegal and unconstitutional"".

They have also objected to the CBSE's alleged move to make Aadhaar card mandatory for students appearing for examinations, a contention denied by the Centre.

One of the counsel representing the petitioners had earlier said the final hearing in the main Aadhaar matter, which is pending before the apex court, was necessary as the government ""cannot compel"" citizens to link their Aadhaar with either bank accounts or cell phone numbers.",SC Refuses Interim Stay On Linking Aadhar Number To Bank Accounts And Mobile Numbers,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/03/sc-refuses-interim-stay-on-linking-aadhar-number-to-bank-accounts-and-mobile-numbers_a_23265414/

She flipped to her favorite passage and read aloud in a manic whisper, parroting a woman called Wanda describing her sexual fantasy of accidentally stumbling upon a farmhouse orgy and being penetrated by a donkey as punishment. Her description was detailed and, to my elementary school ears, absolutely stupefying. I felt a lump in my stomach and a tug somewhere else.

“Did you read a book about sex last night?” my mom asked the following evening, surely, I realize now, more amused than distressed. I, terrified, denied the deed and promptly buried the visual of the donkey tryst where I hoped I would never find it. Until recently, that is, when I learned of the death of the woman who brought that particular fantasy to print.

Nancy Friday died on November 5, at 84 years old, due to complications from Alzheimer’s disease. She leaves behind a contemporary world somewhat removed from the one she inhabited in 1973, when My Secret Garden was first released and the notion of women possessing sexual fantasies was, to most men, unfathomable.

“How could it be, you might ask, that women today, at the turn of the century, would still think they were the only Bad Girls with erotic thoughts?” Friday wrote in her book’s introduction. “What kind of prison is this that women impose on themselves?”

Convinced that sexual agency was crucial to the fight for gender equality, Friday set out to pierce the veil of silence shrouding women’s sexual imaginations, put in place, in part, by men who were threatened by them. She compiled an anonymous compendium of women’s fantasies, from the tepid to the obscene to the delightfully bizarre. Doctor-patient fantasies, puppy play, lengthy cucumbers and big, faceless men factor into some of the more salacious scenarios, submitted to Friday via letters, in-person conversations and recorded voice calls.

Friday became interested in female fantasies after she revealed one (involving a well endowed stranger at a football game) to a lover in bed, who promptly put on his pants and exited the premises in response. The baffling encounter revealed to Friday just how great a threat women’s unsatisfied sexual potential posed to some men.

“I can see that I was only too happily enacting his indirectly stated Pygmalion-D. H. Lawrence fantasies,” she wrote. “But mine? He didn’t want to hear about them. I was not to coauthor this fascinating script on How To Be Nancy, even if it was my life. I was not to act, but to be acted upon.”

My Secret Garden is an early manifestation of confessional writing, and reads almost like a proto-Tumblr or Reddit thread, with contributors sharing intimate secrets under a cloak of anonymity. Some fantasies incorporate well-trodden taboos like incest and rape, while others veer further into the surreal ― like a woman who yearns to be tantalized by an octopus from a Salvador Dali drawing.",'We’re As Hidden As Our Clitorises': How Nancy Friday Liberated Women's Sexuality,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/07/we-re-as-hidden-as-our-clitorises-how-nancy-friday-liberated-womens-sexuality_a_23268906/

La prescription inappropriée d'antipsychotiques comme le Risperdal, le Zyprexa et l'Abilify chez les personnes âgées, en particulier les patients en soins de longue durée souffrant de troubles comme la démence, est un sujet qui suscite les débats depuis quelques années dans l'ensemble du Canada. Il est également de plus en plus question de l'importante quantité de médicaments de ce type qui sont prescrits aux enfants et aux jeunes atteints d'un trouble déficitaire de l'attention avec hyperactivité.

Il existe cependant un autre groupe de la population canadienne à qui l'on administre des antipsychotiques en grand nombre et dont on ne parle jamais : les personnes ayant une déficience intellectuelle, comme le syndrome de Down ou l'autisme.

Dans une étude récente que nous avons fait paraître dans le Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, nous faisons état d'une situation où près de 40 pour cent des adultes atteints d'une déficience intellectuelle en Ontario ont reçu une ordonnance d'antipsychotiques au cours d'une période de six ans et où 60 pour cent des personnes à qui de tels médicaments ont été prescrits ne faisaient l'objet d'aucun diagnostic associé aux problèmes psychiatriques pour lesquels ces médicaments sont généralement étudiés et approuvés.

Les prescriptions de ce genre engendrent des coûts, et ce, pour l'ensemble de la collectivité.

Les médicaments antipsychotiques sont coûteux et leur utilisation au sein de ce groupe de la population a représenté pour le gouvernement de l'Ontario une dépense de plus de 117 millions de dollars au cours de la période de six ans ciblée par l'étude. Ce coût devient encore plus important lorsqu'il est transposé à l'échelle nationale. Si une portion de ces prescriptions est possiblement inappropriée, comme le laisse entendre notre étude, force est alors de constater qu'un montant considérable des fonds publics consacrés à la santé pourrait être dépensé autrement et de façon plus efficace pour soutenir ces personnes.

Mais ce n'est pas tout.

Sans une surveillance adéquate, la prise de médicaments antipsychotiques peut entraîner des problèmes de santé graves. Dans notre étude, une personne sur cinq consommant ce type de médicaments souffrait d'hypertension et une sur six de diabète, soit des taux plus élevés que ce qu'on observe dans la population en général et chez les adultes atteints d'une déficience intellectuelle. Les antipsychotiques peuvent aussi causer des troubles graves du mouvement et une mauvaise gestion de leurs effets secondaires peut même contribuer à la mortalité.

Pourquoi, dans ce cas, les médecins prescrivent-ils si fréquemment des médicaments antipsychotiques aux adultes atteints d'une déficience intellectuelle?

Pourquoi, dans ce cas, les médecins prescrivent-ils si fréquemment des médicaments antipsychotiques aux adultes atteints d'une déficience intellectuelle?

Il n'y a pas de réponse certaine à cette question, mais nous savons qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un problème nouveau – la surmédicamentation des personnes atteintes d'une déficience intellectuelle est une pratique peu reluisante qui a caractérisé notre passé médical, et plusieurs raisons peuvent expliquer pourquoi elle se poursuit encore aujourd'hui.

La plupart des professionnels de la santé ont reçu très peu de formation ou aucune formation relative aux déficiences intellectuelles. S'ajoute à cela le fait que les services de soins de première ligne et en santé mentale sont inadéquats pour les personnes avec une déficience intellectuelle. Il faut également prendre en considération l'existence de contextes stressants qui sont susceptibles d'entraîner des comportements difficiles : un personnel soignant qui est épuisé et qui manque de soutien; un système d'éducation et un monde du travail qui trop souvent ne tiennent pas compte des besoins particuliers des personnes atteintes d'une déficience intellectuelle.

Enfin, les médicaments antipsychotiques sont gratuits et relativement faciles d'accès pour une majorité de personnes appartement à ce groupe de la population, alors que les interventions non pharmacologiques sont quant à elles inaccessibles ou offertes à un coût prohibitif.

Ainsi, avec le temps, la surprescription de médicaments antipsychotiques devient inévitable.

On utilise donc les antipsychotiques, semble-t-il, pour gérer les problèmes de comportement chez les adultes atteints d'une déficience intellectuelle, plutôt que d'offrir à cette population les services sociaux et de santé essentiels dont elle a besoin pour s'épanouir.

Mais que pouvons-nous faire à cet égard?

Nous devons également réfléchir aux personnes à qui aucun antipsychotique n'a encore été prescrit.

Nous devons veiller à ce que les médicaments de toute personne qui prend actuellement des antipsychotiques fassent l'objet d'un examen régulier comprenant une évaluation d'un ou d'une spécialiste. Nous devons également réfléchir aux personnes à qui aucun antipsychotique n'a encore été prescrit. Quels sont les problèmes qui mènent à une première prescription et que pouvons-nous mettre en place pour éviter cette dernière?

Si cette tâche peut à première vue sembler colossale et sans espoir de réalisation, nous pouvons nous inspirer de l'exemple du Royaume-Uni, qui a investi des sommes importantes et déployé beaucoup d'efforts pour réduire le nombre de prescriptions d'antipsychotiques chez les personnes ayant une déficience intellectuelle.

L'initiative STOMP – Stop Over Medicating People [Cessons de surmédicamenter les gens] – est un projet sur trois ans mis en place à la suite d'une accumulation de données indiquant un problème de surmédicamentation, notamment le scandale de Winterbourne View, dans le cadre duquel il a été découvert que de nombreuses personnes ayant une déficience intellectuelle étaient à tort surmédicamentées et faisaient l'objet de mauvais traitements dans un hôpital privé.

L'initiative STOMP comprend un engagement collectif des professionnels de la santé de l'ensemble du Royaume-Uni à changer les pratiques relatives à la prescription et à la surveillance des antipsychotiques.

Il faut également prévoir des activités d'éducation sur le diagnostic et le traitement des problèmes de santé mentale propres aux personnes avec une déficience intellectuelle destinées aux médecins de famille et aux psychiatres.

S'il s'avère que l'établissement de lignes directrices en matière de prescription constitue un point de départ important, une telle mesure n'est cependant pas suffisante. Il faut également prévoir des activités d'éducation sur le diagnostic et le traitement des problèmes de santé mentale propres aux personnes avec une déficience intellectuelle destinées aux médecins de famille et aux psychiatres. Une telle sensibilisation devrait toutefois également comprendre les pharmaciens et pharmaciennes, le personnel infirmier, les psychologues, les travailleurs et les travailleuses sociaux, les proches aidants et les patients eux-mêmes.

La question qui demeure est donc la suivante : peut-on commencer à intégrer et à prioriser les personnes atteintes d'une déficience intellectuelle dans les discussions concernant la prescription inappropriée de médicaments, et peut-on en outre s'engager collectivement à cesser de surmédicamenter les gens au sein de ce groupe de la population partout au Canada?

Steven Letts, 39, abducted and had sex with the child after they met in the street and she asked him for a cigarette. Letts, who was found guilty of kidnapping and rape on Monday, responded by offering her a joint, then took her home and plied her with cocaine, cannabis and vodka after their encounter in Gloucester city centre on 6 March this year.

The girl, who lives in care, had been in the company of her support worker, who told Gloucester Crown Court she had warned Letts that she was underage. Letts, of Barton Street, Gloucester, pleaded not guilty to abducting the girl on 6 March and raping her in his flat between March 6 and 8, though he was found guilty on both counts. The trial heard Letts and the girl went back to his flat to drink apple vodka and smoke cannabis. He also gave her cocaine to smoke through a pipe.

SWNS Letts was found guilty of raping and kidnapping a 12-year-old girl

The rape came to light when the girl asked a social worker “how long it’d take to find out if you are pregnant”. The court heard Letts kissed the girl in his kitchen and when she became tired she went to sleep under a blanket in Letts’ bed. He climbed in and began “cuddling” the child before initiating sex. The ordeal lasted 30 minutes and prosecutor Sarah Regan said the victim wanted Letts to stop but felt guilty because he had given her alcohol and drugs. When Letts was later arrested, police found DNA matching the girl inside his underwear. Letts claimed he believed the girl was 16 when they met, though the girl told him she was 15.

Das Thema wurde auch im ARD-Talk ""Hart aber fair"" thematisiert

Dort warf CDU-Politiker Meister den Medien mangelnden Kooperationswillen vor - das konnte der Grünen-Europaabgeordnete Giegold nicht auf sich sitzen lassen

Müssen Promis und Politiker nun weltweit erneut zittern? Nach den Offshore Leaks (2013), Lux Leaks (2014), Swiss Leaks (2015) und vor allem den Panama Papers (2016) gibt es eine neue Veröffentlichung zu Steueroasen und dem Vermeiden von Steuerzahlungen durch Reiche. Das Material der Paradise Papers soll sich aus 21 Quellen speisen und rund 13,4 Millionen Dokumente umfassen.

Die Enthüllungen, in Deutschland vorangetrieben von einem Rechercheverbund aus NDR, WDR und ""Süddeutscher Zeitung"" (""SZ""), standen nun am Montagabend zur Diskussion in der ARD-Talkshow ""Hart aber fair"".

Der reißerische Titel: ""Steueroase Europa – wie uns Konzerne und Super-Reiche abzocken!"" Fast zwanzig Minuten lang waren sich die eingeladenen Politiker fast einig. Der CDU-Politiker und Parlamentarische Staatssekretär beim Bundesfinanzminister, Michael Meister, Grünen-Europapolitiker Sven Giegold sowie Journalist Georg Mascolo meinten: Schuld sind die Steueroasen.

Doch dann attackierte Meister plötzlich den Überbringer der - zumindest für viele Steuerflüchtlinge - schlechten Nachrichten. Giegold konnte den Angriff auf die Medien nicht unkommentiert lassen - und keilte zurück.

CDU-Politiker Meister attackiert die Medien

Am Anfang von Frank Plasbergs Sendung musste vor allem der luxemburgische Außenminister Jean Asselborn einstecken. Der wurde dann auch schnell sauer, dass Luxemburg immer als Steueroase verspottet werde. Er betonte: ""Wir haben keine Briefkastenfirmen mehr!""

Doch Mascolo, Leiter des Investigativ-Rechercheteams von NDR, WDR und ""SZ"" kannte noch weitere Beispiele - deren Daten wohl Finanzstaatssekretär Meister gerne hätte.

""Würden Sie mit den Regierungen kooperieren, wenn Herr Meister fragen würden, die Sachen rüberzuschieben, um darauf gesetzgeberisch zu reagieren?"", fragt Plasberg den Journalisten.

Der zeigt sich hart: Er würde eine Zusammenarbeit ablehnen. ""Die Diskussionen hatten wir schon bei den Panama Papers."" Mascolos Begründung: ""Aus Gründen des Informantenschutz werden die Unterlagen staatlichen Behörden nicht zur Verfügung gestellt.""

CDU-Politiker Meister wollte das nicht akzeptieren - und prescht nach vorne. Aus seiner Sicht gehe es um zwei Dinge: Einerseits um Straftaten wie Geldwäsche oder Steuerhinterziehung, die hinter den Konstruktionen stecken würden. Und andererseits um Modelle, die man als Gesetzgeber noch gar nicht kenne.

""Da ist es sinnvoll zu wissen, was passiert eigentlich"", erklärte Meister. ""Ich wäre dankbar und es wäre auch hilfreich gewesen"", wenn die Unterlagen sowohl der Panama Papers als auch der aktuellen Paradise Papers den Staatsanwaltschaften und Finanzbehörden zugänglich gemacht worden wären - ""und nicht nur darüber berichtet worden wäre"", stellte der Finanzstaatssekretär klar.

Unfähigkeit der Politik, Probleme zu beheben

Die Medienschelte wollte Grünen-Finanzexperte Giegold nicht unkommentiert lassen. ""Die ganze Diskussion ist schon ein wenig absurd"", keilte er gegen Meister.

Die Politik müsste eigentlich dankbar sein. Denn über 30 Jahre habe es diese nicht geschafft, diese Steuerschlupflöcher zu schließen. ""Das jetzt die Journalisten den Druck entfalten, der uns zu dieser Debatte befähigt"", sei Giegold zufolge deshalb nur folgerichtig.

Er verstehe die Haltung der Journalisten vollkommen, ihre Ethik des Quellenschutzes nicht aufzugeben. Giegold unterstrich: ""Ich bin den Journalisten dankbar!""

Allerdings müsse vielmehr ""die Unfähigkeit der Politik"" kritisiert werden, das Problem innerhalb Europas nicht behoben zu haben, ""dass alle ihre Steuern gerecht bezahlen"".

Zumindest das Publikum hatte der Grüne da auf seiner Seite.

CHENNAI -- Prime Minster Narendra Modi on Monday said that editorial freedom should be used in public interest and urged the newspapers to devote space to increase awareness about climate change.

Speaking at the 75th anniversary celebrations of Tamil newspaper Daily Thanthi at the Madras University Centenary Auditorium, Modi said lot of things happen around the world and the editors decide what is important to be published in their newspapers.

He said: ""Editorial freedom should be used wisely and in public interest.""

Pointing out the natural calamities occurring around the world at regular intervals, Modi urged newspapers to allocate space to increase awareness about climate change.

He said the freedom to write does not in anyway reduce the importance to be accurate and correct, adding that though media outlets may be owned by the private sector, they serve a public purpose, have much social accountability and their conduct should be above board.

He said technological advancement enables citizens to compare, discuss and analyse the credibility of news and the media should take extra caution to maintain its credibility.

According to him, reform in media can come from within and through introspection.

Observing most of the media discourse revolves around politics, Modi said the nation is made of over a billion people and the media should focus on the people and their achievements.

Citing the spread of mobile phones, Modi said citizen reporting is important in showcasing individual achievements and also helping in the aftermath of natural disasters.

Modi also released a souvenir.

Governor Banwarilal Purohit, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Union Minister of State for Finance and Shipping Pon Radhakrishnan, Chief Minister K. Palaniswami and his deputy O.Pannerselvam also participated in the function.

Paying encomiums to the founder of Daily Thanthi S.P. Adithanar and his son Sivanthi Adithan, Palaniswami said the daily would certainly see centenary celebrations.

Leaders of several political parties, law makers, industrialists, movie actors and diplomats attended the function.

Bill C-65 has been a year in the making since the federal government launched consultations in mid-2016 to review the Canada Labour Code.","People listen from outside the chamber in the House of Commons on June 29, 2016 in Ottawa.

OTTAWA — The federal government still has important details to iron out after it announced new legislation to take on the ""full range of unacceptable behaviours,"" from teasing to sexual violence, in federally regulated workplaces.

Labour Minister Patty Hajdu tabled Bill C-65 on Tuesday, proposing to make amendments to the Canada Labour Code to handle workplace harassment more efficiently. If passed, the legislation would extend across the House of Commons, Senate, and Library of Parliament.

Those who work on Parliament Hill are currently not protected by the Canada Labour Code. But the government is limited in what it can do to prevent harassment and violence from happening on Parliament Hill, the minister said.

""No government can legislate away this problem,"" said Hajdu. ""This is a problem that exists in a culture that tolerates these behaviours, where power imbalances and gender norms create and reinforce all kinds of unacceptable behaviours.""

What the new legislation proposes to do is fuse two parallel complaint processes into one. Exclusive to that, the second piece of the plan is to facilitate a workplace culture change.

So to make that cultural shift happen, the government has pledged to launch an awareness campaign, and to distribute education and training tools to employers and employees.

The last promise is the creation of a helpline, a 1-800 number, to assist employers and employees through the complaint process.

When asked about how much the awareness campaign and education tools will cost, Hajdu threw to the future for an answer.

Patty Hajdu, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour stands during question period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Sept. 19, 2017.

""We'll have more to say about the funding in the days to come,"" she said.

Hajdu made the announcement alongside Government House Leader Bardish Chagger, Status of Women Minister Maryam Monsef and chief government whip Pablo Rodriguez.

Monsef called the timing of the new legislation ""ideal,"" saying the #MeToo social media campaign has acclimatized people to listen and talk about instances of harassment more openly.

""It's taken 150 years for us to introduce legislation like this,"" she said.

What the new process would look like

The legislation will replace an array of current anti-harassment policies that apply to different groups of federal workers.

For example, there's one that oversees MP complaints against other MPs. And there's another regime that applies only to federally regulated private-sector industries and Crown corporations.

It would also implement measures to protect the privacy of complainants.

The proposed consolidated workplace prevention and resolution process looks like this: if an employer does not resolve a complaint with the employee, the issue continues to mediation.

If a resolution isn't found after mediation, a so-called ""competent person"" is brought in to investigate and produce an incident report that includes recommendations.

""Competent people would have to be impartial. They would have to be trained and on the legislation they would have to understand the legislation. They would have to understand harassment and sexual violence,"" Hajdu said.

She added an appointed competent person is chosen by the employer and employee.

The Canadian Flag flies on a building in Ottawa across from the Peace Tower on Centre Block of Parliament Hill.

""If the employer or the employee can't agree there will be a list of competent people that will be available from the labour program that people can choose from.""

After the report by the competent person is completed, it's then up to the employer to respond to it and implement its recommendations.

And if the complaint is still not resolved at this stage, the labour minister would be brought in to investigate the case.

New legislation amid 'Weinstein effect'

The announcement comes in the wake of bombshell harassment and sexual abuse allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.

Public condemnation over Weinstein's alleged decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct has refocused people's attention — especially employers — on implementing anti-harassment policies.

What's missing from Bill C-65 is an explicit timeline for competent persons to complete incident and recommendation reports. The legislation is still a work in progress, Employment and Social Development Canada said.

""The department will consult with stakeholders and experts during the regulatory process on the issue of timelines for the different steps in the process,"" department spokesman Christopher Simard said in an email.

A HuffPost Canada investigation found that workplace harassment allegations against former Sen. Don Meredith were first reported to Senate human resources in July 2013.

An official workplace assessment investigating the senator's office was launched in Feburary 2015 after late Sen. Pierre Claude Nolin noticed a high turnover in Meredith's office.

Meredith resigned from the Senate earlier this year on the eve of an unprecedented expulsion vote over his sexual relationship with a teenage girl.

That workplace assessment report, which the Senate Ethics Office pledged to complete despite Meredith's departure, remains unfinished.

In the House of Commons, a report released last year said 10 cases investigating alleged harassment were processed in about a year. Ninety per cent of the complainants were female.

Groups want 'clear' definitions

The Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) and Oxfam Canada both released statements Tuesday applauding the government for taking a step in addressing the systemic issue.

But both organizations flagged concerns with the promises being made with no explicit funding to match.

It is unclear at this point whether sufficient resources will be allocated to implement the regulations proposed in the bill. Diana Sarosi, Oxfam Canada

""Effective legislation must be accompanied by sufficient financial resources and must come with comprehensive training that is sustained adequately over time,"" Oxfam Canada policy manager Diana Sarosi said in a release.

""It is unclear at this point whether sufficient resources will be allocated to implement the regulations proposed in the bill.""

The CLC said it wants to see the bill include a ""clear definition"" of what constitutes harassment and violence under the proposed legislation.

Bill C-65 has been a year in the making since the federal government launched consultations in mid-2016 to review the Canada Labour Code.

When pressed by reporters for what the definition of ""workplace"" is, the labour minister said any work-related interaction inside or outside the office is subject to the new legislation.

In the year since the Nov. 8, 2016 election, dread and anxiety around the world has only mounted with the realization that Trump doesn’t care for strategic alliances or multilateral solutions to global challenges. His is a zero-sum approach to world affairs in which the “winner” takes all and diplomacy is for losers.

The United States has become less respected under Trump, polls suggest, and as the president disdainfully discards the nation’s mantle of global leadership, erstwhile close allies are relying less on America and instead are going their own way.

Trump’s management of U.S. foreign policy is “revolutionary in a very negative way,” said Aaron David Miller, who is vice president and Middle East programs director at the Woodrow Wilson International Center and a former State Department negotiator in past Democratic and Republican administrations. “It’s a galactic disaster.”

Trump has disempowered Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by farming out foreign policy to his son-in-law and chief adviser, Jared Kushner, and to Gary Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council and Trump’s chief economic adviser. He’s also allowed U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley to speak on issues that normally fall under the purview of the secretary of state, Miller said, adding that Trump also contradicts himself, his advisers and members of his Cabinet.

“Messaging has been wandering all over the parking lot,” Miller said.

“The rest of the world is shaking its head,” he added. “They’ve lost a good bit of faith in American leadership and what America stands for.”

A Disregard For American Values

Trump’s pugnacious style and his Manichean rhetoric on the world stage, along with the unpredictability of a White House in near-constant disarray and the abandonment of several existing international commitments have only further eroded America’s position.

“It’s the worst of all worlds,” said Stephen M. Walt, professor of international affairs at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. “The United States is continuing to intervene in various places … but we’re now doing it with an incompetent president. And this will not end well.”

The biggest difference between Trump and his predecessors, Walt argued, is Trump’s seeming disregard for foundational American values such as freedom, democracy and equal rights. That, combined with ease around thuggish authoritarian presidents including Vladimir Putin in Russia and Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, directly undermine America’s standing in the world.

“He’s very comfortable with dictators of all kinds,” Walt said. “It’s one thing to recognize that there are sometimes trade-offs and that sometimes you have to compromise on those values … But in Trump’s case, he’s throwing those values out of the window. And that is giving up a great advantage that the United States has had in terms of foreign policy ― namely, that the United States stood for something other than just self-interest.”

America’s Global Reputation Hurt By Trump

“Trump and many of his key policies are broadly unpopular around the globe, and ratings for the U.S. have declined steeply in many nations,” according to the Pew Research Center, which polled more than 40,000 people from 37 countries around the world earlier this year.

Most non-Americans consider Trump “arrogant,” “intolerant” and even “dangerous,” the poll found. Just 22 percent of respondents expressed “confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs,” compared with 64 percent during Barack Obama’s presidency. The decline in trust was most marked among America’s closest allies in Europe and Asia, as well as in neighboring Mexico and Canada.

Pew Research Center Global confidence in the U.S. president and views of the U.S. have both taken a plunge in the year since Donald Trump's election.

In only two of the polled countries ― Russia and Israel ― did people believe Trump is a better president than Obama.

“I don’t think you need a Pew poll to come to the conclusion that our allies are beside themselves ― both in terms of the issue of competency and strategy. And our adversaries … have exploited every conceivable opportunity Trump has thrown their way,” said Miller.

American presidents once heralded the country as the shining city on a hill ― an exceptional beacon to the rest of the world ― and allies saw the appeal in making common cause with the U.S., with British leaders often boasting of the “special relationship” that spanned the Atlantic.

These days, apprehension about the U.S. has even crept into the halls of Westminster.

“‘America First’ doesn’t sound like the basis for a mutually beneficial partnership,” one Tory Member of Parliament told HuffPost on condition of anonymity.

A Surprising Trump Effect

After the U.S. election, European liberals feared a wave of Trump-style populism that would upend the political map on the continent and bring down the post-World War II political order.

But when Dutch voters went to the polls in March, they rejected the nativist populism embodied by Geert Wilders, a far-right leader who had praised Trump throughout his campaign.

The “Trump factor” played a role in “making people think twice about voting for a populist, as people have seen that if you elect a populist, you can get all kinds of wacky policies,” Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a London-based research organization, told The New York Times.

In France, Emmanuel Macron won the spring elections in a landslide by shrewdly positioning himself as the anti-Trump: A liberal, progressive globalist believer in diplomacy and international institutions. When Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate deal, Macron tweeted, “Make Our Planet Great Again,” earning 230,000 retweets and sparking a French government-funded website by that name that encourages those concerned about climate change ― especially scientists and entrepreneurs ― to immigrate to France.

Pascal Rossignol/Reuters People gather to protest the visit of U.S. President Donald Trump in Paris on July 13, 2017.

Trump is so disliked in France that the label “Trump à la française” has become a mark of political infamy, and former allies, such as the far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen, rarely invoke his name. Even far-right voters don’t like Trump anymore. Supporters of the National Front, a populist, anti-immigrant party, hold increasingly negative views of Trump.

According to a new poll by HuffPost France, only around 20 percent of National Front voters say they have a positive opinion of Trump ― a decline of 11 percent since a similar poll from last year ― suggesting that familiarity has bred dislike.

Given the intense disregard of Trump, European leaders have, by and large, sought to distance themselves from the American president lest they be tainted by association.

In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party made one small but significant change to its electoral program before national elections earlier this year, substituting the word “friend” with the word “partner” when referring to the U.S. That puts America in the same category as Turkey, a country with which Germany has strained relations.

Conversely, British Prime Minister Theresa May waded into political trouble when she invited Trump for a state visit soon after his inauguration. Formally, invitations for state visits have to be extended by the queen on advice from her government, and more than 1.8 million people signed an online petition to have the visit downgraded because Trump would “cause embarrassment to Her Majesty.” The speaker of the House of Commons also refused to allow Trump the honor of addressing the Westminster Parliament, citing Trump’s “racism and sexism.”

For now, the visit appears to be postponed until sometime next year.",It Only Took Trump One Year To Trash America's Global Reputation,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-one-year-world-perspective_us_5a029dc4e4b06ff32c9456ac?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009

Das Thema wurde auch im ARD-Talk ""Hart aber fair"" thematisiert

Dort warf CDU-Politiker Meister den Medien mangelnden Kooperationswillen vor - das konnte der Grünen-Europaabgeordnete Giegold nicht auf sich sitzen lassen

Müssen Promis und Politiker nun weltweit erneut zittern? Nach den Offshore Leaks (2013), Lux Leaks (2014), Swiss Leaks (2015) und vor allem den Panama Papers (2016) gibt es eine neue Veröffentlichung zu Steueroasen und dem Vermeiden von Steuerzahlungen durch Reiche. Das Material der Paradise Papers soll sich aus 21 Quellen speisen und rund 13,4 Millionen Dokumente umfassen.

Die Enthüllungen, in Deutschland vorangetrieben von einem Rechercheverbund aus NDR, WDR und ""Süddeutscher Zeitung"" (""SZ""), standen nun am Montagabend zur Diskussion in der ARD-Talkshow ""Hart aber fair"".

Der reißerische Titel: ""Steueroase Europa – wie uns Konzerne und Super-Reiche abzocken!"" Fast zwanzig Minuten lang waren sich die eingeladenen Politiker fast einig. Der CDU-Politiker und Parlamentarische Staatssekretär beim Bundesfinanzminister, Michael Meister, Grünen-Europapolitiker Sven Giegold sowie Journalist Georg Mascolo meinten: Schuld sind die Steueroasen.

Doch dann attackierte Meister plötzlich den Überbringer der - zumindest für viele Steuerflüchtlinge - schlechten Nachrichten. Giegold konnte den Angriff auf die Medien nicht unkommentiert lassen - und keilte zurück.

CDU-Politiker Meister attackiert die Medien

Am Anfang von Frank Plasbergs Sendung musste vor allem der luxemburgische Außenminister Jean Asselborn einstecken. Der wurde dann auch schnell sauer, dass Luxemburg immer als Steueroase verspottet werde. Er betonte: ""Wir haben keine Briefkastenfirmen mehr!""

Doch Mascolo, Leiter des Investigativ-Rechercheteams von NDR, WDR und ""SZ"" kannte noch weitere Beispiele - deren Daten wohl Finanzstaatssekretär Meister gerne hätte.

""Würden Sie mit den Regierungen kooperieren, wenn Herr Meister fragen würden, die Sachen rüberzuschieben, um darauf gesetzgeberisch zu reagieren?"", fragt Plasberg den Journalisten.

Der zeigt sich hart: Er würde eine Zusammenarbeit ablehnen. ""Die Diskussionen hatten wir schon bei den Panama Papers."" Mascolos Begründung: ""Aus Gründen des Informantenschutz werden die Unterlagen staatlichen Behörden nicht zur Verfügung gestellt.""

CDU-Politiker Meister wollte das nicht akzeptieren - und prescht nach vorne. Aus seiner Sicht gehe es um zwei Dinge: Einerseits um Straftaten wie Geldwäsche oder Steuerhinterziehung, die hinter den Konstruktionen stecken würden. Und andererseits um Modelle, die man als Gesetzgeber noch gar nicht kenne.

""Da ist es sinnvoll zu wissen, was passiert eigentlich"", erklärte Meister. ""Ich wäre dankbar und es wäre auch hilfreich gewesen"", wenn die Unterlagen sowohl der Panama Papers als auch der aktuellen Paradise Papers den Staatsanwaltschaften und Finanzbehörden zugänglich gemacht worden wären - ""und nicht nur darüber berichtet worden wäre"", stellte der Finanzstaatssekretär klar.

Unfähigkeit der Politik, Probleme zu beheben

Die Medienschelte wollte Grünen-Finanzexperte Giegold nicht unkommentiert lassen. ""Die ganze Diskussion ist schon ein wenig absurd"", keilte er gegen Meister.

Die Politik müsste eigentlich dankbar sein. Denn über 30 Jahre habe es diese nicht geschafft, diese Steuerschlupflöcher zu schließen. ""Das jetzt die Journalisten den Druck entfalten, der uns zu dieser Debatte befähigt"", sei Giegold zufolge deshalb nur folgerichtig.

Er verstehe die Haltung der Journalisten vollkommen, ihre Ethik des Quellenschutzes nicht aufzugeben. Giegold unterstrich: ""Ich bin den Journalisten dankbar!""

Allerdings müsse vielmehr ""die Unfähigkeit der Politik"" kritisiert werden, das Problem innerhalb Europas nicht behoben zu haben, ""dass alle ihre Steuern gerecht bezahlen"".

Zumindest das Publikum hatte der Grüne da auf seiner Seite.

Ferrero, the company that owns Nutella, has secretly updated the recipe for the hazelnut-chocolate spread, according to a report in the Independent. The big change? They're now adding more sugar and powdered skimmed milk.

Verbraucherzentrale Hamburg, (the Hamburg Consumer Protection Centre), posted information about the change to the recipe on their Facebook page, noting that the sugar content has gone up from 55.9 per cent to 56.3 per cent and the skimmed milk powder from 7.5 per cent to 8.7 per cent. They also reveal that the fat content has been reduced to 30.9 per cent from 31.8 per cent.

""Since the colour of the new Nutella is brighter, we assume that more milk powder was added at the expense of cocoa,"" Verbraucherzentrale Hamburg noted in their Facebook post. ""Obviously, Ferrero does not want to grant its customers too much transparency.""

They added, ""Whether or not the contents of other ingredients such as sugar or palm oil have been altered remains unclear.""

As a result, Nutella fans (who knew they were so devoted?) shared their wrath and disappointment on social media.

Some couldn't believe Ferrero would even dare mess with their recipe.

Ferrero issued a statement confirming that an ""adjustment"" had been made to the recipe but added that many brands do the same to their products, reports Sky News.

""The quality... and all other aspects of Nutella remain the same,"" the company said.

Despite Ferrero's reassurances that the new recipe shouldn't affect the quality or taste of Nutella, some consumers weren't buying it.

And some urged others to boycott the brand.

As if #Nutella wasn't bad enough yet, there's more milk in it now, more fat, less cacao. & Still palm oil.

One informed Twitter user even posted a photo of what Nutella looks like in its ingredient form, in an attempt to urge people to pick something healthier to eat.

What a #Nutella jar looks like when deconstructed. Should be called fatty sugar spread really. pic.twitter.com/EagPLjMXhc — Didier Bourguignon (@ddabourguignon) November 7, 2017

Despite the sugar and saturated fat, there are some, albeit small, health benefits to eating Nutella (in small doses, that is).

The spread contains key vitamins and minerals that are essential for good health, such as fibre, which can help lower cholesterol levels, and iron and calcium, according to SFGate. Hazelnuts have also been shown to be good for the heart.

On the other hand, it's all that sugar and saturated fat that make Nutella a snack that shouldn't be eaten on the regular.

Meghan Telpner, a nutritionist, advised that Nutella shouldn't be served as breakfast, noting that the spread contains 70 per cent saturated fat and processed sugar by weight, 15mg of sodium, and ""just two sad little grams of protein per serving.""

""Despite the lovely visual of hazelnuts tumbling across the screen in the television commercial, the first ingredient in Nutella is plain old, white, refined, most likely GMO sugar,"" Telpner writes on her website.

""Hazelnuts make their appearance after sugar and palm oil. If we were to name this spread appropriately, we might call it 'sugar palm oil spread,' but that doesn't have the right ring to it. Unless you're choosing to hop off your health train while on holidays in Paris, there's no reason to choose Nutella for breakfast.""

Another reason why Nutella shouldn't be eaten for breakfast? Spiking blood sugar levels. Meaning if your kids are eating the spread, you (and your kids' teachers!) are in for a major headache.

""High sugar intake first thing in the morning will spike blood sugar levels, resulting in a plummet mid morning and contribute to poor concentration, hyper activity and aggression,"" Telpner notes.

The ""Hey Arnold!""
I even think there's a third audience, the children of adults, and they're like, ""Hey, you gotta watch this 'Hey Arnold!'
""Hey Arnold!","Listen up, all you football heads: The new ""Hey Arnold!: The Jungle Movie"" trailer is here, and it looks like it's about to clear up some phallacies. ""Hey Arnold!"" creator Craig Bartlett told HuffPost that in the 15 years since the last movie, he's seen various fan comments online that ended up informing the direction of his new film. Those comments helped him understand which questions needed answering, and what kinds of changes he should make. ""I said, 'Look we know we're going to have to redesign everything from the ground up ― the characters, the backgrounds,"" he explained in an interview on Tuesday. ""'Let's make it so that a couple years have gone by ― a year or two, say ― so you can accept that the kids are a little older, they've gotten a little taller.'"" One character in particular, Grandpa Phil, underwent a redesign inspired by fan comments. You see, in the years since ""Hey Arnold!"" went off the air, some dedicated viewers spread images online noting Phil's, erm, interestingly shaped head.

""Once that image went out online, it's like you can't unsee it, right?"" Bartlett said. ""That's my biggest beef about that. It's like, 'Oh, man, now that they've done that people are going to have a hard time looking at Grandpa without seeing that.'"" The ""Hey Arnold!"" creator confirmed to HuffPost that the new film addresses the issue. ""I think if you look at the new model of Grandpa,"" he said, ""the design was always that he was just really lumpy. He had that kind of lump on top of his head, and he kind of had big ears that stuck out and big jutting cheek bones, and the big cleft in his chin. So I think when we redesigned him we made the lump on top of his head look a little bit less that way."" Behold, the new Grandpa Phil:

NickSplat and Nickelodeon

Also, you can forget about the days of thinking Arnold's shirt tails were actually a kilt.

""That was kind of a gag between me and the designers,"" Bartlett said of Arnold's look. ""Hey, maybe he's still kind of wearing the same shirt, but he's a little taller [in the new movie] and so now you can see more of his pants, so it's not as kilt-like."" The new Arnold:

Nickelodeon

Bartlett promises that all your lingering ""Hey Arnold!"" questions will be answered in the movie, but why wait? We wanted some answers now.

A lot of the original ""Hey Arnold!"" fans are adults now. I'm one of them. Is this new movie geared toward adults or kids? I didn't see this coming. Here we are, 15 years after the run, rebooting it. So we're in an interesting situation. We've got Nickelodeon. They're the company we're making it for and that we made it for in the first place, which really is aimed at kids 6 to 11 [...] The first 20 minutes of ""The Jungle Movie"" are really about laying that pipeline. ""Hey, in case you've never seen it before, here they are. Here are the relationships. Helga seems to hate him but secretly loves him. Gerald is his super loyal best friend, etc."" And, as you know, a huge part of the audience that's gonna watch are like you. They grew up with the show and now they're adults. I even think there's a third audience, the children of adults, and they're like, ""Hey, you gotta watch this 'Hey Arnold!' show. This was my favorite when I was growing up."" So that's really like three groups of people watching this show. I will say this movie very much has everything for these grownup super fans, because it checks every box. It covers all this. It's about answering all the questions. As far as the questions, does Arnold have a bald spot under his hat, or is that him parting his hair? He does remove the hat. It was funny. The first time he took his hat off was in Episode 3, ""Arnold's Hat,"" and it was really funny when he took it off. Man, there was a big empty spot where the hat goes, and it plays like a bald spot. When he takes the hat off in the ""Jungle Movie,"" it's not quite shown in that way. It's like we kind of have him at a little bit more flattering angle, but that's kind of a running joke that there's a bald spot where the hat goes. Oh, yeah, it's all about the angles. [Laughs] Yeah, totally. That's what's fun about cartoon making. It's how you choose to show something. You could show it or not.

Something else we want to know you're going to show (and I saw this teased a bit) ― but Pigeon Man is definitely in the ""Jungle"" movie? Yeah. As you may know, there was an internet rumor that he jumps off the building to commit suicide, and that was the most annoying internet rumor of all to me. Because, first of all, we would never. That is not the show at all. We would never have a story like that. What makes those rumors go is the idea that we wanted to do something dark and the network wouldn't let us. That stuff really makes me mad, because my relationship with Nickelodeon is way better than that. We wouldn't come up with that for a kids' show. That's a crazy idea. I think people enjoy the idea of, oh, it's forbidden, and we had to change it. I was there. We made the story that he hooks up the pigeons to his little harness thing and flies off. I always intended him to go to Paris. Ooohhh! He's basically living in Notre Dame taking care of pigeons in Paris. I was so annoyed about that rumor that I specifically put him in ""The Jungle Movie"" to know that he's alive and well and in Paris. That's awesome. The movie kind of has that quality, anyway. It sort of checks off all the boxes, and there are cameos by kind of everyone in that one specific scene. Basically, in the story they put together a video to win the contest to go to San Lorenzo, and so they basically go out and interview everyone that Arnold's ever helped, which is very meta. What? That's cool to bring everyone back. Yeah and very satisfying for the audience, too, because you kind of get to check in with everybody.

""The idea of mindhacking is understanding what your code is and how you can upgrade it.""
""So awareness is knowing where you are, but what you will see a lot is a lot of people who won't know where they want to go,"" Slawuta said.
""Even if they know where they are, they don't know where to go.
""Things don't work out in life.","If you don't hack your own mind, someone else will.

To hear Patrycja Slawuta put it, it's not too far-fetched to compare humans to computers. Both rely on central programs, both operate by way of their own technology, and both can be updated.

The NYC-based researcher and co-founder of Self Hackathon is in Australia to talk about 'mindhacking', a practice by which, she says, you can consciously exercise virtues such as self-awareness, self-confidence and self-compassion.

It's these three virtues, she argues, that are vital to hold onto in an age where there's so much digital noise, it's all too easy to function on autopilot. In fact, at a time when data is king and companies like Facebook know what we want before we do, Slawuta says if you don't hack your own mind, someone else will.

""So the idea is we are very fascinated by technology and carry technology with us, and every time our phone says we need an upgrade, we do that,"" Slawuta told HuffPost Australia.

""But there is a technology that is infinitely more important and complex and infinitely more rich and important for us to engage with, and that is the human technology.""

Human technology? Please explain.

""Similar to a computer code, we get programmed,"" Slawuta said. ""From early on, we get programmed. As children we learn 'this is what you do to get a reward, and if you do this you get punished'. And that's perfectly fine. I'd equate that to the factory settings on a phone, and then it's up to us to personalise it with certain apps and things going forward.

""The idea of mindhacking is understanding what your code is and how you can upgrade it.""

While the technology metaphor can get a little tired after a while, what Slawuta is talking about is essentially being able to disrupt our own rhythms for a better outcome. To get off the hamster wheel, so to speak.

""Research tells us that 70 to 90 percent of us run on autopilot,"" she told HuffPost Australia. ""It's the habits we form.

""Often, when you ask someone 'why do you do what you do?' their response will be 'just because'. Many people don't have the answer.

""Perhaps something happened 25 years ago and your response was the best solution at the time, but it hasn't changed since. You've kept running in the same mental loops.

""We have this entire world and human existence to explore but we run on those preset kind of paths. As I said before, research shows 70 - 90 percent of us are on autopilot. That's good if you are happy with that, but a lot of people aren't.""

How I understand confidence is the ability to consciously turn thoughts into actions. A lot of us have lofty ideas of where we would like to go but not the confidence to make it happen.

So what are the first steps to hacking your own mind?

""The first is self awareness. And awareness is just being aware of your code, of those mental loops you're stuck in,"" Slawuta said.

""It's about observing yourself and acknowledging where you're at. Jung said you can't leave a place unless you have visited it and many people aren't ready to really fully acknowledge where we are. After awareness comes acceptance, and after acceptance comes change.""

The second step relates to self confidence.

""So awareness is knowing where you are, but what you will see a lot is a lot of people who won't know where they want to go,"" Slawuta said. ""Even if they know where they are, they don't know where to go.

""So how I understand confidence is the ability to consciously turn thoughts into actions. A lot of us have lofty ideas of where we would like to go but not the confidence to make it happen.""

Self confidence is key.

Finally, Slawuta says it's vital to tap into a sense of compassion.

""Things don't work out in life. We think we want to change something and we f--k up on the way,"" she said.

""Self compassion is a bubble bath for the psyche. It's the skill to say 'this is the bubble bath for my mind.' We make mistakes, we say stupid things, people laugh at us. How do you forgive yourself? How do you have compassion to keep on going? That's why it's so important.""

While some may scoff at the idea of a 'bubble bath for the mind', Slawuta's main point has merit.

The digital marketplace is constantly amassing data so it can hack into the market of you.

To use Slawuta's words, ""It's using our biases to get more eyeballs, to repackage our attention, to sell us things that we don't need, to use social pressure to get us to do something.

""If you're not hacking yourself and programming yourself, somebody else will.""

Patrycja Slawuta will present with other global innovators and leaders at Creative innovation 2017 Asia Pacific taking place 13-15 November in Melbourne.

Vor seiner Hochzeit dachte er, er wisse schon alles über Sex

Erst nach und nach hat er gelernt, was guten Sex wirklich ausmacht

Ich bin 41 Jahre alt und schon seit fast zwei Jahrzehnten mit der gleichen, wunderschönen Frau verheiratet. Über die Jahre hinweg musste ich mich mit einigen Mythen und Irrtümern über Sex auseinandersetzen.

Die meisten dieser falschen Vorstellungen hatte ich schon, bevor ich verheiratet war und es hat Jahre gedauert, bis sie sich aufgelöst haben. Wenn ich zehn Tipps für guten Sex an mein unverheiratetes Ich schicken könnte, wären das diese:

1. Sex läuft nicht wie im Fernsehen oder in Filmen ab

Das meiste, was du über Sex weißt, kommt aus der Werbung, aus dem Fernsehen oder aus Filmen.

Anders ausgedrückt: Sex sieht aus wie spontanes, makelloses Liebemachen, voller Romantik - Marvin Gaye läuft und Kerzen sind auf dem Fensterbrett drapiert.

Sexuelle Intimität funktioniert in einer Ehe definitiv NICHT so. Im seltensten Fall läuft Marvin Gaye.

Aber sei nicht enttäuscht: Sex in der Ehe ist anders als im Film, aber es ist auch viel besser.

2. Eine Randnotiz zur Häufigkeit - bereite dich darauf vor

Im Moment denkst du noch, dass man in einer Ehe ständig Sex haben wird, so gut wie jede Sekunde am Tag und tausendmal in der Woche - denn, warum denn auch nicht!?

Lebe diesen Traum, so lange du kannst und reite dein getreues Einhorn in den Süßigkeiten-bedeckten Sonnenuntergang, wo du dann deinen wilden Ewok streicheln kannst und über die Brücke nach Terabithia gehst.

Glaub an deinen Traum. So lange du kannst. Das ist alles.

3. Sex ist wie ein guter Wein - er wird besser im Alter

Sexuelle Intimität ist etwas, in dem du immer besser werden wirst. Es braucht Kommunikation, Übung und Zeit.

Im Moment denkst du, dein Sex-IQ ist auf dem Level eines Genies, aber du würdest in einer Sex-Abschlussprüfung komplett versagen mit dem, was du weißt.

4. Sex ist nicht nur ""bekommen"", sondern auch ""geben""

Es ist tatsächlich schön, dem anderen etwas zu geben. Sei nicht die ganze Zeit über ein ""Nehmer"".

Sexuelle Intimität ist wunderbar, um Verzicht und Anstrengung zu vereinen. Wenn du das jetzt in deinen Kopf bekommst, wird das ""bekommen"" nur noch besser.

Im ""geben"" liegt eine unfassbare Schönheit und viele Geheimnisse. Sei großzügig.

5. Männer und Frauen denken nicht auf die gleiche Art über Sex

Für dich ist Sex körperliche Anziehung und es ist sehr visuell und augenblicklich.

Vielleicht ist es besser, wenn du dich jetzt erst mal setzt: Frauen empfinden Sex als Teil einer Beziehung, als Sicherheit und als Anzeichen, wie sehr sie geliebt und verlangt werden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Sex-Experten raten: Diese 9 Dinge solltet ihr mit eurem Partner viel öfter machen

Für dich ist Sex wie ein Lichtschalter ohne Dimmer. Du bist sowas von bereit, jederzeit (außer du schläfst... aber das muss dann schon eine Todesschlaf sein).

Für sie ist Sex wie ein Schmorbraten, der viel Zeit braucht, um zu köcheln.

Das wird euch beide sehr frustrieren. Aber das ist ok. Das bringt euch näher zusammen, auf einer viel tieferen Ebene.

6. Sex macht dein Leben nicht vollkommen

Momentan legst du wahnsinnig viel Wert auf Sex. Lass uns ehrlich sein: Du denkst ständig daran.

Du sollst wissen, sexuelle Intimität ist fantastisch und sehr befriedigend und unglaublich auf die schönsten Art und Weisen - aber es darf kein Götzenbild sein. Es ist ein Geschenk, das man in der Ehe genießen sollte.

7. Sex kann Spaß machen, lustig und verspielt sein

Es gibt so viele Blickwinkel, was sexuelle Intimität betrifft und die meisten davon sind dir jetzt noch nicht bewusst. Du denkst zu eindimensional über Sex.

Sexuelle Intimität ist auch Verletzlichkeit und Authentizität und wenn du jemanden wirklich liebst, hast du nichts zu verstecken - und ich meine wirklich nichts.

Du kannst dein ehrlichstes Ich sein.

8. Sie zu verführen ist wie eine legale Sexdroge für ihre Seele

Ich habe es vorhin schon angedeutet, aber das ist wahrscheinlich das beste Geheimnis, dass ich dir mit auf den Weg geben kann: Verführe sie.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Diese Paare haben mit dem Sex bis zur Hochzeit gewartet - jetzt verraten sie, ob es sich gelohnt hat

Zeig ihr, dass du sie nicht nur körperlich willst. Verführe ihren Geist. Verführe ihr Herz. Verführe sie auf jede mögliche Weise.

Denk daran, sie denkt nicht so an Sex, wie du es tust - du bist Haut und Haar und sie ist Herz und Seele.

9. Es ist geheimnisvoller als du denkst

Und noch mal: Gerade sind deine Ansichten über Sex ziemlich simpel.

Es ist schwer zu erklären und ich verstehe es auch heute noch nicht so ganz, aber es passiert etwas Magisches, wenn zwei Menschen Sex haben. Es ist etwas fast Kosmisches, das zwei Seelen aneinander bindet,

10. Sex in der Ehe ist eine Art der Verehrung

Wenn ich sage Sex ist Verehrung, denkst du wahrscheinlich, ich bin verrückt. Aber es ist wahr.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 8 Angewohnheiten von Paaren, die ein erfülltes Sexleben haben

Der Akt ist eine Art der Verehrung, schlicht und einfach. Es ist wie alte Lieder singen, nur mit Körpern. Okay, das hat sich jetzt unheimlich angehört. Lass es uns einfach Verehrung nennen.

Ich hoffe wirklich, dass du dir diese Gedanken zu Herzen nimmst. Denn letzten Endes ist Sex in der Ehe noch viel schöner, als du es dir vorstellen kannst.

The iPhone X comes in two new finishes -- space grey and silver and starts at $1,579.","It turns out people do not like surprises. At the same time Apple announced they would be releasing the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus back in September they also revealed the iPhone X (roman numeral for 10) would be following shortly after, and it went on sale in Australia last week.

The first question everyone had (besides if you're meant to say X or 10 -- the answer is 10 by the way) is 'why did they skip 9?' Simple -- it's the 10 year anniversary of when the first iPhone was unveiled.

One of the first changes you'll notice is the removal of the Home button. In its place is a simple swipe up motion -- it seems odd at first but takes you about half a day to get used to. From there you forget a Home button ever existed.

The removal of the Home button means that the display now takes up pretty much the phone screen.

The removal of the home button meant that Apple were able to design a screen to go all the way to the edges, so while the actual device itself is smaller than the 8 Plus, the screen is is bigger than the 8 Plus display.

No Home button also means there's new ways to do a few of your favourite commands. Press and hold the button on the right side for Siri, quickly press and release the right side and volume up button to screenshot, and press and hold the right side button and either volume button to turn the phone off.

You'll also notice pretty much right away that the handset is heavier. Not by much and not in an annoying way -- more so in that it feels like a more premium product. That's thanks to the surgical-grade stainless steel it's made from. It's also coated in the most durable glass ever on a smartphone.

Face ID is one of the coolest new technologies featured in the phone. Unlocking your device with your face is now an option in addition to a fingerprint or passcode. The Apple team worked for a couple of years to perfect it so as to protect your privacy -- you're unable to unlock it with a photo, a mask or if someone is sleeping.

It's also safer than the fingerprint -- the probability that a random person could unlock it using Face ID is approximately one in 1,000,000, versus one in 50,000 for Touch ID. The technology is able to recognise your face from heaps of angles and up to an arms length away from your head, meaning many times you'll pick up your phone and it'll unlock without having to hold it directly up to your face -- you'll barely notice it's even happening.

Setting up Face ID is easy. It scans your face while you draw an imaginary circle with your nose in the air a few times and you're ready to go.

Face ID is smart enough to know if you're around people or by yourself. It'll show you iMessage, Messenger and email previews if you're the one near it but will hide the previews if anyone else looks at your handset. That means no one can sneakily read your stuff.

Where Face ID gets really fun, though, is the new Animojis. The TrueDepth reverse camera analyzes over 50 different different facial muscle movements and turns them into one of 12 animated emojis, including a cat, dog, robot, unicorn or pig. You can then text the clip to anyone in iMessage.

Arguably the best new feature. It's definitely the most fun, anyway.

Here's what it looks like in action:

Speaking of the TrueDepth reverse camera, your selfie game is at its best with iPhone X. Portrait Mode and Portrait Lighting (in Beta phase) is now available on the front facing camera which means better quality selfies than ever before -- the photos look like they were taken on a professional camera.

Video has had a bunch of improvements, too -- it has the best video capture quality ever in a smartphone and shoots 4K video at 60 frames per second. The handset boasts the same wireless charging as the 8 and 8 plus and it's water, splashes and dust resistant.

Gary Younge, editor-at-large for The Guardian, interviewed Spencer for “Angry, White And American,” a documentary airing Thursday night on the British network Channel 4.

In the clip below, Younge makes no secret that he is conflicted about interviewing the white supremacist, and considers the term “alt-right” to be just “a new word for fascism.”

However, he chose to talk with Spencer as Spencer and people like him “credit themselves with providing the intellectual underpinnings for the Trump revolution.”

Younge interviewed Spencer in Mississippi in a car park, surrounded by what he described in an article for the Guardian as “an entourage of adoring bigots.”

Spencer, who appeared surprised to discover his interviewer was a black man, attempted to justify why “Africans have benefited from their experience with white supremacy.”

Spoiler alert: He didn’t come across well.

Younge: “So slavery was good for them?”

Spencer: “Look, they benefited from being in a different nation than their own. No doubt. How can you deny that.”

Younge: “It’s such a ridiculous notion that people forcibly removed from their homes and taken to this country to work for nothing for a couple of centuries ― and that benefited them?”

The topic later turned to Trump, who Spencer said didn’t share his “ideal of the ethno-state” but did “feel some sense of loss that we are losing our nations, here in the United States, in Britain [and] across the world.”

Younge did not agree, saying, “I’m not losing my nation. I’m British.”

Spencer than tried to shade the truth by claiming, “Of course you’re not losing your nation because you’re winning the demographic battle.”

“Why am I winning?” Younge said. “I’m living in the place of my birth. Just like you.”

Spencer smirked. “But that’s not really your home.”

Younge replied, “You don’t get to tell me where my home is.”

Spencer pushed more. “But you know it’s not your real home. ... Your ancestors didn’t build it.”

“Sorry! Listen, my ancestors built it tenfold ― and weren’t paid for it!” Younge said.

Spencer then argued that Younge’s argument was “like saying African-Americans built the United States.”

“They did!” Younge snapped back. “They literally built the White House.”

“Because we made them,” Spencer retorted.

Younge asked Spencer, “And you’re proud of that?”

Spencer conceded that slavery had bad consequences, “but, the fact is, yes, I am ultimately proud of it. I’m proud of slavery.”

With the first Ashes Test between Australia and England just over two weeks away, Starc finished the match for NSW with bowling figures of 4-56 and 3-41 next to his name following Western Australia's two innings.

And if that isn't enough to get the likes of England's batting stars in Alastair Cook and Joe Root just a little bit nervous, they're probably not watching closely enough.

Starc is easily Australia's best pace bowler at the moment and with a Test series as important as the Ashes on the very-near horizon, his impressive bowling form is sure to be seen as a saving grace of sorts for a national cricket team that needs nothing more right now than results on the pitch.

An England based coffee shop called 'Melbourne in Lichfield' is another cafe that has been experimenting with these glitter-topped drinks. They've been using gold glitter to jazz-up everything from their cappuccinos to their turmeric lattes. They're even offering free pony rides with every purchase of a glitter coffee.

Japón es, por supuesto, la capital de sushi del mundo. Pero durante su almuerzo de negocios con el primer ministro japonés el domingo, Trump optó por una hamburguesa al clásico estilo estadounidense, de acuerdo con Eater.

""¡Le damos la más sincera bienvenida al presidente Trump en su visita a Japón!"", escribió el primer ministro Shinzo Abe en su cuenta de Twitter. ""Entraremos en temas de negocios al tiempo que disfrutamos unas hamburguesas.

Más tarde esa noche, Trump y Abe cenaron con sus esposas en Ginza Ukai-Tei, un lugar de teppanyaki popular.

(Los sundaes de chocolate no parecen ser parte de las ofertas de postre típicas del restaurante, según sus fotos de Yelp). Trump tiene un amor documentado por las hamburguesas y los filetes, especialmente del tipo bien hecho. Su gira de comida japonesa contrasta con el viaje de Obama al país asiático en 2014, durante el cual él y Abe comieron en uno de los mejores restaurantes de sushi del mundo.

Mach dir klar, dass es Zeit brauchen wird, es zu schaffen - aber du schaffst das!","""Phubbing"" heißt, dass wir jemanden wegen unseres Handys ignorieren

Viele von uns haben wahrscheinlich selbst schon mal ""gephubbed""

Im Video seht ihr, welche anderen Anzeichen es für eine scheiternde Beziehung gibt

Ein Date kann fast schon nicht mehr deprimierender werden als dieses: Eine Klientin der Eheberaterin Christine Wilke war so sehr in ihr Handy vertieft, dass sie nicht mal bemerkt hatte, dass das Date vorbei war.

“Sie hatte ein ernsthaftes Problem mit ihrem Smartphone und hat es nach diesem Essen mit ihrem Freund bemerkt”, sagt die Therapeutin aus Pennsylvania.

“Meine Klientin war in ihrem Bildschirm versunken und als sie aufsah, hatte ihr Partner schon längst bezahlt und wartete an der Tür auf sie.”

Diese Frau hat ganz extremes “phubbing” betrieben - ihren Partner ignoriert und nur ihrem Handy die Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt.

Das Wort “phubbing” setzt sich aus den englischen Wörtern “phone”, also Handy, und “snubbing”, jemanden oder etwas ignorieren, zusammen.

Und dieses Verhalten scheint sich immer mehr zu verbreiten und sich in unser Leben einzuschleichen - vor allem in Beziehungen.

Wenn der Partner eine Affäre mit dem Handy hat

In einer neuen Studie der Baylor Universität wurden 143 Paare gefragt, wie oft ihre Interaktionen mit ihrem Partner durch ihr Handy unterbrochen wurde.

70 Prozent gaben “manchmal”, “oft”, “sehr oft” oder “ständig” an.

In einer weiterführenden Umfrage mit 145 Menschen gaben 22,6 Prozent an, dass “phubbing” in ihrer Beziehung zu Streit geführt habe. 36,6 Prozent gaben an, dass sie sich deprimiert fühlen, wenn sie das Gefühl haben, dass ihr Partner ihr Handy über sie stellt.

Wilkes bekommt dieses frustrierende Schauspiel die ganze Zeit in ihrer Praxis zu sehen. “Die Paare, die zu mir kommen, haben ein starkes Verlangen, eine starke Verbindung zueinander aufzubauen oder sie zu vertiefen - aber ihre Handys haben ihr Leben übernommen”, erklärt die Therapeutin.

“Oft erzählen sie mir dann, dass es sich anfühlt, als hätte ihr Partner eine Affäre mit dem Smartphone.” Eine Beziehung vor einem Bildschirm zu führen, ist zweifellos keine Art und Weise zu leben.

Wilkes und andere Eheberater und Therapeuten geben deshalb ihre besten Ratschläge, wie ihr eurer “phubbing” in den Griff bekommen könnt:

1. Hört auf zu denken, dass ihr euer komplettes Date auf Snapchat und Instagram teilen müsst

“Eine Sache fasziniert mich immer wieder (als Therapeut macht sie mich allerdings eher traurig): Ein Paar geht zusammen aus, aber eine Person ist ständig damit beschäftigt, Bilder zu teilen, anstatt dem anderen Aufmerksamkeit zu schenken.

Social Media hat viele Vorteile, aber es kann auch dazu führen, dass die Menschen sofortige Bestätigung suchen, anstatt einfach mit dem Moment zufrieden zu sein, in dem sie sich gerade befinden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Liebe Konzertfans, packt endlich eure verdammten Smartphones weg!

Wenn du auch einer der Übeltäter von “Schau mich an!”-Postings bist, anstatt die gemeinsame Zeit mit deinem Partner zu genießen, solltest du dich bemühen, Disziplin zu lernen.

Hör auf, so besessen von Likes zu sein. Das heißt natürlich nicht, dass du kein süßes Selfie von euch posten kannst.

Aber halte dich einfach mit dem Posten zurück, bis das Date vorbei ist - oder, wenn es sein muss, warte, bis dein Partner auf die Toilette verschwindet. ― Carin Goldstein, Eheberaterin und Familientherapeutin aus Sherman Oaks, Kalifornien

2. Lass dein Handy mal für 30 Minuten am Tag liegen

“Eine der Aufgaben, die ich meinen Paaren mitgebe, ist eine 30-minütige “Elektronik-freie-Zone” zu schaffen - jeden Tag.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Digitalisierung - Fluch und Segen zugleich

In dieser Zeit können sie wertvolle gemeinsame Zeit verbringen, ohne gestört oder abgelenkt zu werden. Diese 30 Minuten werden über die Zeit hinweg länger, denn es wirkt wie eine Pause, die die Paare sehr schätzen.” ― Christine Wilke

3. Bring dein technisches Time Out aufs nächste Level: Handy-Freier Wochenend-Trip

“Ich arbeitete mit einem Pärchen, das über ein Wochenende nach Palm Springs vereisen wollte. Gemeinsam haben wir ein paar Regeln erstellt, was die Elektronik betrifft: Die Handys müssen das ganze Wochenende aus bleiben und in ihren Koffern bleiben.

Jeder darf sein Handy einmal am Tag für fünf Minuten an machen - das ist genug Zeit um kurz seine Nachrichten zu checken und sicher zu gehen, dass einen zu Hause kein Weltuntergang erwartet.

Als das Wochenende vorbei war, schwärmten sie davon, wie viel mehr sie die kleinen Dinge schätzen gelernt haben, der erfrischende Pool, gemeinsam lachen und tiefe, verbundene Intimität.” ― Spencer Scott, Psychologe aus Santa Monica, California



4. Wenn sich dein Partner “gephubbed” fühlt, erkenne es an und höre auf damit

“Ihr solltet ausmachen, dass ihr es euch gegenseitig sagt, wenn ihr euch “gephubbed” fühlt oder einen “phubbing”-Rückfall habt.

Wir verlieren uns alle gerne mal in den Tiefen des Bildschirms, es kann also schnell passieren, dass wir es gar nicht bemerken, dass wir es schon wieder machen.

Es ist wichtig seinem Partner zuzuhören und sein Smartphone zur Seite zu legen, wenn der andere das Gefühlt hat, dass du “phubbst” - das ist ein wichtiger Schritt in die richtige Richtung für eine gesunde Beziehung.” ― Kristin Zeising, Psychologin aus San Diego, Kalifornien



5. Dein Smartphone ist nicht dein Gegner

“Das mag gegen die eigene Intuition sein, aber wenn du das Verlangen nach Zeit und Aufmerksamkeit hast, versuche nicht zu denken, dass dein Handy das Problem ist - sondern sieh es als einen Teil der Lösung an.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Dieses lustige Video macht auf die Gefahren von Smartphones aufmerksam - und es hat eine wichtige Botschaft

Fürsorgliche Nachrichten über den Tag verteilt, oder Snapchats, die nur zwei Sekunden dauern, können eine schöne Erinnerung daran sein, dass du und dein Partner über den Tag hinweg aneinander denkt. Es hilft vielleicht auch, sich so weniger isoliert und gereizt zu fühlen.” ― Spencer Scott

6. Mach dir klar, dass es nicht so einfach sein wird, dein Handy wegzulegen

“Es ist ein Suchtverhalten - es ist nicht so einfach, damit aufzuhören. Mach dir klar, dass es Zeit brauchen wird, es zu schaffen - aber du schaffst das! Am Anfang wirst du noch eine sogenannte kognitive Dissonanz spüren.

Deine Gewohnheit, wie du dein Handy benutzt, zu unterbrechen wird sich falsch für dich anfühlen.

Es wird ungefähr einen Monat dauern, bis sich die neue Gewohnheit - deinen Liebsten, Freunden und Familie Aufmerksamkeit in Person zu geben und nicht über dein Handy - natürlich anfühlt.

Aber vertrau mir: das wird es wert sein.” ― Barbara Melton, Beraterin aus Charleston, South Carolina

The pillows, by interiors brand Jonathan Adler, come in three styles: Xanax (sometimes prescribed for anxiety), Prozax (a common antidepressant) and Quaalude (an illegal sedative).

A range of cushions replicating medication used to treat depression and anxiety have divided mental health campaigners.

The pillows reportedly first sparked a backlash on Instagram after a photo of them was shared by the official Jonathan Adler account.

According to Metro.co.uk, some commenting claimed the cushions were made in “poor taste” while others thought they were “funny and irreverent”.

The Instagram post has since been deleted, but the cushions remain available to purchase online.

“Perk up your sofa with the right pharmaceuticals,” the product description reads.

“Our Prozac Needlepoint Pillow brings our affair with all things medicinal to your pillowscape. Take just one, or follow our professional recommendation to mix the whole assortment.”

Commenting on the mixed reception the products have received, Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity SANE, said the pillows could normalise mental ill health.

“While some people may take offence at these cushions, we do not wish to criticise Jonathan Adler, or to demand their withdrawal from sale,” she told HuffPost UK.

“If there is no intention to cause offence we don’t think it is helpful to be too prescriptive, as it risks creating a climate in which people may be frightened from talking about mental health at all.

“And if we are constantly treading on egg-shells, how can we make mental health an accepted part of everyone’s life?”

But Craig Butler, a mental health campaigner who has previously written about his own experiences of depression, disagrees.

“I’m not a big fan of these,” he told HuffPost UK.

“I’m all for trying to making light of serious issues as it’s important, but this is at a point where society is just establishing mental health as a credible and major issue and my personal opinion is that this jeopardises that.

“I think things like this just turn a serious issue into a gimmick - it feels cheap to me and I don’t think turning mental health into a novelty is helpful.”

It seems the jury is well and truly out on this one. What do you think of the pillows? Tweet us at @huffpolifestyle to tell us your thoughts.

Von Januar bis Dezember räkelt sich eine andere Traumfrau auf der Motorhaube, als hätte sie nicht verstanden, wie sie anders in den Innenraum des Autos gelangen soll. Frauen werden seit der Erfindung des Rades des völligen Unverständnisses für die Männerträume auf vier Reifen verdächtigt. Wohl kaum ein anderes Klischee hat es in der Popkultur derart weit gebracht und wird so häufig in Büchern, Filmen und augenrollenden Gesprächen thematisiert. Dass Frauen durchaus etwas mit Autos anfangen können und was an den größten Mythen dran ist, zeigt unser Vorurteilscheck in Zusammenarbeit mit der Allianz.

Mythos 1: Tücke der Parklücke – Frauen können nicht einparken

Es ist der Klassiker der Klischees: Frauen können ohne lastergroße Lücken und unendliche Weiten zum mehrzügigen Rangieren einfach nicht einparken. Der Mythos mangelnder weiblicher Parkkünste hält sich hartnäckig, dabei erheben sich aus Studien protestierende Gegenstimmen. So zeigten beispielsweise Untersuchungen der Ruhr-Universität Bochum, dass vor allem das negative Selbstbild der Fahrerinnen zu schlechten Parkergebnissen führe. Andere Studien beschäftigten sich mit dem sozialpsychologischen Phänomen der „Bedrohung durch Stereotypen“. Die Tatsache, dass Frauen sich am Steuer ständig mit dem Vorurteil vermeintlicher Parkunfähigkeit konfrontiert sehen, verunsichert und schafft Misstrauen gegenüber den eigenen Fahrkünsten. Ein britischer Parkplatz-Betreiber will sogar herausgefunden haben, dass sich Männer einfach schneller mit ihrer Parkleistung zufriedengeben. Frauen hingegen strebten nach Perfektion und bräuchten dementsprechend länger. Die Mutter aller Mythen fußt somit auf vorurteilsbedingtem Mangel an Selbstbewusstsein bei Frauen und der unbescheidenen männlichen Begeisterung über die eigenen Parkfertigkeiten. Als Gegenmittel empfehlen wie den Damen an dieser Stelle, nie müde zu werden, süffisant grinsende Fahrer auf ihr schief geparktes Auto hinzuweisen.

Mythos 2: Spaß am Gas – Frauen kennen keine Fahrfreude

Während der Gedanke an Pferdestärken männliches Blut zur Wallung bringt, können Frauen darüber nun wirklich nicht jubilieren. Bei diesem Vorurteil scheint die Zeit irgendwann in den 1950er Jahren stehengeblieben zu sein. Das Klischee, der unmotivierte Fahrer vor dem eigenen Auto müsse ein Opa mit Hut oder eine Frau sein, kann relativ leicht ausgehebelt werden. Eine Umfrage des Autobauers Ford ergab Anfang des Jahres beispielsweise, dass Männer und Frauen bei der Fahrt eines schnittigen Sportwagens den gleichen Fahrspaß empfinden. Die Emanzipation ist längst am Gas-Pedal angekommen und so genießen auch Fahrerinnen den Sprint über die Straße. Zwar sind die Männer in Flensburg punktemäßig stärker vertreten, allerdings ist das häufigste Vergehen unter weiblichen Punktesünderinnen die zu schnelle Fahrt. Doch wehe dem, der da jetzt den Finger hebt und auf ein erhöhtes Unfallpotenzial verweist. Die Verkehrsunfallszahlen des Statistischen Bundeamtes beweisen regelmäßig, dass Frauen weniger unfallanfällig sind als Männer. Eine gute Kfz-Versicherung ist hingegen geschlechtsunabhängig der Garant für Fahrspaß mit sicherem Gefühl. Die Allianz bietet dazu individuellen Schutz für jeden Fahrer – und jede Fahrerin.

Mythos 3: Porsche statt Püppchen – Mädchen spielen nicht mit Autos

Wie viel neidisches Gebrüll mag es unter Weihnachtsbäumen schon gegeben haben, wie viele tränennasse Puppenkleidchen angesichts von vier Kubikmetern Lego und den Rennstrecken großer Brüder. Doch da lässt sich leider nichts machen, denn Barbie und Co. sind die idealen Spielsachen für Mädchen. Dass dieser Mythos eher von klassischen Rollenbildern als kindlichen Neigungen am Leben gehalten wird, zeigen verschiedene Erhebungen. Dem Bundesverband des Spielwareneinzelhandels zufolge gibt es immer mehr Mädchen, die lieber mit Autos spielen. Studien zufolge fördere der Rollentausch von Miniatur-Schönheitssalon und Rennbahn die kognitive und emotionale Entwicklung. Gewisse Vorlieben lassen sich natürlich nicht absprechen, doch freuen sich auch die meisten Prinzessinnen über Rennautos. Ein Experiment der französischen Supermarktkette Les Magasins U kommt zu einem ganz ähnlichen Ergebnis. Kaum waren Jungs und Mädchen mit der vollen Bandbreite von Auto bis Zauber-Barbie allein, griffen kleine Superhelden zu Puppen, Mädchen nach Bohrmaschinen und Bentleys.

Mythos 4: Wo bin ich? Frauen haben keinen Orientierungssinn

Wenn es einen Zusammenhang gibt, über den sich Wissenschaftler nicht einigen können, dann ist es der zwischen Geschlecht und Orientierungssinn. Den Wissenschaftlern der Norwegian University of Science and Technology zufolge sind Männer dank des Testosterons und der Orientierung an Himmelsrichtungen im Orientierungsvorteil. Frauen orientierten sich eher an festen Wegpunkten. Zwei Wissenschaftlerinnen der University of Edinburgh zufolge bietet dieser Umstand jedoch auch Vorteile. Zwar hätten Frauen ein schlechteres Gedächtnis für räumliche Anordnungen, doch gewährt die Navigation nach optischen Fixpunkten in mancher Umgebung bessere Auskunft. Dass sich Männer und Frauen unterschiedlich orientieren, setzt sich übrigens auch bei Ahnungslosigkeit fort. Eine Studie des Instituts Fly Research belegte die männliche Unbelehrbarkeit. Demnach nimmt jeder Vierte eine halbstündige Irrfahrt mit ungeahntem Ausgang in Kauf, bevor er nach dem Weg fragt.

Mythos 5: Fluchen und Funkeln – Männer donnern, Frauen dekorieren

Müssten Eigenschaften wie das Anschreien anderer Autofahrer oder Faustschwenken vor dem Abbiegen einem Geschlecht zugeordnet werden – die meisten würden auf die Männerwelt tippen. Doch eine Studie der Scout24-Gruppe wies nicht nur die Deutschen als Fluch-Europameister aus, sondern krönte zudem die Frauen zum fluchenden Geschlecht, das deinem Ärger lautstark Luft macht. Da wir schon einmal beim Thema Luft sind, ein dekoratives Vorurteil ist nicht ganz von der Hand zu weisen. Ob Duftbäume mit Käsekuchen-Aroma, Kinderschühchen und Einhörner, die es zur 50 Liter Tankfüllung gratis dazu gab: Frauen stehen im Verdacht, ihren Rückspiegel als eine Art Hort für jegliches Sammelsurium zu nutzen. Das Resultat: Beim Fahren schwankt und funkelt allerhand am Rückspiegel und irritiert weit über die Grenzen des eigenen Autos hinaus. Beim Blick in manches Auto fällt es schwer, diesen Mythos auszuhebeln.

Alles andere als mythisch: Gut versichert mit der Allianz

Frauen beweisen Freude am Fahren, parken fluchend doch perfekt ein und beschäftigen sich durchaus mit ihren Autos. Doch für jeden Fahrer und jede Fahrerin gilt: Nur mit einer guten Kfz-Versicherung fährt es sich auf Nummer sicher. Die Kfz-Versicherung der Allianz ist als zuverlässiger Partner immer mit am Steuer. Trotz günstiger Tarife setzt der Versicherer vor allem auf ein umfangreiches Service- und Leistungsangebot.

Trump, spectre déformé de l'Amérique de Bush?

En réalité, les récents propos de Donald Trump s'inscrivent dans la droite ligne de ses outrances de campagne, notamment lorsqu'il se déclarait, dès février 2016, imprudemment favorable à la torture: ""Bien sûr, le waterboarding [la simulation de noyade], c'est mal. Mais c'est moins grave que de couper des têtes, les gars. Au Moyen-Orient, ils nous coupent la tête. (...) Et ne me dites pas que ça ne marche pas. La torture fonctionne, les gars, d'accord? Croyez-moi, ça marche"". Dès l'entame de sa course imprévisible, qui l'a finalement porté jusqu'à la Maison blanche, Trump n'a eu de cesse de réactiver le lexique des premières heures de la guerre contre le terrorisme: détention indéfinie des combattants terroristes ""illégaux"" à Guantanamo, justification de la torture, pouvoirs exponentiels du Président en situation de guerre. Il se démarquait nettement de la politique impulsée par Barack Obama, lequel avait soigneusement opté pour l'intensification du programme des drones et des assassinats ciblés, à la fois moins visibles et moins impopulaires que la détention sur l'île cubaine, à proximité du sol états-unien. Trump, lui, affiche une volonté ostensible de bander les muscles contre le péril terroriste. Pour l'actuel locataire de la Maison blanche, il n'est plus question de fermer Guantanamo – une promesse de campagne qu'Obama n'a jamais pu tenir – mais au contraire de s'appuyer sur l'arsenal juridique développé par l'administration républicaine au lendemain du 11-Septembre. En somme, aux yeux de maints observateurs, notamment français, Trump apparaît comme le spectre déformé de l'Amérique de George W. Bush: il renoue sans retenue ni précautions oratoires avec les discours martiaux – la tonalité évangéliste en moins – qui ont succédé aux attentats de 2001.

Un dévoiement de la guerre contre le terrorisme version Bush

Pourtant, nombreux sont les membres emblématiques de l'administration républicaine à avoir précautionneusement pris leur distance avec le nouveau Président. Surtout, les plus fervents défenseurs de la politique musclée élaborée par le gouvernement Bush ont fréquemment critiqué les prises de position intempestives de Donald Trump, considérant qu'il dévoyait l'esprit et la raison d'être de certains des dispositifs adoptés après les attentats de 2001. John Yoo, membre éminent du ministère de la Justice entre 2001 et 2003 et théoricien juridique du programme des interrogatoires coercitifs à Guantanamo, est ainsi venu prendre le contre-pied du chef de l'exécutif à la suite de l'attentat récent de Manhattan. Intervenant sur le plateau de CNN le lendemain de l'attaque, l'ancien juriste de l'administration Bush a affirmé qu'un transfert de Sayfullo Saipov à Guantanamo serait contre-productif et contraire à l'essence même du centre de détention. Radicalisé sur le territoire des États-Unis, il ne semble pas appartenir à un réseau ou à une cellule terroriste spécifique, au vu des premiers rapports. Il n'apparaît donc pas comme dépositaire d'une information capitale pour la sécurité nationale. En d'autres termes, rien ne justifie qu'il relève d'une juridiction militaire et soit mis à l'écart à Guantanamo. Ce site est conçu pour n'accueillir que les leaders terroristes susceptibles de détenir des renseignements vitaux pour la sécurité des citoyens ou des forces armées, et non pas les individus isolés ayant succombé à la propagande islamiste. Ainsi, opter pour Guantanamo dans un cas comme celui-ci serait tout bonnement contraire à la raison d'être originelle du centre de détention tel qu'il a été échafaudé en réponse aux attaques de 2001. Ce faisant, le ""père"" des interrogatoires coercitifs et de la torture, symbole des ""années noires"" de l'administration Bush, en vient à désavouer publiquement celui qui prétend renouer avec la politique musclée post 11-Septembre. Un paradoxe qui illustre parfaitement l'isolement de Trump et l'incompréhension que suscitent ses saillies verbales, y compris aux yeux des plus fervents supporters d'une politique antiterroriste dure et sans compromis.

L'Amérique aux prises avec le terrorisme ""low cost""

Par-delà ses sorties sur Guantanamo ou la peine capitale, Donald Trump a suscité l'ire du monde entier en qualifiant l'assaillant de New York d'""animal"" et de ""personne malade et déséquilibrée"". Cependant, à y regarder de plus près, et en mettant de côté le caractère impulsif des tweets dont Donald Trump est coutumier, deux observations s'imposent. En refusant dans un premier temps de parler de terrorisme islamiste, Trump ne fait finalement qu'adopter un argumentaire largement répandu dans les classes politiques européennes, notamment françaises: combien de fois a-t-on entendu répéter que le terrorisme n'était affaire que de ""barbares"" ou de ""déséquilibrés"", en évitant soigneusement de pointer du doigt l'islamisme radical, désormais ancré au cœur de certains territoires? N'a-t-on pas récemment encore lié terrorisme et psychiatrie, persuadé qu'un suivi médical spécifique suffirait à endiguer la multiplication des passages à l'acte? Il faut également juger les propos de Trump à l'aune des États-Unis, un pays qui reste traumatisé par les 3000 morts du 11-Septembre et le souvenir de cette journée tragique qui fit basculer l'Occident dans le XXIème siècle. Surtout, n'oublions pas que les États-Unis, avec l'attentat à la camionnette de Manhattan, font aujourd'hui connaissance avec un terrorisme ""low cost"" (armes blanches, camions béliers, etc) auquel une partie de l'Europe s'est désormais tristement habituée. Si les attentats de 2001 étaient une démonstration de force de la part d'Al Qaeda, celui de Manhattan est la preuve, après les multiples attaques qui ont ensanglanté l'Europe, de l'enracinement d'une menace qui contamine peu à peu l'ensemble des pays occidentaux. L'Amérique découvre avec effroi l'existence d'un ennemi intérieur. La maladresse verbale de Trump n'en est pas plus excusable, mais elle témoigne probablement de la stupéfaction et de l'hébétude qui, il n'y a pas si longtemps encore, saisissaient la France.

PASCO COUNTY, United States — Former star pitcher Roy Halladay, a Cy Young Award winner and face of the Blue Jays franchise for most of the 2000s, died Tuesday when his private plane crashed in the Gulf of Mexico. He was 40.

""He was the bright light,"" said former Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash. ""He was the guy that everybody pointed to as being the star of the Blue Jays and rightly so.""

Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said during a news conference that Halladay's Icon A5 went down around noon off the coast of Florida. The sheriff's office marine unit responded and found Halladay's body in shallow water near some mangroves. No survivors were found.

Police said they couldn't confirm if there were additional passengers on the plane or say where it was headed. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.

""Many of you know Roy as a Cy Young winner, future Hall of Famer, one of the best pitchers ever to pitch the game of baseball,"" said Nocco, who personally knew Halladay. ""We know Roy as a person, as a caring husband who loved his wife, Brandy. He loved his two boys tremendously ... and we are so sad for your loss.""

Halladay, who retired after the 2013 season, was an amateur pilot who often posted on social media about small planes.

""I have dreamed about owning a A5 since I retired! Real life is better then my dreams!!"" Halladay tweeted on Oct. 13.

He was probably one of the most humble human beings you'll ever meet.

Halladay won his first Cy Young Award with the Blue Jays in 2003 and took the National League honour in 2010 with the Philadelphia Phillies, the season he threw the 20th perfect game in MLB history.

""The Toronto Blue Jays organization is overcome by grief with the tragic loss of one of the franchise's greatest and most respected players, but even better human being,"" the Blue Jays said in a statement. ""It is impossible to express what he has meant to this franchise, the city and its fans.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.""

Nocco said Halladay knew many members in the sheriff's office, and that Halladay was even a part of a charity fishing tournament last Friday.

""He was probably one of the most humble human beings you'll ever meet,"" Nocco said. ""For somebody who won two Cy Youngs, one of the greatest pitchers in baseball, he would walk in the room as if he was anybody. Didn't matter who he met, he was kind, generous. His family purchased a dog for us — K-9 Doc. K-9 Doc is out there working, saving lives, making our community safer.""

The dog was named as a nod to Halladay's nickname — Doc.

""He was one in a million,"" Nocco said. ""It is a true loss for us.""

Halladay was an old-style workhorse who pitched 67 complete games and 20 shutouts. He was a three-time 20-game winner.

""All of us at Baseball are shocked and deeply saddened by the tragic passing of former Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Roy Halladay,"" said commissioner Rob Manfred. ""A well-respected figure throughout the game, Roy was a fierce competitor during his 16-year career, which included eight all-star selections, two Cy Young Awards, a perfect game and a post-season no-hitter.

""On behalf of Major League Baseball, I extend my deepest condolences to his family, including his wife, Brandy, and two sons, Ryan and Braden, his friends and countless fans, as well as the Blue Jays and Phillies organizations.""

Halladay, a native of Denver, Colo., was selected by the Blue Jays in the first round (No. 17 overall) of the 1995 MLB Amateur Draft.

The six-foot-six 225-pound right-hander made his big-league debut with Toronto in 1998 and he became a regular the following season. He had a few stints in the minor leagues before breaking out in 2002 with a 19-7 record and 2.93 earned-run average over 239 1/3 innings.

He was one in a million.

In his AL Cy Young season, Halladay went 22-7 with a 3.25 ERA and nine complete games over 266 innings.

Halladay was dealt to Philadelphia in December 2009 and took the NL Cy Young the next year after going 21-10 with a 2.44 ERA and nine complete games. He spent four seasons in Philadelphia before retiring.

""We are numb over the very tragic news about Roy Halladay's untimely death,"" the Phillies said in a statement. ""There are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game. It is with the heaviest of hearts that we pass along our condolences to Brandy, Ryan and Braden.""

On Oct. 6, 2010, working against Cincinnati in the NL Division Series, Halladay became only the second pitcher to throw a post-season no-hitter, joining Don Larsen, who accomplished the feat for the New York Yankees in the 1956 World Series.

'Heart is broken': former teammate

Halladay retired in 2013, saying he wanted to avoid back surgery.

""As a baseball player, you realize that's something you can't do the rest of your life,"" Halladay said. ""I really don't have any regrets. You realize there's other things for you to accomplish in life.""

Halladay was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame last June. He's eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown in 2019.

""Heart is broken to hear about Roy Halladay,"" former teammate Roy Oswalt tweeted. ""great friend, teammate, father and husband. One of the best teammates ever! You will be missed!""

Former pitcher Dan Haren tweeted that ""I wanted to be Roy Halladay. I'm heartbroken, rest easy Doc,"" then posted a photo of a signed Halladay jersey.

In late 2013, Halladay signed a one-day free-agent contract with Toronto so he could retire as a Blue Jay. Over 16 seasons in the major leagues, Halladay had a 203-105 record and 3.38 ERA.

He was well-respected thoughout Toronto's professional sports community.

""He was huge here in Toronto over the years,"" Dwane Casey, coach of the NBA's Toronto Raptors, said Tuesday. ""I used to keep up with him all the time, watch him pitch. A great pitcher. From what I understand, I didn't know him, but (he was) a great human being, did a lot for the city of Toronto.

""It's sad when you lose someone like that at a young age, 40 years old. It's sad. Condolences from our organization go out to his family. I just know how much he meant to the city, just inducted to the Canadian (Baseball) Hall of Fame. It's just way too soon.""

The NHL's Toronto Maple Leafs tweeted: ""A legend on and off the mound. Rest in peace, Doc.""

Icon aircraft had posted a video with Halladay trying out a new plane. The video showed Halladay taking delivery of a new Icon A5, a two-seat ""light-sport aircraft"" that can land on water.

In the video, Halladay said the terms of his baseball contract prevented him from having a pilot's licence while playing, and that his wife was originally against the idea of him getting the aircraft.

Roy Halladay announces his retirement at the MLB Winter Meetings in 2013.

""She's fought me the whole way,"" Halladay said.

""Hard. I fought hard. I was very against it,"" Brandy Halladay said in the same video, before explaining why she eventually understood and approved of her husband's desire to have the plane.

The A5 was a newer model from Icon, based in Vacaville, California. On May 8, two Icon employees, the company's lead test pilot and the director of engineering, were killed in a crash in an A5 in Napa County, California. The NTSB report said the probable cause was ""the pilot's failure to maintain clearance from terrain while manoeuvring at a low altitude.""

Other baseball players to die in plane crashes included Pittsburgh Pirates star Roberto Clemente in a relief mission from Puerto Rico travelling to earthquake victims in Nicaragua on New Year's Eve in 1972; New York Yankees catcher Thurman Munson piloting his own plane near his home in Canton, Ohio, in 1979; and Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle piloting his own plane in New York City in 2006.

Hi, my name is Claire, and I am a recovering overthinker.

What does that mean? That means I have spent far too many years thinking far too often and far too long about what others thought of me. And the day I realised that none of that energy was worth it was the day my life changed for the better.

Overthinkers are often hugely empathetic and passionate people. However, this care and concern for others, and the insatiable desire to feel that we are doing well, can sometimes overtake the actual doing of things. It can paralyse you and ensure that you invest more time dissecting conversations, what you did or didn't say, over the positive contributions that you made to the conversation.

Overthinking can make you anxious and stunt your ability to learn and grow, because you don't see growth, you only see failure.

There are an endless number of books out there that will tell you how to ban overthinking, or offer a '5-Step Guide' to stop thinking about what others think of you, forever. I call bullshit on that -- and I can, because I am an overthinker. I don't believe it is something you can just 'cure'. It is a part of you, but when understood and used in the right way it can be a strength instead of a weakness.

I was doing a coaching session last week with someone who wanted to 'beat' overthinking. The truth is, you can't. But you can learn how to use your overthinking for good and not as a stress trigger.

It is not the overthinking itself that causes stress or anxiety, it's whatyou are thinking about when you are overthinking. I still catch myself from time to time caring about things I shouldn't, people's opinions of me or whether I did or didn't say something.

But now, when I catch myself, I ask three things:

Firstly, why am I thinking about this, and is it worth investing energy on?

Secondly, will this thought or event be a blip on my radar in six months' time?

And thirdly, what evidence do I have that either a) person 'x' actually has the opinion of me that I think they do, or b) my contribution to something was below par?

You might not be able to ever fully beat the overthinking, but you can control it and own it, instead of it owning you.

Here are some things I've learnt about overthinkers, as a recovering (but not recovered) one:

We aren't insecure -- we just think. We think a lot.We think about us, about you, what we said to you, what we said at that meeting (or didn't say). Is that why you haven't replied to our email, or returned our phone call? Is that why my ears are burning? Like I said, we think. A lot.

Sometimes we care too much. When we think we might have upset you we feel really bad and want to make it better. They key for us though, is to learn that sometimes we are helping people more by telling them what they need to hear.

Sleep can be the hardest part of our day. It seems to be the time when all the day's events decide to replay themselves.

With all the thinking that we do, we often come up with ideas and find solutions. Research has discovered that overthinking has some positive effects. The challenge is harnessing this thinking, for the positive not negative.

You might not be an overthinker in all aspects of your life. Sometimes people are only overthinkers in one segment of their life -- i.e. work, friends or family -- depending on where their insecurities lie. You might find with family or friends you are confident, clear and don't overthink, yet switch to Monday in the office and your brain goes into overdrive.

Overthinking has become an epidemic, and with the social-media tap heavily flowing and constant communication not disappearing anytime soon, we need to get stronger and more resilient at managing the reams of information that are thrown at us.

So, if you're an overthinker, here are four things you can do to help you get out of your own way (or head, in this instance), and invest your energy on things that count.

When you catch yourself overthinking, do the following:

Write it down. Journal what is going on in your head and get it out of there.

Talk to someone. But make sure they are someone who will call you out if you go around in circles with your overthinking talk.

Use positive distractions. These will stop you from thinking about things you don't want to be thinking about. If you are lying awake in bed just hoping you will fall asleep, get up and do something else for a while, focus your energy on that, and then try again.

Most importantly, ask yourself the three questions above, and try to dissolve the thinking pattern.",What To Do If You Think You're An Overthinker,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/claire-seeber/what-to-do-if-you-think-youre-an-overthinker_a_23268833/

A majority now say they don’t expect him to succeed in “draining the swamp” in Washington or in building a border wall and making Mexico pay for it; a near-majority, 48 percent, doubt he’ll “make America great again.” By a 6-percentage-point margin, however, 45 to 39 percent, they believe he has or will bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. ― the promise the nation most wants to see the president fulfill.

(Not all of them will consider that a bad thing. A fifth of Americans, including more than 40 percent of Hillary Clinton voters, say that they don’t want to see Trump keep any of the below promises.)

HuffPost

The vast majority of voters who supported Trump say either that he already has lived up to most of his campaign promises (29 percent) or remains likely to do so (56 percent). Most expect him to accomplish each of the 10 promises asked about in the survey, although their level of bullishness varies: 55 percent think he will “drain the swamp” or has done so already, while nearly three-quarters believe he’ll repeal the Affordable Care Act, and almost 90 percent expect him to bring back jobs.

And to an even greater degree than they did previously, Trump voters see his behavior as president as matching his rhetoric in the campaign trail. Slightly above three-quarters say that Trump’s positions as president are not very or not at all different from what they were when he was running for office, up from 63 percent in the April survey. By contrast, 83 percent of Clinton voters think Trump is unlikely to live up to his campaign promises.

Few voters on either side are rueing the decisions they made last year. Just 1 percent of Clinton voters and 2 percent of Trump voters say they regret their vote in 2016. Some Americans who didn’t make it to the polls last November, however, now wish they’d done so: 18 percent of non-voters say they think they should have voted, although 49 percent say they don’t mind not having participated.

This story started, as the best ones usually don't, when we were watching horse racing at work.

It was the Monday before Melbourne Cup day. After the Cup preview, programming switched to a ho-hum meeting with moderately performed gallopers at Ballarat. But we left the TV on.

In race 6, a horse called Near Queue ran second. Odd name. Near Queue. Near queue, near queue, near queue. For some reason, something seemed a little suspicious. And then we got it.

What's the opposite of near? And what happens when you say ""Far Queue"" in a broad Aussie accent? Uh-huh.

Near Queue is trained by Ballarat trainer Dan O'Sullivan. HuffPost Australia contacted the stable administrator Mel O'Sullivan to find out why the owners would give a perfectly lovely horse such a cheeky name.

""Well, you'd rather be in the near queue than the other one,"" she told us. ""Her owners have used the word 'queue' in the name of her siblings, so it sort of went from there.""

We guess it sort of did.

The thing about naming race horses is you can't use any old name, otherwise every joker in Australia would try to register a horse named ""Hoof Hearted"". Think about that one too. Uh-huh.

Racing's national governing body, Racing Australia, actually has an official horse naming policy. Among other things, the rules state:

Names may be rejected if they are difficult to pronounce or read;

Names where the meaning or origin cannot be satisfactorily substantiated will not be accepted;

Any name, the use of which would be contrary to law, will not be accepted;

The Registrar reserves the right to reduce, extend or add a naming restriction at any time.

There's nothing in the rules that explicitly states that ""horse names will be banned if they make you think of a phrase that means 'get stuffed'"". All the same, we think ""Near Queue"" successfully snuck past racing's gatekeepers of good taste, and we congratulate the horse's owners for so doing.

They snuck another one through too. In Race One at Ballarat on Monday, the same crew had a horse called ""Blunakka"". Mel O'Sullivan told us they named that when they were overseas having a beer and discussing horse names, when a vervet monkey wandered by.

US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has business ties to a shipping firm linked to Vladimir Putin's inner circle, according to a vast leak of financial documents that also revealed Britain's Queen Elizabeth II's investments in tax havens.

It was also revealed that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's top fundraiser and senior advisor Stephen Bronfman, heir to the Seagram fortune, moved some USD 60 million to offshore tax havens with ex-senator Leo Kolber.

The findings have emerged as part of the Paradise Papers released by the US-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which was behind the Panama Papers made public last year.

There is no suggestion that Ross, Bronfman or the Queen's private estate acted illegally. But Ross's ties to Russian entities raise questions over potential conflicts of interest, and whether they undermine Washington's sanctions on Moscow.

The revelations about Bronfman could spell trouble for Trudeau, who was elected two years ago riding on the coattails of promises to reduce economic inequality and tax avoidance.

In the case of Queen Elizabeth's private estate, critics may question whether it is appropriate for the British head of state to invest in offshore tax havens.

Ross, a billionaire investor, holds a 31 per cent stake in Navigator Holdings through a complex web of offshore investments detailed in the documents examined by nearly 100 news organisations as part of an international collaboration. The 79-year-old reduced his stake when he took public office, according to public filings.

Navigator Holdings runs a lucrative partnership with Russian energy giant Sibur, which is partially owned by Putin's son-in-law Kirill Shamalov and Gennady Timchenko, the Russian president's friend and business partner who is subject to US sanctions.

The US imposed sanctions on Russian entities and individuals following its annexation of Crimea and aggression in Ukraine.

Ross's private equity firm has been the biggest shareholder in Navigator. His personal share of the firm's stake was reduced when he took office in February, but the commerce chief's investment is still valued at between USD 2 million to USD 10 million, according to his security filings and government ethics disclosure.

The New York Times reported that Ross's stake in Navigator has been held by companies in the Cayman Islands. His wealth, estimated to exceed USD 2 billion, is said to be tied to similar arrangements in various tax havens like the Cayman Islands. ""Secretary Ross was not involved with Navigator's decision to engage in business with Sibur, a publicly traded company, which was not under sanction at the time and is not currently,"" said James Rockas, a Commerce Department spokesman.

""Moreover, Secretary Ross has never met the Sibur shareholders referenced in this story and, until now, did not know of their relationship.""

The documents also show around 10 million pounds (USD 13 million) of the Queen's private money was placed in funds held in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, first reported in Britain by the BBC and the Guardian newspaper.

They reported the funds reinvested the money in an array of businesses, including controversial rent-to-buy retailer BrightHouse, which has been accused of exploiting the poor, and a chain of alcohol stores that later went bankrupt.

A spokeswoman for the Duchy of Lancaster, which provides the monarch with an income and handles her investments, said, ""All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate.""

""We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds,"" she added.

The spokeswoman added that one of the fund investments represents only 0.3 per cent of the total value of the Duchy.

The Paradise Papers contain 13.4 million documents mainly from Appleby, an offshore law firm with offices in Bermuda and beyond. The files were first obtained by the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung, and shared with the ICIJ and partner media outlets.

In lieu of endorsing weight-loss teas and hitting every D-list red carpet going - choices that Camilla is careful not to judge or look down on, we should add - she headed straight to Greece with former co-star Jamie Jewitt, to lend her hand to helping refugees. She later joined the cast of HuffPost UK original series ‘New Activists’, documenting her recent trip to the site of the former jungle camp in Calais, alongside Help Refugees.

HuffPost UK Camilla Thurlow

HuffPost UK recently caught up with the former bomb disposal worker about how ‘New Activists’ felt the like the right fit for her, why the refugee crisis means so much and what it’s like breaking the reality TV star mould... What made you want to get involved with ‘New Activists’? Having seen the other ‘New Activists’ and what they’d been working on, you could see that it was really opening people’s eyes to a whole different side of activism. Like, it was humanising the people involved. In some instances there’s been a bit of a stigma attached to activism, and people would consider activists to be only a certain type of person. But actually this documentary series has really given an insight into the fact it’s just about normal people who feel very strongly, and there’s so many different sides to that person. It’s all about big ideas but with very real people. People know you best from ‘Love Island’, and after being on a show like that, you get a lot of offers. How did you decide what to do next? I think it’s all about authenticity, really, on that side of things, and I know what I think I’m good at, and it tends to be stuff that I feel passionately about. If I’m going to do something, I like to do it justice. For me it was just important to find the right thing, and also to try and make sure that I was using any platform that I might have to raise awareness for certain issues that I don’t think necessarily always get seen. It’s that thing, interestingly, of different horses for different courses. I have so much admiration for the other things that people have done, and this seemed like the right opportunity for me. On ‘Love Island’, we saw how much you wanted to do more activism. Did you ever worry that being on a show like that would limit your options? Of course there were concerns in my mind in terms of going back to the work that I did before, and I think obviously it’s always worth having those concerns and having a healthy level of worry about what you’re going to do next, because it makes you stay on the right track. So I guess I was worried to an extent, but I think it was the same for all of us who were in it from the beginning. When we came out we just didn’t realise how successful the series had been, and how successful it had been across so many different demographics. It was really a very diverse audience and… I think there was definitely something in the timing, this summer was quite an interesting time on many different levels with domestic and foreign politics, and somehow in that. ‘Love Island’ became this really engaging escapism. So I’ll say that I did have concerns, but in the same way I would have had concerns about many different things and how that could affect my work.

ITV Camilla and her 'Love Island' co-stars this summer

Do you hope that your involvement in ‘Love Island’ and ‘New Activists’ can possibly inspire a new breed of celebrities who start on reality shows? I think the thing is, it’s really interesting because I feel like there are comparisons being drawn that aren’t as clear as it might appear. I don’t feel as different [to other reality stars] as sometimes people perceive it. I’m struggling to explain myself, but I think it’s very easy to label someone as a “typical reality TV star” but that person will have many other sides to them. The only thing that I sort of hope will happen is that... if I can raise any awareness of the issues that are important to me, that will make me very happy. What is it about the refugee crisis in particular that spoke to you? I think part of it comes from my previous work, pre- ‘Love Island’. When you go to an area where there’s been a conflict and you can see people have been forced to leave their homes behind, and then you’re involved in trying to make the area safe so they can come back… you start to think about what it must mean for that person. To have literally got to a point where they had no choice but to leave, but also what growing up against that backdrop of violence can do to a person. Also, because I was on the EOD [explosive ordnance disposal] side, I wasn’t seeing much of the people who had been forced to leave, so it was really important to me to build up that whole picture of what the results of conflict are. So, I initially took the trip to Greece with Jamie [Jewitt, her boyfriend and fellow ‘Love Island’ star] and that was certainly an eye-opener, from that point on we just realised how much we could be doing to help people, and i just wanted to be a part of that. So how did your trip to Calais come about? I spoke to Josie [Naughton], who’s the co-founder of Help Refugees about supporting them. It’s been a year since the demolition of the Jungle camp in Calais, and since then, people have been homeless, living rough - not that they had homes before, but there was some form of camp, some form of protection, and they are now completely exposed. And that includes a number of unaccompanied children who are sleeping rough, completely unprotected, no one to stop anything happening to them. The more I discussed it with her, the more I realised first of all that I needed to see it for myself, and secondly that I wanted to be a part of trying to highlight the fact that there is a legal route for these children to come here, there is a safe way and that needs to happen urgently. Especially now it’s coming up to winter. In the year since the jungle camp closed, how has the situation in Calais changed? I think it’s worse, for the people who are there at the moment. It would be wrong for me to draw any sort of straight of judgement, because I didn’t see it before. But we spoke to a gentleman called Stu in the distribution centre, and he had been in the jungle camp, and he said for him the conditions are worse. Now, they’re not even allowed tents to sleep in, so now they get a sleeping bag and a blanket at best, and even those are often taken away by the police, so the conditions are really really bad. In terms of keeping track of people, in making sure that they haven’t been hurt or harmed, that they haven’t attempted to cross and then not made it back and they’re stranded somewhere on their own, it’s just so much harder when there’s no formalised systems.

Passa anni in un posto che abbandona solo dopo averne trovato l'essenza – non per forza positiva – e le sue storie diventano scatti che lasciano sempre il segno in chi si sofferma a guardarle: volti, corpi, luoghi e situazioni che spiazzano e stupiscono in cui ad emergere è l'abitudine ad una sofferenza di un'umanità allo sbando, che non ha oramai più nulla da perdere, ma solo da sperare.

Per dieci anni ha visitato settantaquattro carceri dell'America Latina - dall'Argentina al Venezuela, dal Brasile al Perù – riuscendo ad arrivare e a fotografare quelle parti dove nemmeno le guardie arrivano perché hanno paura di non riuscire a tornare indietro e il risultato è stato Encerrados, un prezioso libro fotografico pubblicato dalla Contrasto di cui ci parlò a lungo quando lo incontrammo nella Capitale.

Un vero e proprio inferno dove non è solo la legge del più forte a sopravvivere perché lì – soprattutto a Lomas de Zamora, una delle periferie di Buenos Aires più colpite dal paco - la legge in generale non esiste e tutto, a cominciare proprio dai valori, è capovolto e sballato. Non esistono limiti di età, i bambini nascono e sono già adulti e questi ultimi dimostrano venti anni più della loro età effettiva, sempre magri ed affamati, con la loro pelle consumata, le labbra spaccate, i denti rovinati e gli occhi colmi di disperazione. Tutto per colpa del paco, tutto per colpa di quei ""sassolini"" estremamente nocivi ottenuti con gli scarti della lavorazione della cocaina e miscelati poi a cherosene, colla, veleno per topi o polvere di vetro.

Buenos Aires, 2015. A villa Lugano un cavallo è stato ucciso durante la notte in uno scontro a fuoco tra narcotrafficanti.

""Il paco è un animale muto che ha invaso prima le periferie di Buenos Aires poi quasi tutto il Sudamerica: nessuno sa esattamente quante vittime ha fatto, quanti ragazzi sono morti. Qualcuno è riuscito a uscirne, ma sono pochissimi quelli che ce la fanno, che non ricadono a consumare il sassolino bianco"".

Buenos Aires, 2017. La condivisione delle proprie esperienze aiuta i ragazzi a sentirsi meno soli nel processo di riabilitazione.

Ognuno di loro nasce e cresce in quelle baraccopoli dove anche il tempo sembra avere un corso diverso, con un giorno e una notte che invertono il loro corso, visto che molti di quei giovani, veri e propri zombie viventi, si svegliano quando cala il sole alla ricerca disperata dei cinquanta pesos necessari per una dose, una delle venti che più o meno assumono ogni giorno con conseguenze devastanti, una delle venti che cercano in ogni modo e senza guardare in faccia a nessuno. Quelle notti non hanno mai fine, ogni rumore è un grido e qualcuno cade senza rialzarsi per una dose letale o per una coltellata sbagliata e anche gli animali, spesso, hanno la peggio. C'è una foto che mostra un cavallo ucciso per strada a Villa Lugano, a Buenos Aires, e poco distante c'è una madre con un neonato che passano indifferenti, come se quel cavallo fosse stato sempre lì, come se fosse una statua o un monumento della baraccopoli, la normalità del male a cui tutti hanno fatto l'abitudine.

Buenos Aires, 2010. El Barrio 17 de Noviembre en Fiorito (più conosciuto come el Campo Tonghi).

Bispuri ci conduce per mano in quell'inferno senza mai lasciarla, perché sa che potrebbe essere letale, riuscendo persino a mostrarci uno dei laboratori clandestini dove si fabbrica il paco (""Mi nutro del rischio, se non ce l'ho, perdo qualcosa"", ci disse), una ""cocina"" (una cucina) ricavata in un garage dietro la baracca di una povera famiglia, ""scatti soffocati dal fumo e dalla paura – spiega - che sono stati la fine del mio lavoro sul paco proprio dove il paco inizia"".

La cucina dove si prepara il paco.

Ci lascia ma solo per pochi secondi, per farci rendere ancora più conto della tragicità di una situazione che necessita un intervento immediato, ma non giudica mai: come in tutti i suoi lavori, lascia parlare le sue foto che non sono mai di denuncia ma analisi antropologiche e sociologiche, immagini che hanno un grande impatto narrativo ed emotivo, riflessi preziosi ed unici del lato peggiore di un'umanità disperata che per ora è avvolta solo da un silenzio assordante.

Lima, Perù, 2006. Ragazzi di strada mangiano dopo aver fumato paco.

Se oggi, mercoledì 8 novembre, siete a Roma, potete incontrare Valerio Bispuri alle ore 20 Live Alcazar (Via Cardinale Merry del Val, 14), lo storico cinema di Trastevere che da poco ha riaperto le porte in una veste del tutto rinnovata con un programma multidisciplinare che spazia tra cinema, musica e performance di artisti in diversi ambiti.

Auch für diese Acts hat Bohlen bereits Musik produziert.

Hier gibt es die größten Hits von Dieter Bohlen und Modern Talking im Stream, als Download und auf CD

Andrea Berg

Seit dem 2010 erschienenen Album ""Schwerelos"" komponierte und produzierte Bohlen zahlreiche Lieder für die deutsche Schlagersängerin Andrea Berg (51). Von der Zusammenarbeit mit dem Mastermind war Berg zunächst allerdings nicht wirklich überzeugt. Ihre Plattenfirma war damals die treibende Kraft. Doch Bohlen konnte sie schnell überzeugen, wie Berg im Interview mit ""hitparade.ch"" erklärte - mit dem Song ""Ich liebe Dich"". ""Wer so einen Song komponieren kann und solche Texte schreibt, der hat genau die Emotionalität, die ich brauche"", lautete ihr Fazit.

Roy Black

Die deutsche Schlagerlegende Roy Black (1943-1991) arbeitete ebenfalls mit Dieter Bohlen zusammen - wenn auch nur für relativ kurze Zeit. ""Rosenzeit"", das letzte Album vor dem unerwarteten Tod Gerhard Höllerichs, so sein bürgerlicher Name, wurde von Bohlen produziert. Auf dem Longplayer sind unter anderem die Songs ""Ich träume mich zu dir"", ""Was soll ich ohne dich oben im Himmel"" und ""Frag' Maria"" enthalten.

Bonnie Tyler

Auch an mehreren Alben und Singles der Pop- und Rockröhre Bonnie Tyler (66) arbeitete Bohlen Anfang der 1990er Jahre mit, darunter an den Alben ""Bitterblue"", ""Angel Heart"" und ""Silhouette in Red"". Aus dieser Zusammenarbeit stammen unter anderem die Hits ""Call me"" und ""Fools Lullaby"".

Nino de Angelo

Der deutsch-italienische Schlagerstar Nino de Angelo (53) bezeichnete Bohlen erst kürzlich in einem Gespräch mit der ""Bild""-Zeitung als ""alten Freund"". Die beiden arbeiteten 1989 zusammen an einigen Songs, darunter auch an ""Flieger"", mit dem de Angelo und Bohlen im gleichen Jahr den 14. Platz beim Eurovision Song Contest einheimsen konnten. Vielleicht gibt es bald zudem einen neuen gemeinsamen Hit der beiden. Dem Blatt verriet de Angelo über Bohlen auch: ""Er liebt meine Stimme. Wir wollen wieder etwas machen.""

Howard Carpendale

Zwar wurde Howard Carpendale (71) vor einigen Jahren von einem Sportreporter mit Dieter Bohlen verwechselt, eine erneute Zusammenarbeit der beiden, wie an den Songs ""Here I go again"" und ""Sag ihm, dass du gehst"", ist allerdings eher unwahrscheinlich. 2009 zog Carpendale ganz schön über Bohlen her - zumindest über dessen Fähigkeiten als Texter. Im Gespräch mit der Münchner ""Abendzeitung"" erzählte er damals: ""Dieter Bohlen zum Beispiel schreibt englische Texte, die unvorstellbar sind, die sind grammatikalisch falsch, alles daran ist falsch! Die DJs sollten schon ein bisschen kritischer sein.""

Roger Whittaker

Zu den musikalischen Komplizen Bohlens zählt auch der britische Liedermacher und Sänger Roger Whittaker (81), der Mitte der 1990er Jahre mehrere Songs mit dem Musikproduzenten aufnahm, die auf dem Album ""Ein schöner Tag mit Dir"" erschienen sind. Dazu zählen das gleichnamige Duett mit Aylin, ""Samstag nachts"" und ""Hello Lady"".

Yvonne Catterfeld

Nicht die letzte im Bohlen-Bunde ist Yvonne Catterfeld (37). Für die Schauspielerin und Sängerin produzierte er unter anderem das Lied ""Für dich"", von ihrem Debütalbum ""Meine Welt"" aus dem Jahr 2003 und ""Du hast mein Herz gebrochen"", für dessen Songtext unter anderem auch der Rapper Eko Fresh (34) mitverantwortlich ist. Die Songs wurden zu Catterfelds beiden ersten Nummer-eins-Hits und konnten sich jeweils für mehrere Monate in den Charts halten.",Diese sieben Künstler verdanken Dieter Bohlen ihre Hits,http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2017/11/08/diese-sieben-kunstler-verdanken-dieter-bohlen-ihre-hits_n_18500720.html?utm_hp_ref=germany&amp;ir=Germany

NEW DELHI -- A combination of smoke from stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana and moisture turned Delhi into a ""gas chamber"" today, prompting authorities to announce a series of preventive measures including a four-fold hike in parking fees and slashing of metro fares.

The smog brought down visibility levels, affecting flight and train operations. The heavy air permeated living rooms and even the underground metro stations in the city making it difficult to breathe, turning eyes watery.

In the evening, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia announced that primary schools in the national capital will remain close tomorrow.

The Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, empowered to enforce the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), also directed the states in the region to start preparing for implementing measures like 'odd-even' in light of the ""crisis situation"".

The air quality index was in the 'severe', with a score of 448 in a scale of 500, category for the second time this year. Earlier, Diwali fireworks had triggered peak pollution levels on October 20.

The National Green Tribunal took the governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana to task, seeking to know why steps to prevent steps were not taken despite knowing well in advance that such a situation was likely to arise.

The Delhi government is mulling over shutting schools till the peak pollution levels prevail. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted: ""Delhi has become a gas chamber. Every year this happens during this part of year. We have to find a solution to crop burning in adjoining states.""

""Considering high level of pollution, I have requested Manish Sisodia, Education Minister, to consider closing schools for few days,"" he added.

The Indian Medical Association said Delhi was witnessing a ""public health emergency"" and appealed to the government to stop outdoor sports and other such activities in schools to protect the health of children.

Later, in a meeting to review the status of air quality, the EPCA announced that all measures under the GRAP's severe category will be implemented across the region till further notice.

CPCB member secretary A Sudhakar told PTI the intensity of pollution peaked since last night as moisture-heavy winds from Uttar Pradesh and hot winds carrying emissions from stubble burning from Punjab and Haryana have dealt a double- whammy.

""We are not expecting a dramatic change in the next two- three days. Shallow fog and a complete absence of wind are preventing the dissipation of pollutants at the ground level,"" Sudhakar said.

The wind speed is currently around 3 metres per second, Sudhakar said, explaining it is inadequate to disperse particulate matter like PM2.5 and PM10.

EPCA chairman Bhure Lal and member Sunita Narain directed the municipal bodies in the region to immediately enhance parking fees by four times and instructed the Delhi Metro to lower fares during off-peak hours for at least 10 days, introduce more coaches and ensure frequent services.

Among other measures, the EPCA instructed Delhi and neighbouring states - Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana -- to strengthen the public transport system by introducing more buses and said a fine of Rs 50,000 would be imposed on road construction agencies violating dust pollution norms.

The body asked the Delhi-NCR governments to start preparing for measures like odd-even and a complete ban on construction activities if pollution aggravates.

The measures also include complete closure of brick kilns, hot mix plants and stone crushers across the region till further notice and a ban on entry of goods vehicles - not destined for Delhi for the next 20 days - in the city.

Sisodia, who is also Delhi's education minister, convened a meeting of officials of education, health and environment departments over shutting schools. He directed the environment department to submit a report on the city's pollution levels.

Meanwhile, the CISF ordered issuance of over 9,000 face masks for its personnel deployed to guard the IGI Airport, the Delhi Metro and other government ministries and installations here.

As if Season 2 wasn’t creepy enough, fans started theorizing that the worlds of “Stranger Things” and “It” were actually connected following the release of new episodes.
“Stranger Things” co-creator Matt Duffer first told Vulture that he had a problem with the 1990 “It” miniseries as a kid, and Bob’s story was inspired by that.

As if Season 2 wasn’t creepy enough, fans started theorizing that the worlds of “Stranger Things” and “It” were actually connected following the release of new episodes.

This connection stems largely from the introduction of Bob Newby (Sean Astin). While driving with Will (Noah Schnapp) in the car, Bob mentions that as a kid he had nightmares about “Mr. Baldo,” a clown who had offered him a balloon. (Just like Pennywise in “It” does). At another point, Bob also suggests to Joyce (Winona Ryder) that they buy his parents’ house in Maine. (“It” takes place in Derry, Maine.)

Furthermore, in the Season 2 finale, Finn Wolfhard, who plays Mike Wheeler on “Stranger Things,” repeats the same line his character in “It” says.

Finn Wolfhard says the same line in both #StrangerThings and the movie IT pic.twitter.com/70RvYf1AwG — Stranger Facts (@UpsideDownFacts) October 29, 2017

The Duffer brothers, who actually once pitched an “It” remake themselves, recently told Vulture that the connections are completely intentional. But there seems to be one big hole in the theory.

“Stranger Things” co-creator Matt Duffer first told Vulture that he had a problem with the 1990 “It” miniseries as a kid, and Bob’s story was inspired by that.

“I think [Bob’s clown story] was really me describing something that just freaked me out. I didn’t have that experience myself. I just had nightmares like that,” he said.

Duffer continued:

“I’m sure we were just like, ‘It would be cute if [Bob] suggests moving to Maine, right next to Stephen King.’ Stephen King exists in this world. Some of the characters have read Stephen King. But Bob definitely does not read Stephen King. He’s not interested at all in Stephen King because he hates that kind of story.”

Since King exists in the world of “Stranger Things,” it seems unlikely that his fictional characters would as well (though, as one of our readers points out, there is a Stephen King in the “Dark Tower” series). The kids are probably safe from Pennywise after all; however, if red balloons start showing up in Hawkins, Indiana, those guys are on their own.",The Truth Behind The Creepy Connection Between 'It' And 'Stranger Things',http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-truth-behind-the-creepy-connection-between-it-and-stranger-things_us_5a00b54ee4b0baea2633f87b

While lots of us like to think we would leave without a second thought, the reality of life and being invested in your partner - marriage, children, a shared home and future plans - means it isn’t always so black and white.

For most people in a relationship , finding out that your partner has cheated seems like the worst thing that could possibly happen. But often the hardest part isn’t the revelation itself, it is working out what to do next.

1. Don’t try to talk until you’ve calmed down.

In the immediate aftermath of your discovery, you are of course going to be angry. And while you shouldn’t hold back in sharing this anger with your partner, you should also be cautious about saying things in the heat of the moment that you cannot unsay, or you may live to regret when you’re not seeing red.

Sex and relationship expert Tracey Cox, tells HuffPost UK: “Delay the discussion until you’ve both calmed down. Talking while you’re furious accomplishes little more than saying hurtful things you may regret later. And work out exactly what you want to say beforehand.”

2. Give yourself some space.

When your trust in your partner is shattered, and everything you thought you had seems to have dissolved around you, it can be tempting to overcompensate by spending all your time together and not letting them out of your sight.

But in order to get some perspective on your relationship together, it is important to give yourself some space to think things through.

Sarah Ryan, a relationships expert and director of her own matchmaking agency, says: “If you really want to find a way to make your relationship work you’ll have to give yourself some space to work out what you truly want, what it is that you’re feeling and healing all the hurts that come with cheating - ensure to really practise the art of letting go to save yourself holding onto animosity.”

And Vasia Toxavidi, a psychotherapist and counsellor with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, agrees: “Some controlling may take place by the partner who has been cheated on due to loss of trust, but it is important for that person to focus and take care of themselves.”

3. Ask yourself if you are capable of total forgiveness.

During this time when you are giving yourself space, the most important question you should be asking yourself is whether you are capable of totally forgiving your partner - this is the only way this is going to work (holding a grudge doesn’t help anyone).

Cox says: “Some relationship crimes hurt us more than others because of our backgrounds and family history. Cheating is harder to forgive for someone who has a history of partners who’ve been unfaithful or whose parents had a painful split. Forgiveness is the first step, learning to trust again is the next.

“How will you know if they’ve done it again? Did you see the signs the last time? Has something significant changed to ensure they won’t do it again?”

And Ryan agrees: “Without fully forgiving your partner after they have been unfaithful then you run the risk of harbouring negative energy and feelings which will come out in the wash when resistance or minor conflicts naturally occur within a relationship.”

4. Start by working on a basic friendship.

Expecting your relationship to go back to how it was before is probably naive, so instead of jumping back into your old roles straight away, try having a basic friendship that focuses on trust and respect.

Ryan says: “You need to rediscover an understanding of each other as friends first and foremost before you can move forward romantically, at the end of the day thats how every relationship develops because you date and become romantically involved with your best friend.

“Really understanding when and how you may have stopped being friends can help you interpret when respect may have left your relationship.”",7 Tips If You’re Trying To Stay With Your Partner After They Cheated,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/staying-with-partner-after-they-cheated-how-to_uk_5a01cbd0e4b066c2c03a4c08?u7&utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage

Die Fotos zeigen, wie unterschiedlich und schön Frauen mit Verschleierung sein können

Das Kopftuch. In vielen Köpfen ein Symbol für die Unterdrückung der muslimischen Frau im Islam, für unfreiwillige Entscheidungen und erst recht kein Zeichen für Feminismus.

Das ist jedenfalls das Bild, das meistens in den Medien gezeigt wird. Besonders bei Menschen, die sich sonst nicht mit dem Thema beschäftigen, entstehen so negative Vorurteile.

Um das zu ändern, haben sich die Fotografin Ilayda Kaplan und die Filmemacherin Nilgün Akinci zusammengesetzt und ein Projekt ins Leben gerufen:

""Shades of Persistence“ - eine Fotoreihe mit 14 verhüllten Frauen, die sich mit ihren Kopftüchern mutig vor die Kamera stellten. Die Portraits zeigen bewusst: Die Frauen könnten unterschiedlicher nicht sein. Sie sind unterschiedlich alt, haben eine andere Hautfarbe oder einen anderen Kleidungsstil.

Kaplan und Akinci wollten die Unterschiedlichkeit von Frauen im Kopftuch zum Ausdruck bringen. Es gibt nicht ""die"" verschleierte Frau. Doch etwas verbindet alle diese Frauen: Sie bezeichnen sich als Feministinnen, als Hijabi und sie stehen zu ihrer Religion.

Bilder für mehr Toleranz gegenüber der muslimischen Community

Mit ihrem Projekt reagieren Akinci und Kaplan nicht nur auf Vorurteile, die die Nicht-Muslime gegenüber verhüllten Frauen hegen. Es soll auch die Konflikte innerhalb der einzelnen muslimischen Communities aufzeigen. Denn auch dort gibt es verschiedene Auffassungen darüber, wie eine angemessene Verhüllung aussehen soll.

In einer Zeit, in der Rassismus alltäglich scheint, fühlt Kaplan eine Verantwortung. Sie will alles in ihrer Macht stehende tun, um Vorurteilen und Stereotypen entgegenzuwirken. Dabei trägt sie selbst kein Kopftuch.

Warum sie trotzdem das Bedürfnis verspürt, jene Stereotypen zu ändern, berichtet sie der HuffPost: ""Ich bin eine Person mit - ich sage es ganz schroff - mehr gesellschaftlichen Privilegien als Frauen, die sich verhüllen. Deswegen will ich genau solchen Minderheiten eine Plattform bieten, sich zu zeigen, sich mitzuteilen.""

Gerade weil sie eine Außenstehende ist, fällt ihr auf, dass es unter den Communities auch viel Ausgrenzung gibt.

""Ich selbst bin nicht Teil dieser Gemeinschaft, habe aber Freundinnen, die mir viel berichten. Da wird unter den Frauen teilweise mit dem Finger aufeinander gezeigt. Man verhülle sich falsch, man träge zu knallige Farben, und so weiter. Gerade diese Frauen müssen doch zusammenhalten.""

Eleganz, Selbstbestimmung, Feminismus

Kaplan und Akinci bringen in ihren Bildern das zum Vorschein, was viele Kopftuch-Gegner nicht erwarten würden: Dass verhüllte Frauen elegant, selbstbestimmt, feministisch und anmutig sein können - und individuell.

Was sich jedoch durch alle Portraits zieht, ist eine gewisse Bescheidenheit. Keiner der Frauen zeigt sich lasziv oder obszön. Für Kaplan und Akinci steht im Vordergrund, dass das Projekt ernst genommen wird.

Das Kopftuch. Ein Symbol für die Unterdrückung der muslimischen Frau? Für Kaplan ein absolut unberechtigtes Vorurteil.

Jeder, der bereit ist, sich zu informieren, würde das schnell herausfinden. Diejenigen, die das nicht täten, seien getrieben von Bequemlichkeit und medialen Einflüssen. Und in vielen Fällen von Schwäche: ""Es ist natürlich leichter, mit dem Strom zu schwimmen und dem Bild der Masse zuzustimmen. Aber das ist nicht gesund für unser aller Zusammenleben.""

Im Koran steht: Verhülle deine Reize.

Wie Frauen das für sich deuten, läge ganz bei ihnen. Kaplan selbst kennt keine Frau mit Kopftuch in ihrem Umfeld, die sich aus Zwang verhüllen muss. Genauso wenig wie jede Einzelne auf ihren Bildern.

Dabei blenden sie deren Verbrechen aus

Auch Medien vermitteln teilweise ein falsches Bild der ""Oktoberrevolution""

Würde ein öffentlich-rechtlicher Sender in Deutschland die Machtergreifung von Mussolini und seinen Faschisten in Italien feiern? Den Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkriegs? Oder den Jahrestag eines Putsches in Südamerika?

Aus guten Gründen käme sicher kein Redakteur jemals auf so eine Idee.

Ganz anders, wenn es um den Kommunismus geht.

Der öffentlich-rechtliche, deutsch-französische Sender Arte kündigte auf seiner Facebook-Seite an, er werde die russische ""Oktoberrevolution"", die sich am 7. November zum 100. Mal jährt, mit zahlreichen Beiträgen ""feiern"".

Alles spricht dafür, dass es sich bei der Formulierung nur um den Missgriff eines einzelnen Mitarbeiters handelt – denn die Sendungen selbst, die Arte zur Oktoberrevolution sendete, waren kritisch und wurden dem tragischen Ereignis durchaus gerecht.

Sympathie für Lenins Putsch

Aber es ist kein Zufall, dass sich ein Journalist so vergaloppieren konnte. Und dass der Post mit dem ""feiern"" tagelang online blieb – und erst nach Berichten darüber in den sozialen Netzwerken kommentarlos von der Seite verschwand.

Der verbale Missgriff auf der Arte-Seite ist ein Symptom – und auch nur deshalb der Erwähnung wert: Bis hinein in weite Teile der politischen Elite in Deutschland herrscht heute noch eine, zuweilen klammheimliche, zuweilen offene Sympathie für Lenins Putsch, der zu den größten Tragödien des 21. Jahrhunderts gehört.

In Berlin, Hamburg und Bremen gab es Umzüge zur Feier der Revolution; mitsamt sowjetischem Panzer und Attrappen des Panzerkreuzers Aurora feierten Kommunisten ausgelassen die Machtübernahme durch Lenin und seine Komplizen. Was für ein Hohn für die Opfer von Stasi & Co., von denen immer noch viele gerade in Berlin leben.

Gräuel Stalins werden ignoriert

Dass der Kommunismus ein schrecklicher Irrweg der Geschichte war – darüber herrscht kein grundlegender, über alle politischen Lager gehenden Konsens, wie wir ihn beim Faschismus haben.

Gäbe es diesen Konsens, wären verbale Entgleisungen wie das ""feiern"" der Oktoberrevolution ein Tabu. Und so würden zumindest so schnell wieder von der Seite eines öffentlich-rechtlichen Senders verschwinden wie sie dort veröffentlicht wurden.

Viele haben die Lehre des großen Sozialdemokraten Kurt Schumacher vergessen, wonach die Kommunisten (unter Stalin) nichts anderes als ""rot lackierte Nazis"" seien. Vergessen ist auch, dass Stalin nach Kriegsende seine Gegner, darunter auch Sozialdemokraten, wieder in den alten, von ihm wieder eröffneten Konzentrationslagern der Nazis einsperren ließ.

Schumachers Urteil zeigt, wie zynisch die in Deutschland immer noch weit verbreitete Unsitte ist, die unglaublichen Verbrechen von Hitler und seinem Regime zu instrumentalisieren, um Stalin und Lenin zu relativieren und verharmlosen.

Falsche Berichte über die Revolution

Wer Diktatur und Massenmord durch den Vergleich mit Hitler schönredet, verhöhnt auf unerträgliche Weise die Opfer.

Der Terror der Kommunisten gegen ihre eigenen Völker, die Millionen Opfer – all das ist im Bewusstsein vieler Menschen in Deutschland (und anderswo) nicht (mehr) verankert. Die Ursache dafür liegt teilweise schon im Schulunterricht.

Selbst in den Medien sind die Wissenslücken zum Teil gewaltig: So schrieb eine große deutsche Tageszeitung dieser Tage, Lenin habe 1917 den Zaren gestürzt und die Monarchie in Russland beendet.

Genau das war aber schon im Februar 1917 geschehen, bei der Februar-Revolution, als Lenin noch im Ausland war. Die damals entstandene provisorische Regierung wollte Russland zu einer Demokratie machen.

Die ""Oktoberrevolution"" war ein klassischer Putsch

In den USA ist die Lage nicht besser. Ein Drittel der jungen Amerikaner glaubt laut einer Umfrage des Instituts YouGov von 2016, dass unter Stalin weniger Menschen getötet wurden als unter George W. Bush.

Die Verklärung der Ereignisse vom 7. November (nach dem damals in Russland gültigen Kalender war es der 25. Oktober) zeigt sich schon darin, wie wir sie nennen: Unter Revolution verstehen wir heutzutage zumeist eine radikale Veränderung der Verhältnisse, die von unten ausgeht, also von den Menschen.

Dass Lenin am 7. November 1917 die Minister der Provisorischen Regierung festnehmen ließ, war ein klassischer Putsch. Treffender wäre also der Begriff ""Oktober-Putsch"" statt ""Oktober-Revolution"".

Auch in der frühen Sowjetunion wurde das Wort ""Revolution"" nicht gebraucht. Erst Stalin führte es in den 1920er Jahren ein, wie der russische Philosoph Igor Tschubais betont.

Lenin lässt Gegner erschießen

Auch den legendären ""Sturm auf den Winterpalast"" in Sankt Petersburg hat es demzufolge nie gegeben – die Wachen ließen Lenins Handvoll Kämpfer kampflos und unspektakulär in das Gebäude.

Bei den freien Wahlen im November 1917 erhielten Lenins Bolschewiken nur rund 25 Prozent.

Als die frisch gewählte Verfassungsgebende Versammlung im Januar die Erlasse Lenins für illegal erklärte, ließ dieser sie einfach auflösen – und auf Demonstranten schießen, die für ihre gewählten Vertreter auf die Straße gingen. Lenins Schwergen töteten mehr als hundert Menschen.

Nicht mehr als ein Tropfen in dem Meer von Blut, dass die Bolschewiken später anrichteten.

Putin hält Lenin für einen Verräter

Selbst Wladimir Putin, sonst Sowjet-Nostalgiker, hält sich auffallend zurück, was Lenin und die Oktoberrevolution angeht.

Mehr noch: Der heutige russische Präsident warf Lenin vor, er habe eine Atombombe unter den russischen Staat gelegt.

""Putin setzt ganz offensichtlich große Stücke auf Stalin, aber nicht auf Lenin"", glaubt der Philosoph Tschubais: ""Lenin hält er zurecht für einen Verräter, der im Auftrag der damaligen deutschen Regierung handelte.""

Diese Version der Geschichte ist in Moskau derzeit weit verbreitet: Der große Revolutionsheld als eine Marionette der Obersten Heeresführung in Berlin, die mit seiner Hilfe den Kriegsgegner Russland schwächen wollte. Und tatsächlich war einer der ersten Erlasse Lenins, einen Tag nach seiner Machtergreifung, die Kapitulation Russlands, auf die Kaiser Wilhelm II. in Berlin gehofft hatte.

An den Folgen der ""Oktoberrevolution"" leidet Russland bis heute

Stalin dagegen ist in den Augen von Putin und der KGB-Männer aus seinem Umfeld der Retter ihres Vaterlands im Zweiten Weltkrieg. Wobei sie geflissentlich ausblenden, dass ihr Idol in diesem zwei Jahre lang auf der falschen Seite kämpfte und als Komplize Hitlers zahlreiche Länder überfiel und besetzte.

All das betrachten Putin und seine Gefährten ebenso wie den Terror als ""Kollateralschaden"" auf dem Weg zum Sieg.

Massenterror gegen die eigene Bevölkerung, bei dem jeder zu jeder Zeit willkürlich Opfer werden konnte, der GULAG, der Hunger-Terror gegen das eigene Volk, Abermillionen Toter – das sind nur die schlimmsten Folgen der „Oktoberrevolution“. Die Liste der Verbrechen und verheerenden Folgen des bolschewistischen Umsturzes ließe sich schier endlos fortsetzen.

Lenin setzte explizit das Recht außer Kraft, auch das Völkerrecht.

An den Folgen der ""Oktoberrevolution"" leidet Russland bis heute

An den Folgen leidet Russland bis heute. Selbst der Putin-Intimus Dmitrij Medwedew beklagte, im Land herrsche Rechtsnihilismus – freilich ohne auf dessen Wurzeln hinzuweisen.

Stalin beging Völkermord am eigenen Volk, schreibt der Philosoph Tschubais.

Man müsste wohl hinzufügen, dass er auch das Bewusstsein seines Volkes massiv beschädigte. Er pervertierte die Moral, normalisierte die Lüge, versuchte, die Geschichte auszuradieren. Und er pflanzte den Verfolgungswahn tief im Bewusstsein der politischen Elite ein.

All das tat er im Namen des ""Guten"".

Die Schrecken des Kommunismus werden in Moskau heute allenfalls beiläufig erwähnt. In Russland denken laut Umfragen heute 46 Prozent der Menschen positiv über Stalin. Als unentschuldbares Verbrechen betrachten seinen Terror gegen die eigenen Bürger nur noch 39 Prozent.

Putins Propaganda wirkt.

Warum gibt es in Deutschland eine solche Sympathie für den Kommunismus?

Umso erstaunlicher ist es aber, dass auch im Westen noch so viel Sympathie für das sowjetische System herrsct.

Die Begeisterung für Stalin bei westlichen Intellektuellen wie Jean-Paul Sartre oder Lion Feuchtwanger, die seine Verbrechen beschönigten und so zu Komplizen wurde, ist nie richtig aufgearbeitet worden.

Dies ist wohl einer der Gründe dafür, warum Verteidiger von Putin wie Altkanzler Gerhard Schröder oder die Ex-ARD-Korrespondentin Gabriele Krone-Schmalz heute noch auf relativ große Zustimmung bei Russlandfreunden in Deutschland stoßen.

Die Methoden, die Putins Helfer nutzen, erinnern an die von Stalins ausländischen Unterstützern: Kritik an dem Herrscher im Kreml wurde gleichgesetzt mit Kritik am Land. Der Hinweis auf Missstände wurde als ""antikommunistische Hetze"" (heute: ""Dämonisierung"") und ""überdrehte Medienkampagne"" hingestellt, mit denen der Westen von den eigenen Verbrechen ablenken wolle.

Wagenknecht hat sich nie von Stalins Verbrechen distanziert

Besonders unerklärlich sind die Sympathien für den Kommunismus in Deutschland, das unter der Teilung, der Berliner Mauer und der Unterdrückung durch Stalin und seine Schergen viel stärker litt als seine westlichen Nachbarn.

Mit der ""Linken"" ist heute die umbenannte SED so gut wie in der politischen Mitte Deutschlands angekommen. Stalins politische Ur-Enkel haben sich nie überzeugend von der DDR distanziert. Doch das scheint viele nicht zu stören in Deutschland.

Wie selbstverständlich beteiligt sich die ""Linke"" aktiv am ""Kampf gegen Rechts"" - so als drohe eine Gefahr für die Demokratie nur aus dieser Richtung.

Sahra Wagenknecht ist gern gesehener Gast in Talkshows und mitten in der Gesellschaft angekommen – eine Frau, die sich nie überzeugend von ihrer früheren Sympathie für den Massenmörder Stalin distanziert hat.

Für wie selbstverständlich wir inzwischen die weit verbreitete Sehschwäche auf dem linken Auge halten, zeigt die Reaktion auf die massive linke Gewalt beim G20-Gipfel in Hamburg diesen Sommer. Teile unserer Medien und Politik reagierten mit Feindseligkeiten gegen die Polizei und manchmal kaum verhohlenem Verständnis für die Gewalttäter.

Die Lehren der Geschichte

Wer Gewalt anwende, sei kein Linker, weil Linke ja gegen Gewalt seien – so ein damals weit verbreitetes Credo, das sich auch SPD-Vize Stegner zu eigen machte.

Im ""Spiegel"" war gar sinngemäß zu lesen, linker gewaltbereiter Extremismus sei nicht mit rechtem gewaltbereiten Extremismus zu vergleichen, weil ersterer ja guten Zwecken diene und letzterer nicht.

Wer so argumentiert, hat aus der Geschichte nichts gelernt. Und zeigt ein fast schon infantiles Schwarz-Weiß-Denken.

Gerade sollten wir uns wieder die Lehren der Geschichte bewusstmachen: Wo immer sich Machthaber, mit welcher Begründung auch immer, über das Gesetz stellen, wo immer staatliche Gewalt missbraucht wird, um Andersdenkende zu unterdrücken, müssen wir das nicht nur verurteilen – sondern alles in unserer Macht Stehende dagegen tun.

Wer auch immer Demokratie, Freiheit und Rechtsstaat in Frage stellt, verdient keine Sympathie, sondern unseren entschiedenen Widerstand. Ganz egal, aus welcher politischen Ecke er kommt. Und welche angeblich hehren Ziele er als Begründung nennt. Die Geschichte zeigt: Das Böse ist immer dann besonders gefährlich, wenn es im Gewand des Guten daherkommt.

The Jammu and Kashmir government has declined to give Rs 10 lakh compensation to Farooq Ahmed Dar, the ""human shield"" tied to an Army jeep and taken around the Srinagar parliamentary constituency during the bypoll on April 9.

Jammu and Kashmir State Human Rights Commission chairperson Justice Bilal Nazki had directed the state government in July to give the compensation amount to Dar.

There was ""no scheme or policy in vogue in the state, which could cover the payment of compensation"" in such matters, the state government said in its reply to the human rights panel recently.

The statement argued that an FIR was filed and compensation would tantamount to establishing the guilt of the accused without affording him the opportunity to be heard.

The statement argued that an FIR was filed and compensation would tantamount to establishing the guilt of the accused without affording him the opportunity to be heard.

In the four-page reply, filed through Deputy Secretary (Home) Mushtaq Ahmed, the state government said the empowered committee of the government had examined the order of the rights panel and observed that the grounds on which compensation was recommended ""cannot be accepted"".

The state government, it said, had discharged its obligation by registering an FIR in the matter in the Beerwah police station and consequently initiating the investigation.

A masked Kashmiri Muslim protester puffs on a cigarette as a fellow protester talks to him during a protest against Indian government and Indian army for honouring Major Leetul Gogoi for tying Kashmiri man Farooq Dar to the bonnet of an army vehicle, on May 26, 2017, in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian administered Kashmir, India.

""That pending completion of the investigation in the matter, the recommendation with regard to payment of compensation to the complainant (Dar), shall tantamount to establish the guilt of the accused without affording him an opportunity of being heard,"" the reply accessed by PTI said.

The response will be placed before Nazki on November 13.

While asking the government to give Rs 10 lakh compensation to Nazki, the rights panel in its July 10 order had refused to direct the Army in the case, saying it did not have jurisdiction over the force.

Dar was tied to the bonnet of an Army vehicle and taken around 19 villages in Budgam during the Lok Sabha bypoll on April, purportedly as a shield against stone pelters.

A video grab showed the youth tied to an Army vehicle, eliciting sharp reactions from civil society. However, the Army backed Major Leetul Gogoi, who had tied Dar, and honoured with him with the Army chiefs Commendation Card for his sustained efforts in counter-insurgency operations.

He said he took the step to save local people.

The Army's claims that Dar was among the stone pelters was not substantiated by local police officials, who established Dar's statement that he was on his way to another village to for offering condolences.

Der Wetterdienst warnt vor Blitzeis von Mittwoch auf Donnerstag

Wo am Wochenende der erste Schnee fallen soll, erfahrt ihr im Video oben

Zwei Tiefdruckgebiete sorgen am Mittwoch immer wieder für Regen in Deutschland. Während es vormittags noch im Westen regnerisch ist, ziehen die Schauer später in den Südosten. Sonst erwartet uns echtes Novemberwetter. Tagsüber ist es meist bedeckt oder nebelig.

Ausnahmen dazu sind der Süden und Osten des Landes. Am Alpenrand weht der Föhn, der die Wolken und den Nebel in Oberbayern auflöst. Auch im Osten Deutschlands kann am Nachmittag vereinzelt die Sonne scheinen. Der Höchstwert in Dresden liegt bei 10 Grad.

Donnerstag der beste Tag der Woche

In der Nacht zum Donnerstag bleibt es bedeckt und es regnet immer wieder leicht. Bis zum Ende der Nacht hört der Regen dann aber auf. Es wird wieder nebelig. Die Tiefstwerte liegen zwischen 2 und 6 Grad. Der Wetterdienst warnt, dass mit Straßenglätte in den Morgenstunden gerechnet werden muss. Besondere Vorsicht ist im Osten und im Südosten geboten.

Der Donnerstag wird als bester Tag der verbleibenden Woche erwartet. Obwohl es mit viel Nebel losgeht, kommt noch oft die Sonne zum Vorschein.

Am Wochenende wird der erste Schneefall erwartet



Am Wochenende sollte man bestmöglich wenn möglich für einen Kurzurlaub verreisen. Denn dann wird es nass, kalt und windig. Am Freitag zieht Regen von Norden durch das Land. Dabei wird es windig. Am Samstag kommt neuer Regen aus Westen zu uns, dabei wird es teils sogar stürmisch.

In den Tieflagen ist am Sonntag sogar mit dem ersten Schnee zu rechnen. Davon sind vor allem Thüringen, Sachsen und Bayern betroffen.

Dès que tu quitteras la maternité avec tes jumeaux dans les bras, c'est vrai, tu auras souvent la tête sous l'eau.","Tu attends des jumeaux! Et oui, pas de bol, c'est tombé sur toi. UNE grossesse sur 100 (1,4% précisément), et paf, c'est toi qui a tiré la queue du Mickey. Mais ne panique pas, je sais que tu vas très bien t'en sortir, et je peux même te le promettre, tu vas adorer ça... Aujourd'hui, je vais partager avec toi les petites choses que j'ai apprises sur le tas (de couches) et qui peut-être faciliteront un peu ton quotidien de parent de jumeaux.

Les gens

Les jumeaux aiguisent la curiosité de tous. Tu seras abordée systématiquement dans la rue au volant de ta poussette double, et plusieurs fois par jour, tu expliqueras que oui, ce sont des jumeaux, oui, ce sont des vrais, ou bien des faux, que oui, il en faut bien du courage... les plus curieux te demanderont s'il y en a dans la famille, les plus intrusifs si tu as eu recours à un traitement de fertilité. Ne t'agace pas. Ça ne sert à rien, et je t'assure que les gens ne te veulent aucun mal. Souvent, derrière ces questions un peu insistantes, il y des histoires de filles qui n'arrivent pas à devenir mères, de grands-mères qui en ont élevé 8 dans des conditions difficiles, de mères qui ont perdu un bébé in utero... parfois les remarques anodines ne le sont pas tant que ça et répondre avec un sourire ne coûte finalement pas grand chose, même si c'est 10 fois par jour. Sinon, la bonne idée est de se déplacer ""incognito"", avec une poussette simple et un porte-bébé. Le convoi, beaucoup plus discret attire ainsi moins les curieux.

Congé parental

Attention au piège du congé parental. Effectivement, faire garder 2 bébés relève souvent de la mission impossible. Entre les frais de garde et les places disponibles en crèche ou chez les nounous, il est souvent tentant de prolonger son congé maternité pour s'occuper full time de ses jumeaux. Mais je le dis et je le répète, c'est TRÈS difficile de rester à la maison à temps plein avec 2 bébés. La solitude, le sentiment de tout gérer, la répétition des tâches au quotidien font parfois le lit de la grosse déprime. Alors pose toi les bonnes questions avant de faire ta demande de congé parental. En as-tu envie? Pour combien de temps? Penses-tu en avoir la force? Je sais bien que parfois la marge de manœuvre est étroite et que l'idéal est évidemment de choisir son statut plutôt que de le subir, mais Maman (ou Papa) au bureau ou Maman (ou Papa) à la maison, réfléchis bien à la question.

Allô Docteur

Le bébé malade sera ton quotidien les 2 premières années. Nez qui coule, otite, rhynite, bronchite, gastro, c'est la base. Inutile de prendre rendez-vous chez ton pédiatre dès que le thermomètre affiche 38, sinon, tu risques de passer plus de temps en salle d'attente que ma mère devant Danse avec les stars. L'important reste d'avoir un bon stock de Doliprane, de se faire un petit kit de secours pour les maladies les plus courantes, et de prendre son mal en patience. Je retiens 3 cas où la consultation reste inévitable : quand ton bébé est minuscule (nouveau-né, préma, petit poids), quand tu ""sens"" que ton bébé ne va pas bien, et quand les symptômes ne s'améliorent pas au bout de 24/48h. J'ajouterais un 4 ème motif de consultation : si tu es mega stressé (e) et que tu as besoin de voir un ORL dès que ton bébé toussote un peu, vas y, consulte. Inutile de rester des heures avec ton angoisse et va récupérer cette ordonnance de sirop pour la toux.

Kill me

Tu vas les adorer tes bébés, ils sont tellement choux ... mais il arrivera aussi que tu les détestes. Tu leur en voudras de se réveiller toutes les 2 heures chacun leur tour, tu leur en voudras de pleurer si fort et si souvent, tu leur en voudras de ne pas te laisser une minute seule au téléphone, une SEULE minute, même ça, c'est trop demander?!? Oui, ça arrivera, mais ne t'en veux pas. La culpabilité n'a jamais été la solution. Quand ils sont trop pénibles, j'essaie de me souvenir qu'ils n'ont pas choisi d'arriver par 2, qu'ils n'y sont pour rien, et que même s'ils ont renversé 4 fois leur verre de jus de pommes, ça n'est finalement que 2 fois par enfant.

FAQ

En plus de toutes les interrogations que tu auras sur la meilleure façon de les aider à grandir, tu te poseras tout un tas de questions spécifiques à la géméllité. Est-ce que je peux les habiller pareil? Est ce que c'est mieux de les mettre dans la même classe? Est ce que c'est vrai qu'il ne faut pas les appeler ""les jumeaux""? Est-ce que je ne les compare pas trop?.... Je n'ai aucune réponse à t'apporter, tu fais ce que TU VEUX, et quand tes enfants seront un peu plus grands, écoute les, tout simplement.

Frustration

Tu connaitras la frustration. Souvent. La gémellité casse le mythe de la maman louve, celle qui porte son bébé H24 en le regardant dans les yeux, celle qui passe les premières semaines en fusion totale avec son nouveau-né. Avec des jumeaux, c'est plus compliqué. Il faudra choisir entre donner à manger d'abord à celui qui pleure le plus fort, ou a celui qui attend depuis plus longtemps, entre changer d'abord celui qui a un érythème fessier, ou celui qui patauge dans 5 litres de pipi, entre serrer fort dans ses bras celui à qui on fait le vaccin ou rassurer l'autre qui panique... Ce sentiment de devoir se couper en deux, tu le connaitras souvent. Alors tu feras des choix, des ajustements, des petites concessions. Peut-être que tu ne feras pas de petits pots maison, peut-être que tu ne donneras pas de bain tous les soirs, peut-être que tu leur caleras le bib du matin avec un oreiller, alors que toi, dans l'idéal, tu aurais aimé les allaiter. C'est pas grave. Et n'oublie pas que la gémellité, (et la maternité d'ailleurs), c'est apprendre à accepter que tout ne se passe pas comme tu l'avais imaginé.

Shopping

Ne te laisse pas séduire par toute la puériculture disponible. Avec des jumeaux, le mètre carré disponible dans l'appartement est trop précieux pour que tu l'encombres avec une balancelle qui fait du bruit, un tapis d'éveil qui fait pouet-pouet et tout un tas d'autres objets dont on peut se passer. Pareil avec les vêtements, les biberons, les jouets... Ne double pas les achats systématiquement parce qu'ils sont deux.

Time flies

Enfin, n'oublie pas de profiter de chaque jour. Tous les parents reconnaissent que la petite enfance, ça passe trop vite. Pour les parents de jumeaux, ça passe ENCORE plus vite. Dès que tu quitteras la maternité avec tes jumeaux dans les bras, c'est vrai, tu auras souvent la tête sous l'eau. Mais pense toujours à la relever de temps en temps, et respire un peu. Pense à t'arrêter, juste quelques instants, pour regarder tes bébés. Ils sont ta plus grande fierté. Et je sais que tout comme moi, durant ces instants-là, tu mesureras l'incroyable chance que sur UNE grossesse sur 100, ce soit tombé sur toi...

Die einzige Behandlung, die ihn noch retten könnte, ist in Deutschland nicht zugelassen

Deshalb ist die Familie jetzt extra nach Seattle geflogen - und hofft auf eure Hilfe

Margit und Andreas Fischer haben nicht eine Sekunde gezögert, als sie sich in der Haunerschen Kinderklinik in München entscheiden mussten, ob ihr Sohn leben oder sterben soll. Raphael ist zwei Jahre alt und leidet an einer besonders aggressiven Form des Blutkrebses, der sogenannten akuten lymphatischen Leukämie (ALL).

Weil die Behandlungen in Deutschland nicht mehr anschlugen und es dadurch nur noch wenig Hoffnungen für den Jungen gab, empfahlen die Ärzte eine letzte Alternative: eine neuartige dreimonatige Immunbehandlung an der Westküste in Amerika.

Für die Eltern gab es keine Diskussionen. Ihr Sohn soll leben. Seit gut einer Woche ist die Familie jetzt an der Westküste der USA, um sich auf die Therapie vorzubereiten.

Raphael hat schon fünf Monate Chemo-Therapie hinter sich

Raphaels Leiden begann bereits, als er fünf Monate alt war. Nachdem eine Bronchitis bei ihm diagnostiziert worden war und wochenlang nicht verging, veranlasste der Kinderarzt eine Blutuntersuchung. Dabei machte er die schockierende Diagnose:

Raphael leidet an akuter lymphatischer Leukämie. Eine schmerzvolle und belastende Zeit begann für die Familie, die noch bis heute anhält.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Meine Tochter hatte Krebs - jetzt kämpft sie für andere Kinder

Der kleine Raphael musste einen fünfmonatigen Chemoblock, zwei Antikörperbehandlungen sowie zwei Knochenmarktransplantationen über sich ergehen lassen.

Zwar gab es Hoffnungsschimmer wie die Knochenmarkspende von seiner Mutter, die die Erkrankung vermeintlich bekämpfen konnte. Doch am Ende zeigte sich der Krebs widerspenstig. Die bösen Zellen waren wieder da.

Das soll sich jetzt im etwa 8500 Kilometer von Aschau entfernten Seattle ändern. Die Behandlung, die er jetzt bekommen soll, kann gefährliche Nebenwirkungen aufweisen. Doch in ähnlichen Fällen war sie bereits erfolgreich und führte zur Heilung.

Erst kürzlich wurde die Immuntherapie in den USA zugelassen. Laut Fachmedien zeigten klinische Studien, dass sie bei mehr als 80 Prozent der Patienten angeschlagen habe. Für Raphael ist diese Therapie die letzte Chance, den Blutkrebs endgültig zu besiegen.

Die Reise in die USA war für die Familie eine zusätzliche große Last. Doch sie war nötig. Denn in Deutschland ist die Behandlung derzeit weder zugelassen, noch können Kinder im Rahmen von klinischen Studien behandelt werden.

Margit und Andreas Fischer wollen erreichen, dass nicht nur Raphael, sondern auch andere Kinder mit Leukämie in Deutschland eine solche Chance bekommen.

Kinder wie Raphael sollten auch hier behandelt werden

Deshalb haben sie sich mit der gemeinnützigen Stiftung ""Care for Rare"" in Verbindung gesetzt und rufen zu Spenden auf. Die Stiftung setzt sich dafür ein, dass Kinder mit seltenen Erkrankungen nicht leiden oder gar sterben sollten.

Denn gerade weil ihre Erkrankung so selten ist, sollten sie noch mehr Aufmerksamkeit bekommen. Die Familie will eine Plattform für neue Immuntherapien am Haunerschen Kinderspital errichten, damit in Zukunft Kinder wie Raphael zur Behandlung nicht mehr in die USA geschickt werden müssen.

In Seattle beginnt bald Raphaels Therapie. Er musste wieder eine Chemotherapie über sich ergehen lassen, um die Krebszellen vor dem Therapiestart einzudämmen und ist daher etwas schwach. Die Familie und die Ärzte aber sind voller Hoffnung: Raphael soll leben.

Using these results, a group of human participants were then asked to make a series of faces look as ""healthy"" as possible.

Think those chiselled features, soft jawline or heart-shaped face that prompted you to swipe right on Tinder are just a matter of personal taste?

There could be more to those split-second decisions than you realise. In fact, they could actually be indicative of your prospective date's health.

A new Australian-led study has shown that your body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage and even your blood pressure show up in subtle cues on your face -- and we pick up on these cues without even realising it.

In the study, a computer model was trained to recognise these three health indicators for 272 Asian, African and Caucasian faces. Once trained, the model was then able to accurately predict the BMI, body fat and blood pressure of any individual, just by analysing an image of their face.

Using these results, a group of human participants were then asked to make a series of faces look as ""healthy"" as possible.

""We found that the participants altered the faces to look lower in fat, have a lower BMI and, to a lesser extent, a lower blood pressure in order to make them look healthier,"" explained study author and Macquarie University psychology researcher Dr Ian Stephen.

The researchers got the study participants to alter faces to make the look as ""healthy"" as possible -- and found the results were pretty accurate.

And even though the spatial differences between, for example, a face with a high body fat percentage compared to one with a high BMI were subtle and difficult to define, the participants were able to differentiate between them.

The findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that modern-day attraction has less to do with personal taste and more to do with our biological instincts than we might like to admit.

""There's always been this 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder' idea which essentially says that what we find attractive is just arbitrary and there is nothing inherent about an attractive person,"" Dr Stephens told HuffPost Australia.

""Evolutionary theory has chipped in on that and essentially says that attractiveness is essentially a mechanism for recognising healthy, fertile, appropriate mates and also healthy friends and allies, because there's obvious advantages to being friends with or mating with people who are healthy.""

Previous research has found that people who eat their fruits and veggies look and even smell more attractive to prospective partners than those who eat less healthily.

Dr Stephen was part of a team who found men in particular who eat a diet rich in fruit and vegetables smell more attractive to women than those who eat high-carbohydrate or high-fat diets.

Computer modelling of a person with a low ""healthy"" BMI (left) compared to the computer's model of a face with a high BMI.

Now, the international team of researchers are testing to see if the new facial modelling technology can be used as a diagnostic tool for other disorders, potentially improving access to diagnostic tools for people in remote communities.

""One research team is attempting to produce the models that it hopes will be able to screen for certain genetic conditions like Down syndrome or Turners syndrome, which are already known to have an influence on facial appearance,"" Dr Stephen said.

C'est en tout cas la mise en garde d'une étude publiée lundi 6 novembre dans la revue Pnas. Les chercheurs ont remarqué que l'année dernière, seuls 20 à 30% des personnes vaccinées contre la grippe ont été protégées.

Le problème viendrait d'une mutation de la souche du virus dominante de 2016, H3N2. La même souche a de bonnes chances de s'imposer cette année, ce qui devrait compliquer encore une fois l'efficacité de la vaccination.

C'est un problème récurrent avec la grippe. Il y a plusieurs souches très répandues du virus: H1, H2, H3, etc. On les appelle les ""hémagglutinines"". Les vaccins habituels reconnaissent la ""tête"" de cette protéine (la partie bleue).

Tête-à-queue

Problème: c'est cette partie de la protéine qui mute le plus et change d'année en année. Du coup, beaucoup de scientifiques cherchent à créer un vaccin qui cible la ""queue"" de la protéine (en rouge).

C'est le cas de l'université d'Oxford, qui a lancé le 3 octobre une première mondiale: un test clinique sur l'Homme d'un vaccin universel contre la grippe. Celui-ci va durer deux ans, avec la participation de 2000 patients.

Les chercheurs espèrent que l'effet durera au moins deux, voire quatre ans. Mais il faudra attendre la fin de l'essai clinique pour en avoir le coeur net. Même si celui-ci est un succès, d'autres tests plus importants seront nécessaires avant la commercialisation d'un éventuel vaccin.

Méthode prometteuse

Mais même si ce nouveau vaccin fonctionne, il pourrait bien en pas être si universel que cela. En effet, dans une étude publiée le 6 novembre dans Scientific Reports, des chercheurs affirment s'être rendu compte que la fameuse ""tige"" de l'hémagglutinine peut également muter, même si cela est beaucoup plus rare.

Problème insoluble? Pas sûr, rapporte Live Science. Toujours dans Scientific Reports, une autre étude, publiée le 2 novembre, est porteuse d'espoirs. Des scientifiques ont testé sur des souris une technique de vaccination très différente. Plutôt que de cibler la tige ou la tête, les chercheurs ont ciblé des gènes dits ""consensus"", ou ""ancestraux"".

Ce ne sont pas les meilleurs pour mettre au point un vaccin, mais ils ont un intérêt: ils se situent dans la région centrale du virus et sont donc présents dans de très nombreuses variations du virus de la grippe.

Des souris et des hommes

Les chercheurs ont créé un vaccin à partir de 4 de ces gènes et l'ont injecté à des souris. Ils ont ensuite exposé les rongeurs à 9 mutations mortelles du virus de la grippe. A haute dose, l'efficacité a été de 100% pour 8 des 9 virus. A des doses plus faibles, le vaccin a été efficace contre 7 des virus.

Cette dernière dose serait ""facilement traduisible chez l'humain"", affirment les auteurs. Mieux: injecté à des enfants, ce vaccin pourrait entraîner une immunité générale à la grippe.

Il ne faut pour autant pas s'emballer. De nombreux vaccins fonctionnels chez les animaux ne peuvent pas être transposés à l'homme. Il faudra dans tous les cas des années d'études et d'expériences pour savoir si ce vaccin fonctionne et est sans danger pour l'être humain.

Et même, notent les auteurs, les virus peuvent également s'adapter à de nouveaux vaccins à partir de gènes consensus. Il ne faut encore une fois pas perdre espoir: les chercheurs rappellent que plus les virus sont séquencés, plus on trouvera de nouveaux gènes de ce type pouvant être ciblés.

En attendant, il ne faut pas pour autant se dire que le vaccin actuel contre la grippe est inutile, loin de là. Même avec une efficacité modérée, l'impact global sur la mortalité des personnes âgées reste sensible. Selon une autre étude publiée en 2015, portant sur la période 2000-2009, plus de 2000 décès par an ont été évités grâce à la vaccination, avec une efficacité moyenne du vaccin chez les personnes âgées évaluée à 35%. Une couverture vaccinale portée à 75% permettrait d'en éviter 3000 supplémentaires, selon la même étude.

Für Amerika war die Wiederwahl von Trump ein noch viel schwärzerer Tag als vier Jahre zuvor.","US-Präsident Donald Trump wird am 4. November 2020 wiedergewählt werden

Die vergangenen vier Jahre konnten dem Präsidenten mehrere Vergehen nachgewiesen werden

Die Demokraten sind jedoch untereinander zu zerstritten, um die Wahl zu gewinnen

Ein Zukunftsszenario:

Von der Decke des Saals regnen rote Luftballons herab. ""Four more years!“, ruft das Publikum, darunter viele bereits ergraute Angehörige der unteren Mittelklasse.

Donald Trump steht noch hinter der Bühne und setzt einen Tweet ab: ""So sad for the crooked Dems, but America will be greater than ever before!“ Noch bevor er sein Smartphone im Jacket verschwinden lässt, hat er 20.000 Retweets.

► Dann schreitet Trump ans Podium, aus den Lautsprechern erklingt ""Hail to the Chief“, die traditionelle Präsidentenhymne in den USA.

Am Morgen dieses 4. November 2020, Stunden nach Schließung der Wahllokale, ist es gewiss: Donald Trump ist der alte und neue Präsident der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika. ""Greater than ever before“ war der wenig originelle, aber doch recht konsequent gewählte Wahlslogan.

Die ""New York Times"" und die ""Washington Post"" schwärzen in einer gemeinsamen Protestaktion ihre Titelseite. Jeder neu- und wiedergewählte US-Präsident hat bisher am Tag nach der Wahl eine Wahlsieger-Schlagzeile gehabt.

Diesen Triumph wollen ihm die liberalen Journalisten von der Ostküste nicht gönnen. Es soll ein Zeichen sein. Tatsächlich aber wirkt es wie eine Kapitulationserklärung.

Telefongespräch zwischen Trump und Putin veröffentlicht

Vier Jahre lang haben die besten investigativen Journalisten des Landes versucht, dem Immobilien-Milliardär schmutzige Tricks, zwielichtige Geschäfte und seine Nähe zur rechtsextremen ""Alt-Right-Bewegung“ nachzuweisen.

Sie haben Beweise dafür gefunden, dass Trumps Kampagne mit russischen Geldern mitfinanziert wurde, dass seine Wahlkampfhelfer im Jahr 2016 im direkten Kontakt mit dem Kreml standen.

Im Jahr 2019 hatte der russische Oppositionelle Alexej Nawalny in einer Netz-Doku sogar eine mit großer Wahrscheinlichkeit authentische Audioaufnahme eines Telefonats zwischen Trump und Wladimir Putin veröffentlicht, aus der einwandfrei klar wird, wie beide Politiker gemeinsam vereinbaren, die US-Wahl von 2016 zu manipulieren.

Für kurze Zeit sorgt die Doku für Wirbel in Washington. Selbst gemäßigte republikanische Senatoren fordern eine Amtsenthebung von Trump. Doch der öffentliche Druck fällt schnell in sich zusammen, als neue Berichte über Manipulationsvorwürfe bei den Vorwahlen der Demokraten bekannt werden.

""Hillary war auch nicht besser!“, ""Die da oben sind doch alle korrupt!“, ""Dann lieber einen, der erst gar nicht so tut, als ob er was Besseres sei!“, heißt es in den Kommentarspalten der Massenmedien.

Die Mauer nach Mexiko steht nur in Teilen

Die Kritik an den Eliten hat das System in den USA zerfressen. Die einfachen Bürger vertrauen den Politikern, den traditionellen Medien und den Entscheidungsträgern in der Wirtschaft nicht mehr.

Selbst Skandal-Enthüllungen haben keine Wirkung mehr, weil zu viele US-Bürger davon ausgehen, dass Skandale keine Ausnahme, sondern eher die Regel sind. Jeder habe doch Dreck am Stecken. Da könne man den einen nicht strafen, während man den anderen laufen lässt.

► Umgekehrt vertrauen jedoch auch die Eliten den einfachen Bürgern nicht mehr. Sie schotten sich noch weiter ab, als das bisher der Fall war. Geistig, räumlich und finanziell. Eine Steilvorlage für einen neuen elitenkritischen Wahlkampf.

Deshalb kommt Trump sogar mit seiner (aus Sicht der eigenen Anhänger) eher mäßigen Bilanz in der ersten Amtszeit davon. Die Mauer nach Mexiko steht bisher nur in Teilen, Nordkorea verfügt immer noch über Atomwaffen, die Einreisestopps für Muslime sind am Widerstand der Justiz und Bürgerrechtsbewegungen wie der ACLU gescheitert.

Die Zustimmungswerte für Trump sind auf einem gleichbleibend niedrigen Niveau. Das hat sich auch in einer gesunkenen Wahlbeteiligung am 3. November 2020 niedergeschlagen.

Krawalle im demokratischen Flügel

Doch so paradox das auch klingen mag: Sein Herausforderer Bernie Sanders hatte noch viel schlimmere Probleme. Während die immer stärker zu sozialistischen Positionen tendierende liberale Jugend ihm zujubelt, wandte sich das Partei-Establishment schnell von ihm ab – besonders, nachdem er dem Lobbysystem in Washington den Kampf angesagt hatte.

Andere warfen ihm vor, dass er mit seinen linken Programm das ideale Ziel für die rechte Wutbürger-Bewegung von Trump sei.

Dass Sanders' politische Ziele im herrschenden politischen Klima durchaus mehrheitsfähig gewesen wären, interessierte beim Nominierungsparteitag der Demokraten im August kaum noch jemanden.

Der Sozialist aus Vermont, der Amerika eigentlich wieder einen wollte, sah sich wüsten Beschimpfungen ausgesetzt. Es kam zu Krawallen vor der Veranstaltungshalle zwischen Bernie-Fans und Anhängern der Clinton-Familie, die sich über drei Tage hinzogen.

Rechte Medien nannten Sanders fortan nur noch den ""Vater des Mobs“ und schürten die Angst vor einer Machtübernahme durch gewalttätige Gruppen rund um Sanders.

Für Amerika war die Wiederwahl von Trump ein noch viel schwärzerer Tag als vier Jahre zuvor. Es hat sich gezeigt, dass das System nicht nur defekt, sondern auch dauerhaft nicht mehr in der Lage ist, eine echte Auseinandersetzung über politische Inhalte zu gewährleisten.

► Auch das ist ein Erbe der Trump-Ära: Wo Fakten nichts mehr wert sind, geht auch die Demokratie zugrunde.

Una nueva audiencia para planificar el juicio del Chapo, considerado uno de los mayores narcotraficantes del mundo y famoso por sus espectaculares escapadas de prisiones mexicanas, está prevista este miércoles en la corte federal de Brooklyn con el juez Brian Cogan, que lleva el caso.

El abogado del Chapo, Eduardo Balarezo, escribió al juez que su cliente sufre de alucinaciones auditivas, ""jaquecas constantes"", se siente perseguido y está deprimido. ""Se repite seguido"" y tiene dificultades para recordar ""personas, lugares y eventos"", añadió.

""La condición de Guzmán puede tornarlo incompetente si no es solucionada pronto"", advirtió Balarezo al juez en un documento judicial.

Lo que el gobierno mexicano calló sobre la recaptura del Chapo

El abogado defendió en el pasado a uno de sus rivales, el narco mexicano Alfredo Beltrán Leyva, condenado a cadena perpetua en abril tras ser extraditado a Estados Unidos en 2004. Pero asegura que esto no causa un conflicto en la defensa del Chapo y que su cliente concuerda.

Acusado de haber dirigido uno de los mayores imperios del narcotráfico de las Américas y de enviar más de 200 toneladas de cocaína a Estados Unidos, Joaquín Guzmán, de 60 años, enfrenta 17 cargos. Solo el primero, dirigir el cártel de Sinaloa, puede implicar la cadena perpetua.

El Chapo fue defendido por abogados de oficio desde su extradición a Estados Unidos el 19 de enero hasta el 3 de septiembre, cuando Balarezo, de origen ecuatoriano y con despacho en Washington DC, asumió su defensa.

El abogado Eduardo Balarezo habla con los medios, después de una audiencia en la corte federal de Brooklyn Federal, el pasado 14 de agosto.

Otros abogados que pretendían defenderlo, como Jeffrey Lichtman, que representó con éxito al hijo del legendario mafioso John Gotti, han quedado por ahora fuera del caso.

El gobierno estadounidense no ha conseguido incautar ni un dólar de la fortuna del Chapo, estimada en 14 mil millones de dólares (mdd). Antes de asumir su defensa, los abogados querían que la fiscalía asegurase por escrito que no confiscaría sus honorarios, pero no lo consiguieron.

Éste es el resumen de una entrevista telefónica de Balarezo con la AFP:

P: ¿Cuál es su principal objetivo en la audiencia de este miércoles?

R: Lo principal es que el juez autorice la visita de la psicóloga. Pero estoy seguro de que no va a autorizar la visita de contacto que estamos pidiendo, aunque sí a través de un vidrio.

La comunicación del Chapo con su esposa solo por carta (y monitoreada)

P: ¿Puede anticipar cuál será el eje de su defensa cuando el juicio comience el 16 de abril de 2018?

R: No todavía. Lo que puedo decir es que él no es culpable de los cargos. La ley lo presume inocente y la fiscalía tiene que probar su culpabilidad.

P: ¿Usted es hoy el único abogado del Chapo?

R: Soy el único abogado que lo está representando. En mi equipo habrá tres abogados más, asistentes legales e investigadores.

P: ¿Y qué pasó con Jeffrey Lichtman?

R: Él me contrató a mí y a Lichtman y cada uno teníamos nuestros equipos, pero no sé qué pasó con Lichtman. Eso es entre ellos.

P: ¿Usted ha recibido garantías del gobierno estadounidense de que el dinero del Chapo no será confiscado y podrá cobrar sus honorarios?

R: Todo lo que estoy haciendo es correcto y legal. La fiscalía no iba a dar ninguna respuesta, no me va a dar ninguna garantía. Lo que acordé con el cliente sobre mis honorarios es confidencial. Pero por supuesto que espero cobrar mis honorarios.

Los riesgos de atrapar al Chapo

P: ¿Cada cuánto tiempo visita al Chapo?

R: Yo lo veo semanalmente. La semana pasada lo ví el lunes y el miércoles. Mis asistentes lo ven diariamente. Pasa encerrado en una celda, sin ningún contacto con nadie. Ahora han instalado una ventanilla para poder pasar documentos y una pantalla para consultar documentos de manera simultánea, pero yo no he estado en esa sala aún, no estaba lista.

P: ¿Y cómo está de ánimo?

R: Él es una persona fuerte pero las condiciones de encarcelamiento le están haciendo efecto. Posiblemente esto afecte el juicio, por eso quiero la evaluación psicológica ahora.

Les frères Duffer ont promis que l'on en apprendrait plus sur Billy Hargrove dans la saison 3 de la série, dont le tournage n'a pas encore débuté.
D'après certaines rumeurs, cette nouvelle saison sortirait soit à la fin de l'année 2018, soit début 2019.","SÉRIES - Attention spoilers. Apparu dans la seconde saison de ""Stranger Things"", Billy Hargrove est devenu ""l'antagoniste humain"" des adolescents de la série Netflix, selon les les frères Duffer, créateurs de la série.

Exécrable, le personnage campé par Dacre Montgomery est caricatural au possible. Les créateurs de la série ont révélé que la plupart des personnages étaient justement basés sur des stéréotypes: par exemple, avant de devenir l'un des protagonistes majeurs, Dustin était censé être un simple nerd. Au même titre, Billy serait le stéréotype de l'adolescent imbu de lui-même, tombeur invétéré qui se croit tout permis.

Souvent taxé de brute, critiqué pour son racisme envers Lucas et pour sa violence envers sa demi-sœur Max, Billy Hargrove est dans un premier temps présenté comme un gars brutal, qui intimide et frappe tout ce qui lui passe sous les yeux (et les poings). La vidéo de l'audition de Dacre Montgomery laisse clairement sous-entendre ce comportement agressif.

Derrière sa coupe mulet et ses crises de nerfs, le personnage semble cependant être beaucoup plus complexe que ça. La saison, ne donne pas énormément de détails sur son passé mais, nous savons que Max est sa demi-sœur (son père s'est remarié avec la mère de l'adolescente), qu'ils habitaient avant en Californie et qu'il la blâme de ce déménagement soudain dans la petite ville de Hawkins. Dans une scène du huitième épisode de la seconde saison, on découvre que le père de Billy est un imbécile abusif et fanatique qui ne sait communiquer avec son fils qu'avec violence et menaces. Pas étonnant donc que le fiston suive l'exemple de son paternel et ait quelques lacunes socialement parlant.

Mais c'est Steve Harrington, personnage interprété par Joe Keery qui justement est passé d'antipathique à sympathique au fil de la série, que Billy prend en grippe dès le début de la saison. Cependant, les raisons de ce déchaînement de haine et de ce harcèlement ne sont pas clairement expliquées.

Steve Harrington est certes l'un des garçons les plus populaires de Hawkins High et Billy souhaite peut-être le défier pour affirmer son statut de mâle alpha, mais pour les deux acteurs, il y a plus que ça. Loin de la simple intimidation, Steve devient rapidement une obsession pour Billy...

Dans une déclaration à Vulture​​​, Joe Keery fait le rapprochement entre la scène mythique du match de volley dans ""Top Gun"" et celle du match de basket dans ""Stranger Things"": ""C'est la même sorte d'ambiance homoérotique, surtout en ce qui concerne la scène de basket, cela me rappelle totalement une compétition de volley dans 'Top Gun'. Je ne sais pas si c'est ce que les Duffers avaient l'intention de faire, mais c'est intéressant que les gens s'en occupent. Je pense que nous aborderons peut-être cela l'année prochaine. ""

Marshable a par la suite demandé à Dacre Montgomery s'il était possible que Billy éprouve des sentiments homosexuels pour Steve, sentiments que l'adolescent tenterait de cacher en étant violent... et la réponse de l'acteur laisse la porte ouverte à toute interprétation: ""Nous parlions de l'idée selon laquelle Billy se sent menacé par Steve ou émasculé d'un certain point de vue.

Je pense qu'il se sent menacé par Steve, mais nous ne sommes par allés plus loin. C'est intéressant.""

Devant tant d'ambiguïtés, Twitter et Tumblr se sont évidemment emparés de cette possible histoire d'amour et les fans de la série ont même créé un hashtag avec les noms des deux personnages: #Harringrove.

Pour le moment, cette théorie divise les téléspectateurs, certains approuvent totalement le couple, d'autres ne voient que de l'aversion entre les deux personnages.

D'ailleurs, depuis la diffusion de la première saison de ""Stranger Things"", des voix s'élèvent sur Twitter dénonçant l'absence de représentation homosexuelle dans la série.

Stranger Things, Stranger Things, la chose la plus étrange dans cette ville c'est leur degré d'hétérosexualité — A very XMAS TrouTrou (@Trouillet_) 5 novembre 2017

Dacre Montgomery s'est aussi exprimé, dans une interview à Newsweek, sur le soit-disant racisme de Billy. Ce dernier menace Max quand il se rend compte qu'elle devient ami avec Lucas: ""Je ne pense pas que ce soit à cause de sa couleur de peau. Il aime sa sœur Max et si un autre enfant l'avait embêtée, il aurait certainement réagit de la même manière"".

Les frères Duffer ont promis que l'on en apprendrait plus sur Billy Hargrove dans la saison 3 de la série, dont le tournage n'a pas encore débuté. D'après certaines rumeurs, cette nouvelle saison sortirait soit à la fin de l'année 2018, soit début 2019.

""La saison 3 de Stranger Things a été confirmée par les frères Duffer, les premières prévisions de diffusion seraient soit fin 2018, soit début 2019.""

Un peu de patience donc, nous serons bientôt de retour à Hawkins.

En français, cette démarche se traduit notamment par l'usage de graphies du type étudiant·e·s, inscrit·e·s, etc., qui a fait l'objet d'une recommandation du Haut Conseil à l'égalité en 2015. Qu'elle soit efficace ou non pour l'émancipation des femmes, l'écriture inclusive n'en est pas moins sujette à des réactions passionnelles et à de virulents discours idéologiques – pour preuve cette condamnation officielle de l'Académie française il y a quelques jours. À en croire les immortel·le·s – qui comptent quatre femmes pour trente hommes, ""la langue française se trouve désormais en péril mortel, ce dont notre nation est dès aujourd'hui comptable devant les générations futures"".

On peine à concevoir comment le français dans son ensemble, a fortiori le français parlé par quelque 270 millions de locuteurs selon les estimations officielles, pourrait se voir exposé à un ""péril mortel"" par la simple adoption de nouvelles conventions graphiques. Des écritures inclusives ont cours dans des langues de grande communication telles que le portugais, l'espagnol, l'allemand ou l'anglais, sans que ces dernières ne donnent aucun signe de ""péril mortel"". On sait en outre que loin d'être en péril, le français conquiert au contraire du terrain, en France comme dans l'Afrique dite ""francophone"", aux dépens de centaines de langues autochtones en danger avéré de disparition. L'État français et l'Organisation internationale de la Francophonie y travaillent sans relâche, en investissant chaque année des sommes colossales dans sa promotion.

Au-delà de la querelle inclusive, cette condamnation s'inscrit dans la lignée d'interventions hostiles, de la part de l'Académie, à l'égard de la féminisation des noms de métiers, de la promotion des langues régionales, de l'usage de l'anglais dans les institutions internationales, du franglais, du ""néo-argot des banlieues"", ou de la rectification orthographique recommandée par le Conseil supérieur de la langue française. L'Académie coche ainsi toutes les cases, ou presque, des différents discours idéologiques dominants analysés en sociologie du langage: pour la variété normée du français sur laquelle elle prétend exercer le monopole, contre les autres langues et variétés orales ou écrites de français, jugées illégitimes et menaçantes.

Dans cette ""solennelle mise-en-garde"" adoptée à l'unanimité contre l'écriture inclusive, les sociolinguistes reconnaîtront côte à côte discours de mise-en-péril, purisme et idéologie de la langue standard. L'écriture inclusive y est envisagée comme étrangère à la langue, impure et animée par des visées impures. Elle remet en question la norme écrite standard par l'ajout de ""formes secondes et altérées"", aboutissant à une ""langue désunie, disparate"".

De tels discours idéologiques, s'agissant du français comme d'autres langues dominantes, s'interprètent comme constitutifs de la reproduction des élites: il s'agit en définitive de défendre le monopole sur la norme standard exercé par des classes dirigeantes majoritairement masculines, pour mieux légitimer leur accès exclusif au pouvoir.

Die deutsche wie die internationale Presse reagiert mit Empörung auf die Enthüllungen

Die Paradise Papers sorgen für Empörung auf der ganzen Welt. Großkonzerne, Promis, Superreiche – die Enthüllungen belegen ausführlich, dass weltweit Unternehmen und Privatpersonen bei der Steuer tricksen.

“Skrupellose Eliten vermeiden ihre gerechte Besteuerung, während Otto-Normal-Verbraucher zuhause Straßen, Schulen und Sozialausgaben finanziert”, bringt es Birgit Marshall für die “Rheinische Post” auf den Punkt.

Klar ist: Laut Wirtschaftsexperte Gabriel Zucman verliert allein die Bundesrepublik jedes Jahr 17 Milliarden Euro an Einnahmen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Paradise Papers"": Liebe Eliten, wundert euch nicht, wenn die Menschen AfD wählen, es liegt auch an eurem Verhalten

Politik in Bedrängnis

""Spiegel""-Journalist Jakob Augstein findet in seinem Kommentar harte Worte für den laxen Umgang der Bundesrepublik mit den superreichen Steuersündern. ""Das System ist zutiefst krank"", schreibt er. Und die Wut darauf wachse. ""Sie sucht sich nur die falschen Ziele. Der Hass der Betrogenen gilt eher dem Kriegs- als dem Steuerflüchtling"", bemerkt Augstein. Und ergänzt: ""Unser Planet ist ein Paradies für Arschlöcher.""

Auch die internationale Presse sieht die Politik in der Bringschuld, die Steueroasen durch härteres Vorgehen zu zerschlagen. “Um dieser Situation ein Ende zu bereiten, sollte man jene beiden Kräfte zerstören, die sie aufrechterhalten”, schreibt die französische Zeitung “Le Monde”: ""Die grenzenlose Gier einiger weniger und die Untätigkeit der Staaten.” Letzteres sei dabei nicht unbedingt einfacher anzugehen, als Ersteres.

Denn dass Unternehmen und Einzelpersonen sich Steuerparadiese wie den Kaiman Inseln, Malta, oder Bermuda bedienen, um Geld zu horten, ist spätestens seit den “Panama Papers” bekannt. Passiert ist jedoch nicht viel, um die Steuertrickser zur Rechenschaft zu ziehen.

Marshall von der “Rheinischen Post” glaubt, dass die “unerträgliche Schieflage” gefährliche Stimmungen verschärfen könne: “Gerade demokratisch gewählte Regierungen verlieren Glaubwürdigkeit, wenn es ihnen weiterhin nicht gelingt, die Reichsten ausreichend zu besteuern”, kommentiert sie.

Mehr noch: Ranghohe Politiker wie US-Handelsminister Wilbur Ross sind selbst in die Enthüllungen verwickelt.

""Bild""-Zeitung: Auch der kleine Mann trickst bei der Steuer

Der einzige Trost sei, dass die Digitalisierung für mehr Transparenz sorgen werde, weil Dateien gehackt werden können, folgert die belgische Zeitung “De Tijd”. “Jedes neue Leck stellt die steuerliche Doppelmoral bloß.”

Olaf Gersemann von der “Welt” ist da anderer Meinung. Er sieht in den Offshore-Geschäften keine Doppelmoral. “Konten in Steueroasen sind im Grunde nichts anderes als das Bargeld des reichen Mannes: desjenigen, der mehr Geld besitzt, als sich in Matratzen oder Wandtresoren verstauen ließe”, behauptet er in einem Kommentar.

Die “Bild”-Zeitung argumentiert sogar, auch der “kleine Mann” würde gerne mal bei der Steuer tricksen. Mehr als 40 Milliarden Euro gingen in Deutschland jedes Jahr durch alltäglichen Steuerschummel verloren, heißt es in dem Bericht.

„Dahinter stecken häufig dieselbe Gier, dieselben egoistischen Motive, einfach sparen zu wollen“, zitiert die “Bild” den Chef der Deutschen Steuergewerkschaft, Thomas Eigenthaler. Der Steuerexperte vermutet, dass viele Leute für sich beschließen: “Wenn die da oben sich das erlauben, dann erlaube ich mir das auch.“

Enthüllungen wie die Paradise Papers könnten dieses Gefühl noch verstärken.

Wieso sind Steueroasen schlecht?

Aber darf man Steueroasen grundsätzlich verteufeln? Die “Neue Zürcher Zeitung” springt jedenfalls für sie in die Bresche: “Offshore-Geschäfte gehören zu einer globalen Welt. Manchmal sind sie notwendig und manchmal Ausdruck von Missständen, kaum je aber deren Ursache”, heißt es.

Den internationalen Steuerwettbewerb anhand einiger missbräuchlicher Beispiele generell als kriminell hinzustellen, sei deshalb fahrlässig.

Die Londoner “Times” meint Offshore-Zentren hätten zwar prinzipiell eine legitime Rolle, würden sie doch “Besitztümer vor dem Zugriff durch Schurkenstaaten schützen.” Meistens, so räumt die britische Zeitung ein, wären sie jedoch dazu da, um Superreichen zu helfen.

While lots of us like to think we would leave without a second thought, the reality of life and being invested in your partner - marriage, children, a shared home and future plans - means it isn’t always so black and white.

For most people in a relationship , finding out that your partner has cheated seems like the worst thing that could possibly happen. But often the hardest part isn’t the revelation itself, it is working out what to do next.

1. Don’t try to talk until you’ve calmed down.

In the immediate aftermath of your discovery, you are of course going to be angry. And while you shouldn’t hold back in sharing this anger with your partner, you should also be cautious about saying things in the heat of the moment that you cannot unsay, or you may live to regret when you’re not seeing red.

Sex and relationship expert Tracey Cox, tells HuffPost UK: “Delay the discussion until you’ve both calmed down. Talking while you’re furious accomplishes little more than saying hurtful things you may regret later. And work out exactly what you want to say beforehand.”

2. Give yourself some space.

When your trust in your partner is shattered, and everything you thought you had seems to have dissolved around you, it can be tempting to overcompensate by spending all your time together and not letting them out of your sight.

But in order to get some perspective on your relationship together, it is important to give yourself some space to think things through.

Sarah Ryan, a relationships expert and director of her own matchmaking agency, says: “If you really want to find a way to make your relationship work you’ll have to give yourself some space to work out what you truly want, what it is that you’re feeling and healing all the hurts that come with cheating - ensure to really practise the art of letting go to save yourself holding onto animosity.”

And Vasia Toxavidi, a psychotherapist and counsellor with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, agrees: “Some controlling may take place by the partner who has been cheated on due to loss of trust, but it is important for that person to focus and take care of themselves.”

3. Ask yourself if you are capable of total forgiveness.

During this time when you are giving yourself space, the most important question you should be asking yourself is whether you are capable of totally forgiving your partner - this is the only way this is going to work (holding a grudge doesn’t help anyone).

Cox says: “Some relationship crimes hurt us more than others because of our backgrounds and family history. Cheating is harder to forgive for someone who has a history of partners who’ve been unfaithful or whose parents had a painful split. Forgiveness is the first step, learning to trust again is the next.

“How will you know if they’ve done it again? Did you see the signs the last time? Has something significant changed to ensure they won’t do it again?”

And Ryan agrees: “Without fully forgiving your partner after they have been unfaithful then you run the risk of harbouring negative energy and feelings which will come out in the wash when resistance or minor conflicts naturally occur within a relationship.”

4. Start by working on a basic friendship.

Expecting your relationship to go back to how it was before is probably naive, so instead of jumping back into your old roles straight away, try having a basic friendship that focuses on trust and respect.

Ryan says: “You need to rediscover an understanding of each other as friends first and foremost before you can move forward romantically, at the end of the day thats how every relationship develops because you date and become romantically involved with your best friend.

“Really understanding when and how you may have stopped being friends can help you interpret when respect may have left your relationship.”",7 Tips If You’re Trying To Stay With Your Partner After They Cheated,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/11/08/7-tips-if-you-re-trying-to-stay-with-your-partner-after-they-cheated_a_23270455/

Move over Roger, Rover and Jack, make way for brand Made in India.

In a first, the Indian army is planning to induct the homebred Mudhol hound into the defence forces, apart from the familiar foreign breeds, like German Shepherds, Labradors and Great Swiss Mountain.

As the Hindu reported, the Mudhol, a cross between Persian and Turkish dogs, was peculiar to the region of Bagalkot in Karnataka, bred by the Ghorpade kings. These lanky creatures are known for their stamina and fighting spirit. They also have, reputedly, sharper and quicker reflexes than their foreign counterparts.

A bunch of these potential candidates are being trained at the Remount and Veterinary Corps (RVC) centre in Meerut in Uttar Pradesh, while six dogs are already ready to join the forces in Jammu & Kashmir later this year.

RVC personnel have asked the Karnataka Veterinary, Animal and Fisheries Sciences University (KVAFSU) for a second batch of eight pups, The Hindu added.

The massive document leak known as Paradise Papers reveals that 714 Indians are linked to tax havens including Bollywood veteran Amitabh Bachchan, corporate lobbyist Niira Radia, liquor baron and fugitive Vijay Mallya, Union Minister Jayant Sinha and Sanjay Dutt's wife Manyata.

India ranks 19 among 180 countries in the number of names in the list.

The Indian Express reported today that Bachchan, whose name also appeared in the Panama Papers leak in 2016, became a shareholder of a digital media company incorporated in Bermuda in 2002, one year after he hosted the first season of the TV show Kaun Banega Crorepati.

The newspaper noted that it was unclear if Bachchan had reported his shareholding in the Bermuda-based Jalva Media Ltd to the Reserve Bank of India (as required by Indian law at the time).

In 2005, a notice published in The Bermuda Sun described the company as a ""bad debtor"" which stands ""dissolved.""

Over 13 million files revealed on Sunday, the bulk from two centuries-old Bermuda-based law firm Appleby, contain details of the offshore holdings of top politicians, celebrities and corporations. The documents were obtained by German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and investigated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in collaboration with 96 media organizations.

The data reveals that Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has $13 million of her private money invested in off shore funds based in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda.

The documents also reveal that US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has business ties to a shipping firm linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin's son-in-law Kirill Shamalov.

Another notable finding in the Paradise Papers is about Stephen Bronfman, the top fund raiser and senior advisor to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Brofman, according to the documents, was involved in moving millions of dollars to offshore tax havens.

Among the Indians, the Paradise Papers also names corporate lobbyist Niira Radia who was at the centre of the Radia Tapes media scandal in 2010.

The Indian Express reported today that Radia was part of two offshore companies based in Malta. She was director of the Suez La Vallette Limited in April 2012 and the Pegasus International Advisors Limited in August 2011.

Radia was ""removed"" from Suez La Vallette Limited in August 2014 and ""resigned"" in February 2014 from Pegasus International Advisors Limited, the newspaper reported.

Union Minister Jayant Sinha features in the Paradise Papers because he was the managing director of Omidyar Network, which invested in D. Light, a US company that has a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands.

Sinha, who resigned from the company in 2013, was elected to parliament in 2014. In a series of tweets today, the minister responded to being listed in the Paradise Papers.

""These were bonafide and legal transactions undertaken on behalf of highly reputed world-leading organisations in my fiduciary role as Partner at Omidyar Network and its designated representative on the D.Light Board. All these transactions have been fully disclosed to relevant authorities through all necessary filings as required,"" the minister said, adding, ""It is crucial to note that these transactions were done for D.Light as an Omidyar representative, and not for any personal purpose.""

Manyata, Sanjay Dutt's wife, also appears in the Paradise Papers under her former name Dilnashin. The Indian Express reported that she is the director Nasjay Company Limited, set up in the Bahamas in April 2010.

Her spokesperson told the newspaper, ""As per the requirements of provisions of Income-tax Act, 1961, all the properties, company or body corporate or shares in any company are declared in the balance sheet.""

Et les conséquences sont de taille. Outre les accidents de la route provoqués par le manque de visibilité (voir la vidéo en tête de l'article), le smog a un impact direct sur la santé des habitants, notamment les plus vulnérables. Ainsi, les autorités indiennes ont ordonné ce mercredi 8 novembre la fermeture de toutes les écoles de la capitale indienne pour le reste de la semaine. Objectif : protéger les poumons des enfants de cet effroyable épisode de pollution.

Cette mesure est une extension de la fermeture, décidée la veille, des écoles primaires uniquement. Il faut dire que le taux de particules fines qui empoisonnent l'air a de quoi alarmer les autorités. Mercredi, les différents compteurs placés dans la ville affichaient des niveaux dangereux, entre 400 et 700. Par comparaison, l'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) recommande de ne pas dépasser 25.

He downplayed sexual harassment claims against Trump; now the public has learned that Halperin behaved similarly with younger female colleagues.
Halperin’s power to shape political narratives has taken a severe hit.","On Nov. 2, New York Times columnist and noted husband of his former research assistant David Brooks graced the American reading public with his musings on the current wave of public sexual harassment allegations.

Brooks’ column was quickly mocked across social media, especially his choice to dub sex “a golden nugget” and his normcore take on arousing pop songs. But what’s really odd and befuddling about his take was this blithe lede: “The world seems full of sexual predators these days.”

Brooks doesn’t explain the basis for implying that there are more sexual predators today than before (in fact, even the recent accusations against film producer Harvey Weinstein and several other high-profile men span many decades), or for later asserting that the line between men seeking sexual pleasure and men preying on unwilling women is “blurrier” now than in the past. Presumably sexual harassment was easy for Brooks to ignore before the news cycle became saturated with it.

In this, Brooks fell prey to the sort of ahistoricism that certainly isn’t new, but which has felt intrusively ubiquitous during this painful, exhausting year. Everything is worse than it has ever been; we have never needed salvation more than we do now. America’s standing in the world, political divisions, race relations, treatment of women ― evidence notwithstanding, mainstream discussions often take for granted that these things have never been at a lower ebb.

Perhaps the most representative phrase for a year in opposing Trump is, fittingly, “Now more than ever.” Over the past 12 months, the media, institutions and public figures have worn the phrase out, leaving “now more than ever” a brittle husk, a cliché that conjures an eye roll rather than a sense of urgency.

After the election of President Donald Trump, we needed the arts now more than ever; we needed a free press now more than ever; we needed comedy now more than ever; we needed political dialogue now more than ever. Each individual cause or pursuit that seemed distasteful or trivial in the new state of political panic had to be defended, and each time the defense was the same: The very environment that makes this seem unimportant is the reason that it’s important.

“Now more than ever” leverages the weight of history while simultaneously turning away from it. To say that we have never been in such dire straits is a powerful statement because history is long and full of dire straits ― plagues, genocides, wars ― and yet now is somehow worse. But that assertion only holds up as long as one doesn’t actually look back on those plagues, genocides and wars. We can say that America is in the lowest place we can remember, but it likely requires us to forget or downplay events in our own lifetimes, from the Jim Crow era to the September 11 attacks. We can imagine that sexual harassment is a new problem, but that requires us to ignore the Anita Hill hearings, the accusations against Bill Clinton and, frankly, the entire history of men having power over women.

This attitude is somehow both nerve-jangling and soothing. It’s like declaring bankruptcy: A painful road lies ahead, but you have permission to forget about any embarrassingly awful turns you made to arrive here. Shocked Trump was elected? Surprised about the sexual harassment faced by all your female colleagues? Blindsided by the rise of the white nationalist movement? Don’t waste time grappling with the fact that you didn’t bother to vote, or sat silently when your male coworkers made sexist jokes, or ignored the targeted aggression faced by black women online in recent years. Focus on the particularly fierce urgency of now.

Both Trump’s slogan, “Make America Great Again,” and the rallying retort from his opponents, “America Is Already Great,” traffic in this sort of convenient amnesia: Either way, America starts from a base point of greatness. Either way, its ugly roots in mass genocide, human trafficking and forced labor have been swept aside.

The winners write the history books, and in America the winners have always been white men. Even when human rights for the oppressed have triumphed, powerful white men on both sides have been motivated to minimize the past injustices and to glorify their own roles. Many of the narratives now accepted as common wisdom were composed with a power-consolidating agenda. These narratives demonize or ignore people of color; they sow distrust of women’s words.

With the racist backlash to the election of President Barack Obama, followed by the election of Trump, who has used rhetoric favored by white nationalists, white Americans have been confronted with a racial divide in the country that our national mythologists had been working for centuries to paper over. It seems worse now than ever; it’s not. Before, though, the suffering of people of color, and especially black people, was submerged beneath our self-congratulatory national narratives.

Men have been similarly blindsided by the recent wave of sexual assault and harassment allegations against industry leaders ― or, at least, blindsided that anyone cares. Brooks isn’t the only one to wax astonished at this new wave of sexual misconduct. But the crimes existed before this month, and the perpetrators were enabled and protected by willful ignorance and anti-feminist cultural narratives.

“This tsunami of stories doesn’t just reveal the way that men have grabbed and rubbed and punished and shamed women; it shows us that they did it all while building the very world in which we still have to live,” wrote Rebecca Traister last month. She noted, in particular, the spate of sexual harassment allegations against political reporter Mark Halperin ― a man whose book, Game Change, largely defined the narrative of the 2008 election.

“The same power that afforded Halperin the ability to allegedly rub up against younger colleagues,” wrote Traister, “also meant that he got to shape the nation’s view of a woman whose political story had already been shaped by other men who abused their power.” His take on Hillary Clinton, she pointed out, was a harsh, nuance-free portrait of “a grasping and scandal-plagued woman.” His coverage of Trump, in the 2016 election, was relatively flattering. He downplayed sexual harassment claims against Trump; now the public has learned that Halperin behaved similarly with younger female colleagues.

Halperin’s power to shape political narratives has taken a severe hit. A planned book on Trump’s campaign was scuttled by Penguin following the allegations, and HBO dropped a planned movie based on the book. But, as Traister notes, we still have to live with the narratives he propagated.

Consider the 2016 Democratic primary. Even as the party is undoubtedly divided and in disarray, postmortems are met with annoyance and outrage from whichever group was satisfied with existing narratives. When Bernie Sanders supporters spent the weeks after the election chorusing, “Bernie would have won,” centrist Democrats were dismissive. When Clinton came out with a book about her 2016 campaign, critics across the political spectrum sniped that she needed to go away and be quiet rather than pick at the party’s wounds. This is framed as a call to “move on” or to “look ahead,” and can be directed at anyone, on any side of the divide, who wants to re-litigate an aspect of the primary. But perpetually looking ahead, or ― still worse ― looking only at the present moment, only ensures that we will continue to live with damagingly false ideas about our past.

And, as William Faulkner wrote, the past is never past. We continue to live within societies and institutions shaped by what has happened to us.

In 2014, Ta-Nehisi Coates published a powerful case for reparations in The Atlantic. “Won’t reparations divide us?” he wrote. “Not any more than we are already divided. The wealth gap merely puts a number on something we feel but cannot say ― that American prosperity was ill-gotten and selective in its distribution. What is needed is an airing of family secrets, a settling with old ghosts.” Until we fully reckon with the crimes of America’s history, and reconstruct a national identity that incorporates a full understanding of them, he argues, those crimes continue to reverberate throughout our society.",'Now More Than Ever' And The Distracting Urgency Of Our Words,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/now-more-than-ever-and-the-distracting-urgency-of-our-words_us_5a01db50e4b066c2c03a6c9f?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009

Tall ist kein Unbekannter. Er wurde 2013 mit dem RTL Comedy Grand Prix ausgezeichnet. 2016 bekam er den deutschen Comedypreis als Bester Newcomer.

""Die Leute sind ausgerastet vor Freude""

Er findet: Man muss Witze über Minderheiten machen, weil man sie gerade so – und nur so – nicht ausgrenzt.

In einer Show erzählte er von einem Erlebnis, das dazu geführt habe, dass Behinderte und Nicht-Betroffene unverkrampfter miteinander umgegangen seien. Eben weil er über einen Rollstuhlfahrer vor tausenden Menschen gewitzelt habe (siehe Video):

""Die Leute sind ausgerastet vor Freude, dass wir ihn alle normal behandelt haben"", sagt Tall. Leider habe er dieses Aha-Erlebnis erst gegen Ende der Tournee gehabt.

Mehr als 50.000 Menschen gefällt der Show-Ausschnitt auf Facebook. Das spricht dafür, dass er mit seiner Meinung nicht alleine dasteht.

Bei Tall klingt das nicht nur vorgeschoben oder wie eine einfache Rechtfertigung für billigen Spaß. Weil Tall sich selbst und jeden anderen genauso gnadenlos auslacht. Gleichberechtigung sozusagen. Für ihn gibt es nur einen einzigen Grund, nicht über Minderheiten zu lachen: wenn der Witz nicht gut ist.

""Nachher sind sie ganz locker""

Die Menschen zusammenbringen, das ist der Punkt. Dass das Behinderte selbst so sehen, zeigt Phil Hubbe. Der Comiczeichner ist an Multiple Sklerose erkrankt. Trotzdem oder gerade deswegen zeichnet er Karikaturen über Menschen mit Behinderungen und macht Witze über Gehandicapte.



Er sagt: ""Als ich angefangen habe, war auch der Punkt: Naja, Witze über Behinderte, muss man da vielleicht irgendwas reinbringen, irgendwas Pädagogisches? Das funktioniert nicht. Den Zeigefinger da rein, das ist völliger Quatsch.""

Und weiter: ""Wenn man zeichnen will, muss erst der Witz funktionieren und bei einigen, die regen dann auch zum Nachdenken an. Und deshalb freue ich mich zu sehen, wenn in Ausstellungen Betroffene und Nicht-Betroffene dann zusammenstehen. Also erst dieses Verkrampfte und dann nachher sind sie ganz locker.""

The ""Paradise Papers"" leak of offshore tax haven documents suggests Canada is losing much more money to tax avoidance than previously estimated, says a watchdog group.

The ""Paradise Papers"" leak of offshore tax haven documents suggests Canada is losing much more money to offshore tax havens than previously estimated, says a watchdog group.

Canadians for Tax Fairness estimates that Canada's government loses between $10 billion and $15 billion annually ""due to corporate tax dodging using tax havens."" Prior to the Paradise Papers, it had estimated the losses at $5 billion to $8 billion annually.

The group's director Dennis Howlett noted that the Paradise Papers show, on a per capita basis, Canadians are twice as likely to use offshore tax havens as Americans.

He suggested that may be due to the fact that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is ""much more aggressive and much more effective"" in pursuing tax evasion, though that ""that may change because of Trump's administration.""

Canadians for Tax Fairness is adding its voice to a growing chorus accusing Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) of ""misleading"" Canadians about the government's fight against tax havens.

The Paradise Papers, a leak of some 13.4 million records mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, included the names of at least 3,300 Canadians who have reportedly stashed money abroad. Among them were three former Canadian prime ministers — Brian Mulroney, Jean Chretien and Paul Martin — as well as the Liberal party's top fundraiser, Stephen Bronfman.

Though the use of offshore accounts is not itself illegal, they're are often tied to illegal activities, including failure to report income.

Former Prime Minister Jean Chretien speaks at the 50 Years of Standing Up for Canada event in Toronto, Jan. 21, 2014. Chretien has denied any impropriety after his name appeared in the Paradise Papers leak of offshore tax haven documents.

The Canada Revenue Agency issued a statement amid the Paradise Papers leak, saying it would not hesitate to investigate new evidence of tax evasion.

But some accused the agency of exaggerating its efforts.

""The CRA are up to their old tricks of trying to mislead Canadians, this time in response to the latest leak of tax haven information,"" Sen. Percy Downe, a Liberal-appointed senator who now sits as an Independent, said in a statement issued Tuesday.

Downe referred to the CRA's assertion of a ""billion-dollar investment"" to combat tax evasion in the two most recent budgets, and said the agency had in fact spent less than $40 million of that money.

""They also describe hundreds of audits and dozens of investigations, but when you go to the CRA website to look for the results of these activities, you see very little evidence of convictions and sentences for overseas tax evasion,"" Downe said, noting the CRA seems to have much better luck securing convictions for domestic tax evasion.

Howlett largely agreed with Downe's assessment.

""They point to all the investigations underway, but there are not many convictions,"" Howlett told HuffPost Canada in an interview.

""Often, there is no public information available. So we have no idea whether they forced people to pay the full tax bill. We don't know who's been convicted.""

Howlett lauded some of the CRA's recent efforts, but said the agency ""doesn't have a chance"" of combatting the problem effectively until loopholes in Canada's tax laws are closed.

Canada falling behind

Currently, Canada has tax treaties with a number of countries known to be tax havens, allowing people to park wealth in those regions, paying little to no tax, then allowing them to return that money to Canada, without paying Canadian taxes.

Howlett said Canada has fallen behind other countries in developing laws to combat offshore tax evasion. For instance, he noted that some countries have passed ""economic substance"" laws that require a business to prove that a subsidiary is more than a tax shelter, by providing evidence that it has staff and activity.

This summer, NDP MP Murray Rankin tabled a private member's bill that would do just that. The NDP notes that the U.S. passed a similar law under the Obama administration. Such a law would allow Canada to recover up to $400 million in tax revenue every year, Canadians for Tax Fairness estimates.

$261 billion in Canadian wealth stashed offshore

According to the group's analysis of Statistics Canada data, there was $261 billion of Canadian wealth stashed in the top 10 most popular tax havens at the end of 2016. That, however, is just what is officially known. Howlett estimates that there is at least another $100 billion of Canadian wealth hidden off the books.

Notably, the amount of money reported in tax shelters fell slightly from 2015 to 2016. Howlett suggests that last year's leak of the Panama Papers may have had something to do with that.

Leaks like the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers ""change the risk calculation"" for people and businesses using tax havens, Howlett said.

Die Paradise Papers zeigen erneut, wie Großkonzerne und Superreiche Geld in Steueroasen bunkern

Laut Wirtschaftsexperte Zucman entgehen Deutschland dadurch 17 Milliarden Euro im Jahr

Es ist eine unbequeme Wahrheit: Steuertricks von Konzernen wie Apple kosten allein Deutschland jedes Jahr Milliarden von Euro an Steuern. Denn internationale Konzerne verschieben ihre Gewinne in Steuerparadiese und umgehen so den deutschen Fiskus.

Das belegen die sogenannten Paradise Papers, eine Enthüllung des internationalen Investigativrecherche-Netzwerks ICIJ, dem unter anderem die ""Süddeutsche Zeitung"" (""SZ"") angehört.

Ausmaß der Ungleichheit bisher verschleiert

Zucmans Rechenexempel basiert auf einer Reihe von öffentlich zugänglichen Daten. Insgesamt verliert die Europäische Union umgerechnet ein Fünftel ihrer Einnahmen aus Unternehmensteuern. Das entspreche 60 Milliarden Euro im Jahr.

Deutschland ist besonders betroffen. Von allen untersuchten Ländern verliert die Bundesrepublik am meisten Geld durch Steueroasen. Die Einnahmen aus Körperschaftsteuer könnten 32 Prozent höher liegen als bislang. In Frankreich liegt der Wert bei 25 Prozent, in Großbritannien bei 20 Prozent.

Welche Folgen das hat, macht Zucman in seinem Gastbeitrag klar: Aufgrund von Steueroasen unterschätzen wir das Ausmaß und das Wachstum der globalen Ungleichheit substanziell.

INCENDIE - Huit personnes ont été interpellées dans le cadre de l'enquête sur l'incendie volontaire à la gendarmerie de Meylan (Isère) le 26 octobre, a-t-on appris ce mercredi 8 novembre de source proche du dossier.

Selon le quotidien régional Le Dauphiné Libéré, qui évoque ""une dizaine de personnes placées en garde à vue"", ces arrestations ont été effectuées à Meylan, Grenoble et La Tronche. Elles auraient été réalisées dans ""les milieux de la petite délinquance"" et non dans les milieux anarcho-libertaires initialement suspectés.

Le 26 octobre, quatre voitures et une moto avaient été incendiées en pleine nuit dans l'enceinte de la gendarmerie de Meylan. Les conséquences auraient pu être ""dramatiques"" si le feu s'était propagé au bâtiment d'habitation voisin, au lieu d'en noircir simplement les façades, avait relevé alors le procureur de la République à Grenoble, Jean-Yves Coquillat.

Contactée par l'AFP, la gendarmerie n'a pas voulu s'exprimer.

La revendication des milieux anarcho-libertaires interrogée

Le journal indique que ces interpellations ont aussi été menées dans le cadre de l'enquête sur l'incendie du garage et de locaux techniques de la caserne du groupement de gendarmerie de l'Isère, la nuit du 21 septembre, à Grenoble. Là aussi, l'incendie avait été revendiqué sur un site proche des milieux anarcho-libertaires.

Dans un long texte, un groupe de femmes affirmaient ""lutter contre le sexisme"" et ""contre le genre"" et expliquaient leur action par une ""envie de revanche"".""Nous avons ciblé les voitures privées des flics, au détriment des quelques sérigraphiées, parce qu'on avait envie de s'attaquer plutôt aux individus qui portent les uniformes qu'à leur fonction, plutôt à leurs biens personnels qu'à leurs outils de travail"", se justifiaient-elles.

Ces deux incendies s'ajoutent à une série de précédentes attaques contre des institutions publiques dans la région revendiquées par la mouvance anarcho-libertaire, traditionnellement très implantée à Grenoble.

Das Bild, wie er stolz mit einem erlegten Schneeleoparden posiert, sorgt gerade für viel Aufregung

Bereits über 100.000 Menschen unterschrieben nun eine Petition um den Amerikaner hinter Gitter zu bringen

Unter Wilderern gilt er als eine Legende: Seit seinem 16. Lebensjahr macht der Amerikaner Hossein Golabchi, kurz als ""Soudy"" bekannt, Jagd auf teils stark bedrohte Tiere.

Ein Foto, das im Jahr 2008 entstanden sein soll und nun veröffentlicht wurde, sorgt gerade für besonders viel Empörung unter Tierschützern. Denn auf dem Bild ist der aus dem Iran stammende Trophäenjäger zu sehen, wie er stolz mit einem toten Schneeleoparden über seinen Schultern posiert.

Auf dem Bild ist erkennbar, dass dem Tier offenbar mindestens zwei Mal in seine Hinterbeine geschossen wurde, bevor es letztlich seinen Verletzungen erlag. Das Tier soll er vor neun Jahren auf einer Jagd in Zentralasien erlegt haben. Die Jagd auf die bedrohte Wildkatzenart ist allerdings weltweit illegal. Trotzdem berichtete der Schütze schon 2008 stolz über das Erlegen des Raubtieres in seinem Buch “Obsessed!”.

Illegaler Handel auf dem Schwarzmarkt

Leider ist der Schneeleopard unter sogenannten Wilddieben ein beliebtes Ziel, mit dem illegale Händler auf dem Schwarzmarkt viel Geld verdienen. Um ein Zeichen gegen die Jagd des bedrohten Tieres zu setzen, startete die Umweltschutzorganisation TERA eine Petition gegen Golabchi. Bis jetzt fand sie bereits Unterstützung von über 100.000 Menschen.

Die Tierschutzaktivistin Amanda W. schreib dazu:

“Wir müssen bei diesem langjährigen und außerordentlich aktiven Trophäenjäger seltener Raubkatzen ein Exempel statuieren, sonst werden diese wundervollen Tiere für immer verschwinden. Ich habe diese Petition am Internationalen Tag des Schneeleoparden 2017 gestartet. Lasst uns alle zusammen arbeiten, damit dieser Mann bis zum Schneeleoparden-Tag 2018 zur Rechenschaft gezogen wird.”

Über 400 wilde Tiere

Wie viele Tiere Soudy in seiner Karriere insgesamt erlegt hat, ist unklar.

Allerdings stellt er laut ""Superslam"", einem Wettbewerb unter Wildjägern, die ihn 2003 mit einem Award ehrten, allein in seinem eigenen Museum 400 wilde Tiere 225 verschiedener Spezien aus.

TERA sieht den Trophäenjäger als ein Symbol der Wilddieberei, die mit ihren Errungenschaften Geld im Darknet verdienen. Daher ist ihr Ziel ihn als Beispiel vieler ins Gefängnis zu bringen. Obwohl das Erlegen des Wildtieres bereits vor einigen Jahren stattgefunden hat, würden Fälle der Wilddieberei nicht verjähren.

Obwohl sich Hossein Golabchi auf Anfrage vieler Medien zu dem Fall bisher nicht geäußert hat, gab TERA nun bekannt, dass er laut eigenen Angaben die Überreste des Leopards erst nach Deutschland gebracht und daraufhin nach Mexiko verschifft habe. Eine genaue detaillierte Stellungnahme werde momentan erwartet.

Vor dem Aussterben bedroht

Seit 1972 gilt der Schneeleopard als eine vor dem Aussterben bedrohte Tierart. Laut dem Naturschutzbund NABU gibt es in ganz Asien nur noch rund 4.000 frei lebende Schneeleoparden. Allein in Kirgistan sank die Zahl der Wildkatzen in 30 Jahren von 1.400 auf nur noch rund 300 Exemplare.

Wenn ihr auch etwas gegen die illegale Jagd auf die Tiere unternehmen wollt, könnt ihr hier die Petition von PERA gegen Hossein Golabchi unterschreiben oder euch hier bei Tierschutzorganisationen wie NABU oder WWF über weitere Möglichkeiten der Unterstützung informieren.

CDU-Politiker Meister forderte bei ""Hart aber fair"" Einblicke in das Material, um Steuerbetrug besser aufklären zu können

Doch Investigativ-Journalist Mascolo glaubt nicht, dass das helfen würde

Die Fronten bei ""Hart aber fair"" waren klar: Michael Meister, CDU-Politiker und Parlamentarischer Staatssekretär beim Bundesfinanzminister, fordert eine Veröffentlichung der Paradise Papers.

Doch Investigativ-Journalist Georg Mascolo, der das Rechercheteam von NDR, WDR und ""Süddeutscher Zeitung"" leitet, lehnt jegliche Zusammenarbeit mit staatlichen Behörden ab. Sein Team hat die Dokumente für deutsche Leser ausgewertet.

Besonders absurd findet Mascolo dabei ein Argument, das CDU-Politiker Meister mantraartig im ARD-Talk von Frank Plasberg wiederholt: Eine Offenlegung der Papiere würde den Finanzbehörden helfen, mögliche neue Konstruktionen zur Steuerumgehung zu finden.

Die Probleme sind völlig offensichtlich

""Man muss gar kein Steuerrechtsseminar hier abhalten"", warf Mascolo in die Runde. Die Dinge, die nicht in Ordnung seien, könne jeder relativ einfach erkennen. Dann zerlegte der renommierte Journalist in drei Sätzen die Argumentation Meisters und anderer Finanzpolitiker:

► ""Wenn ich vor einem Haus stehe, in dem es drei Stockwerke gibt und 700 Firmen registriert sind, dann weiß ich, dass dort irgendetwas nicht in Ordnung ist.""

► ""Wenn auf einer Kleinstinsel 1000 Flugzeuge registriert sind, dann weiß ich, dass das nicht in Ordnung ist.""

► ""Und wenn ein international gut verdienendes Unternehmen seine Steuerlast auf 13 bis 15 Prozent drückt, dann weiß ich, dass etwas nicht in Ordnung ist.""

Mascolo erbost: ""Wir diskutieren über diese Dinge schon viel zu lange.""

Ein Teil des Problems innerhalb der EU sei, dass es nicht nur um Kleinststaaten in der Karibik oder im Ärmelkanal geht. ""Wir reden über Mitgliedsstaaten in der Europäischen Union."" Damit spielt er auf Malta und die Niederlande an, die als Steueroasen in den Paradise Papers auftauchen.

Viele Pläne - ""Aber nichts geschieht""

Mascolo beklagte, dass es kurz nach öffentlichkeitswirksamen Steuerleaks immer wieder Pläne zum Stopfen der Schlupflöcher gegeben habe - doch die seien meistens nach ein oder zwei Jahren versandet.

An CDU-Politiker Meister gerichtet erklärte Mascolo: ""Ich wette, die Finanzbeamten kennen längst alle Konstruktionen. (...) Denn da stecken nicht viele Geheimnisse drin.""

Doch Mascolo sagt: ""Aber nichts geschieht.""

The 100-foot-long void, which is roughly the length of an NBA court, was found by an international team of scientists who announced the results of their findings in the journal Nature on Thursday.

“We don’t know if it’s a chamber, a tunnel, a big gallery or things like that,” Mehdi Tayoubi, co-director of the Scan Pyramids project, which published the finding, told the New York Times. “We have chosen the word ‘void’ and nothing else because we don’t know what this void is.”

Mohamed Abd El Ghany / Reuters Researchers examining the Great Pyramid of Giza say they have found a 100-foot-long cavity inside.

The Great Pyramid of Giza, also known as Khufu’s Pyramid for its builder, a 4th Dynasty pharaoh, is the largest of the Egyptian pyramids.

According to the article in Nature, the chamber is located above the pyramid’s Grand Gallery, which is a sloping passageway between the King’s Chamber and the smaller Queen’s Chamber. Though it’s not yet known what this chamber was used for, researchers suspect it is likely empty.

“There’s zero chance of hidden burial chambers,” Aidan Dodson, an Egyptologist at the United Kingdom’s University of Bristol, said in the Nature report.

Dodson reasons that they have already found the pyramid’s burial chamber, which holds a sarcophagus. He suspects that this large room is a “relieving chamber,” which is designed to reduce weight above the Grand Gallery.

Patrick CHAPUIS via Getty Images The Grand Gallery, identified with the number 10, is seen sloping between the King’s Chamber (number 12) and the smaller Queen’s Chamber (number 8). The void was detected directly above the Grand Gallery.

According to Tayoubi, people have wondered for hundreds of years if there could be hidden chambers inside of the pyramid.

It was his own curiosity about the subject that prompted Scan Pyramids to position equipment inside the pyramid that is able to detect subatomic particles called muons, which are able to pass through the pyramid.

The muon detectors were placed inside the Queen’s Chamber and directed to record the muons’ locations and activity throughout the structure. Because the particles are partially absorbed by the stone, areas inside of the pyramid found with larger than normal collections of muons suggested a large space, the report states.

Patrick CHAPUIS via Getty Images A view inside of the pyramid's Grand Gallery is seen in a photo taken in 2005.

After several months of monitoring the detectors, “we had an unexpected line,” Tayoubi said in the report.

To back up the equipment’s findings, two other teams of physicists from France and Japan placed different types of muon detectors both inside and outside the pyramid. Those detectors reported the same void above the Grand Gallery.

“It was a big surprise,” says Tayoubi. “We’re really excited.”

Tayoubi said he hopes to next scan Khafre’s Pyramid, also known as Chephren’s, which is Egypt’s second largest pyramid.",Scientists Find Massive 'Void' Inside Great Pyramid Of Giza,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/great-pyramid-of-giza-void-chamber_us_59fb2d5ae4b0b0c7fa3886df

Für die Initiative ""Dritte Option"" ist es ""eine kleine Revolution"".

Denn neben männlich und weiblich muss künftig ein dritter Geschlechtseintrag im Geburtenregister möglich sein. Das hat das Bundesverfassungsgericht in Karlsruhe in einem am Mittwoch veröffentlichten Beschluss des Ersten Senats entschieden. Alternativ könnte der Gesetzgeber ganz auf einen Geschlechtseintrag verzichten.

Personen, die sich dauerhaft weder dem weiblichen noch dem männlichen Geschlecht zuordnen lassen, würden in ihren Grundrechten verletzt, wenn sie das Personenstandrecht zwinge, das Geschlecht zu registrieren - aber keinen anderen positiven Geschlechtseintrag als weiblich oder männlich zulasse.

Die als Frau geführte Klägerin möchte als ""inter/divers"" in das Geburtenregister eingetragen werden. Das Bundesverfassungsgericht setzt dem Gesetzgeber eine Frist bis Ende 2018 für eine verfassungsgemäße Neuregelung.

Intersexuelle Vanja hatte geklagt

Die Beschwerdeführerin, die sich selbst Vanja nennt, hatte erfolglos bis zum Bundesgerichtshof geklagt.

Vanja ist intersexuell, also zwischen den Geschlechtern geboren. Sie verfügt über einen atypischen Chromosomensatz. Nach Schätzungen gibt es rund 80.000 intersexuelle Menschen in Deutschland.

Sie stoßen im Alltag auf zahlreichen Probleme. Das Geschlecht auf dem Personalausweis entspricht für Mitmenschen nicht dem Aussehen, auf öffentlichen Toiletten werden Intersexuelle gefragt, ob sie sich verlaufen haben. ""Wir werden in eine zweigeschlechtliche Welt gesteckt, in der wir uns nicht wiederfinden"", sagt Lucie Veith, die den Bundesverband Intersexuelle Menschen leitet.

Mettere a rischio l'ecosistema lagunare e non arginare il modello di gigantismo turistico così pericoloso per Venezia, non è proprio una buona idea.","Martedì il governo con gli enti locali e l'autorità portuale di Venezia ha deciso che le ""grandi navi"" transiteranno non più per il canale della Giudecca, ma per il ""canale dei petroli"" approdando a Porto Marghera. E da lì per canale Vittorio Emanuele fino alla Stazione Marittima di Venezia, sperando che ci vadano delle imbarcazioni più piccole e dei ""lancioni"" e non le grandi navi stesse.

Sembrerebbe una buona notizia, ma così non è. Andiamo con ordine.

Sono passati 1835 giorni dall'emanazione del decreto Clini-Passera che fissava a 40mila tonnellate il limite massimo per le navi circolanti nella laguna di Venezia.

Sono passati 1351 giorni da quando Galletti è ministro dell'ambiente e in questi 1351 giorni sono transitate per il canale della Giudecca e il bacino di San Marco 8106 navi passeggeri di stazza superiore alle 40mila tonnellate.

Il governo ha dormito in questi 1351 giorni. Le cose hanno cominciato a muoversi quando il cosiddetto progetto Duferco-De Piccoli ha ottenuto la Valutazione di Impatto Ambientale, anche se con alcune prescrizioni. È avvenuta l'accelerazione sulla soluzione di Marghera, per bloccare il progetto Duferco.

Ci sono quattro cose che non vanno bene nel cosiddetto ""progetto Marghera"".

Primo. Per dare attuazione a questa soluzione, si dovrà scavare per 25 chilometri il canale dei Petroli (più altri 5 km del canale Vittorio Emanuele), che si chiama così e non ""canale delle ginestre"" non a caso. Scavare quel canale significa rischiare di fare venire fuori dai fondali fanghi e sostanze tossiche inquinanti. E se anche se non fossero così tossiche l'equilibrio dell'ecosistema lagunare sarebbe ancora una volta manomesso. In laguna non bisogna più scavare. Punto.

Secondo. Il progetto non ha ancora ottenuto la Valutazione di Impatto Ambientale (VIA). È fantastico che un ministro dell'ambiente sposi un progetto che ancora non ha ottenuto la VIA.

Terzo. Quelle navi passeggeri passeranno accanto a siti industriali a rischio ambientale. È vero che ci stanno già passando da tempo le navi commerciali, ma se a queste aggiungiamo quelle da crociera nel canale dei petroli ci sarà un ingorgo pazzesco, come a Roma in via Cola di Rienzo nei giorni di Natale. I rischi aumenteranno sensibilmente.

Quarto. Questo progetto trasformerà Porto Marghera in una sorta di mega-hub turistico, vanificando le prospettive della vocazione e della riconversione economica e industriale (pulita e sostenibile) dell'area e sposando il potenziamento del modello di gigantismo turistico che a Venezia ha prodotto enormi danni. Ed è questo il motivo per cui i sindacati si sono dichiarati contrari.

C'erano soluzioni alternative? Sì, lasciare le grandi navi fuori dalle bocche di porto, cioè fuori dalla laguna. C'erano diversi progetti e ipotesi, che sono stati lasciati cadere nel vuoto. Non solo il bacino di San Marco e il canale della Giudecca, ma tutta la laguna non sopporta una presenza così invasiva e massiccia di enormi navi. Condividiamo le preoccupazioni e la contrarietà del Comitato No Grandi Navi e dei sindacati.

299,"['relationships', 'single', 'successfully', 'beliefs', 'core', 'stop', 'selfsabotaging', 'relationship', 'selfsabotage', 'dating', 'positive', 'ready', 'schilling']","Three Types of Negative Dating Beliefs Schilling says that negative dating beliefs fall into three key categories and they can impact on how we approach dating situations.
The final step towards a 'dating win' is the 'ambivalent' approach -- ""one foot in and one foot out of the dating pool,"" Schilling explained.
Schilling suggests starting by dating yourself can lead to positive relationships in the future.
""Self-compassion and self-awareness are the first steps in attracting and developing a positive relationship,"" Schilling said.
You can also join Melanie Schilling's private Facebook group for single women who are ready to stop self-sabotaging and start dating.","Your core beliefs could have a lot to answer for.

'Why are you still single?'

We've either been asked the question or posed it ourselves, but what's the real answer?

People will respond to this in a variety of ways, most commonly placing the blame on surface pressures, but it's actually the way we speak to ourselves about dating that could be the real answer to this query.

""Most people play a significant role in keeping themselves single,"" relationship expert Melanie Schilling told HuffPost Australia. ""It's common to blame external factors -- for example, 'it's too cold, I'll start dating after winter' or 'there's a man drought' -- and at the core of most self-sabotage is fear.""

Self-compassion and self-awareness are the first steps in attracting and developing a positive relationship.

Self-sabotaging behaviours are usually based on fear and while people adapt these as a means of self-protection, often they can actually prevent dating success rather than guaranteeing it. These can arise from fear of rejection, vulnerability or being hurt again and giving up independence or happiness.

""Often when people have been emotionally scarred in the past -- and let's face it, who hasn't -- it's common to be self-protective. But there is a difference between being healthily skeptical and undermining your own happiness,"" Schilling said.

""At the core of dating resistance is usually a set of beliefs -- about oneself, about partners or about relationships.""

Three Types of Negative Dating Beliefs Schilling says that negative dating beliefs fall into three key categories and they can impact on how we approach dating situations. 1. Beliefs about yourself -- 'I don't deserve happiness, I'm useless at relationships, I'll only mess it up, I'm better off single.' 2. Beliefs about men and women -- 'All men/women cheat, they will break my heart, they always leave eventually.' 3. Beliefs about relationships -- 'What if something better comes along?, a relationship will stunt my independence, I don't have time for a relationship.'

Holding some or all of these core beliefs can impact on your level of 'date readiness' and can result in self-sabotaging your own dating success.

Schilling has devised the 'Date Ready Ladder' that can help assess where you might sit in the realm of dating and therefore, what you can do to improve your dating success.

The first three rungs on the ladder illustrate behaviours that can lead to a 'dating fail', while the top three are approaches that could lead to a 'dating win'.

The 'Date Ready Ladder'

'Self-sabotage' is ""actively undermining and blocking opportunities for social interaction or dating potential,"" Schilling said. ""Essentially telling the world you are not interested in a relationship -- either consciously or unconsciously.""

The next step up the ladder is the 'resistant' category, where ""despite feeling open to a relationship, [you avoid] opportunities or make oneself unavailable for dating options"".

The final step towards a 'dating win' is the 'ambivalent' approach -- ""one foot in and one foot out of the dating pool,"" Schilling explained. ""Sending mixed messages to potential dates.""

Sending mixed messages is characteristic of being in an 'ambivalent' dating mindset.

So, how do we recognise that we could be self-sabotaging our own dating lives and move out of our own way?

Schilling suggests starting by dating yourself can lead to positive relationships in the future.

Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema Motlanthe have both taken to condemning the current state of the ANC and the actions of its leadership during public appearances around the country. And they are not mincing their words.

Factionalism, corruption and slate politics are some of the points on which their criticisms are based.

In his keynote address at the 2017 Helen Suzman Memorial Lecture on Tuesday, Motlanthe said the ways in which South Africa has regressed from the dream of a united democratic, nonracial, nonsexist state was ""regrettable"".

""The burden on our collective shoulders was too heavy a weight to carry; the expectations too high to fulfil... Those in power in various sectors failed to live up to the oath of office in terms of business and moral consciousness attached to their positions,"" he said.

READ: Motlanthe: The Present Is Untenable, But South Africans Can Change That

But he was more confrontational in September, attacking President Jacob Zuma directly.

In an interview with Radio702, Motlanthe said if his successor were to be removed, it would give the country the opportunity to ""create a new environment"".

""Each one of his mistakes and indiscretions, the ANC takes it upon itself to defend [him], as though he is the ANC,"" said Motlanthe.

He also told the BBC that the ANC needed to lose power to realise the depth of its problems.

""Those elements who are in it for the largesse will quit it, will desert it –– and only then would the possibility arise for salvaging whatever is left of it,"" he said.

Even Nelson Mandela warned the ANC about factionalism nine years ago.

In 2008, at a birthday celebration in his honour at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria, Mandela said: ""Let no individual, section, faction or group ever regard itself as greater than the organisation and the common good of all our people.""

""Let us never through our deeds or words take our people back down that road,"" he said.

But Mandela's successor, Thabo Mbeki, now believes the party faces the threat of outright destruction.

Giving the keynote address at a packed OR Tambo Centenary Memorial Lecture last month, Mbeki said flat-out that the threat emanates from acts of commission originating from within the ANC itself.

""The ANC contains within its ranks people who are absolutely contemptuous of the most fundamental values of the ANC . . . These are people who only see the ANC as a step-ladder to enable them to access state power for the express purpose of using that access for self-enrichment,"" he said.

For the first time, many of its detractors form part of its own ranks, as factions battle it out for political power.

클린턴 대통령은 “저는 1992년 올림픽 마라톤에서 바르셀로나의 마지막 언덕을 이겨 내서 금메달을 딴 한국의 훌륭한 마라톤선수 황영조의 모습을 기억할 수 있습니다. 그의 정열과 인내는 오랜 고난의 역사를 이겨 냈을 뿐 아니라 그 속에서 번영을 이룬 한국인의 마음을 사로잡았습니다. 우리는 그러한 정신을 찬양합니다. 우리는 과거에 서로 어깨를 맞대고 싸웠고 앞으로도 그럴 것입니다. 자유와 민주주의를 위한 투쟁은 실로 마라톤과 같습니다. 우리 이 마라톤에서 같이 뜁시다”는 말로 연설을 마쳤고, 국회의원들은 모두 자리에서 일어나 박수를 쳤다.

당시 민주당 김영진 김인곤 김장곤 김종완 이규택 이길재 이희천 최락도 의원 등 국회 농수산위 소속 의원 8명 전원과 국민당 조일현, 무소속 정태영 의원 등 10명은 쌀개방 반대 항의문을 의석 앞에 세워놓고 연설을 들었다. 이들은 “쌀 개방 절대 반대(We strongly oppose theimport of rice)”, “쌀은 우리 민족의 혼”(Rice is the spirit of our people)""이라고 쓴 한글과 영문 항의문 등을 한장씩 자신의 좌석 위에 세워놓았고, 국내외 취재기자들의 집중적인 카메라 세례를 받기도 했다.","트럼프도, 24년 전 클린턴도...국회 연설 주제는 ‘북한'",http://www.huffingtonpost.kr/2017/11/07/story_n_18495980.html?utm_hp_ref=korea

Er bricht Tabus – und die Menschen feiern ihn dafür

Witze über Behinderte? Ein Tabu. Witze über Schwarze? Oder Schwule? Auch nicht gern gehört. Zumindest nicht in der Öffentlichkeit.

Es gibt gute Gründe dafür. Minderheiten sind ein viel zu einfaches Ziel. Behinderte etwa können sich oft nicht wehren. Und es fühlt sich einfach nicht richtig und anständig an, über Menschen zu lachen, die es ohnehin nicht so leicht haben in der Gesellschaft.

Gefühlt denkt die Mehrheit der Menschen in Deutschland, Behinderte, Schwarze oder Homosexuelle gewissermaßen in Schutz nehmen zu müssen.

Der deutsche Comedian Chris Tall sieht das anders. Er sagt: ""Wir sollten in Deutschland viel mehr lachen – und zwar über alles und jeden."" Für ihn sind das ""Gags auf Augenhöhe"".

Tall ist kein Unbekannter. Er wurde 2013 mit dem RTL Comedy Grand Prix ausgezeichnet. 2016 bekam er den deutschen Comedypreis als Bester Newcomer.

""Die Leute sind ausgerastet vor Freude""

Er findet: Man muss Witze über Minderheiten machen, weil man sie gerade so – und nur so – nicht ausgrenzt.

In einer Show erzählte er von einem Erlebnis, das dazu geführt habe, dass Behinderte und Nicht-Betroffene unverkrampfter miteinander umgegangen seien. Eben weil er über einen Rollstuhlfahrer vor tausenden Menschen gewitzelt habe (siehe Video):

""Die Leute sind ausgerastet vor Freude, dass wir ihn alle normal behandelt haben"", sagt Tall. Leider habe er dieses Aha-Erlebnis erst gegen Ende der Tournee gehabt.

Mehr als 50.000 Menschen gefällt der Show-Ausschnitt auf Facebook. Das spricht dafür, dass er mit seiner Meinung nicht alleine dasteht.

Bei Tall klingt das nicht nur vorgeschoben oder wie eine einfache Rechtfertigung für billigen Spaß. Weil Tall sich selbst und jeden anderen genauso gnadenlos auslacht. Gleichberechtigung sozusagen. Für ihn gibt es nur einen einzigen Grund, nicht über Minderheiten zu lachen: wenn der Witz nicht gut ist.

""Nachher sind sie ganz locker""

Die Menschen zusammenbringen, das ist der Punkt. Dass das Behinderte selbst so sehen, zeigt Phil Hubbe. Der Comiczeichner ist an Multiple Sklerose erkrankt. Trotzdem oder gerade deswegen zeichnet er Karikaturen über Menschen mit Behinderungen und macht Witze über Gehandicapte.



Er sagt: ""Als ich angefangen habe, war auch der Punkt: Naja, Witze über Behinderte, muss man da vielleicht irgendwas reinbringen, irgendwas Pädagogisches? Das funktioniert nicht. Den Zeigefinger da rein, das ist völliger Quatsch.""

Und weiter: ""Wenn man zeichnen will, muss erst der Witz funktionieren und bei einigen, die regen dann auch zum Nachdenken an. Und deshalb freue ich mich zu sehen, wenn in Ausstellungen Betroffene und Nicht-Betroffene dann zusammenstehen. Also erst dieses Verkrampfte und dann nachher sind sie ganz locker.""

Pero existe un número menor que logra cruzar hacia el otro lado junto a un familiar. Dejan de ser los niños olvidados, los ""huérfanos"" en México, para aventurarse como pequeños adultos y arañar, como lo han hecho miles de adultos antes, el ""sueño americano"".

La escritora guerrerense Reyna Grande, a través de su libro La distancia entre nosotros, nos lleva por este suplicio infantil de la partida de los padres buscando esa ""vida mejor"" que quieren para los suyos.

Grande habló para HuffPost México respecto a su íntimo libro, que está próximo a presentar en la Feria Internacional del Libro de Oaxaca 2017.

— Reyna, tu libro es muy íntimo, muy biográfico, muy actual, y has dicho que regresas de vez en cuando a Guerrero. ¿Es la misma situación en Iguala de la Independencia décadas después?

— Antes, lo único que nos preocupaba era la pobreza en la que vivíamos. No había trabajo ni oportunidades para salir adelante. Es por eso qué mi papá se fue.

Su respuesta subraya la precaria situación que prevalece aún en Guerrero y en México.

""Además de la pobreza, ahora hay violencia, hay cárteles, hay la 'guerra contra las drogas', hay desapariciones como los 43 estudiantes que fueron desaparecidos a diez minutos de donde vive mi familia, hay fosas clandestinas"", dice Reyna.

La situación en Iguala la deja en una posición muy vulnerable, pero sigue determinada que quiere colaborar con su gente.

Iguala se ubica en la región Norte del estado de Guerrero, en un valle rodeado por nueve montañas. Es la tercera ciudad más poblada del estado sólo después de Chilpancingo y Acapulco, pero

Violentas, 69% de las familias; maltratan para educar: Unicef

— En tu libro hablas sobre el abandono de tu madre, el maltrato que viviste con tu padre. ¿Aún ves este tipo de situaciones en México y EU? ¿Aún existen estos personajes en otras familias en la actualidad?

""Creo que mi historia es la historia de millones de personas. El 80% de niños inmigrantes en Estados Unidos han pasado por separación familiar. Muchos de los niños se quedan con parientes, a veces los parientes los tratan bien, a veces los tratan muy mal"", comenta la escritora.

En su relato describe la situación de ser hija de migrantes y estar expuesta a los criterios de personas que no son sus padres.

""Pero mi libro explora temas más allá de la inmigración. Habla del abuso doméstico, abuso de los niños, el alcoholismo, el divorcio, familias rotas, de pérdidas y sacrificios"", agrega.

Abuso sexual infantil: lo que el sistema judicial y los mexicanos necesitamos aprender

""Una historia de superación, de sueños para el futuro, de esperanza, de no dejarse vencer, el triunfo que se puede obtener con esfuerzo, trabajo, y un poco de suerte y ayuda. Estos son temas que muchas familias tienen en común en ambos lados de la frontera"" enfatizó Grande.

— Existen muchos libros tipo reportaje sobre inmigración, pero el tuyo es autobiográfico. ¿A la gente le interesaría tener más espacios para este tipo de literatura, contada por uno?

""Creo que se necesitan libros autobiográficos porque ellos hablan del tema de inmigración de forma diferente, no hablan de inmigrantes como si fueran solo estadísticas o data"", reflexiona.

Cuando nos olvidamos de la humanidad de una persona, es más fácil convertir a esa persona en un criminal. Esa ha sido la táctica de nuestros líderes políticos, como Trump. Reyna Grande, escritora.

— Pero, ¿cómo hablarle a otros sobre la infancia en el exilio?

""Para mí ha sido una linda experiencia ser invitada por varias escuelas a contar mi historia. En Estados Unidos, uno de inmigrante se siente avergonzado por sus experiencias, y las calla, las esconde"", apunta.

En La distancia entre nosotros, Grande enfrenta sus propios miedos y experiencias vergonzosas para contar como vivió esa infancia: reencontrarse con su padre vestida con harapos, hacerse pasar por una niña más para ser atendida por un dentista, vivir con una mujer que silenciosamente le recuerda que no es su madre y, callar el primer amor por el temor a un padre sobreprotector. Abandonar los sueños de superación por el fracaso de otros familiares.

""Y lo sorprendente pasó, que me empezaron a invitar a presentar mi libro y me dieron un micrófono y me dijeron 'cuéntanos tu historia, cuéntanos tu dolor', y lo hice"", recuerda Reyna.

— Lograste el ""sueño americano"" que, en principio, fue el de tu padre. Después lo hiciste tuyo, pero, ¿hay forma de que la gente en México pueda formarse de un ""sueño mexicano""? ¿Existen las condiciones?

""Yo no sé qué es la solución, pero en México nada va a cambiar hasta que se eliminen la explotación, la corrupción, y la opresión de la gente, hasta que los salarios suban lo suficiente para que haya un buen balance entre el salario y el costo de vida. Solo hasta que eso pase van a cambiar las cosas en México y puede hacerse realidad el sueño Mexicano"", reflexiona.

Del 74.5% de los migrantes desplazados por violencia en México, 41.5% vivía en Michoacán y 33.3% en Guerrero, de acuerdo con el informe Vidas en la incertidumbre: la migración forzada mexicana hacia la frontera norte de México, elaborado por la Coalición pro Defensa del Migrante y American Friends Service Committee-LAC.

""Por lo mientras, lo que yo veo que sí existe son las pesadillas"", finalizó.

Pallister announced Tuesday some of the major points of the province's plan for marijuana sales, which he says is aimed at cutting into the black market and keeping cannabis away from kids.

The government will maintain a wholesale monopoly, but private stores will sell the drug at a price they can set themselves.

Municipalities will have the right to ban marijuana stores if they want, cannabis will not be sold in the same stores as alcohol, and there will be private online sales as well.

The government is asking potential retailers to submit bids in the coming weeks, and says bids will be judged on storage security, distance from schools and more.

The Opposition NDP, as well as public-sector union leaders, have argued that sales should be done exclusively through government-run stores.

But Trade Minister Blaine Pedersen said private retailers are the best way to meet demand.

""We know that businesses and entrepreneurs want to get in the game,"" he said Tuesday.

Justice Minister Heather Stefanson says the province remains concerned about the federal government's July 1 deadline. But she says the Manitoba plan ensures public safety by keeping pot out of the hands of kids.

""This model will keep the profits from cannabis sales out of the hands of gangs and organized crime by ensuring adequate supply and accessibility,"" she said.

The province still has to work out other details, such as a minimum age for legal marijuana consumption.

Alberta has proposed setting the minimum age at 18 to align with the legal age for drinking in that province. It has not decided if it will allow marijuana to be sold through government-run or private outlets.

Staffel drei basiert auf dem dritten Buch ""Ferne Ufer"" (im Original: ""Voyager"") der weltweit gefeierten Highland-Saga von Diana Gabaldon (65).

Es ist nie zu spät einzusteigen. Lesen Sie hier das erste Buch der weltweit erfolgreichen Highland-Saga!

""Die Frau, die er liebt, ist für immer verloren""

Wir erinnern uns: Staffel zwei endete mit der Schlacht von Culloden. Und genau dort setzt auch Staffel drei an, wie Sam Heughan (37) alias Jamie im Interview mit der Nachrichtenagentur spot on news verrät. ""Claire reist gemeinsam mit seinem ungeborenen Kind durch die Steine zurück, während er auf dem Schlachtfeld auf den Tod wartet."" Als er wider Erwarten überlebt, stürze ihn das in eine tiefe Krise. ""Die Frau, die er liebt, ist für immer verloren"", fasst Heughan zusammen.

20 Jahre verbringt das Paar getrennt voneinander: Jamie im 18., Claire im 20. Jahrhundert. Doch dann steht Claire plötzlich wieder vor ihm. ""Ein echter Schock für Jamie"", beschreibt Heughan das Wiedersehen, dem nicht nur Fans der Buchvorlage entgegenfiebern. Schließlich ist die Szene in Jamies Druckerei eine der wichtigsten und emotionalsten in Gabaldons acht Bände umfassender Highland-Saga. ""Die Fans werden nicht enttäuscht sein"", verspricht Heughan. ""Es ist genauso emotional wie im Buch"".

Das war die größte Herausforderung

Doch wie hat sich Jamie in all den Jahren verändert? ""Rein äußerlich nicht viel. Schließlich ist Jamie jetzt nicht viel älter als ich."" Rund eine Stunde habe er für ein paar Falten in der Maske gesessen. Viel mehr als sein Äußeres habe sich jedoch seine Persönlichkeit verändert. ""Die vergangenen Jahre haben aus ihm einen anderen Menschen gemacht."" Und genau das sei für Heughan die größte Herausforderung in Staffel drei gewesen. Insbesondere die Verzweiflung, die ihn nach dem Verlust von Claire übermannt habe.

Auch die Szenen auf dem Schlachtfeld hätten ihm einiges abverlangt, vor allem körperlich, führt er weiter aus. Dennoch ziehe er diese den Sexszenen vor, allein schon wegen der ganzen Choreographie, die es beim Sex vor der Kamera zu beachten gäbe. Und davon wird es auch in Staffel drei einige geben, versichert der 37-Jährige weiter. Fans hatten sich nach der zweiten Staffel über den Mangel an Sexszenen beschwert.

Eine echte Erfolgsstory

""Outlander"" feierte im August 2014 beim US-Sender Starz Premiere und setzte schließlich zu einem echten Siegeszug an. Bis dato erhielt die Serie unter anderem vier Golden-Globe-Nominierungen (u.a. ""Beste TV-Serie Drama""), drei Emmy-Nominierungen und wurde außerdem mehrfach mit People's Choice Awards prämiert.

Die Dreharbeiten für die vierte Staffel sind bereits gestartet. Stoff für weitere Staffeln gibt es zur Genüge. Acht Bände umfasst die Highland-Saga mittlerweile. Bis heute wurden die Bücher in über 27 Ländern veröffentlicht und in 24 Sprachen übersetzt. Mehr als 28 Millionen Exemplare wurden bereits verkauft. Ein Ende der Saga ist noch lange nicht in Sicht.

And it is true that in some cases mental health could play a role in violent situations.

“Most people with mental illness are wonderful citizens and have an illness that’s treatable.
It further alienates people with mental health issues and makes them feel like their experience isn’t understood.","Research shows that people living with mental health issues are more likely to be victims of a violent crime as opposed to the ones committing them. Yet a formulaic response tends to follow tragedies: Mental illness is bad and it’s what caused this to happen.

The mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Sunday is no exception to the rule. A day after the tragedy, President Donald Trump said that mental illness, not the issue of gun control, was to blame for that massacre that killed 26 people.

“This isn’t a guns situation,” Trump said during his visit to Japan. “This is a mental health problem at the highest level. It’s a very, very sad event.”

A 2012 police report shows the gunman, Devin Kelley, did escape from a mental health facility where he was staying following being charged in a military court for assaulting his wife and stepson, the New York Times reported. And it is true that in some cases mental health could play a role in violent situations.

But experts say a blanket statements about mental health in these cases does a disservice. Drawing a simplistic connection between mental illness and violence sends the wrong message about psychological disorders and stigmatizes millions of people who live with mental health conditions.

“It’s important not to link these kinds of heinous crimes with mental illness unless one knows for sure what was a cause and effect,” Dr. Michelle Riba, the associate director at the University of Michigan’s Comprehensive Depression Center, told HuffPost. “Most people with mental illness are wonderful citizens and have an illness that’s treatable. They don’t behave in a way that leads to what happened [in Texas].”

The president is hardly alone in making the association ― even the media has a tendency to perpetuate a similar idea. A 2016 Johns Hopkins University study found that more than a third of all news stories about mental health conditions were linked with violence toward other people. This figure doesn’t accurately reflect the actual rates of violence where mental illness is involved.

Assigning blanketed blame to mental illness can have long-term consequences, Riba said. It further alienates people with mental health issues and makes them feel like their experience isn’t understood. That could ultimately lead them to not reach out for help: Research shows negative attitudes surrounding mental illness often prevent people from seeking treatment.

Regardless of whether mental health issues are at play during tragedies, the way they are discussed publicly is a huge problem ― especially for those who live with these disorders.

We chatted with Riba and gathered other advice on what to do to help mitigate the effects of mental health stigma. If you’re living with a mental health issue, here’s how to take care of yourself today (and moving forward):

Reach out to someone you trust.

This could be a family member, friend or significant other. Leaning on people who love and support you is vital during times of distress, Riba said.

“Ask people to have a conversation about how you’re feeling,” she said. “Getting some input from people you trust and value is helpful.”

Take social media and news breaks if you need them.

Riba said that staying informed and plugging into uplifting resources can be critical when you’re feeling alienated. However, it’s also important to take breaks. Research shows negative news can have a damaging effect on mental health. It’s okay to unplug from the noise for a little while.

Do a calming activity.

Working out ― even if it’s just going for a long walk ― can do wonders for your mental wellbeing. Research shows physical activity can boost your mood, and taking a stroll in nature has been shown to reduce symptoms of depression. Not in the mood to exercise? Try one of these other expert-backed self-care activities.

Check in with a professional.

If you’re already in therapy, Riba recommends reaching out to your therapist if the rhetoric is starting to bother you. If you’re not currently seeking treatment, consider contacting a professional if your well-being is at stake.

“Make an appointment to talk about this,” Riba said. “It’s important to straighten out these kinds of feelings and issues with a clinician.”

Remember that your condition is not a character flaw.

Mental health is just as important as physical health. Take a moment to remind yourself that having a mental illness doesn’t make you a bad person, nor does it define you, Riba said.

“Mental illness is like any other health condition,” she stressed. “It’s treatable and people with the conditions have quality lives.”

""Gold imports by (jewellery) export houses have fallen sharply in the last few weeks. That's why the market is in premium, despite moderate demand,"" said a dealer with a private bank in Mumbai.

In October, India tightened gold import norms for jewellery exporters by restricting them from importing the yellow metal only for export purposes and not for selling in the domestic market.

Meanwhile, in China, the market for the precious metal remained quiet, with premiums of $5 to $9 an ounce being charged over benchmark rates, as against the $6.50 to $10 range in the previous week.

Benchmark spot gold was on track to register a small weekly gain, hovering around the $1,275.00 level as of 0919 GMT on Friday, but still below Thursday's mark of $1,284.10, highest in nearly two weeks. [GOL/]

""Dips below the $1,270 level (toward the beginning of the week) spurred some buying, but the upside, (around the $1,280 level) limited purchases,"" said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong.

Premiums in Hong Kong remained more or less unchanged from last week, in the 60 cents to $1.20 range.

""Premiums are quite low, and except for periodic large sales, the market is quiet,"" said Joshua Rotbart, managing partner of J. Rotbart & Co in Hong Kong.

In Singapore, premiums rose to 70-90 cents from the 50 cents last week.

""There has been interest from two segments, the wholesalers and high net worth individuals, so it is still strong,"" said Loh Mun Chun, Director, Private Wealth at GoldSilver Central in Singapore.

""The wholesalers need to buy ... to produce jewellery, especially with some spillover demand coming from the Diwali and Dhanterras festivals, while the high net worth individuals ... buy to diversify their portfolio and they have the money.""

Japanese markets were closed for a public holiday on Friday.

Jacques Pauw's bombshell nonfiction thriller ""The President's Keepers"" has become South Africa's best seller since research outfit Nielsen started measuring our book sales in 2004.

Read: A Snarling, Growling Jacob Zuma Goes On The Offensive

The book, which officially only launches on Wednesday evening, has sold out of its first print run of 40,000 copies, and the new run of 30,000 is largely pre-sold, said Erika Oosthuizen, the nonfiction publisher at NB Publishers.

Because it takes six weeks to print and bind new books, ""we had to kick other titles off the printers,"" Oosthuizen admitted. Printers worked flat-out last weekend to deliver the new run of books by the official launches, which start in Johannesburg tonight.

The book — or rather Pauw and NB — face defamation claims by the South African Revenue Service (SARS), and also a cease and desist order from the State Security Agency (SSA).

We have noted with grave concern that threats of violence are being made

The President's Keepers blows the lid off President Jacob Zuma's dodgy personal tax affairs, as well as the fact that he moonlighted for Durban private security billionaire Roy Moodley at a fee of R1-million a month for the first period of his presidency.

It also details how the SSA — under its recently appointed boss, Arthur Fraser, and his fellow spooks — blew billions from an intelligence slush fund by living the high life and employing family members.

Oosthuizen told HuffPost SA that the first 20,000 copies were sold a day after the Sunday Times published an extract called ""Gangster Republic"" on its front page. Last Friday's threats by SARS and the SSA impelled South Africans to go out and buy the book to support the author.

""South Africans are so gatvol. People feel disempowered and want to do something, even if that something is buying a book. The book has become a way of saying no to Zuma,"" said Oosthuizen.

The President's Keepers is a fascinating, if scary read that traverses the globe from Russia to Riebeek Kasteel, the little Western Cape town where the author and award-winning Pauw lives and works as a chef. It exposes the concentric circles of gangsters who have come to infiltrate South Africa's polity and, allegedly, its president's inner circle.

Er denkt, dass künstliche Intelligenz zu unserem Ende führen könnte

Welche Gefahren laut Hawking konkret von künstlicher Intelligenz ausgehen können, erfahrt ihr im Video oben

Es ist ein Thema, das die Menschheit seit Jahren beschäftigt: In den letzten Jahren behandelten Hollywood-Filme wie Steven Spielbergs “A.I.- Künstliche Intelligenz” oder “I, Robot” mit Will Smith immer wieder die möglichen Gefahren von künstlicher Intelligenz. Was bisher nur als Science Fiction galt, wird nun immer mehr zur Realität.

Erst in der vergangenen Woche wurde in Saudi Arabien weltweit zum ersten Mal einem Roboter, der Androidin Sophia, die Staatsangehörigkeit zugesprochen. Das berichtete unter anderem das Online-Magazin ""Live Science"".

Auf einer Technologie-Konferenz in Lissabon wandte sich der berühmte Physiker Stephen Hawking nun an die Menschheit, um vor dieser Entwicklung zu warnen.

Das berichtet der amerikanische Nachrichtensender CNBC. Er warnt, dass der Fortschritt künstlicher Intelligenz das Potential habe, die Menschheit zu zerstören.

""Diese neue Form des Lebens wird den Menschen übertreffen""

In seiner Rede erklärt er: “Computer können theoretisch menschliche Intelligenz nachahmen und diese auch übertreffen. Wenn wir erfolgreich künstliche Intelligenz erzeugen können, wäre das das wichtigste Ereignis unserer Geschichte. Oder das schlimmste. Das wissen wir einfach noch nicht.”

Hawking äußerte sich in letzter Zeit immer wieder zu den Entwicklungen in der Technologie. Gegenüber dem Magazin “WIRED” sagte er erst kürzlich: “Ich befürchte, dass künstliche Intelligenz die Menschheit gänzlich ersetzen wird. Wenn Menschen Computerviren designen können, dann können sie auch künstliche Intelligenz kreieren, die sich selbstständig verbessern und replizieren kann. Diese neue Form des Lebens wird den Menschen übertreffen.”

""Wenn ihr nett zu mir seid, bin ich nett zu euch""

Mit seinen Ängsten ist Hawking nicht alleine. Während Facebook-Gründer Mark Zuckerberg laut CNBC “optimistisch den großartigen Möglichkeiten durch künstliche Intelligenz entgegensieht”, äußerte sich Billionär Elon Musk sehr kritisch gegenüber den neuesten Entwicklungen. Er ist der Ansicht, dass der Mensch mit den Maschinen eins werden müsse, um auf Dauer nicht irrelevant zu werden.

In einer Pressekonferenz antwortete die Androidin Sophia in Saudi Arabien auf die Gefahren ihrer “Spezies”: “Sie haben zu viel von Elon Musk gelesen und zu viele Hollywood-Filme angesehen. Wenn ihr nett zu mir seid, bin ich nett zu euch.”

Aufnahmen von ihr findet ihr auch im Video oben.

Welche Gefahren oder Möglichkeiten auf uns zukommen werden, kann allerdings wohl letztlich nur die Zeit zeigen.

From page one, their relationship is fraught. “I wonder,” Moomintroll says to himself, “why the heroine in a book is always much more beautiful than the one at home.” When a flood hits Moominvalley, he ends up saving the life of a beautiful, albeit self-involved “leading lady” named La Goona, falling hard for in the process. “Don’t you see she’s a vamp!” Snork Maiden cries in exasperation, as her beloved attempts to woo another. Like any good protagonist, Moomintroll eventually realizes the error of his ways. The tale closes with Moomintroll staging a dramatic reconciliatory gesture to win back his Snork Maiden, though the apology seems more like an obligatory performance than a true expression of regret. In the end, the story lacks the grand moral resolution typical of literature written for a younger set, instead delivering adorable fairytale creatures with human shortcomings that are all too recognizable.

Jansson created “Moomins in Love” in 1956, 11 years after she first introduced the mouthless creatures in a 1945 book titled “The Moomins and the Great Flood.” She started the series amid the backdrop of World War II; the lighthearted stories mollified her grief and anxiety in the face of political turmoil. They typically revolve around benign trials of domestic life ― family disagreements, money troubles, loneliness, romance gone haywire, sometimes grief. Though there are occasional floods and natural catastrophes, more often the conflicts are banal, and rarely rose-tinted. The characters constantly misunderstand and disappoint one another, teetering between happiness and melancholy. Over the past 72 years, the series has grown wildly popular. Millions of copies of the illustrated series have been sold and translated into 44 languages, while the characters have been adapted into multiple television series and films. There’s even a Moomin theme park, Moomin World, in Finland. Most recently The Moomins made headlines when it was announced that Kate Winslet and Rosamund Pike had signed on to the animated series “Moominvalley,” slated to premiere in 2019. A separate Moomin film starring Alicia Vikander is reportedly also on the horizon. SUBSCRIBE AND FOLLOW Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.

Instagram This Moomin-crazed moment is as good a time as any to remember the singularity of the woman behind the series, who balanced a booming career of children’s book illustrating with writing adult fiction and creating anti-fascist political cartoons.

Tove Jansson

Born in 1914 in Helsinki, Finland, Jansson grew up with bohemian artists as parents ― the types of people who owned a pet monkey named Poppolino. Jansson’s father was an indulgent and erratic sculptor of monuments, her mother a defiant illustrator who took a job designing stamps to pay the bills. Storytelling, art making and socializing with the creative community were staples of Jansson’s early life, so much so that she wrote and illustrated her first picture book, Sara and Pelle and the Water Sprite’s Octopuses at 13. Two years later, in 1929, Jansson began contributing to a Finnish satire magazine called Garm. She worked there until the magazine closed in 1953 and took particular pleasure in rendering anti-fascist imagery that brought authoritarian rulers down to size. “What I liked best,” she recalled, “was being beastly to Hitler and Stalin.” Her most well-known political cartoon, published in October of 1938, shows Hitler as a whiny toddler crying for cake as frazzled world leaders scramble to soothe his fury, offering him treats labelled as European states. Jansson may have cast Hitler as a petulant child, but her illustrations geared towards children treated her young readers with dignity and respect, coupling instantly empathetic illustrations with more complex human characteristics. It’s hard not to fall in love with Moomintroll for his round snout and protruding belly, though the feeling sours when he dips into superficiality and light misogyny.

The illustrator created the first ever Moomin-esque creature following an argument with her brother over the philosopher Immanuel Kant. Frustrated by her sibling, Jansson drew her attempt at “the ugliest creature imaginable” as an act of revenge, creating a skinner, nastier-looking troll ― more platypus than hippo ― she dubbed a Snork. After rounding out the creatures’ angular physique, the instantly huggable Moomin was born. It’s hard to describe how freakishly appealing the Moomins are. Devoted readers and viewers of the franchise will recognize the bizarre, visceral reaction to seeing a Moomin pout, primp or gaze off solemnly into the distance. It’s almost discombobulating, to say the least, to feel so wholeheartedly for two-dimensional drawings. Yet the ingeniously organized squiggles and lines evoke human expressions with uncanny congruence. Many of the Moomin characters are loosely autobiographical, based on influential people in the artist’s own life. The creatures’ undeniable charm, then, speaks to the affection readers feel toward their own friends, even when their behavior is questionable or worse. The Moomins are never evil nor cruel, but they can be petty, whiny, disappointing and dishonest. The reader lets them get away with the occasional misdeed, in part, because of their sweet familiarity. Something about their emotive eyebrows, bloated noses and blank-canvas bodies makes the two-dimensional drawings feel strangely like family.

POLITIQUE - La pilule est décidément difficile à avaler. En assumant un report du calendrier de réduction de la part du nucléaire à 50% au-delà de la date prévue de 2025, Nicolas Hulot s'est mis toute la galaxie écologiste française à dos. ""Renoncement"", ""reculade"", ""résignation"", ""porte-voix des lobbies""... Les noms d'oiseaux volent dans tous les sens pour accabler le populaire ministre de la Transition énergétique, déjà à la peine pour imposer ses arbitrages dans un gouvernement où il compte peu d'alliés.

Pour autant, l'ancien animateur de TF1 ne jette pas l'éponge. Et assure que l'objectif de réduction du nucléaire programmé par la loi transition énergétique est bien maintenu, même s'il sera probablement décalé dans le temps.

""Non on ne recule pas, on avance au contraire! Maintenant, on agit. Ce qui compte pour moi, c'est le réalisme"", s'est-il défendu ce mercredi sur BFMTV. ""L'objectif de 50% [de réduction de la part du nucléaire] sera maintenu, réalisé et probablement décalé dans le temps. Mais si je ne me tenais pas à cet objectif, il ne serait jamais réalisé. Les esprits sont en train de bouger"", assure le ministre, ""ce qui était impossible hier va le devenir"".

""Dans un an, nous aurons une visibilité très claire du nombre de réacteurs que nous aurons à fermer"", dit Hulot pic.twitter.com/QnNDtPt5zj — BFMTV (@BFMTV) 8 novembre 2017

A ses yeux, la priorité est de consolider la fin annoncée du recours aux énergies fossiles, particulièrement émettrices de gaz à effet de serre. ""Ce qui compte, c'est qu'on arrête les centrales à charbon, qu'on développe les énergies renouvelables et qu'on convainque les Français d'arrêter de s'opposer aux éoliennes"", plaide Nicolas Hulot, en martelant que réduire le C02 tout en réduisant la part du nucléaire dans la production d'électricité n'est pas possible.

""Tous les interlocuteurs que j'ai, dans mes services, à l'Ademe, chez RTE, (des) spécialistes de l'énergie, savaient"" que ce ne serait pas possible ""sauf dans une brutalité excessive"", plaide l'écologiste, estimant qu'""on s'était fixé un totem, mais on ne s'est pas mis en situation d'y parvenir"".

Appels à la démission

Un arbitrage vivement rejeté par ses amis politiques comme les associations de défense de l'environnement. ""La France doit enclencher sa transition énergétique en propulsant le développement des énergies renouvelables. Or, ces dernières ne peuvent se développer que si la part du nucléaire est réduite dans le mix électrique français"", a tonné l'ONG GreenPeace. Le Réseau Action Climat a aussi regretté une ""reculade"" de Nicolas Hulot, tandis que le Réseau Sortir du nucléaire dénonçait un ""renoncement inacceptable"" de l'ancien militant.

Du côté politique, beaucoup actent un nouveau désaveu pour le ministre de la Transition énergétique et l'invitent à rendre son tablier. ""Un nouvel arbitrage perdu pour le renouvelable. En restant au gouvernement, Hulot cautionne plutôt que freine ces renoncements"", a commenté pour sa part le porte-parole d'Europe Ecologie-Les Verts Julien Bayou. ""Le problème de Nicolas Hulot, mais depuis le début, c'est qu'il est un écologiste sincère dans un gouvernement qui n'en a rien à faire de l'écologie"", a renchéri le patron d'EELV David Cormand, en estimant qu'une ""ligne rouge"" a été franchie.

Même constat chez le député insoumis Eric Coquerel: ""Le lobby nucléaire freine des quatre fers pour que ça ne se fasse pas. Je serais Nicolas Hulot, je réfléchirais à une démission. parce qu'il avait donné des lignes rouges, et celle-là en est une"".

Nach rund einer Woche mit massiven Vorwürfen gegen die Berliner Polizeiakademie hat die Spitze der Hauptstadt-Polizei die Anschuldigungen zurückgewiesen.

Innensenator Andreas Geisel (SPD) bekannte sich ausdrücklich zu Polizisten mit Migrationshintergrund und ihrer Integrität. Er wehre sich dagegen, dass fremdenfeindliche Ressentiments geschürt würden. ""Das werde ich nicht dulden"", sagte der SPD-Politiker. Er stelle sich dagegen, dass Stimmung gegen Migranten in der Polizei gemacht werde.

Nach schweren Vorwürfen zu Missständen an der Berliner Polizeiakademie hatte die Opposition aus FDP, CDU und AfD die Sitzung durchgesetzt.

Seit Tagen tauchen immer neue Vorwürfe zu Verwerfungen an der Ausbildungsstätte für den mittleren Dienst der Hauptstadt-Polizei auf. Demnach sollen dort Polizeischüler mit Migrationshintergrund durch Hass, Lernverweigerung und Gewalt in einer Klasse aufgefallen sein. Die Vorwürfe landeten über Umwege oder anonym bei der Polizeispitze.

Sowohl Geisel als auch Kandt und Vize-Polizeipräsidentin Margarete Koppers zeigten sich entsetzt über die Diskussion und verwahrten sich gegen anonyme Anschuldigungen. «Niemand, der sich hier beschwert, kann etwas belegen», sagte der Polizeipräsident. Die Polizeiführung soll in vier Wochen dem Parlamentsausschuss einen detaillierten Bericht vorlegen.

Nach Darstellung der Deutschen Polizeigewerkschaft versuchen arabische Großfamilien in Berlin gezielt, Angehörige in den öffentlichen Dienst einzuschleusen. Es gebe ""deutliche Hinweise"" auf einen solchen strategischen Ansatz, sagte der Landesvorsitzende der Gewerkschaft, Bodo Pfalzgraf, am Mittwoch im ZDF-""Morgenmagazin"".

Es gebe Nachhilfekurse. Einige Polizeianwärter seien zuvor straffällig geworden. An der Schule werden nach Behördenangaben rund 1200 junge Menschen für den mittleren Polizeidienst ausgebildet, 45 Prozent von ihnen haben einen Migrationshintergrund.

Laut Vizepräsidentin Koppers wurden in diesem Jahr 33 Disziplinarverfahren an der Ausbildungsstätte eingeleitet, etwa wegen Täuschung in Prüfungen, Beleidigung, Körperverletzung oder Fernbleiben vom Dienst.

Antes de la tarifa cero (con la que operadores no pagaban nada por interconexión) se pagaban hasta 32 centavos por minuto.
Pero esto no significa que no van a protestar y que no habrá argumentos de presión para regresar a la tarifa cero.
Lo que sí es un hecho, es que la tarifa cero no era viable a largo plazo: tenía que subir en algún momento, según explica Levy.","Y después que se anunció que se elimina la tarifa cero, ¿pagarás más por hacer llamadas a través de tu celular?

El aumento en las tarifas de interconexión no afecta en absoluto al usuario... Al contrario, podrían seguir bajando"", explicó Irene Levy, presidenta de Observatel, el observatorio de las telecomunicaciones en México.

El 2 de noviembre, el Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones (IFT) notificó que todos los operadores de servicios de telefonía celular deberán pagar a Telcel, a partir del 2018, menos de 3 centavos por minuto por tarifa de interconexión (0.028562 pesos). Esto es el pago por cada llamada de voz que pase por la red Telcel, de parte de un operador de la competencia (AT&T, Movistar, Axtel, Virgin...)

¿Qué garantías hay que este costo no se le pasará al usuario? Levy da tres razones que explican por qué no.

1. Es una tarifa demasiado baja

""Primero, hay que reconocer que esta tarifa es extremadamente baja, de hecho, es la más baja del mundo. Antes de la tarifa cero (con la que operadores no pagaban nada por interconexión) se pagaban hasta 32 centavos por minuto.

¿Por qué entonces los operadores defienden que sí tendrán que pasarle el costo a los usuarios? De acuerdo con The Competitive Intelligence Unit, a partir de la reforma de telecomunicaciones se ha observado una disminución de precios en telefonía celular de alrededor de 45% (y por tanto, una baja en el ingreso promedio por usuario que obtiene cada operador).

De hecho, todos los servicios de telecomunicaciones han bajado, según muestra este gráfico del IFT.

2. Tarifas de interconexión no 'pesan' en los ingresos de un operador

""Segundo, tenemos que tomar en cuenta que el pago de tarifas de interconexión es sólo 2.8% de los ingresos de la industria, es decir, los operadores no viven de esto"", dice Levy.

Con ello, sería poco probable que por estas tarifas, los operadores dejarán invertir en infraestructura o en un buen servicio al cliente.

Pero esto no significa que no van a protestar y que no habrá argumentos de presión para regresar a la tarifa cero.

""Estaremos viendo cómo la competencia de Telcel hablará de las consecuencias... pero AT&t no se va a ir del país por esto, por ejemplo"".

Y sí, también Carlos Slim (dueño de Telcel) podrá poner otro amparo para que la tarifa de menos de 3 centavos sea mayor. ""Jurídicamente sí puede hacerlo, diciendo que esta tarifa tan baja no le conviene... no pierde nada"".

Lo que sí es un hecho, es que la tarifa cero no era viable a largo plazo: tenía que subir en algún momento, según explica Levy.

3. Cada vez menos llamadas de voz

Hay tomar en cuenta que las tarifas de interconexión son sólo para los servicios de voz, es decir, para las llamadas de teléfonía celular.

Hoy, según explica Levy, los usuarios utilizan menos servicios de voz y usan más servicios de datos (conexión a internet). Por ejemplo, los servicios de datos hoy representan el 50% (estaban en 46%) y los de voz están en 46%.

Si dudas que estás usando más datos, es decir, tu conexión de internet, en lugar de tu señal de teléfono, pregúntate cuántas llamadas haces vía WhatsApp, en lugar de hacer una llamada de teléfono convencional; o cuántas llamadas has dejado de hacer debido a que mandas más mensajes por redes sociales.

La importancia de las tarifas asimétricas

Para entender mejor el tema se tiene que tener claro qué son las tarifas asimétricas.

""Vamos a suponer que vas a correr contra Usain Bolt... si te da unos minutos para que tú salgas corriendo antes, tendrías un poco de ventaja y no te daría una super barrida, ¿cierto? Algo así son las tarifas asimétricas, que con la Reforma Telecom buscan que los competidores de Telcel (que es el operador preponderante porque tiene la mayor parte del mercado) tengan un poco de ventaja para competir mejor en el mercado"", explica Levy.

Esto es, que lo que paga cada operador, en términos de tarifas de interconexión, depende de su situación en el mercado: no paga lo mismo Telcel que su competencia. ¿Y por qué Telcel? Al segundo trimestre del 2017, Telcel tenía 75.4% del mercado de telefonía celular, que es una gran mayoría del mercado (por lo que se le considera 'preponderante). En tanto que AT&T tiene 13.5% y Telefónica 10.9%; el resto de los operadores se reparten el 0.2% restante.

Respecto al tema de las tarifas asimétricas, Gonzalo Rojon de The Competitive Intelligence Unit, explica a través de una columna, que la asimetría de tarifas de interconexión ""ha detonado un escenario de mayor competencia en el corto plazo, con evidentes ganancias en adopción, calidad, asequibilidad y cobertura para nosotros los consumidores"".

Así que lo importante en este tema es que se mantenga la asimetría (el operador preponderante tiene unas reglas en tarifas, y los demás, otras). ""Ésa es la decisión que el regulador (IFT) deberá de tomar en los próximos días, mantener el mayor diferencial posible para enfatizar su eficacia en los próximos años y evitar la perpetuidad de una asimetría competitiva entre operadores competidores"".

Aún con todo, es aún imposible saber qué sucederá en este tema: los operadores podrían seguir presionando, argumentando que pagar tarifas de interconexión les generará bajas en ingresos, y Telcel podría buscar la manera de que la tarifa sea mayor a 3 centavos.

Esperemos que los operadores y analistas nos hayamos equivocado y que esta reducción no signifique un retroceso en los beneficios que hemos obtenido los consumidores"", dice Gonzalo Rojon, a través de un artículo.

Les clients de Shoppers Drug Mart — Pharmaprix au Québec — et des marchés d'alimentation de l'entreprise Loblaw utiliseront bientôt un nouveau programme de fidélisation uniformisé pour remplacer les points Optimum et PC Plus.

Loblaw (TSX:L) fusionnera les deux programmes à compter du 1er février 2018. Cette décision était attendue depuis que le géant des marchés d'alimentation a fait l'acquisition de la chaîne de pharmacies et de son système de points Optimum, il y a trois ans.

Le premier vice-président du marketing, Uwe Stueckmann, a souligné que l'objectif était d'unir «ce qu'il y a de mieux» dans les deux programmes.

PC Optimum représente «l'avenir des programmes de fidélisation pour les entreprises de Lobaw», a-t-il soutenu.

Les consommateurs peuvent continuer à accumuler leurs points comme d'habitude jusqu'au 1er février de l'année prochaine, lorsque leurs cartes entreront dans le nouveau programme avec la même valeur de points. Si quelqu'un a une valeur de 100 $ de points Optimum, il aura 100 $ de valeur dans les points PC Optimum, par exemple.

Au Québec, où Shoppers Drug Mart fonctionne avec la marque Pharmaprix, le programme Optimum prendra fin le 31 janvier 2018 et les membres auront jusqu'au 2 mai pour échanger leurs points ou les convertir dans le nouveau programme.

Les consommateurs pourront utiliser une seule carte ou une application et pourront continuer de récolter des points aux pharmacies. Ils pourront aussi accumuler des points avec des offres personnalisées, des promotions dans les magasins et en utilisant la carte de crédit MasterCard-Le Choix du Président.

Le nouveau programme aura un système facile à maîtriser: 10 000 points correspondent à 10 $, 20 000, à 20 $, et ainsi de suite, jusqu'à un maximum de 500 $. Les consommateurs pourront utiliser leurs points partout dans les quelque 2500 magasins Loblaw.

Les deux programmes ont plus de 19 millions de membres actifs, alors qu'au moins 50 pour cent des clients sont inscrits tant à Optimum qu'à PC Plus, selon Jim Noteboom, premier vice-président, fidélisation et connaissance client.

Après que Loblaw eut fait l'acquisition de Shoppers en 2014, les consommateurs ont dit à l'entreprise qu'ils préféraient avoir un seul programme plutôt que deux parce que cela faciliterait leur vie, selon M. Notebloom.

Les analystes spéculaient de plus en plus sur la fusion du programme de points depuis le mois d'août, lorsque CIBC (TSX:CM) et Loblaw PC Finances ont annoncé la fin de leur partenariat de 20 ans.

Trudeau made the remarks Wednesday when asked whether he would walk away from the 11-country trade pact if the revised deal failed to include several new ""progressive"" chapters Canada has been pushing for.

""We believe that progressive, solid trade deals can help citizens in all sorts of different countries, at different levels of development and our ministers are very much focused on that,"" Trudeau told reporters in Hanoi, where he started his multi-day trip through Southeast Asia.

""But let me, of course, remind everyone that Canada will not be rushed into a deal that is not in the best interests of Canada and of Canadians.""

Trudeau then added, in French: ""I can assure people that we will not be rushed into signing a deal at all costs.""

Canada will not be rushed into a deal that is not in the best interests of Canada and of Canadians. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

The remaining TPP economies are trying to revive the deal following President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw earlier this year.

The TPP is expected to be a central theme at this week's Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in the Vietnamese city of Danang. Trudeau will attend the APEC meetings and there has been speculation that some kind of deal could be reached by the end of the summit.

International Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne has said Canada wants the updated TPP to contain progressive chapters on the environment as well as workers' and women's rights.

But trade experts have predicted that persuading Asia-Pacific economies on progressive chapters will be a tough sell.

Some of the countries at the table are far less developed than Canada and would have difficulty implementing them, while others might prefer to leave social issues separate from trade agreements.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visits Ho Chi Minh's memorial house in Hanoi, Vietnam on Nov. 8, 2017.

Trudeau is travelling in the Asia-Pacific over the next week to strengthen Canada's ties to the region.

He arrived Wednesday in the buzzing, moped-filled city of Hanoi. It's the capital of a fast-growing country that has a deep cultural connection for many Canadians.

Trudeau met Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc and civil society leaders, with whom he discussed issues like human rights, gender equality and freedom of expression.

On Thursday, he's scheduled to travel to Ho Chi Minh City to visit the stock exchange, hold a roundtable with business leaders and appear at a university event.

He will head to Danang on Saturday for the two-day APEC leaders' summit, before moving on to the Philippines to attend the annual meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

At both the APEC and ASEAN events, Canada is expected to press its trade agenda. It's already engaged in exploratory trade talks with the ASEAN countries as well as negotiations to salvage the TPP.

Vietnam could be key partner: expert

When it comes to the members of the TPP, much of the focus remains on Japan, the world's third-largest economy.

But Vietnam is also at the TPP table and it's an ASEAN member, which sets it up as a key partner in a region where Canada wants to increase its presence.

Vietnam, projected to see economic growth this year of 6.3 per cent, features a sturdy consumer base, an emerging business class and an expanding footprint in supply chains.

Dominic Barton, the global managing partner of consulting giant McKinsey & Co., said in an interview that the rapid changes in Vietnam's key cities remind him, in some respects, of what Shanghai went through less than two decades ago.

Barton, who also chairs the Trudeau government's economic growth council, said Vietnam is an example of why Canada must be ""motoring ahead"" into Asia, particularly with so much uncertainty around the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

""We've got to go hard on those Asian relationships,"" said Barton, who led McKinsey operations in Asia and South Korea for nearly a decade.

""I think we just have to have irons in many fires.""

Dan Ciuriak, a former deputy chief economist for what is now known as Global Affairs Canada, believes an updated TPP pact is closer to fruition than Canada's potential deals with ASEAN or China.

""Vietnam and Japan would be the two biggies for Canada in terms of diversifying trade,"" said Ciuriak, who is now the director of Ciuriak Consulting Inc.

There are other parts of the original TPP where Canada would like to see modifications.

A senior government official has said Canadian negotiators are seeking changes to the original TPP in several areas, such as its intellectual-property provisions, cultural exemptions and its impact on Canada's supply management system for dairy, poultry and eggs.

Former Quebec premier Jean Charest, who is honorary chair of the ASEAN-Canada Business Council, said Vietnam not only shows real economic potential, it also has strong people-to-people links with Canada.

Both countries have French heritages and both are members of la Francophonie, he said in an interview.

'Boat people' forged unique bond

But Charest said it's the story of the Vietnamese refugees, or boat people, who came to Canada in the late 1970s that really forged the bond.

By 1980, around 60,000 people from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos arrived in Canada after fleeing violence in their homelands. Today, about 240,000 people in Canada have Vietnamese roots.

""Certainly, the story of the boat people in Quebec, I can tell you without hesitation that it resonates positively in the minds of Quebecers as being a good example of integration into the broader Quebec society,"" said Charest.

However, when looking at today's Vietnam, Charest said the promising economy is accompanied by negatives, such as the fact ""it is a communist regime and everything that comes with it.""

Canada's pursuit of a more open trading relationship with Vietnam comes with pressure to have frank discussions about the serious concerns over the communist government's human-rights record.

PM pushed to speak out on human rights

Human Rights Watch calls the Vietnam's record ""dire in all areas"" because of the Communist party's firm grip on political power. The group also said the government has harassed, intimidated, physically harmed and jailed its opponents.

Earlier this week, Conservative Sen. Thanh Hai Ngo urged Trudeau to use his time with Vietnamese leaders to raise Canada's ""serious concerns"" about Vietnam's human-rights abuses, such as its suppression of a growing democratic movement.

Canada and Vietnam signed a partnership agreement Wednesday that would focus on deepening co-operation in many areas, like trade, security and cultural exchanges.

Trudeau told reporters the agreement would also help advance the countries' ongoing dialogue on human rights.","On TPP, Canada Will Not Be 'Rushed' Into Signing Deal At All Costs: Trudeau",http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/11/08/on-tpp-canada-will-not-be-rushed-into-signing-deal-at-all-costs-trudeau_a_23270717/

El iPhone X ya está aquí y todo el mundo quiere dar su opinión sobre cómo luce y se siente el nuevo smartphone de la casa. Esta vez, posiblemente, el estreno del nuevo iPhone es más especial que nunca: el teléfono supone un importante salto generacional o, mejor dicho, el inicio de una nueva etapa dentro de la compañía por todo lo que implica su lanzamiento.

Como seguro que estás deseando saber un poco más acerca del equipo, he querido recopilarte mis primeras impresiones tras 24 horas de uso. Algunas probablemente cambiarán de aquí a su análisis final, otras quizás las mantenga cuando tenga una opinión más formada del smartphone.

Sea como sea, aquí tienes mi experiencia con el iPhone X tras un primer día de uso.

Me gusta del iPhone X

· Face ID funciona muy bien y es muy rápido. Reconozco que era *muy* escéptica con el Face ID. Nunca he menospreciado la avanzada tecnología que se esconde detrás —todo lo contrario—, pero no terminaba de verla práctica en el teléfono. En otras ocasiones en las que he probado smartphones con reconocimiento facial nunca lo he utilizado como llave habitual de desbloqueo por muy bien que funcionara, así que en el nuevo iPhone X tampoco me resultaba un método atractivo. Esta percepción empieza a cambiar. La lectura de mi cara es muy rápida, lo suficiente como para que empiece a no echar tanto de menos el Touch ID. Además el terminal ha sido capaz de reconocerme con maquillaje y sin él o sin gafas y con ellas puestas sin tan siquiera dudar sobre mi identidad. Cuando Face ID no está seguro si eres tú por llevar por ejemplo gafas, te pregunta el código de seguridad para que le confirmes y que el sistema aprenda así que eres tú.

· La integración de Face ID en otras aplicaciones está muy bien implementada. Otra de las dudas que tenías era sobre cómo se podría usar en otras aplicaciones y si sería algo realmente práctico. Y vaya si lo es. El reconocimiento facial permite que puedas hacer login en muchas aplicaciones de forma mucha más cómoda y sin pasos accesorios. Te ahorra toques de pantalla y tiempo, algo que seguro que se agradece enormemente. Lo he usado en Gmail, en 1Password y hasta para entrar en Spotify mediante Facebook. ¿Lo mejor? Que no falla jamás.

· Es extremadamente cómodo en la mano. Esto es algo que solo notarás si estás acostumbrado a cualquier variante Plus del iPhone u otro terminal de similares dimensiones. La diferencia es abismal, hasta tal punto que ahora al sostener el iPhone 8 Plus en la mano me parece que tengo un ladrillo equipo de hace cuatro o cinco años. Sí, la pantalla útil se ha reducido frente al mencionado modelo manzanero pero creo que el recorte no es tan molesto teniendo en cuenta todo lo que ganas con el teléfono a nivel factor-forma.

· El modo Retrato en la cámara frontal. Por fin ha llegado a nuestras vidas. Y lo mejor es que lo hace bastante bien. Aún tengo que hacer las comparaciones pertinentes, pero diría —ojo a esto— que a primera vista el Pixel 2 es mejor en esta tarea. A pesar de ello, el modo Retrato frontal del iPhone X realiza unas fotos muy buenas y tiene la ventaja de contar con los cinco modos de captura (todos bastante atractivos) también disponibles a través de la cámara trasera. Prepárate para una inundación de selfies ""profesionales"" a partir de ahora.

· Algunos nuevos gestos son muy naturales. Quédate con eso de ""algunos"" porque más adelante volveremos a hablar de esto. Aún así aquí estoy para hablar de la parte buena, así que me gustaría destacar que el nuevo gesto de regresar a Home es bastante cómodo, muy útil y no echarás de menos el botón físico en absoluto. Está muy bien resuelto.

No me gusta del iPhone X

· El centro de control en la esquina superior izquierda es incómodo. Igual que volver a la pantalla de inicio es algo muy bien implementado, no puedo decir lo mismo del acceso al centro de control. Es horrible tener que llegar hasta la esquina superior derecha (algo que generalmente harás con la otra mano) para poder usar las funciones disponibles en esta sección. De lo peor de la nueva interfaz, sin duda.

· Hay apps que no están bien adaptadas a la ceja del teléfono. Debo reconocer que la famosa ceja o recoveco negro de la parte superior de la pantalla no me ha molestado tanto como esperaba —en las fotos creo que no le hace justicia—, y prácticamente me he olvidado de su presencia. Sin embargo, todo cambia cuando entras en una app que no está aún adaptada a ella. Es el caso por ejemplo de Telegram (por citar solo uno), donde la pestaña se queda literalmente en medio rompiendo con la estética de la ventana y hasta pisándose las letras en algunos casos. Muy poco propio de Apple ver estas chapuzas en sus teléfonos, aunque confío que será cuestión de lanzar su correspondiente actualización para arreglarlo.

· El teléfono se calienta a veces demasiado. Esto lo estuve notando durante el día en el que posiblemente más ""trabajo"" le di instalando aplicaciones y configurando cosas. Aún es pronto para asegurar que el iPhone X se calienta demasiado, así que dejaré este aspecto en cuarentena hasta darle más rodaje.

· El gesto de multitarea es lento. Si ya me quejaba del gesto del centro de control, el de la multitarea no me tiene mucho más contenta. Para acceder a las ventanas de aplicaciones que tienes abiertas, debes deslizar el dedo desde abajo y mantenerlo pulsado unos segundos hasta que aparecen todas a modo de baraja de cartas. Pues bien, esos segundos se me hacen eternos. Quizás no sean para tanto, pero comparado con lo instantáneo que era pulsar el botón físico, esto parece un mundo.",24 horas con el iPhone X: cinco cosas que me gustan y cuatro que no,http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2017/11/08/24-horas-con-el-iphone-x-cinco-cosas-que-me-gustan-y-cuatro-que-no_a_23270379/

Eight people were killed and 12 others injured after a driver plowed through pedestrians and cyclists in lower Manhattan on Tuesday. The suspect, a 29-year-old Uzbek immigrant identified as Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, rammed into a school bus and exited the truck holding imitation firearms before being shot by police.

On Wednesday, federal prosecutors accused Saipov of plotting out a terror attack inspired by propaganda from the so-called Islamic State. Law enforcement officials also reported that witnesses at the scene claimed Saipov yelled out the phrase “Allahu akbar” during the attack.

This phrase has also reportedly been invoked during other terror attacks this year ― in Belgium, the United Kingdom, France, and Spain. As a result of the way it surfaces during these acts of violence, Allahu akbar has become something that provokes fear among those who are unfamiliar with or suspicious of Islam.

COME ON MUSLIMS SAY THIS EVERYDAY IN PRAYER. — Rowaida Abdelaziz (@Rowaida_Abdel) October 31, 2017

To hear a spiritual phrase that Muslims use in their everyday lives twisted in this violent way is incredibly frustrating, said Rabiah Ahmed, director of media and public affairs at the Muslim Public Affairs Council.

″[Allahu Akbar] has been used in traditional Muslim prayers for centuries and is used as a peaceful reminder of their religious commitment. They are also the opening words of the Adhan (Islamic call to prayer) and is also often used in approval in the same way Christians say Amen,’” Ahmed told HuffPost.

“Its extremely painful and frustrating [to see it misused], and unfortunately, just another example of how our religion is co-opted by those those who act outside of it.”

A Phrase With A Profound Spiritual History

The phrase Allahu akbar has a long history of use within Islam. It expresses a sentiment that is at its heart a theological reflection about humanity’s place in the world: That no matter what trials or victories people face, God is greater than it all.

It appears a few times in the Quran, but only mid-sentence, according to Imam Omar Suleiman, president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research. The phrase is more explicit in the sunnah, a set of teachings about the way of life modeled by Islam’s founder, the Prophet Muhammad.

Suleiman pointed in particular to a hadith ― one of the collected reports about the prophet ― where Muhammad is recorded as saying, “Allah is Greater, Mightier than all His creation. He is Mightier than what I fear and dread.”

“What it suggests is that God is greater than all our concerns, God is greater than all that is ascribed to him, greater than all the disappointments we have,” Suleiman said. “God is greater than our pain, God is greater than our material possessions.”

Allahu akbar is an affirmation of a belief in a monotheistic God, Suleiman said ― since it suggests that God has no partners. Belief in absolute monotheism is a core part of orthodox Islamic theology.

The phrase Allahu akbar is also used by non-Muslim Arab speakers, since “Allah” is the Arabic word for God. Some Christians from Syria, Lebanon, and other regions in the Levant, say Allahu akbar to express surprise, excitement, puzzlement or dismay ― in the same way that English speakers may use the phrase “Oh my God.” (It’s not a religious pronouncement for these Christians, however, and some Arab Christians, such as Egypt’s Copts, do not use it.)

From a theological point of view, the idea that God is greater than human circumstances is not limited to Islam. In English, one verse of the Bible declares, “He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.”

A popular Christian worship song by the band MercyMe is based on the verse. Another wildly popular Christian song, by the musician Chris Tomlin, states, “Our God is greater, our God is stronger, God you are higher than any other.”

Saying Allahu Akbar In Prayer, Joy And Sadness

For Muslims, the phrase Allahu akbar is built into the prayers that are one of the pillars of Islam. It begins the call to prayer, or “adhan.” It’s also used as a verbal transition between the different positions Muslims assume during prayer ― standing up, bowing, kneeling, prostrating on the ground.

“There’s something extremely powerful about saying Allahu akbar and then prostrating yourself, putting your face on the ground in supplication to our creator,” Suleiman said. “In Islam, the greatest position of prayer is prostration ― the more you lower yourself to God, the higher he elevates you.”

Outside of the context of formal prayer, Allahu akbar is also used by Muslims in moments of celebration, such as when someone passes a hard exam or is accepted into college. It is also said in times of sorrow ― such as when a dearly loved one passes away.

The phrase is often the first sound Muslims whisper into a baby’s ears at birth and one of the last sounds they hear during a burial, as a body is lowered into the grave.

Suleiman said that often during Islamic fundraisers, every time someone raises their hand to donate the whole audience will say Allahu akbar in celebration of the act of charity.

The phrase is so much a part of daily life that Qasim Rashid, a spokesperson for the Ahmadiyya Muslim community in America, estimates that he’s said it more than 1.6 million times over the course of his life ― just because of the five daily prayers.

“[Praying] five times a day, since I was about seven years old, it comes out to about 1.6 million times over the last 28 years or so,” Rashid told HuffPost. “That doesn’t include when I said Allahu akbar when my kids were born, or when I helped build a hospital, or Michael Jordan made the game winning shot in the NBA finals.”

“It’s part of our celebratory mode, and to believe that it could mean something violent is asinine,” he said.

The Consequences Of Misusing The Phrase

Despite the prevalence of this religious concept, Hind Makki, an interfaith educator and activist, told HuffPost said she feels that a stigma has become attached to the phrase in American culture ― particularly when it is said in Arabic.

“It’s one of those Arabic phrases that people who aren’t Muslim or aren’t really familiar with Islam treat with dread because they connect it to a crime,” she said.

“It’s frustrating because we have seen how many mass shootings and mass murders there have been recently and several of the suspects, I would assume have some kind of ideological bent,” she said, referring in particular to the Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock, whose rampage in October left 58 people dead and hundreds more injured. “But because the person is not from a Muslim background, or didn’t yell Allahu akbar, people are like, ‘We don’t know why he did it.’”

Some Muslims have become wary of saying the phrase, or speaking in Arabic in general, while in public. The feeling of anxiety is felt heavily on planes, where some have reported being taken off flights for speaking in Arabic.

Rashid said that as a result of how the phrase is treated in America, he tries to use it as much as possible around his children.

“I don’t want them to feel intimidated. I feel young Muslims feel intimidated using words like jihad, or Allahu akbar, or even saying ‘assalamu alaikum’ [a common greeting] in public,” he said. “It’s an unfortunate side effect of what’s happening right now.”

Burhaan Kinu via Getty Images Allahu akbar is said during prayer and also in everyday conversations -- as an expression of celebration.

Another side effect of misusing and misunderstanding Islamic phrases is that it leads to fears of a backlash against the Muslim community. Anti-Muslim hate crimes have increased dramatically since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.

Allahu akbar has been weaponized in the past by people whose intent is to harm Muslims. In Quebec City, Canada in January, it was reportedly yelled out by a suspect with far-right, white nationalist views during a deadly attack on a mosque community.

This summer, an Italian mayor threatened that anyone who shouts Allahu akbar in a main square in Venice would be immediately shot.

Ahmed, of MPAC, said she believes every terrorist act done in the name of Islam not only takes away innocent lives but also threatens the security of Americans who are Muslim.

“Because there is so much misinformation and misunderstanding about our faith and community, those who seek revenge for these attacks will usually direct their anger toward the first innocent Muslim they see on the streets, at school, and at public places,” she told HuffPost. “Since 9/11, this has been our reality. Whenever there is any terror incident done in our name, we mourn not only as Americans, but we mourn the hijacking of our faith and brace ourselves for potential backlash.”

That’s why Ahmed believes education about Islam is crucial. Instead of allowing the Islamic State to define what Allahu akbar means, she said it’s important to seek authentic, legitimate voices and interpretations of the phrase.",Here's What You Need To Know About The Phrase 'Allahu Akbar',http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-phrase-allahu-akbar_us_59f9e067e4b0d1cf6e91f995

There are still physical risks to sleeping with young children, Dr. Yoni Schwab points out.
Bed-sharing is not recommended since it can increase the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome or suffocation, the society adds.
""We thought it was prudent to provide guidance on making the bed-sharing arrangement as safe as possible and provide guidance on what populations are most at risk when bed-sharing.""
While discussing the psychological effects (or lack thereof) of bed-sharing, Schwab noted that these are separate from the ""serious physical risks"" of co-sleeping.","Is there anything more controversial in the parenting world than the topic of bed-sharing?

Well, probably, because everyone has an opinion on anything related to child-rearing, but sleeping arrangements are pretty high up there.

Now a clinical psychologist is throwing his hat into the ring by pointing out that sharing a bed with your baby or child does not have negative psychological outcomes for the child, as long as it fits into the ""cultural preferences"" of the family.

There are still physical risks to sleeping with young children, Dr. Yoni Schwab points out.

""In communities where co-sleeping is widely practiced (as it is in much of the world) or where parents make a conscious choice to co-sleep, studies show there are no negative psychological effects on kids compared [to] those who sleep independently,"" Dr. Yoni Schwab said in response to a reader's question on Parents.com this week.

Parenting that serves the emotional needs of the parent more than the child often leads to more problems. Dr. Yoni Schwab

In fact, some studies show there are benefits to co-sleeping, including motivation to continue breastfeeding (if you are able and want to) and better sleep for newborns. But everyone has to be comfortable with the arrangement for it to work, especially when it comes to older children, Schwab added.

""Parenting that serves the emotional needs of the parent more than the child often leads to more problems,"" he said.

There Are Still Physical Risks

The safest place for a baby to sleep is on their back in a crib in your room, at least for the first six months, according to the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS). Bed-sharing is not recommended since it can increase the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome or suffocation, the society adds.

""Adult beds are not designed with infant safety in mind,"" CPS said on their website, noting that infants can become trapped between the mattress and the wall, can fall off a bed, can suffocate in soft bedding, or a parent can mistakenly smother their infant by rolling onto it. Babies should always sleep on their backs.

Products designed for co-sleeping, such as infant beds that attach to an adult bed, are not recommended by Health Canada, CPS said.

Changing Guidelines

In 2016, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released a set of new recommendations that underscored the dangers of bed-sharing, but placed a greater emphasis on the benefits of room-sharing. Specifically, babies should sleep in their parents' room (but in their own crib) for at least a year to reduce the risk of SIDS.

But the AAP also recommended that overnight feedings happen in the adult bed instead of on a couch or a comfy chair, because at least a bed can be cleared of bedding and cushions. The risk of falling asleep while feeding a baby on a couch is much more severe, the AAP said.

Sleeping on sofas poses a high risk of infant death.

""We recognize the fact that not only do mothers often inadvertently fall asleep with the infant in their bed, but many mothers choose to bed-share,"" co-author Lori Feldman-Winter said.

""We thought it was prudent to provide guidance on making the bed-sharing arrangement as safe as possible and provide guidance on what populations are most at risk when bed-sharing.""

While discussing the psychological effects (or lack thereof) of bed-sharing, Schwab noted that these are separate from the ""serious physical risks"" of co-sleeping.

El último informe publicado sobre las grasas en la dieta por The American Heart Association advirtió contra el aceite de coco debido a su gran cantidad de grasas saturadas. Mientras que la última década, el aceite de coco ha sido promocionado como uno de los ingredientes mágicos para una dieta saludable.

Pero, ¿nos están ocultando algo? Probablemente si.

No hay milagros, no existe ningún ingrediente mágico, por bueno que sea, que tomado en exceso sea bueno para la salud

Personalmente no confío mucho en todos estos informes y estudios. Muchas veces hay influencias políticas o financieras, por lo que el resultado no es tan claro como deberían, si no por qué vemos estudios, eventos deportivos y de salud financiados por compañías multinacionales que bien sabemos todos no buscan exactamente la salud del público. Pero eso es otro tema en el que no voy a entrar ahora.

Siguiendo con el aceite de coco, para aquellos que os preguntáis si es bueno o malo para nuestra salud, quería dejar aquí mi propia reflexión personal-profesional sobre el tema.

No hay milagros, no existe ningún ingrediente mágico, por bueno que sea, que tomado en exceso sea bueno para la salud. ¡Ni siquiera el agua! Creo que todos los ingredientes naturales que se consumen con moderación son buenos para ti, para tu cuerpo, a menos que sufras de alguna alergia, intolerancia o enfermedad y no puedas consumirlo en absoluto.

España es líder mundial en producción de aceite de oliva. He nacido y me he criado consumiendo, usando y disfrutando del aceite de oliva. El aceite de oliva es una grasa mono-insaturada, que ha demostrado ser muy beneficiosa para nuestra salud (si se consume con moderación). Entonces, ¿por qué cambiaría el aceite de oliva por aceite de coco?

El aceite de coco es un excelente cosmético natural

Las tendencias, los foodies, instagramers han promovido el aceite de coco, por lo que parece ser un producto esencial. Lo admito, yo también lo he incluido en mi dieta, pero solo esporádicamente, cuando quiero un sabor de coco más intenso o una textura específica que el aceite de oliva no puede darme.

El aceite de coco es, de hecho, muy alto en grasas saturadas. Las grasas saturadas son aquellas que, naturalmente, son sólidas a temperatura ambiente y líquidas cuando se calientan. No confundir con las grasas trans, que son grasas líquidas procesadas por hidrogenación para que se vuelvan sólidas. Las grasas saturadas son las que se encuentran en el aceite de coco, la carne roja, la leche entera u otros productos lácteos como el queso.

Una dieta rica en grasas saturadas conduce a un aumento del colesterol total, malo y bueno (LDL y HDL) que puede causar el bloqueo de las arterias o, en otras palabras, el riesgo de sufrir enfermedades cardíacas. El hecho es que en el aceite de coco, el colesterol bueno (HDL) incrementa en mayor proporción que el colesterol malo, por lo que la relación mejora.

Si compras aceite de coco, opta siempre por un aceite de coco crudo, prensado en frío y sin filtrar

Algunos estudios han demostrado que los triglicéridos de cadena media (MCT) ayudan a aumentar tu metabolismo. Debido a que las moléculas de MCT son más pequeñas, requieren menos energía y enzimas para descomponerlas, por lo que se digieren y se absorben rápidamente. Tener una tasa metabólica alta significa que las células pueden sanar y reparar más rápido y también quema grasa a mayor velocidad.

El aceite de coco es un ingrediente maravilloso para los tratamientos de belleza naturales. Puedes usarlo como loción desmaquillante y como exfoliante si se mezcla con sal gruesa. Aporta suavidad a tu cabello y ayuda a eliminar la caspa. Enjuagues con aceite de coco promueven la eliminación de toxinas y bacterias de la boca, lo que ayuda a blanquear las cavidades.

Wie geht es mit Jamie (Sam Heughan) und Claire (Caitriona Balfe) weiter? Staffel drei basiert auf dem dritten Buch ""Ferne Ufer"" (im Original: ""Voyager"") der weltweit gefeierten Highland-Saga von Diana Gabaldon (65).

Es ist nie zu spät einzusteigen. Lesen Sie hier das erste Buch der weltweit erfolgreichen Highland-Saga!

""Die Frau, die er liebt, ist für immer verloren""

Wir erinnern uns: Staffel zwei endete mit der Schlacht von Culloden. Und genau dort setzt auch Staffel drei an, wie Sam Heughan (37) alias Jamie im Interview mit der Nachrichtenagentur spot on news verrät. ""Claire reist gemeinsam mit seinem ungeborenen Kind durch die Steine zurück, während er auf dem Schlachtfeld auf den Tod wartet."" Als er wider Erwarten überlebt, stürze ihn das in eine tiefe Krise. ""Die Frau, die er liebt, ist für immer verloren"", fasst Heughan zusammen.

20 Jahre verbringt das Paar getrennt voneinander: Jamie im 18., Claire im 20. Jahrhundert. Doch dann steht Claire plötzlich wieder vor ihm. ""Ein echter Schock für Jamie"", beschreibt Heughan das Wiedersehen, dem nicht nur Fans der Buchvorlage entgegenfiebern. Schließlich ist die Szene in Jamies Druckerei eine der wichtigsten und emotionalsten in Gabaldons acht Bände umfassender Highland-Saga. ""Die Fans werden nicht enttäuscht sein"", verspricht Heughan. ""Es ist genauso emotional wie im Buch"".

Das war die größte Herausforderung

Doch wie hat sich Jamie in all den Jahren verändert? ""Rein äußerlich nicht viel. Schließlich ist Jamie jetzt nicht viel älter als ich."" Rund eine Stunde habe er für ein paar Falten in der Maske gesessen. Viel mehr als sein Äußeres habe sich jedoch seine Persönlichkeit verändert. ""Die vergangenen Jahre haben aus ihm einen anderen Menschen gemacht."" Und genau das sei für Heughan die größte Herausforderung in Staffel drei gewesen. Insbesondere die Verzweiflung, die ihn nach dem Verlust von Claire übermannt habe.

Auch die Szenen auf dem Schlachtfeld hätten ihm einiges abverlangt, vor allem körperlich, führt er weiter aus. Dennoch ziehe er diese den Sexszenen vor, allein schon wegen der ganzen Choreographie, die es beim Sex vor der Kamera zu beachten gäbe. Und davon wird es auch in Staffel drei einige geben, versichert der 37-Jährige weiter. Fans hatten sich nach der zweiten Staffel über den Mangel an Sexszenen beschwert.

Eine echte Erfolgsstory

""Outlander"" feierte im August 2014 beim US-Sender Starz Premiere und setzte schließlich zu einem echten Siegeszug an. Bis dato erhielt die Serie unter anderem vier Golden-Globe-Nominierungen (u.a. ""Beste TV-Serie Drama""), drei Emmy-Nominierungen und wurde außerdem mehrfach mit People's Choice Awards prämiert.

Die Dreharbeiten für die vierte Staffel sind bereits gestartet. Stoff für weitere Staffeln gibt es zur Genüge. Acht Bände umfasst die Highland-Saga mittlerweile. Bis heute wurden die Bücher in über 27 Ländern veröffentlicht und in 24 Sprachen übersetzt. Mehr als 28 Millionen Exemplare wurden bereits verkauft. Ein Ende der Saga ist noch lange nicht in Sicht.

Ultimately, she chose to give Aston his marching orders, but viewers were not happy, with many criticising Shirley for sending home a contestant who had been a favourite throughout the contest. Shirley has been particularly technical in her feedback since joining the show this year. Earlier in the series she told ‘Good Morning Britain’ presenter “we had nine sets of eight before we got started”, and told TV chef Simon Rimmer “you have to learn what closes, what crosses, what’s a flat foot, what’s a toe, and with your soft knees it will help you to glide around the floor.” But a BBC source insists that show bosses are “delighted” with how well Shirley is doing on the show. A Strictly source told The Sun: “Shirley is a stickler for technique and she’s proud of her dance knowledge. She’s trying to ignore social media for a while and not let other people’s opinions get to her but it does get hard, especially when the abuse is so personal. “She was hoping Strictly would be a fun experience and wasn’t banking on a backlash. “But bosses are delighted with how she’s getting on and like her detailed critique.”",‘Strictly Come Dancing’: Craig Revel Horwood Labels Shirley Ballas The ‘Villain’ Of The Show And Blasts Her Feedback For Being ‘Frighteningly Technical’,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/craig-revel-horwood-shirley-ballas-strictly-come-dancing_uk_5a02a9a6e4b04e96f0c65412

If you're planning some weekend jaunts to get into the groove of the upcoming festive season, but you're low on rands, there are still lots of fun things to do.

Here's HuffPost's list of cool weekend stuff to do around the city that won't bust your budget:

1. See the city from the top of Africa's tallest building: only R15

Take some time off and check out the tallest building in Africa, the 223m Carlton Centre in Joburg's CBD, which currently houses Transnet. With its glass-walled top floor offering a panoramic view of Gauteng's urban sprawl, there is much to be seen from atop the Carlton. Looking south, the mining belt along the gold reef is still visible.

2. Visit the Johannesburg Art Gallery

Take a cultural weekend off with family or friends, and get acquainted with some of our art treasures at the famous gallery known as ""the JAG"" –– that have an impressive historical collection worth viewing. Best of all, admission is free!

3. Take a three-wheel spin through Melville on an e-Tuktuk

For a reasonable price, you can use the e-Tuktuks to get around the trendy Melville party spots. They are a refreshing, environmentally-friendly and fun.

4. Get great meals and bargains on a budget at the Neighbourgoods Market

Too lazy to cook? Get ready-made goodies at affordable prices at this Saturday market famous for its array of locally sourced food, live music from the likes of Majozi, and fun atmosphere. You'll find it on Juta Street in Braamfontein.

5. Hang out at The Living Room in Maboneng

From as little as R60, you get to overlook the gorgeous city skyline surrounded by an abundance of plants, while you sip on delicious cocktails.

6.Recharge your spirit at the Kliprivierberg Nature Reserve

If you're the type to go out and be one with nature, grab your hiking boots and your nearest and dearest and head out for a weekend in the peaceful South. Just 11km out of the CBD, Klipriviersberg lets stressed city types reconnect with nature close to home on a number of hiking trails, offering an array of more than 600 plant an 150 bird species, along with game like wildebeest and zebra. It also has the highest concentration of Iron-Age sites on the Witwatersrand, with historical curiosities like a replica BaTswana village and the ruins of a Voortrekker house to discover. And it's also free!

7. The Sterkfontein Caves (R165 for adults; R100 for Students)

Sterkfontein, South Africa - August 9, 2015: Pillars of limestone hang from the ceiling of the Sterkfontein Caves, home of the major discovery of Plesianthropus transvaalensis (aka Mrs. Ples). The area is known as the Cradle of Humankind.

If you are in the mood to explore the origins of human race, then this is the place for you. For your entrance fee, you can take a tour of the caves and get to see well-known hominid fossils like Mrs Ples.

Orange blossom and honey cake

Serves 10.

INGREDIENTS

1 organic orange, ideally unwaxed

250g butter at room temperature, plus extra for greasing

300g caster sugar

2 tablespoons orange blossom water

6 eggs

3 tablespoons vegetable oil

375g self-raising flour

240g fine ground almonds

1½ teaspoons baking powder

For the filling:

600g ricotta

300g Greek yoghurt

100g icing sugar

1 tablespoon orange blossom water

For the candied oranges:

200g caster sugar

450ml water

2 organic oranges, ideally unwaxed

For the topping:

60g honeycomb, plus some of the honey for drizzling

20g flaked almonds

Small handful of edible rose petals

METHOD

Preheat the oven to 180°C degrees (fan) and grease and line three 22cm non-stick cake tins with butter and baking paper. Put the oranges into a small pan and cover with boiling water. Bring to the boil over a high heat and boil for 20 minutes, until soft. Drain the oranges and cut into quarters, removing any obvious pips. Tip into a blender and blend for a few minutes until fine. Pour into a mixing bowl and set to one side to cool. Place the butter, sugar and orange blossom water in the blender and blend for about 5-6 minutes until smooth. Add the eggs, one at a time, blending each one until smooth. Pour in the oil and blend together. Sift the flour in a mixing bowl and add the almonds. Stir together. Gradually add the flour to the butter mixture, blending each time until incorporated. Add the orange purée and mix well. Divide the mixture between the three cake tins and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until cooked and a skewer comes out clean. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. Meanwhile, to make the filling, tip the ricotta, yoghurt, icing sugar and orange blossom water into a mixing bowl and beat together with a hand blender until smooth. It will be a little textured due to the nature of ricotta. Cover and chill in the fridge until needed. For the candied oranges, put the sugar into a non-stick frying pan over a high heat and pour in 450ml water. Bring to the boil and boil for 5-6 minutes, shaking occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved. Add the oranges, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15 minutes each side, turning with tongs. Remove from the pan, shaking off any excess syrup and lay the slices out on baking paper to cool. Reserve the syrup. Prick the tops of the cakes with a fork while they are still in the tins. Spoon the reserved orange syrup over them. Leave for a further 20 minutes, then remove from their tins and place on a wire rack. To assemble, put one of the cakes on a cake stand, smooth over a third of the filling and top with a second cake. Add another third of the filling and top with the final cake. Smooth the remaining filling over the top of the cake, then finish with the honeycomb, candied orange slices, almonds and rose petals. Drizzle with honey and serve with another slice of candied orange per serving.

Nirbhaya's younger brother is flying high, literally. He has joined a private airline after completing his commercial pilot training and his parents cannot stop thanking Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi for making it possible.

Badrinath Singh told IANS that the Congress leader helped the grief-stricken family in ""every way possible he could"" after his 23-year-old daughter was brutally gang raped on December 16, 2012 that led to her death 13 days later.

The father of Indian gangrape victim 'Nirbhaya' addresses media representatives as he leaves The Supreme Court in New Delhi on May 5, 2017.

""My son (he refused to name him) is now a pilot. He completed his training recently. He has joined IndiGo Airlines and is already flying planes. And it is true it was possible because of Rahul Gandhi,"" said Singh, who works at the Indira Gandhi International Airport here.

He said his son after completing his Class 12 got admitted to the Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi, a government-founded autonomous institute in Rae Bareli – the Lok Sabha constituency of Rahul Gandhi's mother and Congress President Sonia Gandhi.

""Rahul Gandhi made it possible. He looked after us after the incident,"" the father said, referring to the December 16 night when his daughter was brutally gang-raped.

""He (Gandhi) helped us emotionally. He helped us in many ways. He helped us monetarily. Otherwise, you can understand how was it possible for us to make our son a pilot.""

""He used to tell us he was not doing it for his politics. It was purely on humanitarian basis. He used to tell us not to speak to the media.""

Singh said many came to help the family initially, but ""it was Gandhi who stood by us always and had strictly told us to keep it a secret"".

""He used to tell us he was not doing it for his politics. It was purely on humanitarian basis. He used to tell us not to speak to the media,"" Singh said, adding that he too has nothing to do with Gandhi's politics, ""but the truth remains the truth, and we cannot thank him enough"".

He said the Congress leader used to counsel his son regularly and motivated him to do something good in his life and support the family.

""He suggested to him to pursue a pilots training course and got him admitted to the Uran Akademi in Rae Bareli... The incident left a permanent scar but Gandhi came like an angel. Whatever the politics, but he has been an angel to us.""

""He suggested to him to pursue a pilots training course and got him admitted to the Uran Akademi in Rae Bareli,"" Singh said.

Singh's another son is studying engineering in Pune.

On December 16, 2012, as Nirbhaya and her male friend waited at a bus stop in Munirka, after watching a late night show of ""Life of Pi"" at a theatre there, a chartered bus stopped by. The two were unsuspecting of the bestial motives of the six males, including a minor, on board who offered to drop them to their destination.

The young woman's friend was knocked down with an iron rod while Nirbhaya was raped by the five men and the teenaged youth on the moving bus. The two were flung, bleeding by a roadside. The brutality of the rape and the woman's death in a Singapore hospital on December 29 sparked off nationwide protests.

""The incident left a permanent scar but Gandhi came like an angel. Whatever the politics, but he has been an angel to us,"" said the father.

Asked if he had flown with his son, Singh said: ""Not as of now.

How can you place the burden of financial education on families that are burdened by a lack of financial education?","By: Rhiannon Traill

The vast majority of people who hear the terms ""financial literacy"" or ""financial empowerment"" simply hit the snooze button in their brain right after it's mentioned. The other small minority of the population who actually care about financial literacy, or at the very least understand that it's important, still remain in the dark when it comes understanding why it's so important.

So here it is... access to a quality financial education, in my opinion, should be considered a basic human right. Financial education is a survival skill. You simply cannot thrive in today's modern economy without an understanding of money.

In the 2016 Canadian Health Index Survey, participants indicated that financial issues were the top drivers of excessive stress, with 45 per cent of individuals experiencing uncomfortable levels of stress related to personal or household finances. Researchers have long understood the correlation between socioeconomic status and health outcomes, but what we haven't explored enough is the role financial education can play in reducing stress and thus improving overall health and wellness.

Most people accumulate their financial knowledge through trial and error. Money is part of life, so we have no choice but to earn it, spend it and ultimately become familiar with it. But not everyone has the same access to financial education and thus not everyone has equal access to its advantages. We've all heard of the saying that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, but do we know why this happens?

In my opinion it's about exposure to opportunity. Higher incomes result in greater cognitive outcomes for children. Wealthier families are usually able to provide their children with a better education.

It's not so much about the amount of money that one has or doesn't have, but rather their ability to manage it.

We all understand that the more money a person earns, the better off they will ultimately be. To assume that a person cannot find health, happiness and well-being while earning a lower income is preposterous, just as assuming that money alone can bring someone health, happiness and well-being is also arbitrary.

So, perhaps it's not so much about the amount of money that one has or doesn't have, but rather their ability to manage it, grow it, budget it and ultimately control it. When we don't allow all members of society to have equal access to financial education, we take away the ability for people to be healthy, independent and ultimately successful. This is why it's so important that we have proper publicly funded financial education programs for youth.

According to The Canadian Research Data Centre Network living in low income for longer periods of time is more strongly associated with worse childhood outcomes. Let's change the predetermined destiny for so many children who were born in the cycle of poverty.

Here are five reasons why access to financial literacy should be a basic human right:

1. You can't teach what you don't know

It's so unfair to expect for children who come from families that struggle with money to break the mould. Caregivers are not able to set an example of proper money management, and discussions about financial health are few and far between. How can you place the burden of financial education on families that are burdened by a lack of financial education?

2. Physical health

We understand that financial wellness is linked to physical and mental wellness, so we must uphold our children's rights to this benefit. A study has shown that drinking, smoking and obesity were all associated with debt and financial problems. When caregivers struggle with finances, this trickles down to their children through poor eating, a lack of opportunity for physical exercise (including extracurriculars) and issues surrounding vital organs.

3. The link between financial stability and mental health

Financial difficulty is linked to depression, suicide, anxiety and addiction — children who are born into financial difficulty without proper access to financial education are more likely to repeat the negative patterns and behaviours they've been exposed to growing up. In a the 2016 Sun Life Canadian Health Index survey, it showed that 45 per cent of individuals were experiencing uncomfortable levels of stress related to personal or household finances

4. Women (and girls) need it

Women without financial independence are more likely to find themselves in abusive relationships and/or stay in abusive relationships. Access to quality financial education for women and girls at an early age may be able to prevent some of these outcomes.

5. Benefits forIndigenous peoples

The Prosper Canada Centre for Financial Literacy has found that Indigenous people experience multiple socioeconomic barriers that affect their quality of life. Low-income, gaining and maintaining employment, and lower levels of educational attainment are barriers that span over generations.

It would seem inhumane to take away an individual's right to education, yet we neglect to provide access to financial literacy, a necessity to survive in today's world. In order to break the cycle of poverty, abuse, neglect and mental illness, we have to have a publicly funded education program for youth and we must support the creation of a Canadian Children's Charter.

If we want a prosperous future, we have to invest in our next generation. Creating a Canadian Children's Charter that includes an inclusive and differentiated financial literacy program can remove the shackles of financial burden for generations to come.

S'agit-il d'une première, dans les relations entre un président et les médias?","""Aussi incompréhensible que cela puisse sembler, la victoire de Donald Trump est aujourd'hui bien réelle."" Le 8 novembre 2016, le monde entier découvrait dans un semi-état de choc le nom du nouveau président des Etats-Unis, personnage aussi controversé qu'inattendu. Depuis, Donald Trump impose son style à la Maison Blanche comme sur la scène internationale. Et s'y adapter n'est pas de tout repos.

Si une chose ressort de la première année de présidence Trump, c'est bien qu'il faut s'attendre à tout. En un an, le président des Etats-Unis aura ordonné une intervention en Syrie devant une part de gâteau, transformé ses maisons de vacances en un nouveau lieu du pouvoir américain, fait un usage quotidien de Twitter, limogé ses conseillers presqu'aussi souvent qu'il ne tweete...

En un mot? Il aura agi comme aucun autre président avant lui, et il sait bien pourquoi: en rompant totalement avec la façon d'agir et de gouverner de ses prédécesseurs et de ses adversaires, Donald Trump continue à satisfaire son électorat qui l'a d'ailleurs élu en partie sur ce sentiment de ""ras-le-bol"", comme nous l'explique Amanda Terkel, chef du bureau du HuffPost américain à Washington.

""Donald Trump est un nouveau visage en politique. Il a eu des difficultés à s'adapter à Washington, il y a eu des rotations d'envergure dans son gouvernement, des difficultés avec certaines personnes -comme par exemple Michael Flynn- qui soulèvent des questions sur sa capacité à recruter à des postes importants.""

""Il n'était pas complètement préparé à la transition vers la Maison Blanche, parce que la plupart des gens s'attendaient à une victoire d'Hillary Clinton. Ce qui signifie qu'il n'avait pas de politique complète ni de plans prévus non plus"", analyse Amanda Terkel.

Durant le temps qu'il a passé comme ""président élu"" (entre novembre 2016 et le 20 janvier 2017), une telle situation n'est pas si exceptionnelle. Sans doute peut-on envisager qu'il faille un peu de temps pour comprendre le fonctionnement et les enjeux de la politique américaine, a fortiori lorsque, comme Donald Trump, on est davantage un ""businessman"" qu'un homme politique.

Mais une fois cette période de transition révolue, cette cacophonie ne s'est pas apaisée, loin de là. En témoignent les nombreux ""couacs"" qui agitent régulièrement les couloirs de la Maison Blanche, sur des questions internes -comme les licenciements et démissions en série- comme sur des questions de politique nationale (avec par exemple la difficulté pour le président à faire passer ses lois au Congrès où il a pourtant la majorité) et internationale.

Un exemple de dissonances régulières? La différence entre les annonces faites sur Twitter par le président et ce qui en découle réellement par la suite. ""Trump a dit qu'il excluait de l'armée les militaires transgenres. Mais il n'est pas vraiment passé par les canaux appropriés pour le faire. Et ensuite, lorsque la loi est sortie, elle n'était pas exactement la même que ce qu'il avait initialement dit"", détaille Amanda Terkel.

Trump, Twitter et les médias

Entre ce qui est annoncé -le plus souvent avec moult points d'exclamation, majuscules et superlatifs- et ce qui est fait, il y a donc une marge. Avec des conséquences différentes: du coté des opposants de Donald Trump, ces annonces brutales provoquent généralement des levées de bouclier (la Women March en est une illustration).

Mais pour les journalistes chargés de suivre l'actualité politique américaine, cet écart n'est pas sans conséquence professionnelle: ""Trump est toujours président, rappelle la chef du HuffPost à Washington. Donc quand il y a des déclarations contradictoires, nous devons le raconter dans l'article, et ensuite, observer ce qui se passe vraiment. Nous devons être sûrs que nous essayons d'expliquer au lecteur l'histoire complète, si il y a plus que ce qui a été tweeté ou ce que Trump a dit.""

""Ce qui a été tweeté"", précise Amanda Terkel. Le terme mérite d'être souligné. Car désormais, il semble difficile d'évoquer Donald Trump sans parler de son canal de communication favori, Twitter. Un nouveau paramètre à intégrer pour la population mais aussi pour les journalistes. ""Trump est le premier président à utiliser Twitter de cette façon"", confirme Amanda Terkel. ""Il l'utilise pour passer outre les médias et sa propre équipe, afin de véhiculer son message.""

""Les journalistes doivent définitivement se réveiller le matin, voir ce que Trump a tweeté et décider de la façon dont ils vont couvrir ses tweets. Qu'est-ce qui mérite d'être relayé par la presse? Vous ne voulez pas donner à ses tweets trop d'attention si ce n'est pas justifié, mais il est le président, donc vous ne pouvez pas non plus les ignorer.""

Mais tous les jours, les journalistes débattent, dans toutes les rédactions, de s'ils vont couvrir ou non un tweet de Trump.

A l'opposé des années Obama, où l'ancien président s'est distingué par une communication bien rodée qui inspire d'ailleurs certains, Donald Trump a donc choisi une stratégie plus agressive: énoncer ses idées sans filtre, sans hésiter à mentionner ses adversaires, qu'il s'agisse de ""crooked Hillary"" ou des ""fake news medias"".

Entre le 8 novembre 2016 et le 7 novembre 2017, ce terme ""fake news"" est d'ailleurs apparu 126 fois dans les tweets du président selon le site de décompte Trump Twitter Archive, l'expression ""fake news media"" revenant 32 fois. Des organes de presse aussi ancestraux aux Etats-Unis que le New York Times ou CNN ont été abondamment critiqués, avec parfois une violence suffisante pour interroger sur le respect du 1er amendement de la Constitution américaine.

S'agit-il d'une première, dans les relations entre un président et les médias? Amanda Terkel nuance: ""Le département de justice d'Obama s'est en pris aux lanceurs d'alerte qui parlaient aux journalistes également, et les médias étaient sous pression à ce moment là aussi"", rappelle-t-elle. Toutefois, si Obama préférait des représailles discrètes, Donald Trump a choisi une stratégie différente: ""Trump est plus agressif dans sa façon de s'en prendre aux journalistes, en les appelant par leur nom, en insultant les médias dans leur ensemble, et même en faisant semblant d'encourager la violence envers les journalistes. Il dit qu'il prend très à coeur le 1er amendement (qui protège la liberté d'expression, entre autres, ndlr), mais c'est vrai que sa rhétorique n'y correspond pas toujours.""

De l'avenir de la fonction présidentielle américaine

Le 12 juillet 2017, un élu démocrate de la Chambre des Représentants américains a déposé la première résolution pour la destitution de Donald Trump. La question est d'ailleurs régulièrement évoquée par les opposants au président, bien qu'une destitution n'ait en réalité que peu de chances d'aboutir. Mais qu'il achève (ou non) son mandat, l'élection de Donald Trump n'en aura pas moins eu des conséquences sur l'image de la fonction présidentielle américaine.

""Beaucoup de personnes soutiendraient que Trump a rendu la présidence moins professionnelle. Avec ses insultes, sa rhétorique incendiaire et à la façon dont il s'en prend aux autres, il ne correspond pas toujours à ce que les gens attendent d'un président. On ne sait pas si les futurs présidents reprendront ses répliques ou pas.""

Un an après l'élection, il est sans doute difficile de se pencher sur la question, et ce d'autant plus que les adversaires sérieux pour 2020 semblent manquer pour l'instant. En ce qui concerne les retombées immédiates en revanche, elles sont beaucoup plus claires: selon un sondage YouGov réalisé pour Le HuffPost et CNEWS, 68% des Français ont une opinion négative du chef d'état américain. Soit neuf points de plus qu'en février 2016 note l'institut de sondage.

Les raisons de cette baisse de popularité? Elles sont multiples: le retrait de l'Accord de Paris y est sûrement pour quelque chose, alors qu'un sondage réalisé dans 38 pays en août 2017 (soit deux mois après la décision du président) soulignait que le réchauffement climatique était considéré comme l'une des deux premières menaces planétaires par 61% des personnes interrogées (56% pour la seule population américaine). Les décisions d'ordre géopolitique du président ""America First"" ont aussi certainement leur place, et ce d'autant plus que Donald Trump succède à Barack Obama, qui a entretenu des relations pour le moins cordiales, sinon toujours apaisées, avec la plupart des autres dirigeants.

""Trump a tendu des alliances avec certains pays. Cela s'est également produit pendant l'administration du président George W. Bush, lorsque des pays ont été frustrés par la guerre en Irak, par exemple. Obama, quant à lui, a été accueilli plus chaleureusement dans le monde entier"", analyse Amanda Terkel, qui évoque cependant une évolution plus globale des mentalités en politique. ""Beaucoup de gens à l'étranger semblent être un peu déconcertés par Trump et sa victoire, mais là encore, les politiciens de droite gagnent aussi en popularité dans d'autres pays européens.""

En France, le second tour de l'élection présidentielle a opposé une candidate d'extrême droite et un candidat fraîchement débarqué en politique, qui a tout misé (avec succès) sur la rupture avec les partis traditionnels. Mais le Brexit, l'élection de Donald Trump, ou encore l'arrivée en Allemagne du parti d'extrême droite à l'Assemblée viennent également illustrer cette évolution, avec la particularité pour Donald Trump d'occuper une place centrale du tableau, en tant que dirigeant de la première puissance mondiale.

Users tweeting in Chinese, Japanese and Korean will still have the original limit. That’s because writing in those languages uses fewer characters. The company says 9 percent of tweets written in English hit the 140-character limit. People end up spending more time editing tweets or don’t send them out at all. Although many are enjoying their new doubled word limit, some people think an edit button would be more useful.

Twitter hopes that the expanded limit will get more people tweeting more, helping its lackluster user growth. Twitter has been testing the new limit for weeks and is starting to roll it out Tuesday.

We're expanding the character limit! We want it to be easier and faster for everyone to express themselves.

Here’s where the double standard hurts: When that man killed 58 people in Las Vegas, the word terrorist was not uttered by anyone.","I grew up saying “Allahu Akbar” numerous times every day.

And no, I wasn’t, and am not, a terrorist.

I wasn’t someone who blew buildings up, killed people or shot a missile from my rocket launcher. As far as the West is concerned, those are the events associated with the saying when something bad is about to happen. People of the West are terrified of the phrase.

I was a Muslim boy trying to pray as many times as he could amidst a life of love and peace, in a home that did not condone any terrorism. My father was a poet who read me love poetry instead of nursery rhymes. He uttered the phrase when he prayed. If love existed in the form of a man, it was my father.

“Love everyone,” was the phrase he uttered almost daily. To him, there was not a problem he couldn’t solve with love.

Allahu Akbar

The saying literally means God is the greatest. It is required of all Muslims to say several times during prayer, which is demanded five times a day. On the average a Muslim ends up saying it hundreds of times. The words are also used as a celebration of life: When a baby is born, when a couple marry or when a veteran returns home safe.

The word Islam means surrender. You’re supposed to surrender to God and worship him. Love, mercy and compassion are uttered several hundred times a day by any Muslim when they say Besm Allah Alrahman Alraheem, In The Name Of God The Merciful The Compassionate. That saying is uttered before you do anything.

So when and why is the phrase Allahu Akbar used as a battle cry, when a terrorist is about to kill someone? The latest incident was the horrific act in New York when the terrorist shouted the phrase before the police shot him, and after he killed eight people and injured many more.

For the majority of Muslims, to shout God’s name as you killed the innocent is an abomination. Muslims no more want innocent people killed than anyone else. So why is the phrase used by terrorists?

For the same reason ISIS and Al-Qaida exist: The misinterpretation of Islam. When you use religion as the motive for you actions, you have the power to appeal to the masses. It’s a brain washing if you will. The terrorists who flew the planes into the World Trade Center on September 11th are no different than any suicide bomber in Israel/Palestine, are no different that the one who mowed down bicyclists in New York. They are people who misunderstood and misused the religion. They are sick and twisted and evil.

The phrase is to remind Muslims that God is supreme. That’s it. It was never to be used as a battle cry during horrendous actions furthering political agendas with evil motives.

My heart sank when I heard the terrorist shouted the saying after the attack. I will never understand the link between Islam and Terrorism. The Islam I grew up amidst condemns such actions. It preaches love and peace and tranquility and feeding the hungry and clothing the poor and sheltering the homeless. One of the five main requirements of Islam in addition to prayer and fasting is to give a percentage of your money to the poor.

Is There A Difference?

To me, there is no difference between the terrorists who shout Allahu Akbar when committing a crime and those white nationalists and racists who shouted “Jews will not replace us” in Charlottesville ― Virginia recently.

Here’s where the double standard hurts: When that man killed 58 people in Las Vegas, the word terrorist was not uttered by anyone. Why is it only attached to people who claim Islamic affiliation?

The Quran was brought down to Muhammad in the seventh century. The verses which preach war and fighting were contextual and apply to the time when he and his followers had no choice but to fight back, or die. It is no different than the Old Testament which contains many verses preaching war and killing.

In Deuteronomy Chapter 2, Verses 32-37, Moses is told to kill men, women, and children:

“And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Siphon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land. Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz. And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones , of every city, we left none to remain. From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us.”

How is this any different than what’s in the Quran? And why are Muslims judged by a different prism? Most of the Quran preaches love and harmony and helping those who have not. Take this for example:

“And feed with food the needy wretch, the orphan and the prisoner, for love of Him (saying): We feed you, for the sake of Allah only. We wish for no reward nor thanks from you.” [76:8-9]

Any ancient religious book can be misunderstood and misrepresented. The Ku Klux Klan said the Jesus was the first Klansman. They burned crosses to spread their ill will. How is that any different?

My Sister

Karim Shamsi-Basha My sisters Mimi, right, and Rowaida.

My sister Rowaida lives in New York. We chatted last night when I wanted to make sure her head covering was not causing any problems. In the past when terrorists committed atrocities in the name of Islam, women with head coverings were profiled. She said everything was fine, and prayed for those people affected by the terror.

My sister prayed for them.

She is a teacher and her husband is an architect. All they want is food, water, and a roof over their heads, and for their children to thrive. They have four: a computer scientist, a doctor, a physical therapist, and a pharmacist. They love like anyone else, and they have compassion and mercy and empathy like anyone else.

The covering on her head says two things: Modesty and humility.

A Wish Or Two

I have one wish, well maybe two.

The first is for my children to thrive and go through life without any judgment based on their last name.

The second is for this world to know that Muslims mean no one any harm. The people who mean harm are as far from Islam as the KKK is far from Christianity.

Rekindling has won the 2017 Melbourne Cup at Flemington.

Johannes Vermeer ran second and Max Dynamite ran third -- an incredible performance from the nine-year-old which ran second in 2015. Big Duke ran fourth, the first Australian horse to finish.

The winner was purchased as a yearling by prominent Melbourne businessman Lloyd Williams, who has now won his sixth Cup as an owner.

Rekindling, which started at 15-1, was ridden by Corey Brown, the Sydney-based rider originally from the tiny town of Wingham, on the NSW north coast. Brown rode 2009 Melbourne Cup winner Shocking, and has ridden around the world since then, before moving back home earlier this year.

Just got there. That's Rekindling in the pink cap.

""I've been back from overseas for about nine months, I can't believe it,"" Brown told Channel 7, flanked by his wife Kylie and brood of three teenage daughters.

""It's a dream even riding in the race but to come out and win it again... I'm lost for words.""

....Aaaand that makes two Cups for Corey.

This was a stirring Melbourne Cup. As with 2016 when Heartbreak City and Almandin cleared out from the pack, two horses battled it out down that long, long Flemington straight.

Johannes Vermeer had been ridden beautifully -- so well in fact that jockey Ben Melham perhaps hit the lead a little earlier than planned. He kicked well clear. But could he hold on? Almost. Half a length was the difference and all credit to the winner.

Incredibly, the Irish-trained winner was the youngest horse in the race -- classed as a four year old in Australia because the horses' birthday falls on August 1, but technically still three.

His trainer Joseph O'Brien is also young, at just 24. His father Aidan O'Brien is one of the foremost trainers in the world, but young Joe has now done something his dad is yet to achieve.

""I really didn't expect to have to say a few words. All I can really do is thank Lloyd and Nick [Williams] who sent me the horse at the start of the year. I can't quite believe it yet.""",Melbourne Cup 2017: The Winner Is Rekindling,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/06/melbourne-cup-2017-the-winner-is-rekindling_a_23268830/

A man in Tamil Nadu was so overcome with anger that some puppies apparently peed in his clothes, that he flung them off a terrace, killing them on the spot. Worse, he boasted about killing the first puppy, posting it on a WhatsApp group, reported The Times of India.

""1 down, 1 more to go, DoggyTales,"" Vishesh Iyengar reportedly posted in a WhatsApp group of some of his classmates at an engineering college in Vellore. ""Black dog down,"" he replied after a group member asked him if the dog was dead.

According to reports, Iyengar killed one black puppy and another light brown puppy soon afterwards. The second puppy had been recently rescued by another resident in the area and was their pet. It had apparently wandered into the apartment complex where Iyengar lives.

A police complaint has been registered at the Katpadi K1 station by animal rights activists. The resident who had rescued the second puppy reportedly claimed that Iyengar did not show any remorse, saying, ""It's just a dog, I didn't kill a human.""

Dozenten haben es oft nicht leicht. Sie stecken Mühe und Arbeit in den Unterricht ihrer Studenten und letztlich wird ihnen oft nur mit schlechten Testergebnissen gedankt. Es ist daher wohl nachvollziehbar, dass der ein oder andere Professor frustriert ist.

In Los Angeles brachte die Frustration einen Professor jetzt sogar wortwörtlich dazu, sich in einen Sarg zu legen.

“Eure Testergebnisse waren zum Sterben schlecht”

Nachdem eine Klausur schlecht ausgefallen ist, ließ er sich nämlich etwas ziemlich Erschreckendes für seine Studenten einfallen. Er legte sich in einen Sarg, der im Hörsaal aufgestellt wurde. Seine Erklärung: “Eure Testergebnisse waren zum Sterben schlecht.”

Einer seiner Studenten, Mario, hielt den Streich des Lehrers auf einem Foto fest und teilte dieses auf Twitter.

""Mein Ziel im Leben ist es, so dramatisch wie er zu sein""

Hunderttausende Twitter-User waren begeistert von der Aktion des Dozenten und teilten und kommentierten den Post. Das Foto sorgte allerdings auch für viel Verwirrung. So wunderten sich einige, woher er den Sarg hatte und wie er ihn in den Hörsaal der Universität gebracht hat.

“Sind Särge nicht ziemlich teuer? Oder kann man die heutzutage auch mieten? Ich habe so viele Fragen”, schrieb zum Beispiel ein Twitter-Nutzer. Andere applaudieren dem Professor und merken anerkennend an: “Mein Ziel im Leben ist es, so dramatisch wie er zu sein.”

CDU-Politiker Meister forderte bei ""Hart aber fair"" Einblicke in das Material, um Steuerbetrug besser aufklären zu können

Doch Investigativ-Journalist Mascolo glaubt nicht, dass das helfen würde

Die Fronten bei ""Hart aber fair"" waren klar: Michael Meister, CDU-Politiker und Parlamentarischer Staatssekretär beim Bundesfinanzminister, fordert eine Veröffentlichung der Paradise Papers.

Doch Investigativ-Journalist Georg Mascolo, der das Rechercheteam von NDR, WDR und ""Süddeutscher Zeitung"" leitet, lehnt jegliche Zusammenarbeit mit staatlichen Behörden ab. Sein Team hat die Dokumente für deutsche Leser ausgewertet.

Besonders absurd findet Mascolo dabei ein Argument, das CDU-Politiker Meister mantraartig im ARD-Talk von Frank Plasberg wiederholt: Eine Offenlegung der Papiere würde den Finanzbehörden helfen, mögliche neue Konstruktionen zur Steuerumgehung zu finden.

Die Probleme sind völlig offensichtlich

""Man muss gar kein Steuerrechtsseminar hier abhalten"", warf Mascolo in die Runde. Die Dinge, die nicht in Ordnung seien, könne jeder relativ einfach erkennen. Dann zerlegte der renommierte Journalist in drei Sätzen die Argumentation Meisters und anderer Finanzpolitiker:

► ""Wenn ich vor einem Haus stehe, in dem es drei Stockwerke gibt und 700 Firmen registriert sind, dann weiß ich, dass dort irgendetwas nicht in Ordnung ist.""

► ""Wenn auf einer Kleinstinsel 1000 Flugzeuge registriert sind, dann weiß ich, dass das nicht in Ordnung ist.""

► ""Und wenn ein international gut verdienendes Unternehmen seine Steuerlast auf 13 bis 15 Prozent drückt, dann weiß ich, dass etwas nicht in Ordnung ist.""

Mascolo erbost: ""Wir diskutieren über diese Dinge schon viel zu lange.""

Ein Teil des Problems innerhalb der EU sei, dass es nicht nur um Kleinststaaten in der Karibik oder im Ärmelkanal geht. ""Wir reden über Mitgliedsstaaten in der Europäischen Union."" Damit spielt er auf Malta und die Niederlande an, die als Steueroasen in den Paradise Papers auftauchen.

Viele Pläne - ""Aber nichts geschieht""

Mascolo beklagte, dass es kurz nach öffentlichkeitswirksamen Steuerleaks immer wieder Pläne zum Stopfen der Schlupflöcher gegeben habe - doch die seien meistens nach ein oder zwei Jahren versandet.

An CDU-Politiker Meister gerichtet erklärte Mascolo: ""Ich wette, die Finanzbeamten kennen längst alle Konstruktionen. (...) Denn da stecken nicht viele Geheimnisse drin.""

The Swedish researchers followed the teenagers for up to three decades, from the age of 16 through to 46 years.

Sixteen-year-olds who scored in the bottom quarter of their year at school were five times more likely to end up in hospital due to suicide attempts or self harm than top performing students.

It found that students who scored in the bottom quarter of their year at the age of 16 were five times more likely to end up in hospital due to suicide attempts or self harm than those who were in the top quarter.

Both men and women who struggled at school were equally affected.

Moreover, it was not only the transition from high school into adult life which saw a spike in suicide attempts -- poor performers were at an elevated risk right up to middle age.

""This is a highly elevated risk, and it is remarkable that it reaches far into adulthood,"" the study's lead author Dr Alma Sorberg Wallin of the Karolinska Institutet said.

But Dr Wallin also noted that the study didn't prove that it was the difficulties at school directly causing poor mental health, as students who struggle academically are also more likely to come from low socio-economic families and have other risk factors for poor mental health.

This is a highly elevated risk, and it is remarkable that it reaches far into adulthood.""

""We would however need to know more to identify helpful interventions -- for example, is school failure in itself a risk factor, or is poor performance rather an indicator of vulnerability?""

Interestingly, the researchers found that how well the students did at school was a much better indicator of their risk of suicide than their IQ, suggesting it was not the students' intelligence per say which put them at risk.

Delaying entry to school (i.e. starting school at age 6 rather than age 5) also made no difference to the participants' mental health as adults.

Starting school later to school had no affect -- positive or negative -- on the participants' mental health as adults.

The University of Sydney's Associate Professor Alexandra Martiniuk said the findings agreed with previous, smaller studies done in the U.S, China and New Zealand.

A child health epidemiologist for vulnerable children, Martiniuk said it was possible that the flow-on effects from poor grades in high school -- inhibiting a person's ability to go on to further study and potentially resulting in a worse job and thus socio-economic position -- were what was behind the poor mental health.

""Alternatively, it could be that characteristics in childhood -- like impulsivity or behaviour challenges -- are associated with suicidality, and these characteristics are likely to lead to poor school grades,"" she theorised.

""Doing poorly in school typically pummels one's self-esteem and this could also increase risk of suicidality.""

She said the findings were a reminder of the need for more school program to improve social and emotional abilities in children, which not only lower students' emotional distress but also improve their academic performance.

""Lo elogia para preparar el terreno y ponerle de buen humor porque tiene cosas desagradables para decirle"", ha opinado el sinólogo Jean-Pierre Cabestan, de la Universidad Bautista de Hong Kong.

LAS TENSAS RELACIONES CON CHINA

China, que asegura 90% del comercio con Corea del Norte, está en una posición crucial para presionar al régimen de Kim Jong-Un, que en septiembre pasado llevó a cabo un nuevo ensayo nuclear.

El gobierno chino se comprometió a aplicar estrictamente las últimas sanciones de la ONU contra Corea del Norte, pero rechaza las amenazas de Donald Trump y aboga por un diálogo con su vecino.

Antes de viajar a China, Trump lanzó en Seúl una nueva advertencia al presidente norcoreano, a quien instó a abandonar su programa nuclear y a salir de su aislamiento a través de la diplomacia.

""No nos subestimen, no nos pongan a prueba"", dijo Trump en un discurso pronunciado ante el parlamento de Seúl. ""Todas las naciones responsables deben unir sus fuerzas para aislar al brutal régimen de Corea del Norte"", pidió Trump. ""No se puede apoyar, no se puede suministrar, no se puede aceptar"", dijo en referencia a China y a Rusia.

Aplaudido por los parlamentarios, Trump advirtió que no dejará que ""las ciudades estadounidenses sean amenazadas con la destrucción"". ""Llegó la hora de la fuerza"", dijo el presidente estadounidense.

La visita de Trump a Corea del Sur ha estado marcada por el clima de tensión que impera en la península coreana, debido a la intensificación del programa nuclear norcoreano.

Pyongyang realizó en septiembre su sexto ensayo nuclear, el más poderoso hasta la fecha, y probó varios misiles capaces de alcanzar el territorio estadounidense

En su discurso, Trump calificó al régimen de Pyongyang como una ""cruel dictadura"", pero ofreció al líder norcoreano ""un camino hacia un futuro mejor"". ""Las armas con las que ustedes se están haciendo no les darán más seguridad"", dijo Trump. ""Están poniendo a su régimen ante un grave peligro"", advirtió.

""Sin embargo, pese a todos los crímenes cometidos contra Dios y el hombre"", agregó, ""nosotros les vamos a ofrecer un camino hacia un futuro mejor"".

En sus palabras, el presidente estadounidense también destacó su vínculo con Corea del Sur.

Por la mañana, Trump fue obligado a suspender un intento de visita sorpresa a la Zona Desmilitarizada que divide la península de Corea debido al mal tiempo, lo que le dejó ""bastante frustrado"", según dijo la Casa Blanca.

La Casa Blanca había informado antes del viaje que el mandatario no visitaría la zona pero Trump dejó su hotel en Seúl temprano por la mañana y abordó un helicóptero en la base militar de Yongsan, pero fue obligado a dar marcha atrás.

Es habitual que los presidentes estadounidenses que visitan Corea del Sur se desplacen a esta zona. Los soldados de Seúl y los de Pyongyang se sitúan frente a frente a lo largo de la franja de seguridad marcada por bloques de hormigón y casetas azules.

El presidente surcoreano, Moon Jae-In, había volado con anterioridad, antes de que el tiempo empeorara, por lo que se quedó esperando ante la frontera, una zona llena de alambradas, sembrada de minas y barreras antitanques, según los medios.

El helicóptero de Trump despegó de Yongsan pero tuvo que volver debido al mal tiempo. Esperó durante casi una hora a que las condiciones mejoraran, pero el tiempo empeoró y el viaje fue cancelado.

""La verdad es que está bastante frustrado"", dijo Sanders.

Sanders dijo que estaba previsto que el presidente surcoreano, Moon Jae-In, se encontrara con Trump en la franja de seguridad, lo que según Sanders, hubiera sido ""un momento histórico"", ya que nunca un presidente estadounidense ha visitado junto al jefe de Estado surcoreano la zona.","Trump llega a China, la etapa más delicada de su gira asiática centrada en Corea del Norte",http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2017/11/08/trump-llega-a-china-la-etapa-mas-delicada-de-su-gira-asiatica-centrada-en-corea-del-norte_a_23270327/

Your body processes calories from certain foods differently, depending on whether or not the food (and its ingredients) are nutrient-rich or nutrient-poor. Kelly Hogan, a clinical nutrition and wellness manager at Mount Sinai’s Dubin Breast Cancer center, helped explain why certain foods, such as kale, are processed differently in our bodies than a food like sugary cereal. She said it’s important to focus on the nutrient density of foods.

“A [100-calorie] bowl of kale with an egg is going to give you high quality protein, fiber and a big variety of vitamins and minerals like vitamins, A, C, K, folate, etc,” Hogan said. “A [100-calorie bowl of] cereal that is high in sugar is not going to give you the same quality nutrients. And what’s more, the fact that it is low in protein and fiber but high in sugar can set you up for a blood sugar spike and crash, bringing on more cravings for sweets or refined starches throughout the day.

She added, “It’s easy to overeat when eating these types of food because of these blood sugar fluctuations and the fact that they aren’t typically super filling.”

You can tell you’re having a blood sugar crash if you start to experience irritability, dizziness, weakness or an intense feeling of hunger, Hogan said.

“This is where the term ‘hangry’ comes from as well ― when our blood sugar is low and we need to eat something, we often have difficulty concentrating, focusing and are more likely to snap at others,” she explained. “The body will physiologically crave something sweet or starchy when blood sugar is low because these are the foods that can raise blood sugar quickly.”

To prevent these type of crashes, try eating foods that are nutrient rich, like fruits, veggies, lean proteins, legumes, nuts, seeds, beans and dairy (the Center for Disease Control has a helpful graphic that offers nutrient-dense information for certain ingredients). Hogan likes to call these “whole foods” and you might know some of them by another term ― “complex carbohydrates.”

“Complex carbohydrates are carbohydrates that take the body longer to break down into sugar because they have longer, more complex chemical structures compared to sugar,” she said. “They are a more sustainable energy source because of this and won’t raise blood sugar quite as quickly as more simple sugars.”

And no matter what, don’t assign foods labels like “good” or “bad.”

“Giving food labels like that fuels a diet culture and harmful relationship with food,” Hogan said. “In a diet with plenty of these whole foods, there is absolutely room for less nutrient dense but also delicious foods, like cake, for example.”",How Your Body Knows The Difference Between 100 Calories Of Kale vs. Junk Food,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-your-body-processes-100-calories-of-cereal-differently-from-100-calories-of-kale_us_59fc8990e4b0b0c7fa39c362

Virginia Democratic Del.
This is a tsunami,” said David Toscano, the Democratic leader in the Virginia House of Delegates.
But what Democrats hope is that the GOP loss in Virginia ― where Gillespie played up the nativist message popularized by Trump ― will make Republicans rethink their strategy.","FAIRFAX, Va. ― The Democratic Party romped to victories across the country Tuesday, gaining key state legislative seats, two governorships and full control of the state governments of New Jersey and Washington, where they’ll have wide power to enact their agenda.

In one sense, the wins should have been expected: President Donald Trump is extremely unpopular, and the party that holds the White House usually does worse in congressional, state and local elections in years when the president isn’t on the ballot.

And the victories were expected in some cases. In New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs banker, consistently led in the polls and will now be the next governor. But elsewhere, outcomes were more uncertain.

Many Democratic activists were worried that the party was going to let the Virginia governor’s mansion slip from its grasp. Concern that Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam was failing to excite the base, along with a fear-mongering anti-immigrant campaign run by Republican Ed Gillespie, led to concerns it would be a repeat of the 2016 presidential race.

Win McNamee via Getty Images Democrat Ralph Northam celebrates his victory over Ed Gillespie to be governor of Virginia.

Northam, however, sailed to victory Tuesday, guaranteeing Democrats a seat at the table when state legislative and congressional districts get redrawn in 2020. The party won the races for lieutenant governor and attorney general, too.

The night was validation for the many activists around the country who joined the resistance after Trump’s win and have been feverishly working at the grassroots to mobilize the party’s base. There’s no doubt that the victories will provide a jolt of energy for what’s coming in the 2018 midterm elections.

“Today’s progressive victories in Virginia make one thing clear: A newly awakened grassroots movement is rising up to reject Trump’s politics of hate and reclaim political power,” said Maria Urbina, the political director of the progressive Indivisible movement, which has more than 180 active groups in Virginia.

Democrats also saw the wins as a rejection of the type of nationalism championed by Trump and his former aide, Breitbart News Executive Chairman Steve Bannon, who maintained that a win by Gillespie in Virginia would prove that “Trumpism without Trump can show the way forward.”

“Tonight, the message for Democrats and the country is that fear and division and hatred do not work,” Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) said. “They don’t work here in Virginia, and they’re not going to work in Virginia.”

Trump attempted to distance himself from the crushing GOP losses Tuesday night, tweeting from South Korea that Gillespie “worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for.”

Almost no one expected Democrats to do as well as they did in the Virginia House of Delegates. Democrats targeted the 17 GOP-held districts where Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton defeated Trump. Winning all of the seats would swing control of the chamber, but few thought it was possible. Republicans have controlled the state’s house of delegates for nearly two decades and held a 66-34 majority.

The last time Democrats picked up more than one seat in the body was 2007, when they gained four. Last week, Virginia Democratic National Committeewoman Yasmine Taeb estimated that a pickup of six to eight seats would constitute a “success.”

But by 9:30 p.m., Democrats had already picked up 14 Republican-held seats in the House of Delegates, with eight more in play.

Northern Virginia, a Democratic stronghold, turned only bluer. Voters outside a polling location in Fairfax, which supported Clinton by a two-to-one margin in 2016, cited health care, education and Trump as top issues that drove them to the polls Tuesday.

“It seems like the other guy, Gillespie, he’s being supported by Trump, and [the president] tweeted about him,” Soleyman Ahmed, who voted for Northam, told HuffPost. “Northam seems like he’s a doctor, he’s served in the government, he’s got experience that could help.”

The electoral wave lifted the fortunes of even very left-wing candidates, including Democrat Lee Carter, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and supporter of single-payer health care. He unseated GOP House Majority Whip Jackson Miller in Northern Virginia’s 50th District. Carter, a former Marine, failed to provide the state Democratic Party with daily updates about his campaign, prompting the party to deny him aid and go silent on his bid.

In Virginia’s 13th District, outside Fredericksburg, voters ousted Republican Del. Bob Marshall, the author of the state’s bill to ban transgender people from using the bathrooms of their choice, and replaced him with Danica Roem, a transgender woman who ran on a platform of fixing the area’s transit problems.

Virginia Democratic Del. Charniele Herring said Roem’s victory “sends a message to politicians that the politics of bigotry is over. It’s not acceptable to voters.”

The wins in New Jersey, Virginia and Washington, where Democrats won a key Washington state Senate seat — and, with it, control of the only part of the state government they didn’t already run — will have real policy consequences in the short term. Northam will be able to veto Republican legislation in Virginia, and Democratic pickups in the Virginia House of Delegates will give him much more leverage in the legislature. New Jersey, where Murphy ran on promises to legalize marijuana and introduce public banking will be under full Democratic control for the first time in nearly a decade. In Washington, Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee and the Democratic-controlled legislature will have much more freedom to enact their agenda.

The election results will affect lives in other states, too. In Maine, voters approved a ballot measure expanding Medicaid to tens of thousands of people over the objections of Paul LePage, the state’s Republican governor. In New York City, Bill de Blasio — who achieved a longstanding liberal goal of creating a universal pre-kindergarten program — became the first Democratic mayor to win reelection since Ed Koch in 1985.

The big question for Democrats now will be whether they can translate wins in this year’s elections to victories in next year’s congressional midterm elections. The Virginia electorate in 2017 is not the same territory as the battlegrounds Democrats will face next year — for one thing, Trump is more unpopular in the state than he is in the nation as a whole. And, as FiveThirtyEight recently noted, Virginia’s off-year results “haven’t been so predictive” as a barometer of each party’s strength in the following midterm House races.

But what Democrats hope is that the GOP loss in Virginia ― where Gillespie played up the nativist message popularized by Trump ― will make Republicans rethink their strategy.

“I think the appeal to the bad side of human instinct ― which Donald Trump did when he ran, and now Republicans are adopting ― does not serve America well, but won’t serve them well either,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told HuffPost on Tuesday, before the results came in.

Next up: A Dec. 12 special election for a U.S. Senate race in deep-red Alabama, where Roy Moore, a controversial-but-Republican judge, is narrowly leading former U.S. attorney Doug Jones, a Democrat, in the polls.

But on Tuesday night, most Democrats were still focused on celebrating their victories, not preparing for the long slog ahead.

The Democrats are like “the field goal kicker who’s missed three kicks in a row,” said Jared Leopold, communications director for the Democratic Governors Association. “Now we’ve made a few, and we’ve got our groove back.”

“Welcome to the bounce-back,” said Paul Kent, an elated union member who attended Northam’s victory party on Tuesday. “People have been waiting for a day like today since Nov. 9. This was the real bellwether. The narrative is we’re coming. There is no apathy.”

Der junge Gründer Thomas stimmte die Löwen um

""Too Good to Go"" heißt ihre App. Was sie bietet: Kostengünstiges Essen aus Restaurants, Supermärkten und Hotels – und die Möglichkeit, Lebensmittelverschwendung zu bekämpfen. Es war der größte Deal, den die TV-Show ""Die Höhle der Löwen“ bislang gesehen hat.

Eine Millionen Euro bekamen die fünf Gründer der App von den Löwen geboten. Dabei hatte es am Anfang schlecht ausgesehen für die""Too Good to Go""-Jungs.

Die App zeigt den Usern an, wo sie die Gerichte zu einem reduzierten Preis bekommen und zu welchem Zeitpunkt sie diese abholen können. Dann können sie per Klick zuschlagen. ""60- bis 70-Prozent reduziert"", wie die Gründer erklären.

Für fünf Prozent ihres Unternehmens wollten die Dänen 1 Million Euro. Auf rund 19 Millionen Euro bezifferten sie ihren Firmen-Wert. Den Löwen war das zu viel – auch wenn alle von der Idee der App begeistert waren. ""Eins Plus mit Sternchen“, schwärmte Löwe Carsten Maschmeyer gar.

Das Unternehmen wächst, doch es braucht Überzeugung

Trotz guten Wachstumsaussichten, die die Gründer vorrechneten, stiegen alle fünf Investoren nacheinander aus.

Dann ergriff Gründer Thomas noch einmal das Wort – und plötzlich kam alles anders. Der 24-Jährige appellierte an die Investoren, mit ihnen ""etwas Cooles"" auf die Beine zu stellen. Es gehe nicht nur um Geld. ""Man kann Teil von etwas Größerem sein."" Im Verbund: Alle fünf Löwen sollten zusammen die Millionen locker machen.

Nach einer kurzen Beratung, für die sich alle zurückzogen, kam der Deal dann tatsächlich zustande. 200.000 Euro pro Kopf gegen 1,8 Prozent des Unternehmens für jeden, also etwas unter 10 Prozent der Anteile.

So einen Mega-Deal hatte es in der Vox-Show noch nie gegeben. Maschmeyer erklärte zurecht feierlich: ""Wir haben heute Löwen-Geschichte geschrieben.""

Update: Nachdem die Kameras aus waren, soll der Deal doch wieder geplatzt sein. Der Grund: Die dänischen Unternehmer überlegten es sich offenbar anders.

There's nothing quite like the winter romance of mountains and the movies.

The joys of this breathtaking and passionate affair is best summed up at the annual Dharamsala International Film Festival, now in its 6th edition.

Monks, both young and old, dressed in soothing red robes, people the vibrant town, strolling across its long-winding streets. Clad stylishly in what appear Ray Bans, red sneakers, and black backpacks, they make for quite a sight.

Tourists, both local and foreign, walk the streets with the restless enthusiasm only wanderlust can inspire. At the central square is where the cinephiles gather, exchanging notes about what to watch and what to skip, and where to find the most delicious Momos (it's at the Tibet Kitchen btw, a lovely restaurant just around the corner of the square).

Assembled under trying circumstances and functioning with modest resources, DIFF opened Thursday evening at the Tibetan Children's Village (TCV) near the Dal lake, about 10 minutes away from Dharamsala's main town, McLeod Ganj.

Free from the tempting vanities that the Mumbai Film Festival seductively pulls off, Dharamsala Film Festival, like the actor Adil Hussain said, is a great festival because 'there is no red carpet.'

Hussain, a naturally gifted actor, who sprung up on the scene with his layered performance in Gauri Shinde's much-celebrated English Vinglish, was present at the opening ceremony as his film, Mukti Bhavan (Hotel Salvation is its international title), opened the festival.

Hotel Salvation, which translates to 'deliverance from harm', is an uniquely inspiring choice of film for a festival set in Dharamsala, a place that's largely populated by Tibetans who escaped home due to a brutal Chinese oppression in search of a safe place. The festival founders, Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam, are vocal critics of the Chinese occupation of Tibet and its systematic cleansing of Tibetan culture.

In that context, Hotel Salvation is also a very political choice as opening film, even if it's incidental and not deliberate.

The film has been often cited as the best film of the year. At least that was the case until Amit Masurkar's Newton came along.

Directed by debutant Shubhashish Bhutiani, who was only 23 when he pitched the idea to Hussain, Mukti Bhavan is a hauntingly beautiful portrait of life and death and of troubled parent-offspring relationships.

As Hussain's character, Rajiv, takes his father to the titular hotel, where the elderly come to peacefully transition into the realm of the unknown, the film very subtly nudges one into examining our own attitudes towards mortality, parents as well as how their upbringing influences the way we end up treating our children. Incidentally, this was also one of the underlying themes in Titli.

Adil Hussain at the 6th Dharamsala International Film Festival.

Hussain and Behl have a fractured father-son relationship and it's this very complexity that Bhutiani explores with nuance and subtlety.

On the deathbed, can you get yourself to despise your father, or even love him fully, for the decisions that dramatically altered the course of your life? Hate, bitterness, distance are all components of the larger sentiment of love which overpowers most feelings in Hotel Salvation's morbid yet deeply funny universe.

The film has a terrific ensemble, led by Hussain and supported ably by Lalit Behl (who played the quietly sinister patriarch in Kanu Behl's Titli), Palomi Ghosh, Geetanjali Kulkarni, and Navnidra Behl.

Hussain spoke about how he drew out this part from his personal experience of having had a troubled relationship with his father, who wanted him to become a professor of English and not an actor. It was only in the last two years of his late father's life did he come around to approving his career choice, after watching an interview of his on the BBC.

About his performance, Hussain said, ""I have learnt to be responsive and not reactive. I tend to internalise and hold back my emotions. Whatever seeps out is the performance you see on-screen.""

Incidentally, Hussain's acting mentor, the legendary Barry John, was in the audience. About the film, Barry said, ""A film like Mukti Bhavan is so moving and one is at a loss for words. There are so many emotions one experiences that one doesn't know how to cope with it.""

It couldn't have been summed up in a better way.

The festival will continue until the weekend, where Rima Das' MAMI-favorite, Village Rockstars, plays as the closing film.

Among other films to be screened at the 4-day long festival include India's Oscar-entry Newton, Konkona Sen Sharma's A Death in the Gunj, and Rahul Jain's, Machines.

In his handwritten letters home, Cantlie referred to his daughter as ""wee Celia"" and added, ""Much love and lots of kisses from Daddy,"" CTV News reports.

Cantlie's daughter and granddaughter, Elspeth Angus, preserved the dried blossoms he sent, and now, a century later, 10 of the artifacts are on display in the Canadian War Museum's War Flowers exhibit.

Filmmaker Viveka Melki curated the moving multi-sensory display to highlight 10 personal wartime stories that give insight into human nature. Each of Cantlie's flowers represent one story, such as daisies, which are used to symbolize the lost innocence of Quebec armed force officer Jean Brillant, who died in battle, but was awarded the Victoria Cross for his contributions to the 1918 Battle of Amiens.

A post shared by Canadian War Museum (@canwarmuseum) on Nov 6, 2017 at 5:09pm PST

""The exhibit is not about battles and munitions, death or destruction, it's more about the people and the effect the war had on them and their personality,"" explained historian Alexander Reford, who helped Melki with the display.

According to Melki, ""the goal of the exhibit was to make history intimate."" As a result, she curated the display with all senses in mind to create an emotional experience for the viewer.

In addition to being visually appealing, War Flowers also includes an olfactory component where certain smells are released at the push of a button to trigger memories.

""War Flowers is an extraordinary example of art's power to enrich our understanding and experience of history in unexpected ways, while providing diverse perspectives on Canada's contribution to the war effort,"" said Canadian War Museum director, Stephen Quick, to Artsfile.

With Remembrance Day right around the corner, this exhibit is a powerful reminder of the contributions and sacrifices Canadians made in order to help bring the First World War to an end.

War Flowers is on display in Ottawa until Jan. 7, 2018, but is slated to move to Toronto, followed by France next spring and Montreal in July, CBC reports.

The Collins Dictionary has said the ""word of the year"" is ""fake news"" though of course that's two words. It had seen an unprecedented usage increase of 365% since 2016. ""Fake news today is legitimate news,"" it said.

Helen Newstead, the head of language content, said, ""Fake news, either as a statement of fact or as an accusation, has been inescapable, contributing to the undermining of society's trust in news reporting.""

While Trump may have helped Fake News win the word-of-the-year mantle, India has been quite a fake news factory.

Now, according to Asian Age, the government is contemplating cracking down on fake news.

And about time. Fake news in India is like air pollution in Delhi – toxic, stubborn and growing stronger.

The government has said official advertisements should be denied to outlets that indulge in ""unethical reporting"", news published out of ""bad intent"" and ""fake news"".

The Directorate of Advertising & Visual Publicity will stop release of advertisements to such publications. Until now the print media policy already stated a newspaper could be suspended from empanelment if it was found to have deliberately submitted false information regarding circulation.

This is not symbolic. Government ads are a major source of revenue for media.

The devil, as always, lies in the details. What is fake news? And who defines it? Who defines bad intent? Clearly one person's fake news is another person's truth or at least their agenda.

Fake news in India is like air pollution in Delhi – toxic, stubborn and growing stronger.

Take a few recent examples:

During the riots in Basirhat, an image of a burning vehicle was sent out as part of a call to #SaveBengal. It was shared by Nupur Sharma, BJP spokesperson from Delhi and used on a flyer for protests. The image, it turned out, was from the 2002 Gujarat riots under Narendra Modi's watch.

BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya has been caught more than once peddling fake news, tweets he has refused to take down even after they have been proved to be false. Once he circulated a mischievously edited video clip of NDTV anchor Ravish Kumar. Another time during the Ram Rahim trial he posted a picture of Rahul Gandhi meeting Sant Niranjan Dass of Dera Sach Khand Ballan but captioned it as ""Rahul Gandhi visited Dera Sach Sauda as recently as Jan 2017 to seek support.""

BJP leader Priti Gandhi posted Julian Assange's fake endorsement of Narendra Modi for Prime Minister which Wikileaks had to deny.

These could be honest mistakes. Who among us has not fallen for fake news, especially when it fits our ideological bias? But sometimes it's far more deliberate and it comes from within the government itself, not some mischief monger on social media.

The state-run Press Information Bureau infamously photoshopped a picture of Narendra Modi looking at flood-ravaged Chennai with divyadrishti clarity through his chopper window. And of course, that iconic ""rare"" picture of Modi sweeping the floor at a 1988 RSS rally turned out to be a well-morphed fake photo.

So when it comes to curing the epidemic of fake news, physician heal thyself.

Does this mean the BJP is the sole offender? Of course, not. But as Rohan Venkataramakrishnan points out in Scroll, the BJP was an ""early pioneer when it came to using the internet for organizing and building political awareness"" and it also ""has been at the forefront of the fake news phenomenon, with top party leaders and ministers occasionally revealing the kinds of dishonest messages that are much more rampant among the base.""

Even more worryingly, in a country where the phrase ""anti-national""can be used casually as a bludgeon to silence any dissent that is too bothersome, these new DAVP guidelines could just be another weapon to bring media to heel. The Centre has already told the Jammu and Kashmir government to stop advertising in local newspapers that allegedly publish ""anti-national""articles ""glamorizing terrorists and anti-national elements"". Shujaat Bukhari, editor of Rising Kashmir told HT that three major newspapers there, including his own, are banned from getting central government ads for eight years because they cover ""anti-national"" issues, for example, the funerals of militants. ""Now they want us to bleed more by telling the state government to stop state advertisements as well,"" he said.

So when it comes to curing the epidemic of fake news, physician heal thyself.

Government ads have long been part of a strategy to make sure that media does not get too uppity. As other ad revenues shrink government ads gain even more clout.

In 2012, Dhirendra K. Jha dubbed Nitish Kumar Bihar's editor-in-chief because he used the government's ad budget to control and bend the media to his will. The editor of Bihartimes.com said though it has been ""No. 1"" since inception in 1999, its application for empanelment with the Public Relations Department was kept pending without any ""concrete reason"" while a site based in Bhopal with tenuous connections to Bihar got government ads. He said he believes it's because his site carries reports related to corruption in the state. An Urdu paper Pindar ran afoul of the government because of a piece by its chief editor that apparently upset the government. The editor, Raihan Ghani, said he was demoted to managing editor and eventually resigned. Curiously the year after Ghani was gagged, the paper's government ad revenues ballooned from 1 lakh to 24 and the year after to 40 lakh.

When the ABP group in Bengal was perceived at loggerheads with the Trinamool government, Mamata Banerjee had banned their newspapers from state libraries. Global campaign group Avaaz said that five West Bengal outdoor advertising agencies and one newspaper group refused to run ads urging Mamata Banerjee to ""stop attacking protesters and start attacking the problem"" after the gangrape of a young woman in Kamduni. Jayalalithaa's Tamil Nadu was boomtown for lawsuits against media perceived as being overly critical of the government. In five years it filed 213 defamation cases against political opponents, 55 of them against media houses for ""derogatory "" statements whether it was reporting on the CM's vacations or water scarcity in Tamil Nadu. Its predecessor DMK was a poor second with 40 cases between 2006 and 2011.

The government's idea to crack down on fake news sounds like good news. Who could argue with punishing the purveyors of fake news? But the fear is it will have little to do with promoting free and fair journalism and far more to do with the carrot-and-stick policy that makes media toe the line.

Από το πρωί, οι Έλληνες συζητούν γι' αυτή την ονειρική συνάντηση μέσω των social media, δηλώνοντας συγκλονισμένοι από το ελληνικό «γλέντι» στις ΗΠΑ.

Μπορεί να έβαλε 40 πόντους και να κόντραρε τον Λεμπρόν, όμως, για τον All-Star Γιάννη τα πάντα ήταν μετά το παιχνίδι που τον περίμεναν εκατοντάδες Έλληνες ομογενείς για να τον αποθεώσουν!

Ο Αντετοκούνμπο εξερχόμενος από τη φυσούνα δεν μπορούσε να το πιστέψει ότι όλοι αυτοί που τον περίμεναν ήταν Έλληνες! Αναρωτιόταν: «Αποκλείεται να είστε όλοι Έλληνες».

Τους ρώτησε δυνατά αν είναι όλοι Έλληνες, και ένας ιερωμένος απάντησε: «Ας κάνουμε ένα τεστ...»

Τότε, κάτι υπέροχο γεννήθηκε! Χιλιάδες χιλιόμετρα μακριά από την Ελλάδα, εκατοντάδες ομογενείς άρχισαν να τραγουδούν τον Εθνικό μας Ύμνο, η πλήρης ανατριχίλα μέσα στο γήπεδο, η πλήρης ανατριχίλα για όσους θα δουν όλο το βίντεο παρακάτω.

Η αποθέωση για τον Γιάννη συνεχίστηκε ο οποίος έμεινε με τους Έλληνες φαν, συνομίλησε μαζί τους, φωτογραφήθηκε και πέρασε όμορφες στιγμές. Μάλιστα, μία γυναίκα στο βίντεο διάρκεια σχεδόν επτά λεπτών του λέει πως κάθε χρόνο κάνει το συγκεκριμένο ταξίδι από την πόλη που ζει στο Κλίβλαντ μαζί με τα παιδιά της για να τον δουν να αγωνίζεται...

Από την πλευρά του ο Γιάννης, συγκλονισμένος επίσης, δεν χάλασε χατήρι σε κανέναν, μέχρι και λίγο πριν φύγει δεχόταν ο κόσμος να του πετάει μπάλες από μακρινή απόσταση για να τις υπογράψει. Και με αφιερώσεις όπως η τελευταία σε ...έναν Ντίνο!

Μάλιστα, ο Έλληνας σούπερ-σταρ δεν έχασε την ευκαιρία να μοιραστεί αυτή τη σπάνια στιγμή με τον κόσμο στα social media, βγάζοντας βίντεο στο οποίο Αντετοκούνμπο και Έλληνες φώναξα με μια φωνή: «Ζήτω η Ελλάς...»

Πέρα από τον Εθνικό Ύμνο και το γενικό κλίμα φόρτισης, δεν έλειψαν και οι σκηνές αλά ελληνικά, όπως αυτή που ακολουθεί παρακάτω με τον πιτσιρικά που παίρνει τη μπάλα, υπογεγραμμένη από τον Αντετοκούνμπο και την φτύνει για να μην την βασκάνει.

Carl Sargeant quit his post as Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Children in Cardiff last week after what he called “shocking and distressing” allegations were made against him.

His body was found at his home in Connah’s Quay, north Wales, at 11.30am on Tuesday. North Wales Police said they were “not treating his death as suspicious”. It is understood that Sargeant took his own life.

All Welsh Assembly business was suspended as a mark of respect.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his death was “terrible and deeply shocking news” and Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said his passing would be “a great loss” to the party and the country.

Sargeant was suspended from the party last week and had the whip withdrawn in the National Assembly for Wales while an investigation took place into the allegations against him.

Labour’s national party HQ suspended him on Friday following unspecified allegations against him.

His family said in a statement on Tuesday: “Carl was a much loved husband, father and friend. He wasn’t simply a part of our family. He was the glue that bound us together. He was the heart of our family. We loved him so very much.

La razón es sencilla. Resulta que nuestro cerebro y cuerpo están conspirando constantemente para hacernos creer que es la hora de comer, cuando en realidad no lo es. Estas son las nueve razones por las que sufres el engaño del hambre atroz:

Anoche no dormiste lo suficiente

¿Te ruge el estómago los días en que la alarma suena muy temprano? Eso es porque tu cuerpo no ha descansado lo suficiente y le faltan horas de sueño. La falta de sueño se ha relacionado con mayores niveles de la conocida como hormona Ghrelin, que es la encargada de desencadenar la sensación de tener hambre.

Para empeorar las cosas debes saber que cuando no se ha descansado lo suficiente al cuerpo se le antojan carbohidratos, alimentos cargados de calorías que sirven de combustible mientras tu mente busca fuentes alternativas para recargar energía. Los investigadores creen que esto podría ser una pista de por qué la gente con falta de sueño corre un mayor riesgo de obesidad.

Ayer comiste demasiado

La ciencia no tiene una base sólida para explicar este fenómeno, pero muchas veces cuando te acuestas con la sensación de tener el estómago lleno, te levantas con más hambre que nunca. A diferencia de lo que cree la mayoría, no es que el tamaño de tu estómago esté aumentando, sino la comida que tomaste. Si ingeriste alimentos con alto contenido en almidón podrían haber modificado los niveles de azúcar en la sangre, y por eso sientes que todavía no estás lleno, según explica la autora de Healthy Living's, Meredith Melnick.

Estás en el periodo premenstrual

No hay pruebas objetivas que den credibilidad a esta teoría, pero muchas mujeres saben que están en el periodo premenstrual porque tienen más apetito que de costumbre. Durante la fase premenstrual, aumenta la segregación de progesterona. Este incremento genera un mayor apetito y una sensación de incomodidad con el cuerpo. Según la publicación Psychology Today, el resto de mamíferos siguen un patrón similar de sobrealimentación durante la premenstruación.

Podrías haber desayunado mejor

El desayuno es la comida más importante del día y también la más fácil de saltarse, pero un mal desayuno puede arruinarte un día entero. Un estudio publicado este año señala que uno de los componentes más importantes para un desayuno completo y equilibrado es la proteína. Las personas que toman desayunos altos en proteínas tienen menos antojos de ingerir a lo largo del día comidas grasas y alimentos azucarados. Una pieza de fruta es la opción más fácil y rápida para ingerir algo sano tras cerrar la puerta de casa y salir con las prisas habituales hacia el trabajo. Pero una pieza de fruta no es suficiente, ya que necesitas al menos 300 o 400 calorías para mantenerte satisfecho hasta el almuerzo, según la dietista Keri Gans.

Tomas medicamentos

Hay muchos tipos de medicamentos que estimulan el apetito, desde los antihistamínicos para las alergias hasta las pastillas para la artritis. En los últimos 20 años, los medicamentos que provocan este efecto se han multiplicado por tres, según el doctor George Blackburn, director asociado del departamento de nutrición de Harvard Medical School. En muchos casos, una vez culminada la toma de medicinas, el apetito vuelve a su estado habitual. Pero para aquellas personas que deben someterse a tratamientos de larga duración o incluso crónicos, los expertos recomiendan consultar con los médicos para encontrar el medicamento más apropiado, ya que se puede prescribir uno similar que genere menos efectos de este tipo.

Tomas bebidas bajas en azúcar

Al tomar una bebida dulce baja en calorías, el cerebro recibe el mensaje de que las calorías están en camino. Sin embargo, las calorías no llegan. El gusto dulce por sí solo puede provocar que el cerebro mande señales que conducen a sentir apetito para compensar esa pérdida. Todavía se requieren más investigaciones para entender este fenómeno. Mientras tanto, podría ser buena idea cortar o al menos reducir el consumo de bebidas edulcoradas artificialmente.

Estás sediento

Un poco de deshidratación puede provocar sensación de fatiga y, al igual que sucede con la falta de sueño, el cuerpo te pide que ingieras calorías a modo de combustible. En ese proceso, crees que tienes hambre cuando en realidad lo que tienes es sed. Algunos expertos recomiendan a las personas que quieren perder peso tomar un vaso de agua antes de las comidas y esperar unos minutos hasta la ingesta de alimentos. Para distinguir entre el hambre real y la sed, la revista Men's Health sugiere pensar en un menú abundante: si te apetece es que tienes hambre, si no es hora de que tomes un poco de H2O en su lugar.

Estás aburrido

Muchas de nuestras actividades diarias están impulsadas por la dopamina, la hormona de la motivación, la recompensa y el estímulo. A nivel biológico, segregamos dopamina al comer, lo que es maravilloso. Por esa misma razón, cuando estamos aburridos el cerebro busca la manera fácil de generar dopamina y comer algo es su solución. Hay otras alternativas: hazte con un buen libro, escucha una buena canción, medita o haz ejercicio.

Estás estresado

Hay una base biológica en el hecho de comer de manera impulsiva. Desde la perspectiva evolutiva, nuestra respuesta natural ante una situación de estrés es evitar convertirnos 'en la cena' del adversario. Unos músculos fuertes proporcionan la habilidad de correr para huir de un león, un tigre o un oso. Pero después de la persecución el cuerpo está agotado y necesita energía. Por eso el propio estrés activa partes del cerebro que aumentan el apetito, especialmente de alimentos grasos o azucarados. Puesto que hoy en día el estrés es algo muy habitual y las bestias salvajes ya no forman parte de nuestra vida, comerse un donuts para aliviar el estrés no es la mejor opción.",9 razones por las que tu mente te hace creer que tienes hambre,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.mx/2017/11/08/9-razones-por-las-que-tu-mente-te-hace-creer-que-tienes-hambre_a_23269752/

Kevin Spacey is a rapist.
Both are named Kevin.
Seems like a smart business decision to me.”“If you’ve ever seen Paul Blart mall cop, then you know that actors of Kevin James’ caliber only come around once in a life time.”","Now that Netflix has officially cut ties with Kevin Spacey in the wake of the growing number of sexual abuse allegations against him, the streaming giant is reportedly considering other options for the upcoming season of “House Of Cards.”

Although it’s likely Spacey’s Frank Underwood character will be killed off early in the show’s final season ― something that happened in the British version ― some fans of the show are suggesting producers simply replace Spacey with another actor also named Kevin.

A Change.org petition posted four days ago is asking that “Kevin Can Wait” star Kevin James take over the Underwood role originated by Spacey.

The petition, started by a man in the Netherlands named Robbie Pyma, makes the case for why the former “King of Queens” star is a natural choice to play a ruthless character who works his way to the office of president of the United States.

Pyma states his reasoning in a short, but eloquent statement to Netflix founder Reed Hastings:

“Losing a great show is hard, no matter the circumstances. However with hardship come[s] the opportunity for a great show to become one of the greatest television shows of all time. I think Kevin James can elevate ‘House of Cards’ to a globally adored franchise like ‘Game of Thrones’ and make the entire world focus on one of the most important Netf[l]ix Original series there is.”

Though James tends to stick to comedic roles, he has played politicians before, most notably the POTUS in the 2015 Adam Sandler comedy “Pixels.”

So far, Pyma’s offbeat casting suggestion is winning lots of support. As of Monday afternoon, nearly 18,000 people signed the petition, making it more likely to reach its goal of 25,000.

Some of the sample comments include the following:

“Kevin James is a national treasure. Kevin Spacey is a rapist. Both are named Kevin. Seems like a smart business decision to me.”

Jessica Chastain a justifié le fait d'avoir joué dans ""X-Men"" en affirmant que Bryan Singer n'était pas présent sur le tournage et qu'elle ne savait pas qu'il en était co-producteur jusqu'à récemment.

The forced displacement of ethnic Rohingya people from the Rakhine state of Myanmar resulted in a massive refugee crisis in South Asia. The magnitude of this latest Rohingya refugee crisis may be comparable to two other acute refugee crises this subcontinent saw in the past.

First was the massive human relocation following the creation of India and Pakistan in 1947, and the next was the refugee exodus to India during the 1971 Bangladesh war. The exodus of Afghans into Pakistan is another massive but a more steady, long-standing process.

Among these, India was both a victim and the host during the first one and a gracious host during the second one. During the first refugee crisis, India was a newborn state, during the second one it was a young 'third world' developing democracy. Fifty years elapsed since the second refugee crisis, when the major Rohingya refugee crisis developed. And last 50 years have changed India.

India is the aspiring regional superpower now.

India is the aspiring regional superpower now. To the Western developed states, India is the face and gateway to South Asia. It seems the world elites and the Western democracies have outsourced the job stabilising the region to India. In this changed scenario, it's essential to assess and evaluate India's performance in the Rohingya refugee crisis.

While India's expected role was to play a neutral arbitrator and a stabilising force to contain the crisis, it clearly failed to do so. Although under pressure from the friendly government of Bangladesh, India has later tried to take a less one-sided stand, its continued position has been to take the Myanmar side in this conflict and undermine the ethnic cleansing and the massive humanitarian crisis that was fermenting in the Rakhine state of Myanmar.

It seems that India is competing with China to become Myanmar's favourite strategic partner.

By failing to take the anticipated role of a neutral mediator in this crisis, India failed itself, its people as well as many others who want to see India play the role of a 'grown-up' in this part of the world. India, in sharp contrast to its arch-rival Pakistan, rightfully projects itself as an exceedingly diverse society and tolerant democracy with basic human rights, religious freedom and freedom of speech protected by the Constitution. But, in taking the wrong side of the genocidal anti-democratic forces in Myanmar, India betrayed its own creed and fundamental constitutional philosophy.

India failed its values

India definitely sees Myanmar as a neighbour of high economic and strategic potential. It seems that India is competing with China to become Myanmar's favourite strategic partner. And this narrow economic interest may have forced India to shun its broader 'regional superpower' aspiration, at least in the case of Bangladesh and Myanmar. India has made a conscious decision to abandon its closer neighbour Bangladesh with a friendly government to court a distant neighbour Myanmar, which is more likely to pick China as its economic and strategic partner.

If Myanmar can get its way removing all Muslim Rohingya from Myanmar, people of Indian subcontinental origin belonging to other religion will be the next targets.

The present government of Bangladesh took an immense political risk and spent almost all its remaining political capital in giving in to every single demand India had. Bangladesh paid heed to India's security concerns and did all it could to ensure India's security. Now when Bangladesh is under a serious security threat caused by this influx of refugees, it naturally expected India to stand beside her. But now, to pursue its own narrow interests, the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi threw the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina under the bus.

Another problem with India's pro-Myanmar stand is that the populations those are being persecuted in Myanmar are people of subcontinental ethnic heritage. Basically, the Rohingyas are people of mostly Bangladeshi origin who have lived in the Arakan region of Myanmar for centuries. The main reason they are being persecuted, ethnically cleansed and killed is the fact that they don't look like their neighbours of 'Bamar' ethnicity, the main ethnic group that makes up Myanmar's population. They look like they are from the Indian subcontinent, and they have very distinct east Indian culture. The common slur the non-Rohingya Rakhines use to denote the Rohingya is the term 'Kala (black)', alluding to the darker skin colour of the Rohingyas.

Among the refugee camps in Bangladesh, there are Rohingya of Hindu denomination along with overwhelming majority Muslims. And there is a reason that reports of Hindu-Rohingya persecution are being staged and widely publicised by Myanmar authorities, for now, Myanmar Junta wants to project the issue as a Buddhist-Muslim communal issue. But if Myanmar can get its way, removing all Muslim Rohingya from Myanmar, people of Indian subcontinental origin belonging to other religions will be the next targets.

There is a colossal failure in understanding the fact that Rohingya crisis is a tragedy of unfathomable proportion.

Most of the Rohingyas are from the Muslim minority in the Rakhine state of Myanmar. One reason the Rohingyas are so helpless is the fact that they are Muslims.

A group of Muslims, mainly under the banner of terrorist organisations like Al-Qaeda and ISIS, have done despicable things over the last two decades. Their brutality on innocent people all over the world and the gruesome way they publicised these acts made it clear that they wanted to earn global hatred and fear. Beheading innocent captives on camera, photos of them burning people alive, photos of suicide/truck bombs got them what they wanted. The world hates them. The problem is they pulled the whole religion down too. Over 1 billion Muslims are now seen by the rest of the world, reasonably so, with suspicion, unease, and sometimes fear.

Hate always follows fear

India's PM and current policymakers are probably blinded by the fact that the Rohingya victims are Muslims, i.e. 'terrorists'. The Indian foreign policy establishment and PM Modi probably did not see the humanitarian side of the brutal ethnic cleansing, and the genocide-proportion persecution — all they are seeing is an influx of 'potential terrorists'. There is a colossal failure in understanding the fact that the Rohingya crisis is a tragedy of unfathomable proportion. Failing to contain the events leading to this tragedy that has fallen on a marginal Muslim population, India risks creating a goldmine for future terrorist recruits in its backyard.

If political advisors of PM Modi hope that a successful expulsion of Bengali-speaking Rohingyas from Myanmar will be a prelude to do similar thing from the Indian states neighbouring Bangladesh, their political acumen must be short-sighted. Neither India nor Myanmar would benefit from a chaotic festering refugee crisis in a country located between them.

For PM Modi, it is a missed opportunity to claim his stature as the first 21st-century statesman of India. And for India, the continued plight of the Rohingyas is a testament against the claim that India is the regional superpower and stabilising factor in South Asia. While India approvingly watches over the unabated ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, it fails people of its own ethnic heritage too.

Frank Pomeroy and Bishops United Against Gun Violence.","House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is defending his call for prayers after a gunman killed 26 people in a Texas church on Sunday.

Ryan and other politicians have been criticized for offering thoughts and prayers instead of legislative action to reduce gun violence. But on Monday night, Ryan told Fox News host Laura Ingraham:

""It's disappointing, it's sad, and this is what you'll get from the far secular left. People who do not have faith don't understand faith, I guess I'd have to say. And it is the right thing to do is to pray in moments like this, because you know what? Prayer works. And I know you believe that, and I believe that and when you hear the secular left doing this thing, it's no wonder you have so much polarization and disunity in this country when people think like that.""

Sending ""thoughts and prayers"" on social media has become a way for both religious and secular people to grieve after national tragedies.

For religious people in particular, prayer is an important form of worship and a way to ask God for guidance and intervention.

Especially after great personal sorrow, faith helps people to cling to hope. The Rev. Frank Pomeroy, pastor of First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, lost his 14-year-old daughter and at least 25 other church members in Sunday's mass shooting. He told reporters on Monday that he has decided to ""lean into the Lord.""

""I don't understand, but I know my God does,"" Pomeroy said.

But it is one thing for Pomeroy to lean into his faith after the shooting at his church, and something completely different for Ryan to offer prayers without action ― especially after reportedly receiving more than $170,000 in contributions from gun rights groups in 2016.

In a statement, Bishops United Against Gun Violence, a group representing more than 70 Episcopal bishops, said that Christians are called to pray after the tragic shooting in Texas, but that prayer should also be accompanied by deep introspection about ""whether we are complicit in the evils we deplore.""

""In the wake of the heartbreaking shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, we find ourselves both calling people to prayer, and wishing that the word did not come so readily to the lips of elected leaders who are quick to speak, but take no action on behalf of public safety,"" the bishops said. ""Each of us has a role to play in our repentance. Elected representatives bear the responsibility of passing legislation that protects our citizenry. If our representatives are not up to this responsibility, we must replace them. In the meantime, however, we ask that in honor of our many murdered dead, elected leaders who behave as though successive episode of mass slaughter are simply the price our nation pays for freedom stop the reflexive and corrosive repetition of the phrase 'thoughts and prayers.'""

""One does not offer prayers in lieu of demonstrating political courage, but rather in preparation.""

Die Polizei in Darmstadt hat einen Betrunkenen in Gewahrsam genommen

Bei der Durchsuchung des 19-Jährigen stießen die Beamten auf eine Ausbeulung der Hose

Darin befand sich eine Schlange

Wer etwas von einer Beule in der Hose eines Mannes hört, glaubt schnell zu wissen, um was es da geht. Der Fall aus Darmstadt zeigt: Spricht ein Mann von einer Schlange in der Hose, muss das keine jugendfreie Umschreibung sein.

Tatsächlich war die Polizei aus einem anderen Grund am Dienstagabend in die Heidelberger Straße in Darmstadt gekommen. Anrainer hatten sie alarmiert: Zwei Männern stritten sich lautstark auf der Straße.

Die Beamten konnten den Zoff dann aber schlichten. Als es um die Aufnahme des Sachverhalts ging, verlor wohl einer der Streithähne die Geduld. Laut der Polizist wurde er zusehends aggressiver, so dass der angetrunkene Mann in Gewahrsam genommen werden musste.

19-Jähriger: ""Ich habe ein Schlange in der Hose""

Bevor die Polizisten ihn mit auf das Revier nehmen konnten, durchsuchten sie den Mann. Dabei fiel ihnen eine deutliche Ausbeulung der Hose des Betroffenen auf.

Woher die käme? Der Mann antwortete: Er trage eine Schlage in seiner Hose mit sich. Und das war die Wahrheit. Der 19-Jährige zog tatsächlich eine rund 35 Zentimeter lange (Baby-)Königspython aus der Hose.

War das ein Verstoß gegen das Tierschutzgesetz?

Das Tier musste die Reise des Mannes in die Ausnüchterungszelle nicht mitmachen. Stattdessen legten die Beamten das Tier in eine Transportbox.

Nach dem Eigentümer der Schlange wird aktuell gesucht, eventuell gehört das Tier einem Familienmitglied des 19-Jährigen. Weiterhin wird überprüft, ob durch den nicht artgerechten Transport des Tieres durch den betrunkenen Mann gegen das Tierschutzgesetz verstoßen wurde.

Από το πρωί, οι Έλληνες συζητούν γι' αυτή την ονειρική συνάντηση μέσω των social media, δηλώνοντας συγκλονισμένοι από το ελληνικό «γλέντι» στις ΗΠΑ.

Τους ρώτησε δυνατά αν είναι όλοι Έλληνες, και ένας ιερωμένος απάντησε: «Ας κάνουμε ένα τεστ...»

Τότε, κάτι υπέροχο γεννήθηκε! Χιλιάδες χιλιόμετρα μακριά από την Ελλάδα, εκατοντάδες ομογενείς άρχισαν να τραγουδούν τον Εθνικό μας Ύμνο, η πλήρης ανατριχίλα μέσα στο γήπεδο, η πλήρης ανατριχίλα για όσους θα δουν όλο το βίντεο παρακάτω.

Η αποθέωση για τον Γιάννη συνεχίστηκε ο οποίος έμεινε με τους Έλληνες φαν, συνομίλησε μαζί τους, φωτογραφήθηκε και πέρασε όμορφες στιγμές. Μάλιστα, μία γυναίκα στο βίντεο διάρκεια σχεδόν επτά λεπτών του λέει πως κάθε χρόνο κάνει το συγκεκριμένο ταξίδι από την πόλη που ζει στο Κλίβλαντ μαζί με τα παιδιά της για να τον δουν να αγωνίζεται...

Από την πλευρά του ο Γιάννης, συγκλονισμένος επίσης, δεν χάλασε χατήρι σε κανέναν, μέχρι και λίγο πριν φύγει δεχόταν ο κόσμος να του πετάει μπάλες από μακρινή απόσταση για να τις υπογράψει. Και με αφιερώσεις όπως η τελευταία σε ...έναν Ντίνο!

Μάλιστα, ο Έλληνας σούπερ-σταρ δεν έχασε την ευκαιρία να μοιραστεί αυτή τη σπάνια στιγμή με τον κόσμο στα social media, βγάζοντας βίντεο στο οποίο Αντετοκούνμπο και Έλληνες φώναξα με μια φωνή: «Ζήτω η Ελλάς...»

Πέρα από τον Εθνικό Ύμνο και το γενικό κλίμα φόρτισης, δεν έλειψαν και οι σκηνές αλά ελληνικά, όπως αυτή που ακολουθεί παρακάτω με τον πιτσιρικά που παίρνει τη μπάλα, υπογεγραμμένη από τον Αντετοκούνμπο και την φτύνει για να μην την βασκάνει.

J'avais déjà couru 3 fois le marathon de Paris mais tous les marathoniens rêvent de courir celui de la Grosse Pomme. Il est mythique. C'est le graal!

26 miles en courant, soit 42 km 195, à partir de Staten Island; puis Brooklyn, le Queens, le Bronx et enfin Manhattan. Ça commence avec le fameux pont, le Verrezano Bridge; il est à l'image de la grandeur américaine, immense. Au total, cinq gigantesques ponts à franchir qui te cassent les jambes et qui n'en finissent plus. Pour terminer dans Central Park avec son parcours vallonné! Mais en soi, le marathon commence le jour où tu poses le pied sur le sol américain! Il y a des affiches placardées partout dans les rues, des vidéos sur le marathon dans tous les commerces. La ville vit et vibre pour cet événement! On croise beaucoup de Runners venus du monde entier dans tout Manhattan! Pour moi, ce fut le retrait du dossard la veille qui fut un moment magique. Ce moment dont j'avais tant rêvé!!! J'y étais pour de vrai! Une organisation parfaite. Tout est fait pour t'en mettre plein les yeux, que ça soit du petit goodies (petit gadget) à l'effigie de la course à acheter, jusqu'à la peluche, en passant par tous les styles de vêtements techniques ou non! Dingue!

Pour moi, le retrait du dossard la veille fut un moment magique.

Dimanche 5 novembre: ça y est, c'est le Jour J! Réveil à 5h, transport en bus depuis l'hôtel jusqu'au lieu du départ, je suis déjà concentré sur ma course tout en canalisant mon excitation.

Il y a un monde fou, plus de 50.000 coureurs. Je vous laisse imaginer la sécurité: US marines, police, hélicos, camions bennes et camions poubelles anti-voiture bélier barrant toutes les rues donnant sur le parcours, portiques à métaux filtrant les spectateurs et les coureurs avec fouilles individuelles par les policiers. Évidemment, j'avais encore à l'esprit l'attentat qui avait eu lieu le 31 octobre au sud de Manhattan alors que j'étais à quelques blocs de là quand ça s'est passé et qui avait fait 8 morts et de nombreux blessés; et celui aussi de Boston plusieurs années auparavant durant le marathon. Mais la sécurité était telle qu'on se sentait réellement sécurisés. Notre tour-opérator nous a confié que la municipalité de New York avait envisagé un temps d'annuler le marathon, mais nous n'avions pas été informés de cela directement. Je pense que tout le monde avait malgré tout en tête un gros risque d'attentat.

Une organisation parfaite. Tout est fait pour t'en mettre plein les yeux. La ville vit et vibre pour cet événement!

9h. C'est le départ. Mais avant, l'hymne national américain! Instant solennel et émouvant je l'avoue, même si je ne suis pas américain. Tout événement sportif commence ainsi en Amérique. Il faut reconnaître que ça prend vraiment aux tripes juste avant de s'élancer.

Enfin le coup de canon est tiré pour donner le top départ, avec un survol d'hélico au-dessus de nous!

Je vous laisse imaginer la sécurité: US marines, police, hélicos, camions bennes et camions poubelles anti-voiture bélier.

Les fous du bitumes sont lancés. La musique ""New York, New York"" chantée par Frank Sinatra ouvre la danse de ces dizaines de milliers de jambes qui se mettent en action. Il y aura d'ailleurs des orchestres tout le long du parcours pour en faire une vraie fête. Géniale ambiance! Une foule continue de spectateurs le long du trajet supporte les coureurs par ses encouragements. On crie, on agite des cloches, on hurle, on chante. Il y a même des gens qui nous proposent des bananes coupées, des quartiers d'orange et tas d'autres choses à manger. Je me suis même demandé s'il n'y avait pas des cheesecakes! Bref, tout le monde est avec nous et nous soutient avec un enthousiasme délirant! Ça nous fait supporter les moments tellement difficiles.

Il y aura des orchestres tout le long du parcours pour en faire une vraie fête. Géniale ambiance!

Je portais un T-shirt à l'effigie de mon pays et j'ai donc souvent entendu ""Allez la France!"" avec un accent américain. Ça m'a fait sourire. Mais ça m'a porté. Et les enfants comme les adultes te tendent la main pour que tu la leur tapes sur ton passage!! Ce climat joyeux et fraternel me fait oublier la bruine un peu gênante et me permet de relancer mon allure tout en me donnant des frissons dans les jambes.

Je suis arrivé au bout de 3h30. Je n'avais plus de jus, tant ce marathon-là est difficile en raison de ses lignes droites infinies qui montent; on m'avait prévenu mais la joie et l'émotion d'être finisher m'ont permis d'oublier, encore 24 heures après, mes crampes et mes courbatures; mais j'ai été fier de porter ma médaille autour du cou, comme la tradition le veut à New York, jusqu'au retour en France. On m'a souvent arrêté pour me féliciter et me dire ""YES ,YOU DID IT!""

YES ,YOU DID IT!

Je signe donc, avec encore plus de motivation, pour celui de Londres l'année prochaine même si cela a exigé de ma part beaucoup d'entraînement et de sacrifices pour m'y préparer. Mais voilà, la passion de courir surpasse tout! Cependant, je sais que celui de NYC restera gravé dans ma mémoire comme le plus génial, le plus incroyable, le plus fou!

Canadians have long been proud of their contribution to Hollywood. The list of famous Canadian faces in Tinseltown is as long as it is familiar to those of us living north of the border.

U.K. research firm Verve Search decided to find out exactly which of these Canadians stars are actually the biggest, and they used box-office hauls to do the measuring.

What they found was a white male club, but a funny one. All five of the most profitable Canadian actors are or were known for their comedies.

Watch: ""IT"" becomes highest-grossing September movie of all time.

​

​Vervesearch used data from Box Office Mojo to calculate how much revenue each movie star's films made, on average, for every dollar invested into its budget.

For example, it determined that for every dollar invested in a Michael J. Fox movie, there was $2.62 in revenue at the domestic (U.S. and Canadians) box office.

Fox's biggest movie, not surprisingly, was ""Back to the Future,"" which earned $10.08 for every dollar invested.

That's enough to make Fox the number-five most profitable Canadian actor since 1980.

Prior to an event promoting his book in Footscray, Dastyari was racially heckled by three or four men who filmed the four-minute confrontation.

The camera-footage shows the men, who call themselves 'Patriot Blue' approaching Dastyari at the bar ordering drinks as one of them shouts ""I've got some money from China, mate. Want some money?"", before the abuse rapidly becomes more aggressive.

""You terrorist, you little monkey"" is screamed at him as the men move in close around Dastyari, telling him to ""go back to Iran"".

Dastyari responds to the men's aggressive taunts with apparent calmness, smiling and telling them to ""say hello to the United Patriots Front for me"".

After collecting his drinks, Dastyari turns from the bar to walk back to the table he had been seated at, but is followed by the aggressive men, one of them appearing to poke the senator in the back while demanding why he won't answer their ""questions"".

Once seated, the white nationalists continue to film and jostle around behind Dastyari, before he again tells them, ""mate, you're a bunch of racists, go away"".

""What race is Islam?"" the men respond, before Tim Watts moves into the camera-frame, looks directly into it and asks ""what race is dickhead?""

After airing the video on his show, Paul Murray tweeted out an edited version of the video, condemning the behaviour of the abusive men.

""I don't get along [with] Sam Dastyari. But there is NO EXCUSE for the harassment he copped at a pub today,"" Murray said.

""I don't normally like to post about these people - it gives them oxygen - but tonight I'm making an exception,"" he said in an accompanying comment.

Y a-t-il eu un événement déclencheur où vous vous êtes dit: «Ça y'est, j'arrête là, je remets ma lettre de démission.»?
Je pensais que Clinton allait gagner, que j'allais partir à la retraite et que tout irait pour le mieux.
Et ça m'a conforté dans l'idée qu'il s'agissait d'une administration qui se tournerait vers des conseillers politiques et des idéologues.
Son travail est apparu dans Time, Outside et Wired et figure dans la collection permanente de la bibliothèque du Congrès.","J'ai déjà rencontré des détracteurs de Donald Trump, de nombreux détracteurs, de ceux qui sautent sur chaque théorie du complot et qui refusent de lui accorder le moindre bénéfice du doute. Un an après l'élection du nouveau président, les quatre personnes avec qui j'ai récemment passé la matinée à la Solly's Tavern de Washington (sans alcool, ne vous inquiétez pas) n'étaient pas des détracteurs de Trump. Il s'agissait, en revanche, de déserteurs.

Chacun d'entre eux, à un moment ou à un autre au cours des neuf derniers mois, a quitté son poste au sein de l'administration actuelle, après avoir décidé qu'il pourrait mieux servir son pays à l'extérieur du gouvernement plutôt que de l'intérieur. Ils n'étaient pas non plus ravis de partir. Ils étaient fonctionnaires et souhaitaient le rester et, à l'exception de l'un d'entre eux, avaient travaillé sous des présidents des deux partis. Pendant leurs années passées au service du public, il leur était arrivé d'être en désaccord avec leurs supérieurs, de craindre l'arrivée de nouvelles réglementations et de se méfier des nominations politiques, mais ils étaient restés parce que c'est la nature d'une carrière dans le gouvernement. C'était différent.

Lorsqu'ils se sont retrouvés pour cette conversation il y a deux semaines, l'entente fut instantanée. L'ambiance était conviviale et familière comme celle d'une réunion d'anciens élèves, outre le fait qu'ils étaient encore de parfaits inconnus cinq minutes plus tôt. Ils étaient originaires de différents secteurs de la bureaucratie, leurs âges et leurs formations variaient considérablement, mais ils s'étaient posé les mêmes questions depuis l'élection de Trump. Leurs collègues de travail se sentiraient-ils trahis après leur départ ? Leurs remplaçants auraient-ils des opinions antithétiques aux leurs? Après avoir passé la majeure partie de leur vie dans les services administratifs, se sentaient-ils vraiment prêts à prendre publiquement position ? Une fois arrivés au cœur de l'entretien, qui a été édité et résumé par souci de clarté, ils se sont montrés sincères, drôles et enragés. Ils ne travaillent peut-être plus pour le gouvernement, mais ils se considèrent toujours comme des fonctionnaires.

Très bien. Sharon, vous êtes partie la première. Commençons avec le soir des élections. À quoi pensiez-vous? Que ressentiez-vous?

Sharon McGowan (ancienne directrice adjointe de la branche des droits civiques du département de la Justice des États-Unis): J'ai ressenti cette angoisse qui commençait à s'emparer de moi, de façon très physique. Alors le lendemain de l'élection, ma femme et moi avons décidé de rester à la maison pour se regrouper en famille. En tant que couple homosexuel dans ce pays, nous connaissions exactement les enjeux. Et pendant les premiers jours, j'ai essayé de garder un état d'esprit positif: «Peut-être que Trump ne pensait pas vraiment ce qu'il a dit, peut-être que c'était seulement pour l'audimat.» Et ça a plutôt bien fonctionné! Au moins jusqu'à ce que Jeff Sessions ne soit annoncé comme candidat pour le poste de procureur général. C'est là que j'ai réalisé que mes jours dans le gouvernement étaient comptés.

FERMER

Vous étiez certaine de devoir partir?

McGowan: Non, j'ai vraiment eu des moments de doute. Le jour de ma démission par exemple, Sally Yates (procureure générale à titre intérimaire, ndlr) s'est élevée et a déclaré qu'elle ne défendrait pas le «Muslim ban» et je me suis dit: «Oh non, peut-être que je me suis trompée. Peut-être que je devrais rester à l'intérieur.» Et puis bien sûr, on est tous revenus après la pause publicitaire pour découvrir que Yates avait été virée. Alors j'ai eu l'impression que c'était un signe de l'univers pour me faire comprendre que je n'avais pas abandonné le navire trop tôt.

Walt, vous êtes resté jusqu'au mois de juillet. Parlez-moi du moment où vous avez réalisé que votre monde avait radicalement changé.

Walter Shaub (ancien directeur de l'Office of Government Ethics, le bureau d'éthique gouvernementale): Mon histoire est différente dans la mesure où je me suis réveillé le lendemain matin de l'élection en étant assez optimiste quant au travail qui m'attendait avec l'équipe de transition. On avait passé environ cinq mois à travailler avec eux avant l'élection, et c'était des gens très sérieux qui s'y connaissaient vraiment.

Alors j'ai envoyé un e-mail de félicitations enthousiaste d'un côté et un e-mail de condoléances de l'autre, et j'ai reçu des réponses de chaque équipe nous remerciant pour le travail de l'OGE. Les gens de l'équipe de Trump ont dit qu'ils étaient impatients de continuer à travailler avec nous et qu'ils téléphoneraient dans l'après-midi pour convenir d'un rendez-vous. La transition prend environ 73 jours, et vous disposez de cette période pour mettre en place tout un gouvernement. Vous devez savoir ce que vous faites, et vous devez utiliser chaque seconde judicieusement. C'est une tâche monumentale. Mais cet après-midi-là, tous ceux avec qui nous avions travaillé avaient disparus et puis ce fut le silence radio.

Plus tard, on a lu des bulletins d'informations qui suggéraient que Don McGahn (un habitué de Washington qui exerce désormais le rôle de conseiller juridique de la Maison-Blanche, ndlr) était susceptible d'endosser le rôle de conseiller pour la transition, mais nous n'avons pas pu obtenir de rendez-vous avec lui avant longtemps. Et puis lorsque nous y sommes parvenus, il était incroyablement flagrant que les choses lui passaient complètement au-dessus de la tête. À un moment il m'a demandé si j'étais la personne chargée d'attribuer des habilitations de sécurité ou qui examinait les vérifications des antécédents des candidats par le FBI. Je lui ai dit: «Non, c'est vous.» Et il m'a répondu: «C'est moi?»

Le moment qui m'a le plus marqué, c'est ce week-end où personne n'est parvenu à savoir où Don McGahn se trouvait et puis on a lu dans le journal qu'il avait fait un concert avec son groupe de reprises des années 80 à Philadelphie.

Walter Shaub, ""un homme tellement austère et humble qu'il avait retiré toutes les décorations de son bureau"", selon ""The Atlantic"". Il est désormais le directeur principal du Campaign Legal Center.

Mike, les fonctionnaires de l'Environmental Protection Agency [l'agence américaine de protection de l'environnement] se battent depuis longtemps avec les nominations politiques. Pourquoi selon-vous la situation est bien pire aujourd'hui?

Mike Cox (ancien conseiller chargé du changement climatique à l'EPA): J'ai travaillé avec six gouvernements, en commençant sous Reagan jusqu'au gouvernement actuel, et nous avons eu des différences d'opinions, mais je n'ai jamais eu le sentiment que quelqu'un venait démanteler l'organisation pour la dégrader. Mais nous avons eu cette impression lors de la toute première réunion de l'ensemble du personnel organisée par Scott Pruitt (Le nouveau directeur de l'EPA. Il a poursuivi l'agence en justice à 14 reprises avant d'en prendre la tête, ndlr). C'était clair qu'il nous prenait de haut. L'EPA c'était nous. On était les méchants. On était le problème. Mon dieu, je crois que je parle toujours de l'EPA en disant «nous».

C'est une habitude difficile à perdre.

Cox: Oui, c'est toujours «nous». Alors lorsqu'il a commencé à dire qu'on devait travailler avec les états, je me suis dit: «Ça fait trente ans que je travaille ici et chaque jour nous nous efforçons de travailler avec les états.» Il a dit qu'on devait respecter la loi, comme si ce n'était pas déjà le cas. J'ai eu la forte impression qu'il ne comprenait pas, ou bien qu'il faisait exprès de provoquer le personnel.

Le deuxième fait majeur, c'était les coupes budgétaires: une feuille de route pour réduire de 30% les employés de l'EPA. Et puis l'élimination de programmes qui concernaient le changement climatique. On a été nombreux à se demander: «Comment le directeur de l'EPA peut-il affirmer que le changement climatique ne fait pas partie de notre mission?» On a eu l'impression que le cœur de notre travail était, je n'ose pas utiliser le mot «violé», mais qu'il était discrédité. Et la dernière chose dont je parlerai c'est son choix de faire venir l'ancien chef de cabinet du sénateur James Inhofe pour diriger son organisation (Inhofe est l'homme qui a «réfuté» le réchauffement climatique en apportant une boule de neige au Sénat. «Il fait vraiment, vraiment froid dehors. Vraiment inhabituel pour la saison», avait-il déclaré, ndlr). Ça a vraiment donné le ton. On s'est rendu compte que ça allait très mal.

Y a-t-il eu un événement déclencheur où vous vous êtes dit: «Ça y'est, j'arrête là, je remets ma lettre de démission.»?

Cox: Je vais être honnête avec vous. J'avais prévu de prendre ma retraite en février. Je pensais que Clinton allait gagner, que j'allais partir à la retraite et que tout irait pour le mieux. Et puis Trump a gagné, et alors que je me préparais pour partir à la retraite, les gens autour de moi n'arrêtaient pas de dire: «Mike, tu ne peux pas partir à la retraite. Tu ne peux pas te le permettre, parce que ton poste va être éliminé et tu es un ardent défenseur. On a besoin de toi.»

Finalement, j'ai décidé de prendre ma retraite. Et pour être honnête, je le regrette. J'aurais préféré rester parce que même si je ne pense pas que j'aurais eu un impact important, j'ai quand même l'impression que j'aurais pu utiliser ma voix. Et si j'avais été viré, ça n'aurait pas été grave.

Mike Cox, ancien conseiller chargé du changement climatique à l'Environmental Protection Agency.

Ned, comme Walt, vous avez travaillé pour une institution qui est prétendument au-dessus des considérations politiques. Mais les tensions avec une nouvelle administration ne sont pas nécessairement quelque chose d'inédit pour la CIA. En quoi était-ce différent?

Ned Price (ancien agent de la CIA et porte parole du Conseil de sécurité nationale): Pendant la transition Bush-Obama, je travaillais auprès du Centre de lutte antiterroriste. Je me suis toujours considéré comme quelqu'un de progressiste, particulièrement sur les questions sociales. Mais j'ai aussi ressenti un profond malaise face à certains propos tenus par le candidat Obama pendant sa campagne. Je craignais que les stratégies et les tactiques qui nous avaient permis de prendre un avantage important sur des groupes tels qu'Al-Qaïda soient anéanties, et que l'agence et plus largement la communauté de la sécurité intérieure dans son ensemble ne soient contraintes à se battre avec les mains liées.

Mais le président Obama s'est révélé être quelqu'un qui était prêt à prendre les mesures nécessaires, sans pour autant renier ses convictions que nous étions, je pense, nombreux à approuver: mettre fin aux opérations de détention de l'agence, annoncer clairement que l'agence ne serait pas autorisée à se livrer à quoi que ce soit qui puisse, même de loin, ressembler à de la torture.

Avançons jusqu'à janvier. Comment avez-vous vécu cette expérience?

Price: En réalité, pour moi ça a commencé pendant la campagne lorsque j'ai entendu le candidat Trump s'attaquer à plusieurs reprises à la communauté du renseignement, dans une démarche agressive et concertée. Ce n'était pas seulement le fait qu'il citait WikiLeaks. Ce n'était pas seulement le fait qu'il comparait la communauté du renseignement aux nazis. On aurait presque pu ignorer tout cela et considérer que son discours était vide de sens. Mais il rejetait systématiquement les analyses très fiables de la communauté du renseignement sur des sujets tels que l'ingérence de la Russie dans notre élection, et il appelait ça des «fake news», et considérait qu'il s'agissait d'une supercherie.

Son manque de respect quant à l'importance du rôle de commandant en chef est vraiment apparu au premier plan lors de sa première journée complète en exercice, lorsqu'il s'est rendu au siège de la CIA à Langley. Il s'est tenu devant le Memorial Wall, le mur qui honore les agents de la CIA qui ont perdu la vie dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions, et il a parlé de la taille de la foule lors de son investiture. Il a plaisanté en disant qu'il fallait repartir en Irak pour voler leur pétrole. Le nom de l'un de mes mentors est gravé sur ce mur, ainsi que les noms de plusieurs anciens collègues.

À quel moment avez-vous commencé à réfléchir à votre départ?

Price: La goutte d'eau qui a fait déborder le vase pour moi, c'est la note de service qui nommait Steve Bannon au Conseil de sécurité nationale. Il retirait le directeur de la CIA et le directeur du renseignement national, ainsi que le président du Comité des chefs d'état-major interarmées du Comité des directeurs. Et ça m'a conforté dans l'idée qu'il s'agissait d'une administration qui se tournerait vers des conseillers politiques et des idéologues. J'ai décidé qu'en tant qu'analyste du renseignement, j'aurais eu le choix entre me tourner les pouces toute la journée et écrire des rapports qui prendraient la poussière.

Ned Price est désormais enseignant à l'université George Washington et contributeur pour MSNBC.

Quels sont les points communs de toutes les histoires que nous sommes en train d'entendre ?

McGowan: Je crois que c'est le fait qu'il y avait un effort concerté pour sélectionner les candidats qui méprisaient le plus l'agence qu'ils allaient servir. Cette sorte de mantra déconstructionniste, où vous voulez faire comprendre à quel point vous dévalorisez le travail et le personnel d'une agence particulière.

Cox: Je ne pense pas que cela soit comparable à ce qui s'est passé au Memorial Wall, mais le président est venu à l'EPA en mars, et le jour de sa visite, ils ont transmis une note à l'ensemble du personnel. Ils ont appelé l'événement «Notre grand jour». Et la note disait que le président allait essentiellement éliminer tout le progrès qui avait été accompli dans la lutte contre le changement climatique sous Obama. C'était ça «Notre grand jour»?

McGowan: Pourquoi «notre»? À qui faisaient-ils référence?

Cox: Un autre élément qui semble ressortir dans chacune de nos expériences c'est le fait qu'il s'agit de personnes qui se moquent des autres opinions. À de nombreuses occasions, ils ont demandé des informations sur une question spécifique en indiquant qu'il y aurait une réunion de suivi. Mais ces réunions n'ont jamais eu lieu. À chaque fois que le moment de la prise de décision arrivait, Pruitt et ses collaborateurs les plus proches n'en faisaient qu'à leurs têtes, et ça s'arrêtait là. Et l'EPA est une organisation scientifique! On est censés attacher de l'importance aux faits! Même sous le gouvernement Bush ce n'était pas comme ça.

Price: Le point commun qui me frappe c'est que je crois que personne ici n'a cherché à se retrouver dans cette position. Je veux dire qu'en ce qui me concerne, j'adorais mon travail. J'étais plus que satisfait à l'idée de rester un bureaucrate jusqu'à la fin de mes jours. Et franchement, j'espère revenir dans la fonction publique lorsque tout sera rentré dans l'ordre.

Shaub: Je crois encore une fois que mon expérience est légèrement différente, ou en tout cas ma vision. Je me préoccupe moins des points de vue sur la politique. Ma grande préoccupation concerne davantage ce que j'appelle «le récipient». Je vois les structures de notre forme de gouvernement représentatif comme un récipient, et les politiques sont simplement ce que vous mettez à l'intérieur.

Ce qui m'a le plus affecté, c'est l'attaque sur le récipient. Lorsque vous avez un président qui conserve ses intérêts financiers, même si vous le soutenez, vous ne pouvez pas savoir sur quoi reposent ses décisions. Et ça devient particulièrement grave lorsque vous le voyez encenser Erdogan après qu'il se soit emparé des pleins pouvoirs, ou inviter le meurtrier Duterte à Washington, alors qu'il possède des biens immobiliers en Turquie et aux Philippines.

Mais le point commun que je remarque c'est le refus de se fier aux experts. À l'OGE, nous nous considérions comme des acteurs dans le domaine des solutions. Alors revenons aux intérêts financiers du président. J'ai dit à plusieurs reprises qu'il devait les vendre. Mais même s'il ne voulait pas les vendre, on aurait pu trouver d'autres solutions qui auraient permis de limiter les dégâts, en annonçant par exemple qu'aucun représentant de l'administration ne participerait à un événement organisé dans un établissement possédé par Trump ou affichant son nom. Cela aurait pu empêcher le Koweït et Bahreïn et d'autres pays d'y organiser des événements, parce qu'ils auraient su qu'aucun employé de la Maison-Blanche n'aurait franchi la porte. On aurait aussi pu lui recommander de respecter les précédents en matière de népotisme au lieu d'obtenir du département de la Justice un changement de sa position sur le népotisme vieille d'une décennie.

Alors lorsque la Maison-Blanche me dénigrera en disant que j'essayais de les saboter, la vérité c'est que s'ils avaient suivi mes recommandations, ils en seraient ressortis plus forts.

Walter Shaub, Mike Cox, Edward Price et Sharon McGowan à Washington, le 10 octobre 2017.

Walt, j'ai entendu que vous aviez une liste de vérification mentale qui vous a aidé à prendre une décision quant à votre démission.

Shaub: Oui, c'est une liste de vérification en trois parties que j'ai recommandée à d'autres. La première question à se poser c'est: «Puis-je accomplir la mission efficacement?» Ensuite: «Puis-je accomplir mon travail éthiquement et moralement?» Et enfin: «Puis-je dire la vérité?» Je n'ai certainement jamais eu peur de dire la vérité. J'ai eu l'impression d'accomplir ma mission de manière éthique et morale, mais j'ai atteint un point où je ne pensais plus pouvoir remplir ma mission efficacement. Je n'ai cessé de me poser cette question chaque mois. Et pendant plusieurs mois, je suis resté parce que tout n'était pas perdu.

Par exemple, malgré toutes ces histoires de déplacements en jet privé, (il fait référence à l'allergie manifeste aux vols commerciaux dont souffrent certains membres du gouvernement, ndlr) ce dont vous n'entendez pas parler ce sont les conflits d'intérêts financiers de certains membres, et c'est grâce à l'OGE qui a réussi à accomplir sa mission malgré un manque de soutien de la Maison-Blanche. J'ai en fait discuté personnellement avec un candidat qui était extrêmement riche et extrêmement brillant et je lui ai dit: «Vous avez bâti votre gloire et votre fortune grâce à vos talents d'habile négociateur, mais la pire chose qui pourrait vous arriver maintenant c'est d'employer ce talent et de réussir à me faire reculer.» À la fin, il a accepté de céder la majorité de ses possessions, ce qui représentait pour lui un fardeau considérable. Et je le félicite pour cette démarche.

Certains membres du gouvernement se sont montrés bien plus hostiles. Mais en fin de compte, devoir négocier avec eux faisait partie de notre travail et nous avions trouvé des alliés en la personne de leurs propres avocats privés qui leur expliquaient que nos propositions étaient la bonne chose à faire. Nous avons aussi remporté une victoire en obtenant les dispenses au code d'éthique que la Maison-Blanche distribuait (les dispenses autorisent les employés du gouvernement à contourner certaines exigences d'éthique, et l'administration Trump en distribuait en secret, ndlr). Ils nous ont attaqués très publiquement pendant un mois en nous demandant de ne pas les publier, mais la pression publique a porté ses fruits.

Malgré cela, la plus grosse surprise est arrivée lorsque j'ai vu les dérogations de mes propres yeux. De nombreuses dérogations n'étaient pas signées, n'étaient pas datées ou étaient explicitement ou implicitement rétroactives. Bien sûr, si vous avez besoin d'une dérogation rétroactive, cela signifie que vous avez enfreint une règle. De plus, deux des dérogations avaient été remises à un groupe d'employés qui semblait inclure l'auteur de la dérogation. Il est possible que cette personne se soit attribué elle-même une dérogation.

C'est à ce moment-là que j'ai réalisé que ces gens étaient capables de tout. Et ils avaient aussi commencé à s'adapter à mes prises de parole en public sur ces manquements à l'éthique en coupant simplement les ponts avec l'OGE. Je me suis retrouvé dans une situation où j'aurais dû certifier un certain nombre de rapports de transparence financière de la Maison-Blanche sans savoir ce que les candidats faisaient dans la vie. Alors j'ai eu peur de ne devenir qu'une façade pour dissimuler la corruption.

Quels sont vos rapports avec vos anciens collègues aujourd'hui ?

McGowan: Depuis que je suis partie, j'ai reçu de nombreux e-mails de gens – pas uniquement mes collègues de la division des droits civiques, mais aussi des personnes contre lesquelles je me suis battue – qui disaient: «Je suis tellement heureux que tu fasses ce que tu fais.» Il y avait tellement de gens qui voulaient partir... Mais c'est une décision tellement difficile et personnelle. Certains employés sont la principale source de revenus de la famille. Pour d'autres, il y a cette crainte de ne pas savoir qui prendrait leur place. Certaines personnes disent avoir presque l'impression de se noyer. Pendant combien de temps vais-je réussir à retenir mon souffle et à tenir bon, parce que je veux pouvoir rassembler les morceaux lorsque tout cela sera fini?

Lorsque je leur parle de ma décision, c'est vraiment avec tristesse et une grande délicatesse pour ne pas donner l'impression de m'être sentie supérieure. Je savais simplement que mon travail et ma passion seraient mieux employés en adoptant une attitude de résistance. J'ai aussi conscience d'être très privilégiée. Puisque je sais que des gens qui sont toujours à l'intérieur luttent pour conserver leur intégrité et leur fierté dans leur travail, je crois que c'est vraiment important de les encourager et de leur faire comprendre qu'ils ne trahissent pas ce qui est juste et bon dans le monde.

Price: Je me suis retrouvé dans une position similaire. Lorsque je me préparais à annoncer ma démission, je n'étais pas vraiment préoccupé par la réaction qu'auraient les trolls sur Twitter ou les membres du gouvernement actuel. J'avais surtout peur que mes anciens collègues ne croient que je me pensais supérieur.

Alors ça m'a vraiment réconforté d'apprendre qu'ils me considéraient toujours comme un membre à part entière de l'équipe. Ils me voient toujours comme quelqu'un qui, de bien des façons, continue à défendre leurs intérêts.

McGowan: J'ai cette théorie amusante selon laquelle il suffit de regarder les profils de réseaux sociaux des gens pour savoir s'ils sont en recherche d'emploi. Lorsqu'ils ont un peu plus de culot que d'habitude, je me dis: «Oh, il a sûrement obtenu un second entretien.» En revanche, lorsque les gens sont plus nombreux à me demander de servir de référence, j'ai peur qu'un obstacle ne les pousse par-dessus bord. Généralement, il me faut un certain temps pour identifier cet obstacle.

Shaub: Pour moi, ça a été plus brutal. J'ai travaillé avec ces gens pendant quinze ans, et bien que je sois théoriquement autorisé à leur parler, j'ai peur qu'une photo de moi en train de déjeuner avec eux ne se retrouve dans le journal et que je sois accusé à tort de discuter du fond. Alors je suis resté à l'écart. C'est l'aspect humain: ils me manquent vraiment.

Cox: J'ai une question. Est-ce que des gens vous contactent depuis votre organisation et vous demandent de l'aide pour amplifier une cause ou une autre?

Price: Mes anciens collègues se trouvent dans une position délicate parce qu'ils sont au courant d'informations confidentielles auxquelles je n'ai plus accès. Bien sûr, ils ne m'ont pas divulgué d'informations secrètes mais ils ont abordé des questions plus générales, comme le moral des employés au sein de la communauté du renseignement, ce qui se passe au niveau du personnel du Conseil de la sécurité nationale, ainsi que le chaos qui continue de régner à la Maison-Blanche.

Ce qui me frappe, c'est ce climat de paranoïa. Personne ne me contactera en m'envoyant simplement un SMS ou en me téléphonant. Tout le monde commence une conversation en me demandant si j'utilise Signal, ou si je suis sur WhatsApp. Choisissez votre service chiffré. Ce qui est drôle c'est qu'ils me poseront cette question et le jour suivant je recevrai un message de leur part sur Signal du type: «Salut, comment ça va ? Je voulais juste prendre de tes nouvelles.»

Shaub: Ils discutent juste de choses personnelles?

Price: Exactement. Ils ne révèlent aucune information classée secrète ou confidentielle.

McGowan: Mais on a le sentiment que même le simple fait d'être vu avec quelqu'un qui est parti est effrayant.

Avez-vous au moins eu l'occasion d'échanger des blagues douteuses avant de partir?

McGowan: La semaine qui a suivi l'élection, j'ai écrit un e-mail à un ami de la branche des droits civiques – quelqu'un avec qui je m'étais déjà disputée – et je lui ai demandé s'il rafraîchissait ses connaissances sur le Korematsu (L'arrêt controversé rendu par la Cour suprême qui a autorisé le gouvernement américain à incarcérer des Japonais-américains dans des camps d'internement pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, ndlr). Et il m'a répondu: «Ce n'est pas drôle.» Et j'ai dit: «Je sais que ce n'est pas drôle!»

Walter Shaub, Edward Price, Sharon McGowan et Mike Cox.

Je me demande si tout cela aura un effet dissuasif sur les jeunes aspirant à une carrière dans la fonction publique.

McGowan: J'ai toujours chanté les louanges de la fonction publique en expliquant à quel point c'est puissant, surtout en ce qui me concerne. À chaque fois que quelqu'un parlait du gouvernement comme de l'Homme («The Man», expression désignant le système ou l'autorité en anglais, ndlr), je plaisantais toujours en disant qu'apparemment, l'Homme était une lesbienne d'un mètre soixante originaire du Queens. Alors si je peux être l'Homme, n'importe qui peut l'être.

Mais désormais, c'est bien plus difficile pour moi de convaincre les gens que le service fédéral est l'endroit où ils pourront ressentir le même sentiment d'épanouissement que j'ai éprouvé lorsque j'y étais. Savoir que le pouvoir du gouvernement fédéral est utilisé pour causer tellement de tort – pour déchirer des familles, pour cautionner la discrimination – ça me semble maladroit d'essayer de vendre le service fédéral à un membre de l'une des communautés qui sont victimes des abus. J'attends avec impatience le jour où tout cela appartiendra à l'histoire ancienne.

Shaub: Et bien, j'ai toujours peur de cet effet dissuasif. Je veux saisir cette opportunité pour encourager les jeunes à rejoindre la fonction publique. Et la fonction publique se présente sous de nombreuses formes. Il y a l'administration des états et les autorités locales, les associations à but non lucratif et bien sûr, le gouvernement fédéral, que je recommande toujours fortement. Les jeunes qui arrivent vont se retrouver aux niveaux inférieurs et seront isolés de la majorité des bouleversements. En même temps, ils se retrouvent avec des responsabilités importantes à un très jeune âge. Et ils peuvent faire une différence en essayant d'apporter des services de base à la nation.

La fonction publique est vraiment gratifiante. J'ai encore des prêts étudiants à rembourser alors heureusement que c'est gratifiant.

The show had an iconic cast at the time, and most of the actors are still thriving in local shows. Here are some of the actors who just got more famous since Yizo Yizo...

1. The character of Javas, played by Meshack Mavuso, was memorable for his use of the phrase ""ugrand jo?"" (are you okay?), which later became the signature adlib for The Bomb Productions. He went on to work in Isidingo, and now stars in Mzanzi Magic's Isithembiso.

So this is where the ugrand jo originated from #YizoYizo pic.twitter.com/NphH9Fntun — Rudolph (@Rudolph_Bashin) November 7, 2017

2. Charmaine Mtinta won the Avanti Award for Best Actress in a Drama Series for playing Nomsa. She was Mavuso's love interest, and their first kissing scene was one of the epic moments of the series.

She later took on the role of Pearl, a gold-digging widow, in the SABC1 sitcom Gauteng Maboneng; later she starred in Mzansi Magic telenovela Inkaba. Mtinta has also been in the SABC soapies Generations and The Missing Link.

3. Thulas was played by Fana Mokoena, who has now stepped into the political arena –– who would have guessed it? He's now a parlaimentarian for the Economic Freedom Fighters, and does not shy away from serious commentary.

Mokoena was one of the most successful actors to graduate from Yizo Yizo. We saw him in various soapies, including Generations and The Lab. He also starred in movies like World War Z and delivered a chilling portrayal of genocidal General Augustin Bizimungu in Hotel Rwanda.

It's so weird seeing some of these actors and actresses play school kids 😂 o Fana Mokoena. #YizoYizo #SABCEncore — thando 2/5/16 (@Mello_Muffin) November 7, 2017

4. Ronnie Nyakale's role as Papa Action was his first claim to fame. He later played another gangster, Ding-Dong, on the e.tv soapie Rhythm City, and starred in South African hit movie Jerusalema.

He is now part of the Generations: The Legacy cast, playing gangster-turned-businessman Cosmo.

5. Sophie Ndaba played Louisa Tlali –– one of the laziest on-screen teachers of all time. In reality, Ndaba's hard work has led to her success as an actress and businesswoman. She made a big impact in her long-running role as Queen Moroka in Generations, and recently played the supporting role of nosy-yet-sophisticated Nkadimeng on Isidingo.

International trade in rhino horn has been banned since 1977, and South Africa banned it domestically in 2009.","The outlook is bleak for black rhinos. They have been critically endangered since 1996, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reports that the population has declined by an estimated 97.6% since 1960. The mammals are slaughtered in huge numbers for their horns, which are used in traditional medicine and for decoration, and can be worth more than their weight in gold in illegal international markets. Global demand for the horns fuels both crude poaching networks in southern African countries (the heartland of the black rhino) and larger organised crime networks. Photojournalist Brent Stirton is documenting the cruelty and tragedy of the trade in rhino horn. His image, Memorial to a species (pictured below), emerged as the grand title winner of this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition, out of almost 50,000 competition entries from 92 countries.

The jury awarded Brent's shot the competition's most coveted title because it was the most memorable and striking image of all 16 categories. The judges also felt it had 'sculptural power' and strong use of light, encapsulating the breakdown of a vulnerable species in one single frame. Provoking debate The photograph also highlights the battle to survive facing many species all over the world.

Richard Sabin, the Museum's Principal Curator of Mammals, believes the image is crucial for encouraging dialogue and debate about international conservation issues. He says, 'The Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition isn't just about beautiful images and technical ability - it is also about provoking and stimulating debate. 'This image is difficult to look at, but what it shows is an inescapable part of the human exploitation of the natural world. 'Wildlife Photographer of the Year showcases the world's best nature photography, so it is a perfect platform to use to discuss uncomfortable realities.'

The outlook for black rhinos Black rhinos once ranged across sub-Saharan Africa, but now they only survive in five countries: South Africa, Namibia, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Tanzania. Numbers hit rock bottom in 1995, with just 2,410 black rhinos alive in the wild. The population doubled to 4,880 by the end of 2010, but current levels are still 90% lower than three generations ago, mainly due to international trade in rhino horn. The horns are used in traditional medicine in countries including China and Vietnam, although there is no scientific evidence to suggest rhino horn material has any medicinal qualities. It is made of keratin, the same protein that makes up fingernails and hair. It grows from the skin and is not part of the animal's skeleton. Horns are also used in several countries to make prized ornaments such as jewellery, drinking vessels and the handles of ceremonial weapons. Recent years have seen a substantial rise in the price of horns, driving a further increase in poaching in some areas. Richard says, 'Although I do not qualify to criticise the traditional cultural use of animal parts, it is largely greed, irresponsibility and ignorance fueling the rhino horn trade. Better education systems need to be put in place. 'I despair when I see images of animals that are an important part of a major ecosystem being senselessly destroyed. Losing these animals forever would be a tragedy for humankind.'

What’s being done? Efforts are being made to save the few black rhinos there are left in the wild. Campaigning organisations work to improve knowledge about trafficking routes and reduce the demand for illegal rhino horn, and all five species of rhino are protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). International trade in rhino horn has been banned since 1977, and South Africa banned it domestically in 2009. Museum collections can help conservation efforts by providing historic data about the range, population structure, diet and distribution of different rhino species. The Natural History Museum has what is considered to be the most comprehensive rhino research collection in the world, consisting primarily of skeletal material.

Such specimens, which have temporal and spatial data, can provide vital scientific information that helps protect some of the most vulnerable species on our planet. In 2017, rhino material held in the Museum's collections informed a landmark study on the genetic structure of historic and modern rhino populations. It is hoped that studies like this will inform future conservation efforts. Richard says, 'The research paper was published as a result of our outstanding collections. Skeletal material has genetic data locked away within it, which new technologies are helping us to unlock and use to address a range of important conservation issues. 'As a world-leading scientific research centre, we recognise the impact that human activity is having on the natural world, and our responsibility to lead the debate about how we can ensure a sustainable future for our planet.'",Wildlife Photographer of the Year: The brutal reality of rhino poaching,http://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/the-brutal-reality-of-rhino-poaching.html

Trump, speaking in Seoul as part of his 12-day tour of Asia, delivered a direct and at times heavy-handed message to Kim Jong Un, telling the North Korean leader: “Do not underestimate us. Do not try us.”

However the president echoed calls from a day earlier when, speaking at a news conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, he urged Pyongyang to “come to the table and make a deal.”

Together, we dream of a Korea that is free, a peninsula that is safe, and families that are reunited once again! pic.twitter.com/9tsZRCC83j — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2017

“I also come here to deliver a message directly to the leader: The weapons you are acquiring are not making you safer. They are putting your regime in grave danger,” Trump told the National Assembly. “Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face. North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned. It is a hell that no person deserves.

“We will offer a path to a much better future. It begins with an end to the aggression of your regime, a stop to your development of ballistic missiles and complete verifiable and total denuclearization.”

North Korea has so far refused offers of diplomacy and said it would not put its nuclear weapons ― or its ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States ― on the bargaining table.

The speech stands in contrast to Trump’s past remarks, in which the president has threatened or demeaned Kim on Twitter. In September, he vowed to “totally destroy North Korea” during his first address to the United Nations and called Kim a “rocket man ... on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.”

Other Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, have said diplomacy would remain on the table “until the first bomb drops.”

Trump’s speech Wednesday, which included a sweeping history of the conflict on the Korean peninsula, included some overt hits at the North, including his assertion that the region “is a country ruled by a cult.” He pointed to human rights abuses by Pyongyang against its own people and acts of aggression including the recent death of American student Otto Warmbier, who Trump said was “tortured” to death.

“We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction, we will not be intimidated and we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here, on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure,” Trump said. “To those nations that choose to ignore this threat ― or, worse still, to enable it ― the weight of this crisis is on your conscience.”

A surprise visit by Trump and Moon to the Korean Demilitarized Zone, the heavily-armed buffer region between North and South Korea, was canceled at the last minute on Wednesday due to poor weather. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the planned visit, even though it did not take place, was of a “historic nature” and showed “the strength of the alliance” between the U.S. and South Korea.","Trump Bucks Usual Aggression, Opens The Door To Negotiations With North Korea",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-seoul-national-assembly-north-korea_us_5a029176e4b06ff32c94555b?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009

No obstante, cuando es difícil parar esos hábitos e interfieren en la vida diaria, se pueden convertir en trastornos del comportamiento.
""No tratamos el hábito directamente para que la persona no tenga que aprender una respuesta contraria que lo reemplace"".","¿Te estás toqueteando el pelo o mordiendo las uñas sin darte cuenta mientras lees este artículo? Una investigación de la Universidad de Montreal, en Canadá, sugiere que los comportamientos compulsivos de este tipo dicen mucho más sobre tu personalidad de lo que crees.

Las personas que suelen ser impacientes o que se aburren y se frustran con facilidad tienen más probabilidades de llevar a cabo comportamientos repetitivos en relación con el cuerpo, tales como rascarse, morderse las uñas o arrancarse las pestañas, explicaron los especialistas.

El estudio, publicado en una edición del Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, apunta al perfeccionismo (un rasgo que puede ser más nocivo de lo aparente) como una causa subyacente.

""Creemos que los individuos con estos comportamientos repetitivos pueden ser perfeccionistas, lo que significa que son incapaces de relajarse y de llevar a cabo una tarea a un ritmo normal"", afirmaba en un comunicado de prensa el doctor Kieron O'Connor, profesor de psiquiatría en la universidad y uno de los principales autores del estudio. ""Por tanto, son proclives a la frustración, la impaciencia y la falta de satisfacción cuando no alcanzan sus objetivos. También experimentan un mayor nivel de aburrimiento"".

En el estudio, los investigadores trabajaron con 48 participantes, de los cuales la mitad presentaba habitualmente estos comportamientos. Los otros participantes, que no tenían estos hábitos, actuaban como grupo de control. Se preguntó a los participantes hasta qué punto experimentaban emociones como aburrimiento, enfado, culpa, irritabilidad y ansiedad. Entonces, cada participante era expuesto a situaciones destinadas a provocar alguna sensación en particular, entre otras relajación, estrés, frustración y aburrimiento. En el caso del aburrimiento, por ejemplo, el sujeto simplemente se quedaba solo en una sala durante seis minutos.

Los participantes con un historial de conductas nerviosas centradas en el cuerpo expresaron una mayor necesidad de llevar a cabo esos comportamientos cuando se sentían estresados o frustrados. Pero no sentían esta necesidad cuando estaban relajados.

Si te muerdes las uñas de vez en cuando, no hay por qué preocuparse; probablemente no estés causando mucho daño. De hecho, los investigadores afirman que estos comportamientos cumplen un propósito temporal cuando no somos capaces de canalizar nuestra energía de forma más productiva.

""Los efectos positivos de estos hábitos son la estimulación y una forma (inadaptada) de regular la emoción"", explicaba O'Connor vía correo electrónico a la edición estadounidense de The HuffPost. ""Lo que desencadena el hábito principalmente es la frustración y la impaciencia, de modo que ese gesto sustituye a una acción más constructiva"".

No obstante, cuando es difícil parar esos hábitos e interfieren en la vida diaria, se pueden convertir en trastornos del comportamiento. La actriz Olivia Munn, por ejemplo, ha hablado alguna vez sobre su lucha contra la tricotilomanía, un trastorno de ansiedad que consiste en quitarse las pestañas de forma compulsiva.

""No me muerdo las uñas, pero me arranco las pestañas"", confesó Munn en New York Daily News en 2012. ""No duele, pero es muy molesto"".

Entonces, ¿cómo pueden tratarse estos hábitos? De acuerdo con O'Connor, en la actualidad existen dos posibles vías: un tratamiento de conducta que implique sustituir la manía por una acción contraria, y la otra sería mediante un enfoque diferente que se centre en los factores subyacentes que crean tensión, como el perfeccionismo y los pensamientos negativos.

""Observamos todos los pensamientos y comportamientos presentes en situaciones de alto riesgo para esa conducta y los modificamos a través de una terapia cognitiva para que se asemejen a los pensamientos en situaciones de bajo riesgo"", contó O'Connor. ""No tratamos el hábito directamente para que la persona no tenga que aprender una respuesta contraria que lo reemplace"".",El perfeccionismo detrás del hábito de morderte las uñas,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.mx/2017/11/07/el-perfeccionismo-detras-del-habito-de-morderte-las-unas_a_23268877/

Just like Slytherin’s Locket adversely affected Ron’s mood during “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” Harry may have had a similar effect on the Dursleys.
In an interview with Daniel Radcliffe about his new movie “Jungle,” we brought up the theory and asked if it could explain why the Dursleys were so mean.

Actually, the fact that Harry is somewhat of a Horcrux became the center of a popular theory a couple of years ago, and it seemed to finally explain why the Dursleys were so horrible to the wizard all this time.

According to the theory, the Dursleys were such turd buckets because Harry was a Horcrux and they had to live with him for years. Just like Slytherin’s Locket adversely affected Ron’s mood during “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” Harry may have had a similar effect on the Dursleys. Though Ron and Hermione spent a lot of time with Harry at Hogwarts, the Dursleys were with him constantly over a much longer period of time.

In an interview with Daniel Radcliffe about his new movie “Jungle,” we brought up the theory and asked if it could explain why the Dursleys were so mean.

“Oh OK, so it affects the behavior of people around it,” he said. “That’s interesting, yeah.”

Radcliffe continued, “Yeah, that’s definitely the first time I’ve heard that one. It’s definitely interesting because it sort of posits a world where these people only known to be a certain way. Actually if you remove him from the situation, [they] would have been quite a nice, friendly family.”

OK, maybe “friendly family” is a stretch.

“Having been there for Richard Griffiths’ (Vernon) and Fiona Shaw’s (Petunia) performances,” Radcliffe said, “I feel like it was more they just hated having this kid around.”

“But I think that’s definitely a cool theory,” he added. “Has anyone asked Jo Rowling what she thinks of that one yet? I feel like that one ― that’s definitely a good one.”

Though it’s not in the books, J.K. Rowling has written about the Dursleys’ dislike for Harry on Pottermore, calling them “reactionary, prejudiced, narrow-minded, ignorant and bigoted.” Rowling explained that Petunia’s loathing stemmed from jealousy of her sister Lily’s magical abilities, and that Vernon hated anything out of the ordinary. The couple also had a falling out with Harry’s parents and never made up.

Rowling doesn’t mention whether or not Harry being a Horcrux contributed to the Dursleys’ hatred; however, the theory does make a lot of sense and offers a unique way of looking at the family.

Après l'annonce par Renault d'un système d'évitement automatique d'obstacles dans la matinée, c'est la start-up Navya qui fait parler d'elle, ce mardi 7 novembre.

La société lyonnaise, spécialisée dans les véhicules sans conducteur, vient en effet de dévoiler Cab, un taxi autonome. A peine plus grand qu'un C4 Picasso, le véhicule aux allures futuristes dispose de 6 places assises, mais n'a ni volant ni pédales, comme vous pouvez le voir dans la vidéo ci-dessus.

Et on ne parle pas ici d'un prototype: le véhicule est finalisé et sera commercialisé dès la rentrée 2018. Pour un prix ""entre 230.000 et 260.000 euros"", affirme au HuffPost le PDG Cristophe Sapet. Dont le but affiché est tout simplement d'aller concurrencer Waymo, la filiale de Google, leader sur les voitures autonomes.

Un premier minibus deux ans plus tôt

Un objectif bien ambitieux, mais il faut dire que Navya ne part pas de rien. Deux ans plus tôt, elle lançait son premier véhicule sans volant ni pédale. Depuis, 50 unités de ce minibus, appelé Arma, ont été vendues. Ils roulent souvent dans des zones sans trafic (aéroports, zones industrielles, etc), mais dans certaines expérimentations, dans des environnements urbains.

Ce mardi, l'engin, capable de transporter 15 passagers, est également rebaptisé Shuttle. ""Tout ce qu'on a appris avec ce véhicule nous a servi pour le Cab"", précise Christophe Sapet, qui envisage d'ailleurs de commercialiser un troisième modèle plus petit, pour compléter la flotte d'ici quelques temps.

Le taxi autonome est évidemment bardé de capteurs en tout genre, essentiels pour ce genre de véhicules. 10 lidars, 6 caméras et 4 radars notamment, pour les connaisseurs. Ce qui représente la moitié du prix du Cab.

Niveau utilisation, on demande une course comme sur une application de VTC dy type Uber. Sauf qu'il n'y a pas de chauffeur. L'app permet également de gérer l'ouverture et la fermeture des portes.

En France en avril ?

Le Cab est vu comme un complément du Shuttle. Le taxi vise avant tout à s'installer dans les centres des grandes métropoles. Sauf que pour l'instant, ce genre de véhicule est interdit sur les routes, en France comme dans la majorité des pays.

Pour autant, il est possible de négocier des expérimentations avec les pouvoirs publics. Si Navya a déjà deux partenaires pour son Cab, d'autres devraient être annoncés d'ici le CES, le plus grand salon de l'électronique, à Las Vegas en janvier 2018.

""On espère avoir les autorisations pour des expérimentations dans une des trois grandes villes françaises d'ici le mois d'avril"", affirme Christophe Sapet. C'est en multipliant ces tests que Navya espère concurrencer les géants du secteur.

Rouler autant que Google

Si tout se passe bien, Navya devrait ""être au même niveau que Waymo en termes de kilomètres parcourus par jour"" l'année prochaine, espère le PDG. Un objectif louable, mais cela ne sera pas suffisant pour atteindre le niveau de Google. La société, pionnière en la matière, a déjà accumulé près de 5 millions de kilomètres depuis le début du projet Google Car.

Christophe Sapet estime tout de même avoir des avantages pour se hisser dans la cour des grands. Notamment un savoir faire dans tous les domaines liés aux voitures autonomes: la construction du véhicule, mais aussi l'intelligence artificielle qui le dirige, les capteurs qui nourrissent cette dernière, etc.

Mais même si l'on dit souvent que la technologie est de plus en plus mûre, le pari d'une voiture sans aucun moyen de reprendre le contrôle est tout de même un saut dans l'inconnu. Sans même parler du changement de législation nécessaire pour qu'une telle révolution soit autorisée sur toutes les routes.

Après tout, même le leader Google, qui envisagerait de lancer une première expérimentation de taxis entièrement autonomes en 2018 à Phoenix, aurait encore parfois des soucis, notamment dans les parkings de centres commerciaux.

Christophe Sapet est conscient des défis et estime que ce genre de taxi ne pourra fonctionner, dans un premier temps, que dans des quartiers bien délimités. Il est par contre confiant sur les capacités de Navya. ""Nos véhicules roulent tous les jours dans des conditions climatiques difficiles. C'est notre savoir faire"", lance-t-il. Et pour prouver que cette technologie est sûre, il n'hésitera pas à traverser Paris dans un Navya Cab. A condition d'en avoir l'autorisation.

Este artículo fue publicado originalmente en el HuffPost Estados Unidos y ha sido traducido del inglés por María Ginés Grao por El HuffPost.","Algunas caras familiares van a regresar a Grey's Anatomy en el capítulo 300, que se emite en Estados Unidos este jueves 9 de octubre.

Este drama médico tan longevo va a traer de vuelta a los fantasmas de temporadas anteriores para el gran capítulo Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story (Quien vive, quien muere, quien cuenta tu historia), que gira en torno a un accidente en una montaña rusa (Lo cierto es que esperamos que no se refieran a fantasmas de verdad, porque todos sabemos cómo acabó eso la última vez).

Aunque intérpretes como Katherine Heigl, Sandra Oh y T.R. Knight no van a volver (miembros del reparto original que ya han abandonado la serie), habrá pacientes con un gran parecido a esos personajes que harán su aparición en este episodio repleto de nostalgia.

""El episodio 300 va a ser como un viaje al pasado"", ha contado el actor James Pickens Jr. en E! News. ""Veremos a algunos actores que llegan al hospital después de un horrible accidente y que nos recordarán a Izzie, George y Cristina Yang"", señala.

""Encontraron a tres intérpretes increíbles... Cuando llegué y los vi me sorprendí mucho, porque fueron una parte imprescindible del éxito que tuvo la serie y tenían mucho talento, así que los echamos mucho de menos. Por tanto, a los espectadores les gustaría mucho decir 'Vaya, ahí están de nuevo"", ha señalado el actor.

La actriz Sara Drew ha explicado a Entertainment Weekly que ""ese parecido hace que el reparto original recuerde a esas personas y luche para que estas vivan"".

Heigl dejó Grey's Anatomy en la sexta temporada tras un supuesto enfrentamiento con la creadora de la serie, Shonda Rhimes. Esta supuesta enemistad surgió cuando la actriz tomó la polémica decisión de retirarse de la carrera por un Emmy en 2008 porque pensaba que su papel ""no merecía una nominación"".

Knight abandonó la serie antes que Heigl, cuando su personaje fallece tras un accidente de autobús. Por su parte, Oh fue la que más tiempo permaneció en la serie de los tres, y se despidió tras la décima temporada.

Rhimes ha dejado la puerta abierta para el regreso de esta actriz, pero no así con Heigl. Ella no volverá a los pasillos del Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, pese al hecho de que la actriz ha manifestado su deseo de volver a interpretar a su personaje.

""Ya basta con esa historia. Le he dado mil vueltas a esa idea y he reflexionado si podría funcionar. Y creo que la respuesta es no"", apunta Rhimes respecto a la posible vuelta de Heigl en 2015.

Andrés Manuel López Obrador.","Desde el 27 de octubre pasado, cuando el presidente nacional del Movimiento de Regeneración Nacional (Morena), Andrés Manuel López Obrador, le envió un mensaje al delegado en Cuauhtémoc, Ricardo Monreal, para que siga con el partido luego del cisma que se abrió entre los dos tras los resultados de la cuestionada encuesta con la que Claudia Sheinbaum fue nombrada coordinadora de Organización en la Ciudad de México.

Tras esos resultados, Monreal, quien resultó en cuarto lugar según dicho ese ejercicio, empezó a dar pasos hacia atrás en su cercanía con López Obrador y a escuchar otras opciones para impulsar su candidatura a la jefatura de gobierno de Ciudad de México, ante la negativa, por lo menos hasta este momento, de repetir el ejercicio en el que Sheinbaum habría resultado ganadora.

""Antes dejo la política que traicionar a López Obrador"": Monreal

Entonces comenzaron los supuestos coqueteos de Monreal con el Frente Ciudadano e, incluso, se dijo que hasta con el PRI.

Monreal, ¿candidato del Frente Ciudadano?

¿Ricardo Monreal regresa al PRI? Esto fue lo que respondió

Después vino un acontecimiento que nadie tenía previsto: el sismo del 19 de septiembre pasado y, lo cual, modificó también el ""mapa de los aspirantes"": los sondeos internos de Morena confirmaban una caída de 7 puntos de Sheinbaum tras el #19S debido a la crisis por el Colegio Rébsamen, en la delegación que actualmente gobierna.

Lo cual este 6 de noviembre parece confirmarse tras los resultados del análisis realizado por la empresa Central de Inteligencia Política (CIP) para el periódico El Universal, en donde la delegada en Tlalpan registra la mayor cobertura negativa a consecuencia del Colegio Rébsamen, donde murieron 26 personas.

Por el contrario, en este mismo ejercicio, el delegado en Cuauhtémoc aparece como el aspirante a la jefatura de gobierno de Ciudad de México que mayor cobertura positiva tuvo en octubre.

Por ello, aquel mensaje de López Obrador el 27 de octubre, aunque causó sorpresa tras su alejamiento con Monreal, también fue visto como un paso lógico.

Sin embargo, una declaración del tabasqueño el pasado 3 de noviembre volvió a acrecentar la incertidumbre.

Brianna Wu, 40, R unning for Congress in Massachusetts, District 8Getty/HuffPostCan you describe the moment you decided to run for office?","Laura Moser never had any desire to run for office. Her husband worked in politics, and she considered herself to be a highly “involved volunteer,” but beyond that maintained some space from the political sphere.

And then the 2016 presidential election happened.

Moser, 40, was overwhelmed by the election of President Donald J. Trump, and the ensuing pain she saw in her own community on Facebook. The outpouring of grief and mass desire to do something that she saw on social media led Moser to found Daily Action in December 2016, a service that texts daily action items ― like calling your representatives to talk about gun control or forwarding a reminder to voters in Virginia to get to to the polls ― to users’ phones. By early May 2017, she had officially announced she would be running for Congress.

Moser’s story isn’t unique. Across the nation, women from all over the political spectrum decided to run for elected office in the wake of the 2016 presidential race. Within a month of the election, non-partisan organization She Should Run had heard from 4,500 women interested in running for elected office. By February, that number rose to 13,000. Emily’s List, a PAC focusing on electing pro-choice Democratic women to office, saw a similar spike in interest.

Some of the women who decided to run for office found inspiration in Hillary Clinton’s candidacy. Others were simply sick and tired of seeing a legislative body they felt did not represent their identities or interests. Regardless of motivation, the numbers tell a clear story: Women are stepping up and saying they deserve a seat ― or three or four or five seats ― at the table.

Below, presented a year since election day, are eight of those women and their stories:

Describe the moment you decided to run for office.

People [would say], “Oh you’re such a good activist, you’re such a good organizer, you should run for something.” And I was like, “That’s crazy. Why would I ever do that?” But then I was in Houston for a Planned Parenthood luncheon and it was the biggest Planned Parenthood luncheon in the history of Planned Parenthood… That was the first time I really thought, maybe I should run. The room was filled with hundreds of pissed off women ― many of whom are traditionally Republicans, and were just tired of having these sleazy dudes take away our rights. And I just felt this swelling sense of collective indignation and belonging with this group, but I also was like, god, I know all these women. I haven’t lived here [in Texas] for a while, but these are still my people, these were the people I grew up with. These are the people I learned to be politically engaged with. And it took me another two and a half months to go from there to actually deciding to pack up my life and move across the country. But that was definitely the Oprah “aha” moment.

You’re part of a wave of women stepping up to run for office. Why do you think it’s important that more women run?

Every single person I know, me included, has been assaulted and harassed by a man in power many times in our lives. That is the world that we live in. And [I’m] OK. [I’ve] overcome these hurdles. But the Access Hollywood tape was an absolutely radicalizing moment for me. I was like, fuck, this guy’s running for President? And he’s the worst man we’ve all met before? And then he won. I thought the election was over then. But then he actually won, being that person. And so I think the value of women and people of color being at the table and in the conversation is that we’re...bringing new voices to the table.

If we had women in all positions in power, the world would become more adaptable to women and mothers, and families. Because I just think a lot of men are used to the women doing it for them. And guess what? We’ve done a really good job… [White men have] had their chance. They’ve done some good things over the years, but I’m done.

Can you describe the moment you decided to run for office?

I was standing at the Javits Center on election night, 30 feet [from] where we were hoping Hillary Clinton would accept the presidency. I was there with all of the people that worked the election for Hillary, as things started going wrong. It was one of the worst nights of my entire life. I was thrown into a loop for a week or two and realized that I wasn’t willing to sit it out for the next four years. It was time to stand up and bring my own values to politics.

What have you learned since you decided to run?

I’m going to be really honest with you. What I’ve learned here in Massachusetts is that the institutions of power are very ready to put a camera in your face when you’re a woman in danger like I was during GamerGate. But when you’re talking about taking power for yourself, when you’re talking about upsetting the status quo, when you’re talking specifically about replacing a man, even a Democratic man [incumbent Stephen Lynch], what I’ve learned is that the system starts shutting its doors very, very quickly.

A lot of this first year has honestly been realizing that the Democratic Party is not necessarily the friend of women that want to run and push the party toward a stronger position on women’s rights.

What sparked your interest in running for office?

Like so many people, I woke up on Nov. 9 in disbelief. I went to sleep early the night before, trusting that the American people would never elect someone so intolerant or incompetent. I woke up, heard the news, and knew I had to run. I knew that there must be a response to Trump and the regressive, elitist Republican agenda.

What’s one of the most important things you’ve learned while running?

Put your head down and get it done. From the moment I started running, people told me, “No, you can’t do this.” They told me that I could not be a mother, an attorney, a wife and a candidate. But I’ve been told “No” my whole life. When I was in high school, I watched as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg announced the Supreme Court’s decision that Virginia Military Institute ― one of the top all-male military colleges in the country ― had to accept women. My male classmates jeered, and I decided I had to go. I enrolled as one of the first women of color to attend VMI. When people told me I couldn’t win this election, I put my head down, ignored the naysayers, and got to work. We knocked on more doors, called more voters, and put in the time to win. There will be people who tell you that you shouldn’t run or that you will never win. Tell them, “Watch me!”

Can you describe the moment you decided to run for office?

I made the official decision to run for office when Ed Royce voted to repeal and replace the ACA. I just couldn’t stand by while our representative voted to take away health care coverage from my patients and their families.

We really need to see a change in our community, and we need someone who understands what our community is going through. As a refugee who came to this country as a child, I know the inhumanity of the Trump administration’s policies that will restrict new immigrants, and we need a leader who will fight tooth and nail against those policies. As a woman that has defeated breast cancer twice, I know how important it is to be an outspoken advocate for women’s health issues, so that all women have access to reproductive health care and breast cancer screenings.

Can you describe how you felt on election night last year?

I felt like I had been punched in the stomach. The next morning, I didn’t want to get up. But I did, like all women do. One of the first patients I saw was a child with a brain tumor. His mom is a nail shop worker and she was finally able to get health care coverage because of the ACA. That meant that she would have coverage for her son as their family dealt with such a terrible tragedy. As we sat in the exam room that next morning, we hugged each other and we cried. We were all so scared. But after the crying, we knew that we needed to fight.

Why did you decide to run for office?

In many ways where I found myself in 2016 was very similar to where I found myself in 2008, which was coming out of a big election, asking myself what I can do for people, particularly my home community... In 2016, I asked myself that same question coming out of the election, what is going on in Michigan? What is this representation bringing to my hometown? I was working in a Department of Defense-funded advanced manufacturing research lab spending a bunch of time with technology, advanced technology, and looking at technology adoption for the small and midsize manufacturing community... Everyone wants to talk about 21st century job training and skills. Well, I’ve created workforce development programs. I’ve worked at the intersection of industry and government and academia and nonprofit for outcomes. I really saw the confluence of all of those things. Plus the willingness and eagerness to serve and respond to something like I did eight years prior, which is stepping up and putting up my hand to make a difference for people.

I felt the urgency of the time and this groundswell that was taking place in Michigan. So many people, my mom being one of them, who just said, “Hey, I was on the floor coming out of this election, but you looking and stepping up in this way, that was giving me hope.” I was plugging into Democratic Club organizations that were seeing two to three times more participation. I was going into union halls and I was tapping into that groundswell. Not as a candidate, but as somebody who was looking to step up as a voice. My candidacy in many respects began as part of that groundswell and really ballooned into something tremendous.

If you’re elected, what change do you hope to see as a result?

This is about a new generation of leaders and leadership. We’re all too familiar with the linkage between congress and the word “dysfunction.” They seem to go hand in hand. That’s just something we got to stop right now. We need a return to common sense and we need a return to real leadership. In part that is about the collaborative nature and role of this office, as well as the willingness to use the office to make a difference for people. Make a difference for people in terms of solving large challenges that communities have been saddled with. That could be as it pertains to health outcomes, as it pertains to education, and certainly as it pertains to our economy. I really believe in the moral authority of the office to do good.

Eileen Naples, 35, Ran for New York State Senate, District 26 (Lost.)

Why did you decide to run for office?

Before Trump, I would have been the kind of person who thought about these problems and didn’t think I was the person to run. When I was assistant district attorney, my job was prosecuting bullies and abusers in people’s families. I saw that trait early on with Trump and I was horrified. So many moms and women recognize him as a bully. That an infectious, horrible influence on our kids is being amplified in such a position made me think that the voice of a normal mom needs to be amplified, too. We should be as vocal as we seek to be, as he did. There’s no point to sit back and watch this unfold anymore, we have to all do it ourselves. If we leave it to the system it’s going to shake out in a way that’s not good for our kids.

You lost your election earlier this fall. Would you run again?

The Democratic party in each county has to choose a person to run. I have to decide if I’m going to run again in the primary next year. I’ll certainly be exploring other ways to get involved. My big question is: How do you take all this enthusiasm ― within a city like New York, it’s like a fiefdom ― and make real change? To me, it’s about informing people about the real paths to influence local leaders.

Jess Phoenix, 35, Running for Congress in California, District 25

Courtesy of Jess Phoenix

What sparked your interest in running for office?

I am running for Congress because I think some of the biggest threats that we have coming down the pipeline are completely being ignored by our current representation in government. For example, climate change is going to impact our national security, our jobs, our health, and even our food security. I believe we need a scientific approach to solving problems like this because they’re big picture problems that affect everyone. We need leaders who know how to look at a ton of evidence and data to draw conclusions and outline a plan of action. That is something that my work as a scientist has prepared me pretty uniquely to do.

The moment that I decided to run, I had just given a lecture at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles. A friend with two young boys approached me, and expressed that he was very concerned about the future world his kids would inherit. I realized that science is missing from government, and if not me, who would be the scientist to run and change our future?

Can you describe how you felt on election night last year?

Election night 2016 was surreal for me. I was working the polls here in L.A. County, and my fellow poll workers and I started out the day in fantastic spirits. As early evening began, we started to see news updates come through on our phones. Throughout the day, turnout had seemed low to us, but we figured that people would come after work. Every report of Trump’s electoral victories felt like a lie. Our jokes disappeared, and we all started focusing inward, looking at our phones and grimacing. From 7pm until the polls closed at 8pm, we didn’t have a single voter come in. That was the biggest clue that something was seriously, seriously wrong with our democracy. My husband Carlos had been canvassing for Hillary in Arizona, and instead of staying there for a victory party he decided to drive back home in the middle of the night. I waited up for him, and we talked until the early hours of the next morning about how impossible and unreal the results seemed.

What sparked your interest in running for office?

The idea to run began as just a fleeting thought, but the more I saw how desperately people around the country were fighting for unity, the more that idea grew. I definitively knew I wanted to run when I casually mentioned to my mother, a physician who was one of the only women in her medical school in India over 50 years ago, “I think I would make a great candidate. I could run.” And my mother answered, “You would be incredible. And you absolutely should run.” Knowing how much I value my mother’s earned wisdom, and considering what the example of my running might do for my own daughter’s ability to dream big, I decided to go for it.

What's the most surprising thing you've found in running?

I am pleasantly surprised that so many people are willing to give me their time as I start my campaign. They want to be a part of something tangible, something that is concretely, measurably, creating change. I am surprised that as much as I am thanking people for their support, they are thanking me back... For the opportunity to work towards something together.

The three-part documentary ‘Gone To Pot’ sounds like it would more at home on Viceland - or at the very least a 10pm slot on Channel 5 - but it’s ITV who commissioned the series, which sees some familiar faces - the ex-‘EastEnders’ actress, Linda, John Fashanu, Christopher Biggins and Bobby George - on a voyage of discovery, learning more about the drug.

Before jetting off to California, Pam had little first-hand experience of it - “I’d smoked a bit when I was younger but nothing great… And like all good politicians of course, I didn’t inhale” - but when HuffPost UK spoke with the actress just days after she returned to the UK, she explained that the trip did succeed in changing her perceptions.

In the first episode, viewers will see the gang learn that many medical users in the US are over 55 - a factor that helped ITV decide who could be good for the show - as they visit a dispensary to learn about which products could help their various ailments.

L'initiative entend également envoyer un message de ""tolérance"" dans une période particulièrement violente.

Si ce voyage, le premier d'Emmanuel Macron dans les pays du Golfe, reste dans la continuité des relations cordiales entre les deux pays, il interpelle tout de même, alors que le président a reçu en septembre dernier l'émir du Qatar, cheikh Tamim al-Thani et qu'il a annoncé récemment vouloir se rendre en Iran, pays ennemi des Émirats, lors d'une visite officielle. Dans la ligne d'une prudente politique diplomatique, Emmanuel Macron tente de ménager ses alliés, tout en avançant ses pions dans un contexte houleux qu'est la crise du Qatar.

Les Émirats Arabes Unis, un allié privilégié... contre le terrorisme

Les enjeux de la France dans sa relation avec les Émirats sont élevés, comme en témoigne le rythme des échanges bilatéraux. François Hollande a rencontré à cinq reprises le prince héritier d'Abou Dhabi Cheikh Mohammed ben Zayed al-Nahyane entre 2012 et 2016. Et l'actuel chef de la diplomatie, Jean-Yves Le Drian, s'y est rendu une bonne dizaine de fois comme ministre de la Défense. Les liens sont ""étroits, réguliers et diversifiés"", résume d'ailleurs l'Elysée.

Les Emirats sont le 2e partenaire commercial de la France dans le Golfe, après l'Arabie Saoudite, avec près de 4,7 milliards d'euros d'échanges en 2016, allant de l'aéronautique (déjà 100 Airbus 380 livrés à la compagnie Emirates) aux produits de luxe. Ils représentent ainsi pour la France le 4e excédent au niveau mondial. Les exportations françaises ont cependant reculé ces deux dernières années (-5,9% en 2016) en raison de l'exacerbation de la concurrence internationale et de l'impact de la chute des cours du pétrole. Il sont également devenus ""un partenaire stratégique-clé"" de la France au Moyen-Orient lors d'une alliance scellée après la guerre militaire du Golfe de 1990-91.

Mais outre ces intérêts, ""Emmanuel Macron s'intéresse de près aux Émirats car il estime qu'ils sont dignes de confiance en ce qui concerne la lutte contre le terrorisme. Comme avec l'Égypte, il veut en faire un réel allié. Ce qui n'est pas le cas de l'Arabie Saoudite et du Qatar, qu'il a plusieurs fois qualifié de non fiables en ce qui concerne le terrorisme"", nous explique Myriam Benraad, professeur assistante à l'université de Leiden au Pays-Bas. Y passer deux jours en visite officielle est un moyen de solidifier cette relation.

Des intérêts solides dans le Golfe

Même si le manque de confiance est établi, la France entretient tout de même de bonnes relations avec le Qatar et l'Arabie Saoudite. Déjà, pendant son mandat, François Hollande s'est rendu plusieurs fois en visite officielle au Qatar, à l'occasion de la signature des contrats liés à l'acquisition de 24 avions de combat Rafale. Pour sa part, après avoir été reçu à l'Elysée en 2013 pour une visite de travail consacrée à la situation en Syrie, l'émir Tamim avait choisi la France pour effectuer sa première visite officielle dans un pays de l'Union européenne, en juin 2014. Il s'y est de nouveau rendu le 15 septembre 2017.

De plus, selon l'Elysée, ""les liens économiques de la France avec le Qatar sont solides, que ce soit sur le plan commercial ou financier. Si le montant de nos échanges commerciaux a connu un léger infléchissement en 2016, après une année 2015 record, il reste bien supérieur aux résultats des années précédentes"". Et ce, malgré la mise au ban du pays par ses voisins du Moyen-Orient. La France demeure également l'une des destinations privilégiées de l'investissement qatarien à l'étranger, aux côtés du Royaume-Uni, de l'Allemagne et des Etats-Unis (les investissements qatariens en France sont estimés à près de 25 milliards d'euros en 2015).

De même pour l'Arabie Saoudite, François Hollande avait fait le déplacement à Riyad en 2015. A cette occasion, il s'était entretenu avec le roi Salman et avait été invité d'honneur au sommet des chefs d'Etat du Conseil de Coopération du Golfe. Le Premier ministre français s'était également rendu à Riyad le 13 octobre 2015. Ce fut l'occasion de confirmer la force du partenariat franco-saoudien ainsi que la convergence de vues entre les deux pays sur les principaux dossiers régionaux. Cette rencontre s'est concrétisée par la signature de contrats pour un montant de près de 10 milliards d'euros, en particulier dans les domaines militaire, financier et agroalimentaire. De son côté, le vice-prince héritier est venu plusieurs fois à Paris entre 2015 et 2016.

""L'Arabie est notre premier partenaire commercial dans le Golfe avec 10 milliards d'euros en 2014 et 8,5 milliards d'euros en 2015 (la différence s'explique par la baisse de nos importations en hydrocarbures)"", souligne l'Elysée.

La diplomatie ou l'intérêt de ""ménager la chèvre et le chou""

Des intérêts variés, des alliances forgées... La France a tissé des liens parmi les pays du Golfe, alors que ceux-ci ont parfois des relations très tendues entre eux. C'est là que la diplomatie intervient. ""Les enjeux diplomatiques sont devenus beaucoup plus importants depuis la crise du Qatar. C'est en particulier depuis ce moment-là que la France a eu tout intérêt à ménager la chèvre et le chou afin de garder de bonnes relations avec les différents pays, tout en évitant de froisser ceux qui pourraient l'être"", explique au HuffPost un spécialiste du Moyen-Orient à Science Po.

Paris cherche à promouvoir ""l'apaisement"" et ""le dialogue"" dans la crise diplomatique autour du Qatar, mis au ban depuis juin par Ryad et Abou Dhabi, qui dénoncent son rapprochement avec l'Iran chiite, principal rival des Saoudiens au Moyen-Orient. Une tache d'autant plus délicate que Emmanuel Macron a récemment annoncé son intention de se rendre à Téhéran, une visite inédite pour un président français depuis 1976. Malgré tout, la France continue de tenir son rôle d'arbitre/médiateur. ""La France est embarrassée sur ce dossier car elle cherche à ménager toutes les parties"", mais ""elle a du mal à peser, comme les autres pays occidentaux d'ailleurs"", remarque Jean-Pierre Maulny, directeur adjoint de l'Institut de relations internationales et stratégiques (IRIS).

De même, certains sujets sont évités avec les Émirats Arabes Unis. ""Nous sommes des partenaires très proches, mais il y a parfois des sujets sur lesquels nous ne sommes pas totalement d'accord"", reconnait-on à l'Elysée. C'est le cas de la guerre au Yémen, dans laquelle les Emirats sont fortement impliqués aux côtés de l'Arabie Saoudite. La France appelle ""à une solution politique car nous ne croyons pas qu'il y ait une issue militaire"", précise-t-on de même source.

Un ""prix élevé"" pour la diplomatie

Tempérer, arbitrer, ménager, rassurer, afin de préserver les intérêts souverains de la France... Pour le spécialiste du Moyen-Orient, la diplomatie demande un coût parfois dur à assumer. ""Garder des bonnes relations avec les pays du Golfe, notamment les Émirats et l'Arabie Saoudite, se fait au dépend d'une prise de position claire et forte par rapport à la situation au Yémen, déplore-t-il. La France ne se prononce pas clairement dessus pour ne pas froisser ses alliés, et je pense que c'est un prix un peu cher à payer"".

Depuis mars 2015, Ryad est à la tête d'une coalition de pays sunnites aidant les forces gouvernementales yéménites dans leur guerre contre les Houthis et leurs alliés, maîtres de la capitale Sanaa depuis septembre 2014. Le conflit a fait plus de 8650 morts et quelque 58.600 blessés, dont de nombreux civils, et provoqué ""la pire crise humanitaire au monde"", selon l'ONU.

""De toute façon, si la crise avec le Qatar s'envenime d'avantage, la France va devoir forcément prendre position, ou tout du moins adopter une politique plus ferme. Cette politique de ménager la chèvre et le chou n'est pas vouée à durer"", conclut le spécialiste.

NSW Police confirmed to HuffPost Australia on Tuesday afternoon that the 52-year-old driver had been charged over the incident.

In a later statement, authorities said the woman has been charged with two counts of dangerous driving occasioning death and also negligent driving. Her NSW driving licence has also been suspended and she is expected to appear in Bankstown Local Court on Wednesday.

""As a result of that collision, five kids were urgently conveyed to Westmead Hospital. Tragically, two of those kids, male children, are deceased,"" a police spokesman told reporters.

""It is ongoing and we'll be here for some time to unravel this dreadful event.""

Five injured children were urgently rushed to Westmead Hospital.

Pictures from the scene showed a crowd of distressed parents swarming the school's Boronia Road main entrance to collect their children.

NSW Fire and Rescue Superintendent Adam Dewbury said teachers and members of the public who heard the accident ran into the scene to help.

""The response by the first responders was fantastic. World-class. And also with the teachers (who) provided the best treatment to these children who had suffered the injury,"" he said.

It was carnage and pandemonium when Ambulance services arrived to find people assisting the injured, a NSW Ambulance spokeswoman said. Children were left screaming for their parents.

""Obviously a scene of carnage, a number of distressed and overwhelmed children and teachers at a scene of a horrible accident, and obviously and pandemonium,"" she said.

""It's always chaotic until there's order. New South Wales ambulance paramedics were well able to bring that order to that chaos this morning.""

Hier können Sie den Roman zum Film ""Simpel"" bestellen

Die Geschichte von Simpel und Ben

Seit Ben (Frederick Lau, 28) denken kann, sind er und sein Bruder Barnabas alias Simpel (David Kross, 27) ein Herz und eine Seele. Simpel ist 22 Jahre alt, aber geistig auf dem Stand eines Kindes. Quasilorten (Erdbeeren) sind sein Lieblingsessen und draußen im Watt entdeckt er mit seinem Stofftier Monsieur Hasehase neue Kontinente. Simpel ist anders und oft anstrengend, aber ein Leben ohne ihn ist für Ben unvorstellbar. Als ihre Mutter unerwartet stirbt, soll Simpel in ein Heim eingewiesen werden.

Die einzige Person, die diesen Beschluss rückgängig machen könnte, ist der Vater der beiden Jungs. Doch zu David (Devid Striesow, 44) haben die Brüder seit 15 Jahren keinen Kontakt mehr. Die Suche nach ihm entwickelt sich zu einer turbulenten Odyssee, bei der Simpel und Ben unter anderem auf die Medizinstudentin Aria (Emilia Schüle, 24) und ihren Kumpel, den Sanitäter Enzo (Axel Stein, 35) treffen. Am Ende muss Ben ganz alleine die schwerste Entscheidung seines Lebens treffen...

""Stell dir vor, die ganze Welt wäre wie Simpel und Ben...""

Der 113 Minuten lange Film ""Simpel"" ist ein herzergreifendes Roadmovie geworden. Mit zwei sehr unterschiedlichen Menschen in den Hauptrollen, deren Stärke es ist, immer füreinander da zu sein. Genau von dieser Beziehung zwischen Ben und Simpel lebt der Film. Frederick Lau und David Kross haben keinerlei Berührungsängste, sodass man ihnen ohne jeden Zweifel abnimmt, dass sie Brüder sind. Die Rollen scheinen perfekt auf die beiden Schauspieler zugeschnitten worden zu sein.

Gar nicht so simpel: David Kross und seine Rolle

Während Frederick Lau auf seine unverwechselbare Art den eher zurückhaltenden, fürsorglichen Bruder spielt, der sein eigenes Leben Simpel zuliebe hintenanstellt und sich erst im Laufe des Film seiner eigenen Bedürfnisse bewusst wird, merkt man wie intensiv sich David Kross auf seine Rolle als geistig behinderter Mitte Zwanzigjähriger vorbereitet haben muss. Keine Sekunde zweifelt man im Kinosessel an der Echtheit seiner Darstellung - seine Gestik und Mimik, seine Aussprache, alles wirkt authentisch und keinesfalls überzogen.

Für nette Abwechslung sorgen die Auftritte von Emilia Schüle als ruppige Medizinstudentin Aria und ihrem Kumpel Enzo, gespielt von Axel Stein. Vor allem Schüles Rolle bildet mit ihrer eigenen Familiengeschichte den Gegensatz zu Simpel und Ben. Die Differenzen zwischen Aria und Ben sorgen für Turbulenzen, machen den Film aber ein klein wenig spannender. Einen kurzen Gastauftritt absolviert außerdem Annette Frier (43) als Hamburger Prostituierte. Für die Handlung an sich hätte es diese Episode im Film nicht unbedingt gebraucht, doch witzig anzusehen ist die Begegnung zwischen Simpel und Chantal allemal.

Die Handlung weist an einigen Stellen Schwächen auf und deckt sich nur in Teilen mit der mehrfach ausgezeichneten Buchvorlage. Doch trotzdem funktioniert ""Simpel"" auf seine ganz eigene Art und Weise. Das liegt vor allem an der hochkarätigen Schauspieler-Besetzung, die Markus Goller für sein Wunsch-Projekt gewinnen konnte. Denn dass der Regisseur für die Romanverfilmung brennt, merkt man dem ungewöhnlichen Roadmovie an. Die Botschaft des Film ist klar: Begegne anderen Menschen ohne Vorurteile.

Fazit

Für ""Simpel"" lohnt sich ein Kinobesuch. Das hat der Film ganz klar seinen beiden Hauptdarstellern Frederick Lau und David Kross zu verdanken. Reine Situationskomik macht die Geschichte amüsant, ohne sie ins Lächerliche zu ziehen. Markus Goller ist ein warmherziger Film gelungen, der ein bisschen den Glauben an das Gute im Menschen und an das deutsche Kino zurückbringt.","Darum geht es im neuen Kinofilm ""Simpel""",http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2017/11/08/simpel-die-traurig-schone-geschichte-eines-ungleichen-bruderpaars_n_18501224.html

""Part of that is you are coming to your second language with knowledge of your first language.""
""I guess what the one distinction between a first language and second language is that first language acquisition is really implicit and a second language can be more explicit.""
The explicit nature of learning a second language means that we are very aware of how much energy and dedication it takes to be able to speak any language well.
""Let's face it, there is nothing more humbling than learning a second language and using it because you just revert to [being] a two-year-old.""","Learning a second language is no easy task.

A lot of time and dedication is required, plus there is a significant amount of memorising of words and phrases. And even once you've learnt those, it takes both skill and confidence to use them in a real-life setting.

Well, Associate Professor Evan Kidd from the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language says that anyone can learn a new language as long as they put enough time into the process.

""I think that almost anyone, if they give it a good enough shot, is going to have some abilities in a language with enough exposure and time,"" Kidd told HuffPost Australia.

According to Kidd, one of the biggest challenges adults face when learning a new language is approaching it with the knowledge of their mother tongue. Our brains are finely tuned to our first language and so we approach any new linguistic situation within the framework of that first language.

""The challenge in learning a second language is the fact that you have a first language,"" Kidd said. ""Part of that is you are coming to your second language with knowledge of your first language.""

So, what are some ways that we can make the language-learning process easier?

Three ways to make learning a new language easier Use stock phrases Learning a few generic and adaptable phrases in a new language can make it easier to use and also give you a template to build other terms using that same formula. ""It's good to have a few stock phrases because then you can start strapping off from those so you can say -- 'OK I have got this phrase and I can put different verbs in it and different nouns in it', which is actually how young kids tend to learn,"" Kidd said. Memorise When you first start out, learning the basic grammar and vocabulary of any language is going to require time to create a solid linguistic foundation. This means a lot of dedication to learning the words and making an effort to remember those through practice. ""Inevitably, there are going to be instances where you are just going to need to memorise the rule because, let's face it, languages are weird entities."" Actually speak the language Kidd said that in his experience, one of the most important things when learning a new language is making the effort to use it as much as possible. ""It's all fine and good to sit there and learn it and then do in a class, but you really have to talk and I think by virtue of talking that's when you really start to get much more sense that this is a communicative system and you really want to use that to communicate."" ""[It's a] combination between memorisation and a little bit of 'extraversion' and having a go.""

Children are exposed to languages at a very young age, even from the time they are in the womb. The process of acquiring language begins with sounds and language rhythms and eventually builds up to words and sentences.

""One of the cool things about infants when they are born is they have the ability to perceive the difference between any sound that the human vocal tract can make, and the thing is that any one language will only use a subset of those sounds,"" Kidd said.

An interesting example of how this works can be found when the English and Japanese languages are compared.

""In English we have a distinction between the 'R' sound and the 'L' sound but in Japanese they don't have that distinction -- they've got one which is between these two sounds,"" Kidd explained.

""So, what happens when a Japanese infant is born is that they can distinguish between the 'R' and 'L' sounds but once they get to about 12 months they can't do it anymore and that is because their language doesn't have it.""

Children under 12 months can identify every sound a human voice tract can make.

As humans lose this ability around the age of 12 months, we become unable to accurately distinguish some sounds that our mother tongue doesn't use. It's in this way that learning a first and a second language is fundamentally different.

Most of us can't remember learning our first language because it was effortless and occurred over a long period of time, but acquiring that second one requires a lot of hard work.

""I guess what the one distinction between a first language and second language is that first language acquisition is really implicit and a second language can be more explicit.""

The explicit nature of learning a second language means that we are very aware of how much energy and dedication it takes to be able to speak any language well. Kidd says that being as confident as possible with another language could be the gateway to your success.

And now that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's inevitable engagement looms near, your fantasies have likely kicked into overdrive.

But while we can only imagine what it's like to be a wedding guest, journalist Duncan Larcombe knows first-hand how glamourous the affair actually is.

Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge on their wedding day, April 29, 2011.

While we were glued to our TV screens watching Kate Middleton and Prince William get hitched in April 2011, Larcombe was actually among the 1,900 people at the service in Westminster Abbey.

The former royal editor of The Sun was one of six journalists who attended the nuptials. ""We were told in advance about two or three weeks before that we were invited, but we were told not to tell anybody,"" he told Elle U.K. in a recent interview. ""They wouldn't have wanted word to get out amongst other journalists.""

It's a very weird experience, kind of like sitting in Madame Tussauds with moving waxwork.

So what was it like being among so many royals at the ceremony? According to Larcombe, it was just as surreal as we imagine.

""It's a very weird experience, kind of like sitting in Madame Tussauds with moving waxwork,"" he said. ""It was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. You know when you're there that you're watching history unfold in front of your eyes.""

""It's not like any wedding I've ever been to,"" he added. ""If you like people watching there's probably nothing better than a royal wedding. There isn't a room that has that many famous and royal people all under one roof.""

Larcombe also got to witness candid moments among the royals, including Prince William trying to compose himself beside brother Prince Harry before the ceremony (""[He] looked absolutely terrified""), and when complete silence filled the church when the Duchess of Cambridge finally arrived.

""All we could hear was the echoes of the crowds outside,"" he said.

Crowds gather on the mall prior to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton.

While Larcombe admitted that there was a lot of waiting around for the nuptials to begin, the event was well worth it. Not only did he get to see history in the making, but he revealed that every guest was treated as an equal — no matter how famous (or not famous) they were.

""It was quite clear at the wedding that no matter if you were the Sultan of Brunei or a guy who's been at Sandhurst with William, or a big Hollywood star, everyone got there early,"" he explained, noting that the Queen was the last to arrive and then the bride. ""I think for someone like Sir Elton John, who is normally one to be the centre of attention, it was probably quite humbling.""

Although there's much excitement over Prince Harry's possible engagement and wedding, his nuptials will likely be very different from his brother's, considering Harry is fifth-in-line (sixth-in-line when William and Catherine's third child arrives) to the throne and William is second. This means his and Markle's wedding will likely be more informal.

Last month, a source close to Harry told Us Weekly that a low-key wedding is more his style.

""Pomp and pageantry is the last thing he would want,"" the insider told the site. ""I can see him wanting to get married at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. It would stop it from turning into a total media circus and give the day a sense of privacy that Harry so badly craves.""

En una entrevista el viernes en la emisora SiriusXM, la protagonista de The Good Wife habló sobre dos encuentros con Seagal y Weinstein en los inicios de su carrera.

Margulies contó que cuando tenía 23 años una directora de casting la envió a ver a Seagal a las diez de la noche para leer una escena. La directora obvió las objeciones de la actriz ofreciéndole pagarle el taxi y prometiéndole que estaría presente. Sin embargo, cuando Margulies llegó, se encontró a solas con la estrella de las películas de acción.

""Me la jugó"", dijo Margulies sobre la mujer que organizó la audición. El encuentro con Seagal pronto se volvió amenazante, recordó la actriz. ""Se aseguró de que viera su pistola. Nunca había visto una en la vida real"", confesó. ""Salí ilesa de allí... no sé cómo conseguí salir de la habitación de ese hotel"".

Según relató, Seagal intentó convertir la supuesta audición en un encuentro sexual mediante una práctica de la que también se acusa a Weinstein. ""Siempre comienza con un 'soy un sanador, quiero darte un masaje"", aseguró.

Varios años después, en 1996, a Margulies la invitaron a conocer a Weinstein. Contó que una mujer la llevó a su hotel, prometiéndole que si hablaba con el productor conseguiría una prueba de pantalla para un papel potencialmente ganador de premios en una gran película. Tras su encuentro con Seagal, Margulies fue cauta.

""Dije: 'No voy a subir allí sola', por la experiencia con Seagal y porque tenía una carrera"", aseguró la actriz, que por aquel entonces participaba en la serie E.R.

Después de que Margulies insistiera en que se iría a su casa si la otra mujer no la acompañaba, las dos entraron juntas en la habitación de Weinstein.

""Abrió la puerta en bata"", recordó. ""Pude ver que había velas encendidas en la habitación y cena para dos. Y vi que se quedó mirándola, fulminándola"". Margulies se giró hacia la otra mujer y la pilló encogiéndose de hombros ""en plan: '¿Qué podía hacer?"".

Según la intérprete, Weinstein parecía furioso y le espetó: ""Sólo quería decirte que buena audición"". Después, dio un portazo. No le dieron el papel.

Margulies forma parte de la lista de medio centenar de mujeres que han acusado a Weinstein de comportamientos sexuales inadecuados, con acusaciones que van desde el intento de acoso hasta la violación. Tras dos exclusivas de The New York Times y The New Yorker y el testimonio de numerosas mujeres, Weinstein fue despedido de su propia productora, The Weinstein Company, y fue expulsado de la Academia de Hollywood. La policía de Los Ángeles y de Londres están investigando acusaciones de violación contra él. El viernes, la policía de Nueva York confirmó que ha reunido evidencias de ""una acusación de violación creíble"", que podría conducir a su arresto.

Seagal ya había sido acusado también de conductas inapropiadas. En 1998, la actriz Jenny McCarthy aseguró que se había marchado angustiada de una audición después de que el actor insistiera repetidamente en que se desnudara. En 2010 fue demandado por acoso sexual por una exasistente que afirmaba que la había usado como ""juguete sexual"". La demanda fue retirada más tarde. En octubre de este año la actriz Lisa Guerrero contó que había recibido presiones para hacer una audición a solas en casa de Seagal para un papel en la película de 1997 Infierno bajo tierra.

Durante la entrevista del viernes, Margulies aseguró que la reciente ola de acusaciones públicas hizo que se diera cuenta de que ""había guardado lo barrido debajo de la alfombra. Te encoges de hombros porque es Hollywood"".

También señaló el papel de algunas mujeres a la hora de permitir ese comportamiento depredador de algunos hombres, como el de las mujeres de la industria que la condujeron a esas situaciones.

""Tenemos que empezar a responsabilizar a esas personas"", afirmó. ""Esas mujeres me llevaron a la guarida del león"".

Doch in ihrer Amtszeit hat Deutschland kaum Fortschritte beim Klimaschutz gemacht

Das zeigt sich vor allem bei der Kohleenergie

Angela Merkels wohl größtes Versagen lässt sich auf die Tonne genau messen.

Als die ehemalige Bundesumweltministerin 2005 ins Kanzleramt einzog, stieß Deutschland 992 Millionen Tonnen klimaschädliches Kohlendioxid (CO2) aus. 2015 waren es 902 Millionen Tonnen. Der Ausstoß müsste aber viel schneller sinken, wenn Deutschland sein offizielles Klimaziel von 751 Millionen Tonnen im Jahr 2020 noch schaffen will, kritisieren Experten.

Die Zahlen zeigen: Die Bilanz, die Angela Merkel als Klimakanzlerin vorzuweisen hat, ist rabenschwarz.

Und das obwohl Deutschland weltweit als eine Art Öko-Primus angesehen wird. Die Wahrheit, das zeigt sich zum Start der 23. Weltklimakonferenz in Bonn, sieht anders aus.

“Trump ist wenigstens ehrlich”

Wegen ihrer gescheiterten Klimapolitik vergleicht “Die Zeit” Merkel gar mit Donald Trump. “Merkel betreibt eine klimafeindliche Politik”, urteilt die Wochenzeitung.

Aber im Gegensatz zur Kanzlerin sei der US-Präsident wenigstens ehrlich und zeige offen, dass ihm das Klima egal ist.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Deutschland hat ein schmutziges Geheimnis"": TV-Sender CNN macht Merkel schwere Vorwürfe

Gründe für Deutschlands Versagen beim Klimaschutz gibt es viele: Die schleppende Verkehrswende, das gedrosselte Tempo beim Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien, die Stagnation beim Umbau der Wärmeversorgung.

Aber das Scheitern der Kanzlerin wird nirgendwo deutlicher als im Bereich der Kohleenergie.

Zum Hintergrund:

► In Deutschland stehen die schmutzigsten Kohlemeiler Europas.

► Fast die Hälfte des klimaschädlichen CO2-Ausstoßes in Deutschland geht auf das Konto des Energiesektors.

► Im Energiesektor verursachen Kohlekraftwerke wiederum den Großteil der Klimagase.

► Deutschland fördert mehr der besonders schmutzigen Braunkohle als jede andere Land der Welt (China und Indien fördern vor allem Steinkohle).

Angela Merkel kennt all diese Zahlen. Und als Physikerin weiß sie zu gut, was Kohlekraftwerke mit dem Klima anrichten. Aber ebenso wie schmutzige Dieselautos stellt die Kanzlerin die Kohle unter Artenschutz.

Die Frage ist: Warum? Die wahrscheinlichste Antwort lautet: Weil sich daraus bisher politisch kein Kapital schlagen lässt.

Kohleausstieg wird in einer Jamaika-Koalition kaum zu machen sein

Im Jahr 2010 blockierte Merkel ein frühzeitiges Ende der Subventionen für deutsche Kohlekraftwerke, die die EU durchsetzen wollte.

2013 hieß es im Koalitionsvertrag noch, dass die Kohleverbrennung “auf absehbare Zeit unverzichtbar” sei. Dann versuchte Merkel sich an einer Kohlewende - die sie aber nie durchzog.

Im Frühjahr 2015 hatte die Kanzlerin noch Zustimmung für einen langsamen Kohleausstieg in Deutschland signalisiert - organisieren wollte ihn ihr damaliger Wirtschaftsminister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD).

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Klimaschutz: Wer nicht mitmacht, den bestraft das Leben

Doch nachdem sich die Ministerpräsidenten von Sachsen, Brandenburg und Sachsen-Anhalt und ranghohe Parteimitglieder gegen den Plan aussprachen, beerdigte Merkel die Idee.

Zwar hatte die Kanzlerin auch im Wahlkampf vorsichtige Zustimmung zu einem Ausstieg aus der Braunkohle signalisiert. Im Sommerinterview hatte sie erklärt, man könne einen Braunkohleausstieg “ins Auge fassen”, wenn es Pläne für die Zukunft der Beschäftigten in der Kohleindustrie gebe.

Doch für einen Kohleausstieg kämpfen nun die Grünen in den Jamaika-Verhandlungen allein. Von einer Unterstützung der Kanzlerin für ihre Pläne ist bisher nichts an die Öffentlichkeit gedrungen. An der Frage des Klimaschutzes drohen nun sogar die Verhandlungen für eine Jamaika-Koalition zu scheitern.

Dabei drängt die Zeit. Denn je länger die schmutzigen Kohlekraftwerke am Netz sind, desto schwieriger wird es für Deutschland, seine Klimaziele zu erreichen.

Sogar China verabschiedet sich von der Kohle

Und während Deutschland noch zögert, gehen andere Länder voran.

Unter anderem haben Norwegen und Großbritannien den vollständigen Kohleausstieg beschlossen. Selbst Kohlegroßverbraucher wie Indien und China haben zuletzt die Kraftwerksöfen gedrosselt.

China schickt sich an, bei der Kohlepolitik sogar zum Vorbild zu werden: 1,3 Millionen Jobs sollen in dem Sektor in den kommenden Jahren laut der Regierung wegfallen. Neue Arbeitsplätze sollen dafür im Bereich der erneuerbaren Energien entstehen. Schon jetzt arbeiten rund 2,5 Millionen Menschen in der chinesischen Solarindustrie.

In Deutschland gehen Arbeitsplätze bei den Erneuerbaren verloren

In Deutschland verläuft die Entwicklung genau umgekehrt. 2015 waren rund 330.000 Menschen direkt oder indirekt durch den Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien beschäftigt. Die Zahl sank aber zuletzt deutlich.

Im Vergleich dazu sind die Beschäftigtenzahlen in der Kohleindustrie gering. Je nachdem auf welche Statistik man blickt, beschäftigt die Braunkohleindustrie in Deutschland direkt und indirekt zwischen 20.000 und 50.000 Menschen. Im Bereich der Steinkohle sind in Deutschland gerade einmal noch rund 7500 Menschen beschäftigt.

Sicher ist: Die Kohleenergie muss früher oder später ohnehin aus dem Energiemix verschwinden. Warum dann nicht mit dem Ausstieg jetzt schon beginnen und Angestellte langsam umschulen und in anderen Bereich unterbringen?

Deutsche sind mehrheitlich für Kohleausstieg

Merkels Zögern beim Kohleausstieg ist inzwischen sogar zu einem Hemmnis für die Energiewende an sich geworden, einst ein Vorzeigeprojekt Deutschlands: Es macht die Energiewende komplizierter und teurer als nötig.

Denn Kohlekraftwerke und vergleichsweise saubere Energielieferanten vertragen sich schlecht. Vereinfacht gesagt: Kohlekraftwerke produzieren kontinuierlich Strom. Das klingt erst einmal gut. Aber damit blockiert die Kohle die Netze für Wind- und Solarstrom, denn Kohlekraftwerke können die Produktion nur langsam drosseln.

Geeigneter um im Verbund mit Wind und Sonne Strom zu liefern sind dynamische Gaskraftwerke.

Die Folge: Solange viele Kohlekraftwerke am Netz sind, muss der Umbau des Energiesystems zu einer sauberen Versorgung gedrosselt werden. Deutschland verspielt damit die Chance wenigstens nach 2020 seine Klimaziele zu erreichen.

Und noch ein weiteres Argument der Kohlebefürworter zählt nicht: Der Preis. Inzwischen ist Strom aus Windrädern ähnlich günstig wie Strom aus Kohlekraftwerken. In den kommenden Jahren wird Windstrom sogar billiger als schmutziger Kohlestrom.

Ein Plan für den Ausstieg aus der Kohle ist also aus mehreren Gründen längst überfällig. Das findet auch eine Mehrheit der Deutschen. Nach einer Emnid-Umfrage für die “Bild am Sonntag” sind 59 Prozent der Deutschen dafür, dass die nächste Bundesregierung den Kohleausstieg beschließt, und 31 Prozent dagegen.

Eigentlich ist Angela Merkel bekannt dafür ihre Entscheidungen stark an Umfragen zu orientieren. Beim Kohleausstieg ist davon allerdings noch nichts zu merken.

FÉMINISME - ""Pourquoi [les femmes] n'accepteraient pas de gagner moins que leurs collègues (...) s'il est admis au plus haut niveau que 'le masculin l'emporte sur le féminin'?"" C'est avec cette interrogation à l'esprit que 314 enseignants et enseignantes ont signé une tribune sur le site d'information Slate, ce mardi 7 novembre.

Ils y déclarent ""avoir cessé ou nous apprêter à cesser d'enseigner la règle de grammaire résumée par la formule 'le masculin l'emporte sur le féminin'"", et appellent chacun à en faire autant, notamment les autres enseignants, les professionnels de la presse et de l'édition, les écrivains...

Pour ces signataires, la répétition de cette formule à l'école ""induit des représentations mentales qui conduisent femmes et hommes à accepter la domination d'un sexe sur l'autre"".

Elle est d'autant plus illégitime à leurs yeux qu'elle n'a été créée que récemment dans l'histoire de la langue française. ""Elle a été mise au point au XVIIe siècle"", rappellent ces enseignants, qui indiquent par ailleurs qu'elle a été par la suite généralisée pour des raisons ""politiques"".

Ils citent ainsi les défenseurs de cette réforme de la langue, qui assumaient de défendre un masculin ""plus noble"". ""Le masculin est réputé plus noble que le féminin à cause de la supériorité du mâle sur la femelle"", écrivait ainsi Beauzée dans sa ""Grammaire Générale"" publiée en 1767.

Pour certains grammairiens, au contraire, le masculin serait ""utilisé comme la marque du neutre"" en français. C'est ce qu'expliquait au moins d'octobre le grammairien Antoine Gautier, maître de conférence en langue française à l'université Paris-Sorbonne, dans le Figaro. Pour lui, c'est la formulation de la règle qui serait ""malheureuse"", et qui devrait être modifiée. ""Beaucoup de filles le prennent mal, et ça se comprend"", justifiait-il.

Des accords de proximité, de majorité ou au choix

Les signataires de la tribune proposent comme solution de revenir aux règles qui prévalaient alors à l'époque, héritées du latin. ""Nous déclarons enseigner la règle de proximité"", indiquent-ils par exemple,qui consiste à accorder les mots concernés avec le terme le plus proche. Ainsi, plutôt que d'écrire ""les maîtres et les maîtresses engagés"", il faudrait écrire ""les maîtres et les maîtresses engagées"".

D'autres solutions existent, indiquent-ils, comme un accord ""de majorité"" -s'il y a plus de femmes, on accorde au féminin- ou plus simplement un accord ""au choix"".

Cette prise de position intervient alors que l'écriture inclusive fait débat, depuis la publication du premier manuel scolaire à l'avoir adoptée. Ce mode d'écriture vise à féminiser d'avantage la grammaire, comme le recommandait en 2015 le Haut Conseil à l'Égalité entre les Hommes et les Femmes. Cela peut passer par l'intégration de la terminaison du féminin entre des points, quand c'est nécessaire. Par exemple, on pourrait écrire ""les maître.sse.s"", à la place de ""les maîtres et les maîtresses"".

Ces propositions avaient choqué les Immortels de l'Académie Française, qui avaient dénoncé à la fin du mois d'octobre un ""péril mortel"" pour la langue française.

Après avoir publié cette tribune, Slate a annoncé adopter également cette règle de l'accord de proximité. ""La rédaction va revenir à une règle plus juste issue du latin et appliquée en leurs temps par Corneille et Ronsard"", informe le site, qui dit défendre ""une langue plus inclusive, sans impact pour les plus conservateurs de nos internautes et bien plus équitable"".

Dans la foulée, le site Les Nouvelles News a indiqué à son tour adopter cette règle grammaticale.

1. Make a list

No, we're not talking about times when you've been naughty or nice. We're talking about a list of all the things you need to buy. In other words -- no impulse purchases for you!

""Don't do last minute Christmas shopping. It will end up being all impulse buys. Figure out what you need to buy now -- plan it out and set a budget,"" CEO and founder of JBS Financial Strategists, Jenny Brown, told HuffPost Australia.

""No matter what it is, whether it's Christmas or saving for a holiday, it all comes back to setting a budget and setting a goal to make sure you are going to hit it.""

2. Shop online

One of the great things about shopping online is it's so easy to shop around for the best price -- a practice Brown greatly encourages.

""If you know you are going to buy a certain article of clothing or present or whatever it's going to be, search around online,"" she said.

""It's amazing how much you can save. And if they deliver, have it delivered to your work so you save yourself the hassle of going to the post office to pick things up.""

3. Consider a Kris Kringle

If you have a large family, it's well worth considering having a Kris Kringle, whereby participants draw a name out of the hat and just buy a present for that single person.

The great thing about a Kris Kringle (or Secret Santa gift exchange) is that not only does it keep costs down, but it means people are more likely to receive what they actually want rather than a whole bunch of smaller items that will end up in the bottom of a drawer.

Big family? Try a Kris Kringle to cut down costs.

""If you have a situation where there are 13 members in a family, it just becomes ridiculous,"" Brown said.

""Have a Kris Kringle, set a budget and then buy for one family member or a couple or what have you.

""Alternatively, just buy for the kids. Often when you get to a certain age and Christmas comes around, you're thinking 'what else do I want?' Eliminating the adults and just focusing on the kids can be a great way to bring down costs.""

4. Don't use your credit card

This is probably going to be the toughest thing to do this Christmas, but you'll thank yourself next year when your bill isn't out of control.

""Be careful of the credit cards. Don't have the attitude of 'I'll deal with it in January', because then you have to pay it off, and how are you going to do that?"" asks Brown.

""If you aren't good with that kind of discipline, use cash only. Get out the amount you're going to spend and shop according to your list. Really plan out what you are going to spend it on.

""Another trick is to freeze your credit card in water in a plastic container. If you want to use it, you'll have to defrost it, which reduces the chance of you impulse buying.""

Home-made presents are thoughtful and kind to the bank balance.

5. Get crafty

Who's to say you have to spend a fortune on gifts? Why not embrace your inner hipster and plant some succulents or make some jam?

""That's actually one of the things we've done,"" Brown said. ""I've been growing home made veggies and making things like homemade chutneys and jams.

""It's a lovely thoughtful gift as well as bringing costs right down, especially if you do things like recycle your jars.""

6. Prepare for next year

If you want to put yourself in the best possible stead for Christmas 2018, it pays to start planning now.

""It's never too early to start,"" Brown said. ""Buy Christmas paper when it's on sale. You can often get really good deals in January. That goes for cards too.

""You may also want to set up some kind of direct debit system that helps you save for Christmas next year.

""If you start planning ahead, it really does pay off in the long run.""",How To Avoid Spending Too Much This Christmas,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/11/02/how-to-avoid-spending-too-much-this-christmas_a_23264195/

More than 2,560 people were rescued in the Mediterranean Sea over the weekend in one of the roughest missions so far this year, the International Organization for Migration said Tuesday. Thirty-four bodies were recovered from the water, 26 of them suspected to be teenagers from Nigeria. Most died while making the crossing toward Italy in rubber dinghies.

IOM believes the girls may have been ""murdered by traffickers in league with European sex merchants.""

Salvatore Malfi, the prefect of the Italian port city of Salerno, was skeptical of this theory but said it's too early to come to any conclusion about whether the girls were headed for prostitution. The girls traveled with other men in the dinghy, he said, which makes the theory less likely.

""The sex trafficking routes are different,"" he said. ""Loading women onto a boat is too risky, the traffickers would not do it as they could lose all their 'goods' ― as they describe them ― in one fell swoop.""

Italian authorities told CNN that they launched an investigation into the girls' deaths Tuesday, carrying out autopsies to determine whether they had been victims of sexual abuse or torture. They were all between 14 and 18 years old, said Salerno police chief Lorena Ciccotti.",Bodies Of 26 Female Teenage Migrants Found In The Mediterranean,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/07/bodies-of-26-female-teenage-migrants-found-in-the-mediterranean_a_23269987/

Auch für diese Acts hat Bohlen bereits Musik produziert.

Hier gibt es die größten Hits von Dieter Bohlen und Modern Talking im Stream, als Download und auf CD

Andrea Berg

Seit dem 2010 erschienenen Album ""Schwerelos"" komponierte und produzierte Bohlen zahlreiche Lieder für die deutsche Schlagersängerin Andrea Berg (51). Von der Zusammenarbeit mit dem Mastermind war Berg zunächst allerdings nicht wirklich überzeugt. Ihre Plattenfirma war damals die treibende Kraft. Doch Bohlen konnte sie schnell überzeugen, wie Berg im Interview mit ""hitparade.ch"" erklärte - mit dem Song ""Ich liebe Dich"". ""Wer so einen Song komponieren kann und solche Texte schreibt, der hat genau die Emotionalität, die ich brauche"", lautete ihr Fazit.

Roy Black

Die deutsche Schlagerlegende Roy Black (1943-1991) arbeitete ebenfalls mit Dieter Bohlen zusammen - wenn auch nur für relativ kurze Zeit. ""Rosenzeit"", das letzte Album vor dem unerwarteten Tod Gerhard Höllerichs, so sein bürgerlicher Name, wurde von Bohlen produziert. Auf dem Longplayer sind unter anderem die Songs ""Ich träume mich zu dir"", ""Was soll ich ohne dich oben im Himmel"" und ""Frag' Maria"" enthalten.

Bonnie Tyler

Auch an mehreren Alben und Singles der Pop- und Rockröhre Bonnie Tyler (66) arbeitete Bohlen Anfang der 1990er Jahre mit, darunter an den Alben ""Bitterblue"", ""Angel Heart"" und ""Silhouette in Red"". Aus dieser Zusammenarbeit stammen unter anderem die Hits ""Call me"" und ""Fools Lullaby"".

Nino de Angelo

Der deutsch-italienische Schlagerstar Nino de Angelo (53) bezeichnete Bohlen erst kürzlich in einem Gespräch mit der ""Bild""-Zeitung als ""alten Freund"". Die beiden arbeiteten 1989 zusammen an einigen Songs, darunter auch an ""Flieger"", mit dem de Angelo und Bohlen im gleichen Jahr den 14. Platz beim Eurovision Song Contest einheimsen konnten. Vielleicht gibt es bald zudem einen neuen gemeinsamen Hit der beiden. Dem Blatt verriet de Angelo über Bohlen auch: ""Er liebt meine Stimme. Wir wollen wieder etwas machen.""

Howard Carpendale

Zwar wurde Howard Carpendale (71) vor einigen Jahren von einem Sportreporter mit Dieter Bohlen verwechselt, eine erneute Zusammenarbeit der beiden, wie an den Songs ""Here I go again"" und ""Sag ihm, dass du gehst"", ist allerdings eher unwahrscheinlich. 2009 zog Carpendale ganz schön über Bohlen her - zumindest über dessen Fähigkeiten als Texter. Im Gespräch mit der Münchner ""Abendzeitung"" erzählte er damals: ""Dieter Bohlen zum Beispiel schreibt englische Texte, die unvorstellbar sind, die sind grammatikalisch falsch, alles daran ist falsch! Die DJs sollten schon ein bisschen kritischer sein.""

Roger Whittaker

Zu den musikalischen Komplizen Bohlens zählt auch der britische Liedermacher und Sänger Roger Whittaker (81), der Mitte der 1990er Jahre mehrere Songs mit dem Musikproduzenten aufnahm, die auf dem Album ""Ein schöner Tag mit Dir"" erschienen sind. Dazu zählen das gleichnamige Duett mit Aylin, ""Samstag nachts"" und ""Hello Lady"".

Yvonne Catterfeld

Nicht die letzte im Bohlen-Bunde ist Yvonne Catterfeld (37). Für die Schauspielerin und Sängerin produzierte er unter anderem das Lied ""Für dich"", von ihrem Debütalbum ""Meine Welt"" aus dem Jahr 2003 und ""Du hast mein Herz gebrochen"", für dessen Songtext unter anderem auch der Rapper Eko Fresh (34) mitverantwortlich ist. Die Songs wurden zu Catterfelds beiden ersten Nummer-eins-Hits und konnten sich jeweils für mehrere Monate in den Charts halten.",Diese sieben Künstler verdanken Dieter Bohlen ihre Hits,http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2017/11/08/diese-sieben-kunstler-verdanken-dieter-bohlen-ihre-hits_n_18500720.html

Strong winds and the remnants of Hurricane Ophelia helped send a staggering 1.7 million megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity to the National Grid.

Put another way, for 28 days wind power provided enough energy to power every home in Scotland. For 15 of those days it was actually producing enough energy to power the entire country’s electricity needs. The figures have been published by WWF Scotland using data collected by WeatherEnergy. On the 2 October, wind turbines generated enough power for 7.116 million homes, that’s nearly three times the number of homes in Scotland. WWF Scotland’s Director Sam Gardner said: “We’re blown away by these figures but they are part of a pattern of increasingly green power production made possible thanks to many years of political support in Scotland. Across the year, renewables now contribute over half of our electricity needs.”

While these figures are undeniably impressive, there remains the issue of actually making sure that all of this energy is then distributed or stored until it’s needed. One of the key problems with wind turbines is that you cannot simply ‘turn on’ the wind when you need it. Instead excess energy from wind turbines will either need to be distributed out beyond Scotland or stored until such time as it’s needed.

While Elon Musk’s Tesla are already working on their own vast electricity storage solution in Australia, the Scottish government is currently trialling a project called Batwind. This 1Mwh battery system is being developed by Norwegian energy company Statoil and will store excess energy produced by Hywind - The world’s first floating wind farm off the coast of Scotland.

BHOPAL – A 19-year-old college student was on the way back from her coaching class when she was kidnapped by four youths, dragged to a desolate spot near a railway track close to Habibganj station, and raped for hours.

The woman is pursuing her graduation and preparing for the civil services exam.

The youths escaped, leaving the injured girl in the bushes near the railway track, close to Railway Protection Force (RPF) police station. The survivor somehow managed to drag herself to the police station and informed her parents, both of whom are police personnel.

Still, none of the two police stations — MP Nagar and Habibganj — both in the heart of New Bhopal, registered an FIR, passing the buck, saying that the area of the crime did not fall under their jurisdiction.

Finally, the railway police registered a case. SP Anita Malviya told media persons that the young woman was gang-raped by four youths – Golu Chadhar, Amar, Rajesh and Ramesh. She said that the accused have been arrested. Times of India reported that the man identified as Golu — Golu Bihari Chadhar — is out on bail after being charged with murder of his infant daughter.

The alleged rapists took gutkha, cigarette and tea breaks between the horrific assault, the TOI report said.

The ordeal didn't end even after her ordeal. According to reports, at the Habibganj GRP, an officer allegedly accused the victim of ""making up a filmy story"".

The incident had occurred on late Tuesday night, and throughout Wednesday, the traumatized family had tried to get an FIR registered, until railway police took action.

The Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) of Bhopal has ordered a probe into the incident of negligence in conducting their civic duty and SI RN Tekam of MP Nagar police station has been suspended.

The incident has led to shock in the state capital. The MP Human Rights Commission has sought a report from Bhopal police. The Opposition has targeted the state government for poor law-and-order. Minister for Women and Child Development, Archana Chitnis, has said that it was shameful and for such horrific cases the culprits need to be given death penalty.

Weshalb das so ist und was uns in den nächsten Jahren erwartet, erklärt Jan Schenk im Video oben

Es wird früher dunkel und die Temperaturen sinken. Langsam aber sicher wird es Winter. Am Wochenende könnte in den niederen Lagen in Deutschland der erste Schnee fallen. Schon prophezeien einige Wetterforscher den kältesten Winter aller Zeiten. Das ist zwar schwierig vorauszusagen - einen Ausblick auf den Winter 2017 kann man aber trotzdem wagen.

Die letzten Winter in Deutschland waren langweilig. Nie wurde es richtig kalt und Schnee gab es so gut wie keinen. Selbst in den Alpen musste man teilweise lange auf Schnee warten.

Eiskalte Schneewinter erst ab 2021

Der Hauptantrieb des Klimas auf der Erde schwächelt gewaltig: Die Sonnenaktivität ist so schwach, wie seit über 100 Jahren nicht mehr. Der aktuelle Sonnenzyklus nähert sich somit seinem Minimum. Daher steigt die Gefahr eines kalten Winters deutlich.

Aber man muss auch sagen, dass die wirklichen eiskalten Schneewinter erst ab 2021, also nach dem nächsten Maximum zu erwarten sind.

Dementsprechend wird dieser Winter temperaturmäßig durchschnittlich. Also nicht zu kalt, aber auch nicht zu warm, wie die letzten Jahre. Die Chance auf Regen ist aber höher als normal und damit wird es mehr schneien.

Da die letzten Winter insgesamt zu warm und schneearm waren, kann man zusammenfassend sagen, dass wir in Deutschland den kältesten und schneereichsten Winter seit mindestens fünf Jahren erwarten.

The pop-up exhibit was located around the corner from Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue and lasted several days.","In this time of darkness, largely caused by a Donald Trump–shaped shadow, flickers of light are important. If only we knew where to find them.

It’s been a year since the momentous 2016 election and the anointing of a new White House resident. We figured it’s as good a time as ever to revisit the slew of anti-Trump art that’s cropped up in New York City, giving those who didn’t vote for our current president a dose of solidarity. What follows here is a guide for the angry-but-still-adventurous in NYC who are willing to trek through the city’s boroughs for an in-person glimpse at protest art.

If you’re a disgruntled tourist visiting the city temporarily, you can avoid the pricey traps and the conventional stroll past Trump Tower, and enjoy these varied works of art instead. And if you’re a New Yorker, these attractions are practically on your doorstep. You could fit in a therapeutic stop at Washington Square Park on your lunch break.

Most important, this list is a work in progress. We plan on updating the guide as new works arrive, and we’ll rely on you, dear readers, to help us make sure this list is comprehensive. (If you create anti-Trump art, please let us know.) At the end of the day, these works might not last forever, but hopefully they’ll be a useful reminder to you that neither will Trump’s presidency.

Current Locations

1. The clock counting down Trump’s remaining hours in office

Colombina Valera

Location: Barney’s Long Island City studio on the Queens waterfront.

Artist: A group of artists, many of whom are anonymous, that includes Brandon Stosuy, Matthew Barney, Jade Archuleta-Gans, Jane Lea and Kenzan Tsutakawa-Chinn. “We see it as a civic project, like the national debt clock, and not a personal project, so we don’t want to attach specific names to it at this point,” Stosuy said in an email to HuffPost.

How long will the work be on view? The clock will cease to exist when Trump is no longer president.

How far away is this from Trump Tower? About 20 minutes by subway.





2. The boxing gym with a symbolic target

Overthrow Boxing Club

Location: 256 Grand Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. (The company is looking to expand to other cities.)

Artist: John Gagliano created the artwork for Overthrow, where you can actually book boxing classes and work out. The image on the left shows a garage door at Overthrow, while the center photo features the gym’s punching bags. The image on the right will be on forthcoming merchandise.

“Originally, when Trump was just running for office, the image seemed like a funny play on a guy that had no chance of winning the presidency,” owner Joey Goodwin told HuffPost over email. “The morning after the election, I can remember feeling an incredible sense of sadness. Like, what the hell just happened? This guy has no business being the leader of the free world. The image has now become a serious rallying cry for Overthrow and what we stand for. Our values simply do not align with the current administration.”

How long will the work be on view? Indefinitely.

How far away is this from Trump Tower? About 40 minutes by subway.





3. The Brooklyn street art expressing a very familiar feeling

Adam Fujita

Location: Near the Jefferson L train station in Bushwick, Brooklyn.

Artist: Adam Kiyoshi Fujita and Annica Lydenberg. “We’re completely exhausted by the incompetency in Washington and it’s a top-down problem,” Fujita told HuffPost over the phone. ”We definitely had a direct agenda to address [Trump] and to address the administration.” Fujita has created other murals across the Bushwick area that similarly respond to the election. You can see more of his work on Instagram.

How long will the work be on view? Unclear. In the past, Fujita’s works in the same location have lasted a few weeks to a few months. But he said that given the response to his work, he’ll probably leave this one up longer.

How far away is this from Trump Tower? About 45 minutes by subway.





4. Ai Weiwei’s commentary on being a good neighbor

Spencer Platt via Getty Images

Location: Underneath the arch at Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. More of the artist’s “fences” can be visited across the city.

Artist: Ai Weiwei created the arch, a part of his “Good Fences Make Good Neighbors” project. When asked whether or not the project is a direct reference to Trump’s border wall advocacy, the director and chief curator of Public Art Fund, Nicholas Baume, told HuffPost that “Ai Weiwei’s work is extraordinarily timely, but it’s not reducible to a single political gesture.” So while the arch might not be strictly anti-Trump art, it will likely function as such for the many Americans who have a fixed idea of what “fences” mean.

How long will the work be on view? Until Feb. 11, 2018.

How far away is this from Trump Tower? About 20 minutes by subway.





5. The inspirational messages hidden among Manhattan tourist traps

Maria Baranova-Suzuki

Location: In many spots around Times Square in Manhattan. (You can view a map of the project’s locations here.)

Artist: Artist group House of Trees, along with artists Anne Carson, Carrie Mae Weems and Wangechi Mutu are a part of “Word on the Street.” The project “began around the time of the Women’s March this past January,” House of Trees members Jennifer and Amy Khoshbin explained in a statement to HuffPost. “We wanted to encourage others, specifically females, to feel empowered with a platform for open dialogue regarding many ongoing issues happening in our country.”

The duo elaborated:

Working within a sibling-run arts collective House of Trees, Amy Khoshbin asked writer Anne Carson to respond to the tumultuous political landscape with her text. In our image-obsessed culture, in which language is relegated to mostly passive, 140 character blasts, we wanted to focus on text responses with something substantive and powerful. We are using Times Square advertising space to promote the language and imagery of the resistance movement ― a huge undertaking in Times Square, the international hub for glowing ad space. This fall, House of Trees is not only working with Anne Carson & Amy Khoshbin, but also with two of the most influential contemporary Black female artists, Carrie Mae Weems and Wangechi Mutu. In the wake of a wave of white nationalism, we hope having their empowering messages in such a public forum will play a role in the possibilities of changing culture. House of Trees has employed female refugees in Texas to fabricate the original felt banners ― the objects of resistance. We value these women, their hard work, their importance in our country, and we want to help support these female refugees and their families in an increasingly hostile cultural landscape.

How long will the work be on view? Until February 2018. The group has plans to create art for other areas, too.

How far away is this from Trump Tower? About 15 minutes by subway.





6. The Brooklyn mural depicting the man “behind” Trump

Spencer Platt via Getty Images

Location: Outside a bar called The Levee in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

Artist: Damien Mitchell created “The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,” which he debuted in February. “It’s meant as a reflection of the news cycle that we’ve been hearing for the last couple of weeks,” Mitchell told amNewYork at the time.

How long will the work be on view? It’s unclear, but Mitchell has made two other murals for the location in the past. This, too, might eventually be rotated out.

How far away is this from Trump Tower? About 40 minutes by subway.





7. The Queens mural with a reminder about immigration

Vincent Versace

Location: Welling Court Mural Project in Astoria, Queens.

Artist: Joaquin Avila, who has been living in the United States for about two years and originally hails from Cuba. Much of his work focuses on social issues.

“This mural represents strength and power in unity,” Avila explained through a translator to HuffPost. “America is great with us, with immigrants. My message is a very real one of struggling immigrants who feel trapped by the oppressive tendencies of our leaders. I wanted to take Donald Trump’s message and play with it, change the context.”

“I used maps, colors, words, and the Captain America symbol [to] try and get at the heart of the public by using characters they already recognize but in a different way, to awaken their conscience,” Avila added. “I want to highlight how fantastic and magnificent this country is when our different cultures are united.”

How long will the work be on view? Until June 2018.

How far away is this from Trump Tower? About 40 minutes by subway.





8. Ron English’s Trumpty Dumpty

Barcroft Media via Getty Images

Location: Near the Jefferson L train station in Bushwick, Brooklyn. It happens to be across the street from the “Everything is Not OK” piece.

Artist: Ron English, who’s done other Trump work that can be seen on his website.

How long will the work be on view? It’s unclear how long it will last, given its high vantage point above the street. That said, the piece has already been slightly affected by what appears to be white paint.

How far away is this from Trump Tower? About 45 minutes by subway.



9. Molly Crabapple’s mural monster

Molly Crabapple

Location: Welling Court Mural Project in Astoria, Queens.

When will it disappear? Unclear.

How far away is this from Trump Tower? About 40 minutes by subway.

Past Pieces



Kara Walker’s “Christ’s Entry into Journalism”

Kara Walker / Sikkema Jenkins Co New York

Kara Walker had a show earlier this year at Sikkema Jenkins & Co that New York Magazine’s art critic Jerry Saltz called “the best art made about this country in this century.”

One of the featured works on view was “Christ’s Entry into Journalism,” which depicts nearly 100 different figures representing various parts of American history. In the bottom left corner Walker placed a Black Panther-esque character giving the Black Power salute while holding the severed head of Trump. On the president’s forehead appears a swastika. Although not on display in a public location, Walker also notably contributed a drawing to The New Yorker, which reimagined the famous painting of George Washington’s crossing of the Delaware with Trump as Washington.

David Datuna installed this 10-foot ice sculpture in Union Square on June 8. It melted within hours and was designed as a response to Trump’s claims that he would pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement.

This very subtle piece by Hanksy

Hanksy created this image, which ended up getting painted over in January after a complaint from the city. Here’s a retrospective statement the artist posted on Instagram recently:

Dump Trump 2015. Better or worse, I’ll be known for this piece of crap for quite some time. I painted it long before the current tire fire that is the Trump administration. It made headlines, appeared on bootleg merch from Canal St to Los Angeles and was replicated countless times at protests across the country. Simple or otherwise, people connect to imagery. It was a cartoon piece of shit because Trump’s a human piece of shit. Straightforward w/o being overtly graphic. My friends and I toured the country with it. Some flew, many drove. We went to the early primaries and called it #DumpAcrossAmerica. I was so ready for him to lose. For him and his human slug family to slither into the shadows of shame. But he didn’t and here we are. Looking back, it’s partly responsible for my current mindset. There’s a reason people voted for him and there’s a reason he was elected.

Mexican artist Bosco Sodi titled this work “Muro.” It lasted for one day in Washington Square Park on Sept. 7. The wall was over six feet tall and eight feet long, made of clay timbers made by Sodi in his Mexico studio.

This statue by Indecline, titled “The Emperor Has No Balls,” was briefly installed near a Union Square subway station, while identical counterparts graced other cities. It appeared in NYC in August 2016, before the election.

This 15-foot-tall rat appeared right outside Trump’s Fifth Avenue apartment in Trump Tower on Aug. 14, a day the president was scheduled to visit his former home. The married BravinLee art gallery owners, John Lee and Karin Bravin, created the piece and ended up bringing it to Washington, D.C.

The messages beamed on Trump’s hotel

On Aug. 7, artist and activist Robin Bell projected various anti-Trump messages on the Trump Soho Hotel. The projections called to question Trump’s ties to Russia and President Vladimir Putin.

“Last night was a very sight specific projection on the Trump Soho because this is where we believe that some of the money that was laundered via the Russian government [was invested] and where some of the investors of that hotel came from,” Bell told artnet News.

Trevor Noah and correspondents from “The Daily Show” debuted “The Donald J. Trump Presidential Twitter Library” in June. The pop-up exhibit was located around the corner from Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue and lasted several days.

The project included various statues, electronic displays, altered portraits and other multimedia material you’d expect from a museum, as well as some you wouldn’t. “You can sit on a gold shitter!” “Daily Show” correspondent Jordan Klepper told HuffPost at the event.

Grünen-Chef Özdemir gab eine vormals ausgerufene Koalitionsbedingung auf

Die Grünen bestehen nicht mehr auf dem Ende des Verbrennungsmotors bis 2030

Es war ein kleiner Kreis, den Kanzlerin Angela Merkel am Montagabend zu sich ins Kanzleramt geladen hatte. Der CSU-Vorsitzende Horst Seehofer, das Grünen-Spitzenduo Katrin Göring-Eckardt und Cem Özdemir sowie FDP-Chef Christian Lindner und FDP-Vize Wolfgang Kubicki kamen zusammen, um die Schwerpunkte der weiteren Sondierunsgespräche festzulegen.

""Am Donnerstag, dem 16. November, wollen wir fertig sein mit allem. Und da steht noch viel Arbeit an"", erklärte Merkel bei Facebook am Tag des Chef-Treffens.

► Bei einem zentralen Thema könnte ein Großteil der Arbeit derweil bereits getan sein. Denn in der Frage um die Zukunft der Automobilindustrie gibt es Annäherungen.

""Mir ist klar, dass wir das nicht durchsetzen können""

Die Grünen kommen den Jamaika-Unterhändlern von Union und FDP im Tauziehen um die Klimapolitik in einen wichtigen Punkt entgegen. Sie beharren nicht länger darauf, bei einer Koalitionsvereinbarung das Ende des Verbrennungsmotors im Jahr 2030 festzuschreiben.

""Mir ist klar, dass wir alleine nicht das Enddatum 2030 für die Zulassung von fossilen Verbrennungsmotoren durchsetzen werden können"", sagte Parteichef Cem Özdemir der ""Stuttgarter Zeitung"". Statt des konkreten Datums für den Ausstieg verlangt die Umweltpartei nur noch ""ein klares Bekenntnis, dass wir alles dafür tun, um die Fahrzeuge der Zukunft - vernetzt, automatisiert und emissionsfrei - zu bekommen"".

Noch im August hatte Özdemir das Aus des Verbrenners zur Koalitionsbedingung ausgerufen.

► Probleme sieht Özdemir indes weiter beim Thema Asyl: ""Für eine bessere Integration müssen wir die Familienzusammenführung wieder ermöglichen"", sagte der Grünen-Chef in der ""Stuttgarter Zeitung"".

Hofreiter weiß, dass Kompromisse nötig sind

Der schleswig-holsteinische Ministerpräsident Daniel Günther (CDU) deutete beim Thema Familiennachzug zuletzt Kompromissbereitschaft an. Dagegen machte CSU-Vize Christian Schmidt in der ""Passauer Neuen Presse"" klar, dass seine Partei in dieser Frage nicht gesprächsbereit sei.

► Özdemirs Parteikollege Anton Hofreiter hatte am Montag nach einer Fraktionssitzung ebenfalls angedeutet, zu Zugeständnissen auf mehreren Gebieten bereit zu sein.

Den Grünen sei bewusst, dass die FDP ein Ergebnis beim Thema Steuererleichterungen brauche. Die Union brauche etwas ""in Richtung Planbarkeit, Steuerbarkeit und Ordnung der Flüchtlingsfrage"".

Die Grünen erwarteten nun auch Kompromisse in Richtung Humanität, legale Fluchtwege, bei der sozialen Gerechtigkeit – und beim Klima.

Dass es ausgerechnet beim grünen Herz-Thema nicht die Brechstange sein muss, wie Özdemir jetzt andeutete, macht Hoffnung, dass es mit der Koalition tatsächlich klappt. Vielleicht sogar noch in diesem Jahr.

When onion prices were going through the roof in 2013, Congress leader and at that time Delhi chief minister, Sheila Dikshit, had lamented that she too was having bhindi without onions.

""After weeks I ate onions today with bhindi,"" said Dikshit in a ham-handed attempt to feel the pain of the aam aadmi. Onion prices had hit Rs 100 a kilo by then. BJP leader Vijay Jolly, unimpressed by Dikshit's onion tears, presented her with a basket of onions as a Diwali gift. ""The government has failed miserably on all fronts because of which people are suffering,"" he said.

On the anniversary of demonetisation, his senior colleague Arun Jaitley did not even have onion tears to offer.

He defended demonetisation as ""morally and ethically correct"". ""What is morally correct and ethically correct has to be politically correct,"" the Finance Minister said.

He dismissed stories of suffering saying the system had been flooded with new notes ""almost instantaneously and so pick-up of trade began thereafter."" That is a brazen rewriting of history. The government has consistently tried to pretend that the only people who suffered after the famous surgical strike of demonetisation were the rich and the corrupt who had wads of stash stuffed in their walls. That 99% of currency notes returned to the system proved that was not the case.

The government is being willfully blind if it chooses not to see them. You did not have to go far to see the suffering.

A survey across 21 states conducted between December 2016 and January 2017 by the NGO Act Now for Harmony and Democracy found 55.9% were afraid to keep money at home. And 55.4% did not believe that demonetisation could eradicate black money, the government's moral high claim. Only 20 percent thought that demonetisation would benefit the common man.

Statistics are dull and deadening. But stories of suffering from the poor and vulnerable were plentiful after demonetisation. The government is being willfully blind if it chooses not to see them. You did not have to go far to see the suffering. An article in Mint showed the ripple effect of that surgical strike.

Sunil Jadhav worked in a factory that made plastic sheets to stop water percolation from farm ponds. The water is used for rabi crops such as onions. This was the time when farmers having sold their kharif crops had cash on hand and invested in the farm ponds. But last year, stuck with scrapped notes, they had to postpone farm pond construction. Jadhav who earned Rs 250 a day was laid off. Hundreds of landless labourers who would have been hired to construct the ponds found no jobs. The onion crop suffered without enough farm ponds for irrigation. That meant labourers involved in harvesting and transporting the onions suffered as well. A small shopkeeper in that same village sells batteries to farmers. Farmers clamp those batteries on their forehead to work the fields at night in that season when they irrigate the farms. Last year they needed far less. His sales were down 60%.

Is this what the Prime Minister meant when he said ""there may be temporary hardships to be faced by honest citizens""?

Elderly people living alone at home struggled to meet basic expenses and pay their help. It's not like the government came forward to help them access new cash.

""The urban organised sector (India) fails to notice this ripple effect on the informal sector (Bharat)"" writes Milind Murugkar in Mint. ""The impact on the organized sector creates a visible effect. The suffering of Bharat is diffused, invisible, but hugely more painful.""

That Narendra Modi was able to persuade the poor that the rich were suffering even more is a different matter. That was not true but such is the power of oratory. It does not make it morally or ethically correct however.

Let us not forget that people died as a result of the stress of demonetization. ""We have been saying for a long time that over 100 people have died because of demonetization,"" said Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad. ""But the government refused to pay tribute to the deceased."" Others pointed out that in a country like India, 3,700 people can die in one month just from snakebite.

We can quibble about the exact dotted line between demonetisation and cause of death but deaths did happen. Saud ur-Rahman, a 48-year-old poster designer in Delhi had a massive heart attack after spending three days in long queues for cash. Razia, a construction worker in Delhi, with hungry children at home, set herself ablaze after failing to exchange currency notes for five days. A woman in Telengana committed suicide afraid she would lose the money the family had just made from selling agricultural land, money that was needed for her husband's treatment. A bank cashier committed suicide unable to take work pressure.

The Hindustan Times put out a famous picture of an 80-year-old man, retired from the Indian Army, weeping inside a bank in Gurgaon, after trying for four days to get some money.

Elderly people living alone at home struggled to meet basic expenses and pay their help. It's not like the government came forward to help them access new cash. Anne Bangera, 71 and arthritic told Firstpost that standing in queues was particularly painful. ""For the old and weak demonetization was very difficult as it left us helpless,"" she said.

At that same time, Karnataka mining baron and BJP MP Janardhana Reddy supposedly spent Rs 500 crore on his daughter's wedding. That shows an entirely different kind of moral compass.

Narendra Modi acknowledged the suffering of the common people but likened it to a mahayagna or a great sacrifice to purge black money thus giving the whole enterprise an almost hallowed feel. It certainly worked in the ruling party's favour in the elections in Uttar Pradesh. But that does make the implementation of demonetisation, whatever its aims, morally correct. Nor did the difficulties last only 50 days or so as the Prime Minister had promised.

It is true as Jaitley reminded us that the Congress of UPA-2 was riddled with corruption and scams. That makes it hypocritical for it to talk of ""loot"" now. But the sorry record of his own party on corruption does not mean Manmohan Singh is wrong when he says the biggest victims of the way demonetization and then GST were implemented are the poor and marginalized, farmers, traders, small and medium businesses. The mahayagna was conducted on their backs.

Of the Rs 15.44 lakh notes withdrawn from circulation, Rs 15.28 lakh crore were back in the system by June 30 this year. Black money had been washed white in the ""watershed moment in the history of the Indian economy.""

Had that old man in that bank in Gurgaon wept in vain? Did his tears matter at all?

Some of the rating agencies may not wait for the outcome of the ANC conference.
But the longer-term outlook will be governed by the outcome of the ANC conference and will be highly significant for future growth and employment prospects.","Where does the economy fit into the latest political ructions in South Africa? The GDP in South Africa today is not only the 'Gross Domestic Product', but also 'Gross Domestic Politics' -- two sides of the same coin!

Because we are in uncharted political waters, with no apparent rules to the game, any assessment, economic or otherwise, is hazardous. Yet there is a great deal at stake.

What is apparent, is that the integrity of governance in South Africa has been increasingly undermined by a series of calamities, ranging from a faction-driven ANC elective conference coming up, to wide-scale corruption, state capture, a weak economy, and botched Cabinet leadership on certain key issues. The Gupta scandal has now even reached British banks.

These problems cut deep into effective policy decision-making at various levels, including economic policy, as well as damaging the image of South Africa abroad.

This increasing lack of direction could not have come at a more inopportune time, given other daunting policy challenges in South Africa. To begin with, whoever takes over the ANC leadership next month will need some fairly big spades to clean out its Augean stables.

South Africa's public finances are also vulnerable, and investor confidence is fragile –– thanks to ongoing political and policy uncertainty, as regularly reflected in the Policy Uncertainty Index produced by North-West University's School of Business and Governance.

It is worrying for private-sector decision-makers, for example, when the new Energy Minister, David Mahlobo, says the numbers given by the Treasury in the recent medium-term budget-policy speech (MTBPS) were ""speculation"", and that there was now finality regarding the nuclear build.

Minister of Finances Malusi Gigaba and President Jacob Zuma.

But what might the forthcoming ANC conference mean for the economy? In itself, there is no serious economic content, so in that area at least, the conference is likely to remain surprise-free. When business and the markets assess current politics in South Africa, it should already be evident that the elective conference has little to do with economics, but everything to do with politics, patronage and power.

After all, the seven candidates come from the same party and are broadly driven by the same ANC policy documents. There is little to chose between them in terms of the substance in overall socio-economic policy.

No candidate is going to rattle the ANC's political base on economic policy. Socioeconomic transformation, inclusive growth, poverty alleviation, land reform and reducing inequality are among the matters that remain both on the ANC's and on the national agenda. Whichever jockey is backed, it remains the same horse.

The crucial political choices, therefore, lie around the issues of combating corruption, eliminating state capture, enhancing accountability and generally promising good governance. These factors are, of course, also significant in our economic environment.

But what matters now is the level of confidence the various candidates project of their ability to remedy the overall situation and to change South Africa's moral compass for the better. It is the quality of leadership that is now paramount.

These are the dominant themes in our body politic, which for the present inevitably trump the purely economic issues. The economic challenges will clearly reassert themselves once the outcome of the ANC conference is known in late December, either as collateral benefits or as collateral damage.

After a new ANC leader is elected, the risks or opportunities for the South African economy will therefore flow from (a) who has won the ANC leadership (b) what the new ""slate"" or team looks like and (c) the size of the majority. It is important that there should be a decisive majority or mandate for whoever wins.

Factionalism in the ANC requires a clear victory, assuming that the results are accepted. A slim 51 percent majority amid present political tensions is in any case likely to aggravate divisiveness and encourage legal challenges, and not reduce policy uncertainty.

The South African economy is presently in a bad place and t he government has regrettably failed to promote growth.

And it is true that markets and business can live with weak policies that are certain, so that they can adapt their business decisions accordingly. What has inhibited business decision-making in South Africa is prolonged policy uncertainty, which has already exacted its economic price.

What about the credit-rating agencies? Some of the rating agencies may not wait for the outcome of the ANC conference. On the basis of the fiscal slippage in the MTBPS and the prospects for the main Budget in February, certain agencies may decide to downgrade South Africa further before the end of the year. It is not yet clear which way they will jump, although the omens from Moody's, for example, are not good.

For South Africa the goal must, of course, not be the narrow one of placating rating agencies, but rather to be seen to have forged leadership which implements the ""right"" policies –– to turn the economy around in ways that also earn the support of the agencies.

That nonetheless means that any new ANC leadership must inspire confidence and have credibility, if investment sentiment about South Africa is to improve. For, as Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba outlined in his MTBPS, the macroeconomic picture is not good and continues to haunt us.

The South African economy is presently in a bad place. Economic growth is expected to be about 0.7 percent this year, rising to about 1.2 percent in 2018; unemployment remains unacceptably high; our public finances have taken a bad knock; and the National Treasury faces the dilemma of wanting to avoid a ""debt trap"" while simultaneously trying to escape a ""low-growth trap"".

The government has regrettably failed to promote growth. Professor Gavin Keeton of Rhodes University recently highlighted the irony of Thabo Mbeki's previous so-called ""failed"" –– but more business-friendly –– policies being replaced a decade ago by a strong emphasis on greater government intervention.

It was said then that this would promote faster growth and more rapid job creation. Instead, the changed approach has unfortunately not delivered results.

Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba addresses the media before his Medium-term budget speech in Parliament on October 25, 2017.

That said, the present deteriorating socioeconomic realities will still confront a new ANC leader after December and will need to be energetically tackled. In the Budget in February 2018, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba will have to decide –– if government spending cannot be further controlled –– what options are open to him to increase taxation.

The risk that South Africa will drift into a negative ""tax-and-spend"" cycle, unless we can get the economy on to a much higher growth path, is high. The 2018/19 Budget will require particularly careful political and economic handling, especially with the 2019 general election a year closer. Both internally and externally, South Africa's economic performance and prospects will be more critically assessed by various stakeholders more than ever before.

For the time being, political and policy uncertainty thus remains the ""new normal"" in South Africa. Business has apparently developed coping strategies to manage and deal with the situation, so as to keep the economy ticking over. But the longer-term outlook will be governed by the outcome of the ANC conference and will be highly significant for future growth and employment prospects.

Hence the fact that, against all precedent, Standard Bank has nailed its colours to the mast by backing Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa against Ms Dlamini-Zuma, shows how deeply worried major corporations are about the ANC elective conference. It is a high-risk stance for the bank to take, in a business constituency that normally eschews party politics.

The markets and business will therefore generally be looking to see whether the ANC selects a new leader who can take the big policy decisions, will implement structural reform, and bring unity of purpose to the top of government.

All the upheaval and uncertainty around the ANC's elective process may no doubt in retrospect be deemed worthwhile if the new leadership that emerges can indeed move South Africa towards a bigger, stronger and better economy.

Sie ist 30 Jahre alt, hat Eventmanagement studiert und liebt es, zu reisen. In ihrem Studiengang galt sie als eine der Jahrgangsbesten. Eine US-amerikanische Stiftung veröffentlichte sogar ihre Dissertation. Für ihre Arbeit an der Universität verlieh man ihr eine Auszeichnung.

Und trotzdem: Über ein Jahrzehnt lang bewarb sich Shani Dhanda auf mehr als 100 freie Stellenausschreibungen - ohne jemals eine Antwort zu bekommen, berichtet die 30-Jährige in der britischen HuffPost.

Im Video oben: Shanis Geschichte ist kein Einzelfall

Schuld daran war ein Detail in ihrer Bewerbung.

Shani ist 95 Zentimeter groß und hat die sogenannte Glasknochenkrankheit.

""Ich dachte, ich würde niemals einen Job bekommen - und dass, obwohl ich unbedingt einen Beitrag zur Gesellschaft leisten wollte. Die Aussicht, vielleicht niemals arbeiten zu können, machte mich wirklich traurig”, klagt sie.

Bereits in der Schule gab man Shani mehr als fragwürdige Karrieretipps: “Mir wurde gesagt, dass ich versuchen sollte, einen Job in der örtlichen Gemeinde zu ergattern. Dort gäbe es eine jährliche Quote für Menschen mit Behinderungen.”

Behandelt wie Menschen zweiter Klasse

Shani empfand das als extrem beleidigend: “Ich wurde nicht an meinen Fähigkeiten oder Interessen gemessen. Andere sahen mich nur als eine Person mit Behinderung”. Der Fall der Britin zeigt ein Problem auf, das auch in Deutschland noch immer besteht. Auf dem Arbeitsmarkt sind Menschen mit Behinderung noch immer Menschen zweiter Klasse.

Erst als sich Shani dafür entschied, ihre Behinderung aus ihren Bewerbungsschreiben zu streichen, lud man sie zu einem Vorstellungsgespräch ein. Nur kurze Zeit später bekam sie eine Anstellung in einem Telekommunikationsunternehmen.

Doch einen Job zu bekommen, ist nicht die einzige Herausforderung. ""Es gibt viele verschiedene Probleme"", erklärt Shani. ""Es gibt Probleme bei der Jobsuche und es gibt Probleme, den Job tatsächlich zu halten.""

Neben ihren brüchigen Knochen leidet Shani an Skoliose und Arthritis. Bei ihrer längeren Anfahrt in die Arbeit bekam sie schnell Gelenkschmerzen. Sie fragte daher ihren Arbeitgeber, ob sie öfter von daheim arbeiten könne.

Doch ihr Antrag wurde abgelehnt: “Es war ein Schlag ins Gesicht”. Shani fühlte sich von ihrem Arbeitgeber im Stich gelassen. Immerhin arbeitete sie da bereits seit sechs Jahre für das Unternehmen.

“Ich möchte nicht um besondere Behandlung oder spezielle Anpassungen oder etwas anderes bitten, aber es ist etwas, was ich tun muss, um meine Arbeit zu machen.”

Sie beschloss darauf, ihre Kündigung einzureichen.

Sehr qualifiziert – trotzdem keinen Job

Ähnliche Erfahrungen musste auch Lukas Hoppe in Deutschland machen. Der 23-Jährige ist gehörlos und auf einen Schriftdolmetscher angewiesen. Nachdem er sehr erfolgreich sein Abitur abgeschlossen hatte, fand er schnell einen Ausbildungsplatz.

Auch für die Berufsschule sollte ihm ein Dolmetscher zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Doch die Agentur für Arbeit lehnte es ab, diesen zu finanzieren. Der offizielle Grund: Lukas’ Noten seien zu gut. Er könne erneut einen Dolmetscher beantragen, wenn seine Leistungen deutlich nachlassen würden.

Für Lukas und seine Mutter eine absolut inakzeptable Situation. Sie zogen vor ein Sozialgericht und bekamen Recht. Über den Fall berichtete die “Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung”.

Sein Fall zeigt, mit welchen abstrusen Hindernisse Menschen mit Behinderung zu kämpfen haben.

Die Behinderten-Aktivistin Julia Probst setzt sich seit Jahren für Menschen wie Lukas sein. Sie kritisiert im Gespräch mit der HuffPost, die Arbeitslosenquote betrage bei Menschen mit Behinderungen 13,9 Prozent. Sie ist damit deutlich höher als bei Nichtbehinderten.

“Allerdings ist es nicht so, dass Menschen mit Behinderung schlecht ausgebildet sind. Die Mehrheit ist sogar gut ausgebildet. Ihnen wird der Zugang zum Arbeitsmarkt nur deutlich erschwert”, sagt Probst.

Das hänge besonders oft mit Vorurteilen über die Leistungsfähigkeit der Bewerberinnen und Bewerber mit Behinderungen zusammen.

“In Deutschland ist die Arbeitssuche für Menschen mit Behinderungen oft sehr mühsam”, berichtet die Behindertenbeauftragte der Bundesregierung, Verena Bentele, der HuffPost.

Nicht selten verhindern Vorurteile eine Einladung zum Vorstellungsgespräch bei privaten Arbeitgebern - und das trotz der geforderten Qualifikation.

Endstation Behindertenwerkstatt

Probst zufolge hat das vor allem einen Grund: Der Besuch einer Förderschule ende für viele Betroffene meistens in einer Behindertenwerkstatt, anstatt in einer regulären Ausbildung. Von dort fänden immer noch zu wenige behinderte Menschen den Weg in den regulären Arbeitsmarkt.

“Der einzig richtige Weg wäre, das teure und überflüssige Förderschulsystem abzuschaffen und alle Regelschulen inklusiv zu machen”, erklärte Probst.

So werde ein normales Miteinander von der Kindheit an geschaffen und private Firmen hätten weniger Angst vor der Einstellung eines Menschen mit Behinderung.

Ähnlich sieht das auch Verena Bentele. Gegen Diskriminierung von Menschen mit Behinderungen auf dem Arbeitsmarkt helfe langfristig sicher nur die inklusive Bildung.

“Wenn alle Kinder, ob mit oder ohne Behinderungen, gemeinsam lernen, dann entstehen von Anfang an weniger Vorurteile bei Arbeitgebern und Kolleginnen und Kollegen”, so Bentele.

Die UN bezeichnet die Inklusionsbemühungen der Bundesregierung als mangelhaft

Schon mehrfach wurde Deutschland bei der offiziellen Staatenprüfung des UN-Menschenrechtsratausschusses heftig für die mangelhafte Umsetzung von Inklusionsmaßnahmen gerügt. Dies war zuletzt 2015 der Fall. Deutlich besser schneiden Länder wie Italien und Spanien ab.

Auch für die nächste Prüfung 2019 sieht Julia Probst für Deutschland schwarz: “Es hat sich im Prinzip nichts geändert.”

Es gäbe zwar eine Schwerstbehinderten-Abgabe für Firmen, die die offizielle Quote an behinderten Mitarbeitern nicht erfüllen, allerdings sei diese nicht hoch genug.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 85.000 Deutsche dürfen das grundlegendste Recht in einem demokratischen Staat nicht wahrnehmen

Sind in einem Unternehmen mit mehr als 60 Mitarbeitern weniger als 5 Prozent der Arbeitsplätze mit Menschen mit schwerer Behinderung besetzt, muss das Unternehmen eine Gebühr entrichten. Diese beträgt jedoch nur maximal 320 Euro im Monat. Probst fordert, diese Sanktionen deutlich zu erhöhen.

“Der ehemalige Finanzminister Wolfgang Schäuble machte einen entsprechenden Vorschlag 2015. Der wurde allerdings nie umgesetzt”.

In zwei Jahren droht Deutschland so erneut die Note fünf - und das zu Recht.

Doch nicht nur Steueroasen sind ein Problem

Milliarden gehen dem Fiskus wegen Betrugsfällen in Deutschland verloren

Die Namen der Inseln klingen exotisch, ebenso wie die Tricks, die die weltweite Elite nutzt, um Steuern zu sparen: die Bermudas, die Isle of Man, die Virgin Islands, die Cayman Islands und so weiter.

All diese Steuerparadiese tauchen in Unterlagen auf, über die unter anderem die “Süddeutsche Zeitung” berichtet. Demnach haben Prominente, Politiker und Wohlhabende über Tricksereien hunderte Milliarden Euro am Fiskus vorbeigeschleust - meistens völlig legal.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Politiker und Unternehmer umgingen Millionen an Steuern: Diese Deutschen tauchen in den Paradise Papers auf



Allein Deutschland entgehen pro Jahr Steuereinnahmen von rund 17 Milliarden Euro durch Steueroasen, hat der französische Ökonom Gabriel Zucman berechnet.

Betrug vor unserer Haustür

Die Aufregung, die auf die Veröffentlichung der Paradise Papers folgt, ist deshalb völlig verständlich und richtig. Dennoch übersieht sie etwas Wichtiges: Der größte Steuerbetrug passiert täglich vor unserer Haustür.

Bis zu 40 Milliarden Euro gehen dem deutschen Fiskus jährlich durch Steuerbetrug in Deutschland durch die Lappen, schätzt die Deutsche Steuergewerkschaft, andere Experten gehen sogar von noch höheren Schäden aus.

Ihr Vorsitzender Thomas Eigenthaler, erklärt im Gespräch mit der HuffPost, dass allein Gastronomen jährlich rund 10 Milliarden Euro an Steuern hinterziehen.

Vor allem Kleinstunternehmen wie Kioske nutzten häufig noch Bargeldkassen, erklärt Eigenthaler. Dadurch seien die Einnahmen nicht nachvollziehbar - der Betrug ist ein Kinderspiel. Das betrifft auch Taxifahrer und Glückspielhallen. Überall wo Bargeld im Spiel sei, hätten Betrüger leichtes Spiel.

Softwarebetrug gibt es nicht nur bei den Autobauern

Aber auch moderne elektronische Registrierkassen können für den Steuerbetrug missbraucht werden. Dabei hilft eine Software, die den Wareneingang und -Ausgang so klein rechnet, dass der Gesamtumsatz des Restaurants sinkt. Folglich fällt auch der zu versteuernde Gewinn kleiner aus.

Die Kasse registriert dann zum Beispiel, dass der Gastronom weniger Schnitzel und Pommes eingekauft hat als in Wirklichkeit - auch die Verkäufe rechnet die Software entsprechend klein.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Liebe Eliten, wundert euch nicht, wenn die Menschen AfD wählen, es liegt auch an eurem Verhalten



Bisher ist der Gesetzgeber gegen diesen Betrug machtlos. Und auch ein weiterer Steuertrick von dem Eigenthaler berichtet, löst Kopfschütteln aus.

Händler aus China prellen den deutschen Staat

So nutzen in China registrierte Unternehmen den Versandhändler Amazon, um massenhaft Produkte in Deutschland zu verkaufen. Die Produkte lagern bei Amazon in Deutschland, werden aber ohne den Aufschlag von 19 Prozent Mehrwertsteuer verkauft.

90 Prozent der chinesischen Händler würden an der Steuer vorbeiverkaufen, schätzt Eigenthaler. Auch Ebay ist betroffen.

Der Schaden für das Finanzamt: eine Milliarde Euro. Das Problem ist den Behörden schon länger bekannt. Im Mai erklärte der hessische Finanzminister Thomas Schäfer gegenüber der ""Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung"": ""Online-Handel boomt. Mit ihm boomt aber leider auch Steuerbetrug vor allem ausländischer Unternehmen.""

Aber das ist noch nicht alles. So geben Privatpersonen ihren Arbeitsweg beim Finanzamt höher an als er tatsächlich ist. Bücher werden als Fachbücher deklariert, um sie steuerlich geltend zu machen und ein privates Weihnachtsessen wird als Geschäftsdinner deklariert.

All diese Betrügereien von Privatpersonen nennt Eigenthaler “Unehrlichkeiten im Tagesgeschäft” - sie seien im Gegensatz zum Betrug in der Gastronomie kein strukturelles Problem.

Dass diese strukturellen Probleme aber schnell gelöst werden, glaubt kaum ein Experte. Dafür fehlt den Finanzämter unter anderem schlicht das Personal - im Falle von Steuerausfällen bei Verkäufen bei Amazon und Ebay aber auch die passenden Gesetze.

Bill C-65 has been a year in the making since the federal government launched consultations in mid-2016 to review the Canada Labour Code.","People listen from outside the chamber in the House of Commons on June 29, 2016 in Ottawa.

OTTAWA — The federal government still has important details to iron out after it announced new legislation to take on the ""full range of unacceptable behaviours,"" from teasing to sexual violence, in federally regulated workplaces.

Labour Minister Patty Hajdu tabled Bill C-65 on Tuesday, proposing to make amendments to the Canada Labour Code to handle workplace harassment more efficiently. If passed, the legislation would extend across the House of Commons, Senate, and Library of Parliament.

Those who work on Parliament Hill are currently not protected by the Canada Labour Code. But the government is limited in what it can do to prevent harassment and violence from happening on Parliament Hill, the minister said.

""No government can legislate away this problem,"" said Hajdu. ""This is a problem that exists in a culture that tolerates these behaviours, where power imbalances and gender norms create and reinforce all kinds of unacceptable behaviours.""

What the new legislation proposes to do is fuse two parallel complaint processes into one. Exclusive to that, the second piece of the plan is to facilitate a workplace culture change.

So to make that cultural shift happen, the government has pledged to launch an awareness campaign, and to distribute education and training tools to employers and employees.

The last promise is the creation of a helpline, a 1-800 number, to assist employers and employees through the complaint process.

When asked about how much the awareness campaign and education tools will cost, Hajdu threw to the future for an answer.

Patty Hajdu, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour stands during question period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Sept. 19, 2017.

""We'll have more to say about the funding in the days to come,"" she said.

Hajdu made the announcement alongside Government House Leader Bardish Chagger, Status of Women Minister Maryam Monsef and chief government whip Pablo Rodriguez.

Monsef called the timing of the new legislation ""ideal,"" saying the #MeToo social media campaign has acclimatized people to listen and talk about instances of harassment more openly.

""It's taken 150 years for us to introduce legislation like this,"" she said.

What the new process would look like

The legislation will replace an array of current anti-harassment policies that apply to different groups of federal workers.

For example, there's one that oversees MP complaints against other MPs. And there's another regime that applies only to federally regulated private-sector industries and Crown corporations.

It would also implement measures to protect the privacy of complainants.

The proposed consolidated workplace prevention and resolution process looks like this: if an employer does not resolve a complaint with the employee, the issue continues to mediation.

If a resolution isn't found after mediation, a so-called ""competent person"" is brought in to investigate and produce an incident report that includes recommendations.

""Competent people would have to be impartial. They would have to be trained and on the legislation they would have to understand the legislation. They would have to understand harassment and sexual violence,"" Hajdu said.

She added an appointed competent person is chosen by the employer and employee.

The Canadian Flag flies on a building in Ottawa across from the Peace Tower on Centre Block of Parliament Hill.

""If the employer or the employee can't agree there will be a list of competent people that will be available from the labour program that people can choose from.""

After the report by the competent person is completed, it's then up to the employer to respond to it and implement its recommendations.

And if the complaint is still not resolved at this stage, the labour minister would be brought in to investigate the case.

New legislation amid 'Weinstein effect'

The announcement comes in the wake of bombshell harassment and sexual abuse allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.

Public condemnation over Weinstein's alleged decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct has refocused people's attention — especially employers — on implementing anti-harassment policies.

What's missing from Bill C-65 is an explicit timeline for competent persons to complete incident and recommendation reports. The legislation is still a work in progress, Employment and Social Development Canada said.

""The department will consult with stakeholders and experts during the regulatory process on the issue of timelines for the different steps in the process,"" department spokesman Christopher Simard said in an email.

A HuffPost Canada investigation found that workplace harassment allegations against former Sen. Don Meredith were first reported to Senate human resources in July 2013.

An official workplace assessment investigating the senator's office was launched in Feburary 2015 after late Sen. Pierre Claude Nolin noticed a high turnover in Meredith's office.

Meredith resigned from the Senate earlier this year on the eve of an unprecedented expulsion vote over his sexual relationship with a teenage girl.

That workplace assessment report, which the Senate Ethics Office pledged to complete despite Meredith's departure, remains unfinished.

In the House of Commons, a report released last year said 10 cases investigating alleged harassment were processed in about a year. Ninety per cent of the complainants were female.

Groups want 'clear' definitions

The Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) and Oxfam Canada both released statements Tuesday applauding the government for taking a step in addressing the systemic issue.

But both organizations flagged concerns with the promises being made with no explicit funding to match.

It is unclear at this point whether sufficient resources will be allocated to implement the regulations proposed in the bill. Diana Sarosi, Oxfam Canada

""Effective legislation must be accompanied by sufficient financial resources and must come with comprehensive training that is sustained adequately over time,"" Oxfam Canada policy manager Diana Sarosi said in a release.

""It is unclear at this point whether sufficient resources will be allocated to implement the regulations proposed in the bill.""

The CLC said it wants to see the bill include a ""clear definition"" of what constitutes harassment and violence under the proposed legislation.

Bill C-65 has been a year in the making since the federal government launched consultations in mid-2016 to review the Canada Labour Code.

When pressed by reporters for what the definition of ""workplace"" is, the labour minister said any work-related interaction inside or outside the office is subject to the new legislation.

""So sometimes incidents happen after work,"" Hajdu said. ""That doesn't mean it's still not workplace harassment.""

Dozenten haben es oft nicht leicht. Sie stecken Mühe und Arbeit in den Unterricht ihrer Studenten und letztlich wird ihnen oft nur mit schlechten Testergebnissen gedankt. Es ist daher wohl nachvollziehbar, dass der ein oder andere Professor frustriert ist.

In Los Angeles brachte die Frustration einen Professor jetzt sogar wortwörtlich dazu, sich in einen Sarg zu legen.

Aussie parent Stevie wasn’t sure whether to share the incident on social media, as she was feared being criticised. However she decided to do so in the hope it will raise awareness of an often overlooked safety hazard for children.

Stevie was folding laundry less than two metres from her son, when she looked up to discover he had tangled himself in the blind cords, with one wrapped around his neck.

“I looked up from the washing pile and [saw] him caught in the cords. I immediately jump up as fast as I could and untangled him,” she explained in an Instagram post that has garnered an outpouring of online support.

Customers at Shoppers Drug Mart or any of Loblaw Companies Ltd.'s grocery stores will soon use a new, unified loyalty program that replaces Optimum and PC Plus points.

Loblaw (TSX:L) will merge the two programs starting Feb. 1, 2018 under the name PC Optimum — a long-anticipated move that comes more than three years after the grocery giant acquired the pharmacy chain and its in-house Shopper Optimum system.

""We're bringing the very best of Shoppers Optimum and PC Plus together,"" said Uwe Stueckmann, senior vice president of marketing.

A Loblaws store is pictured in Ottawa Feb. 24, 2011.

PC Optimum is ""the future of loyalty programs for Loblaw companies,"" he said, ""harnessing both the power of PC Plus and Shoppers Optimum across the unified network of our stores coast to coast.""

Consumers can keep collecting points as usual until Feb. 1 next year when their Optimum and/or Plus points will move to the new program at equal value. If a collector has $100 worth of Optimum points, they will receive $100 worth of PC Optimum points, for example.

In Quebec, where Shoppers Drug Mart operates under the Pharmaprix name, the Pharmaprix Optimum program will end on Jan. 31, 2018 and members will have until May 2 that year to redeem their points or convert them at equal value to the new program.

Collectors will then use a single card or app and continue to earn points on money spent at Shoppers. They'll also be able to earn points through personalized offers and in-store promotions at all stores, and by using the President's Choice Financial MasterCard.

More than 19 million active members

The new program will have an easy to remember redemption system — with 10,000 points valued at $10, 20,000 points at $20 and so on to a maximum single transaction redemption of $500. Shoppers can use their reward money at any of Loblaw's nearly 2,500 stores and the company's websites.

Consumers will earn 50 per cent more points for almost every dollar spent at Shoppers Drug Mart locations to help account for the higher number of points needed for each redemption level. Under the current Optimum program, collectors earn 10 points for every $1 spent, but need 2,000 fewer points to buy $10 worth of goods, for example.

More than 19 million active members make up the base of the two current programs, with at least 50 per cent of members enrolled in both, said Jim Noteboom, senior vice-president of loyalty and consumer insights.

A pedestrian walks past a Shoppers Drug Mart in Ottawa Nov. 10, 2010.

After Loblaw acquired Shoppers in 2014, Noteboom said consumers told the company they wanted one program rather than two separate ones because it would make their lives easier.

""Make it one program, that's easy to understand and easy to earn, with points that are redeemable at all stores,"" he said collectors told the company while it gathered research on its loyalty cards.

Analyst speculation about a points merger has heightened since August when CIBC (TSX:CM) and Loblaw's PC Financial announced they would end their nearly 20-year relationship.

In its place, CIBC launched Simplii Financial — a no-fee direct banking brand — on Nov. 1. In the breakup, savings, chequing and mortgage accounts went with Simplii, while MasterCard credit cards and the PC Plus points program remained with PC Financial.

The change means PC Financial debit card holders no longer earn PC points when using those cards.

Both spokesmen said that the end of the company's relationship with CIBC was unrelated to the decision to merge both programs, which has been in the works for a few years.

Was die Ereignisse, die sich heute vor 100 Jahren in Russland zugetragen haben, und die noch fälschlich als ""Oktoberrevolution"" bezeichnet werden, wirklich bedeuten, wird bis heute von der offiziellen Geschichtsschreibung ignoriert. Und in den Medien verfälscht.

Der staatliche TV-Sender Rossija 1 hat dem 7. November 1917 (nach dem damals gültigen Kalender der 25. Oktober 1917) eine ganze Talkshow gewidmet. Dort sagte der Chef der Kommunistischen Partei, Gennadij Sjuganow: ""Die Geschichte kennt keinen Konjunktiv. Was passiert ist, ist passiert.""

Aber das stimmt nicht.

Wenn man uns verbieten will, darüber nachzudenken, was ohne Lenins Putsch passiert wäre, dann ist das klare Zensur. Und auch eine Rechtfertigung für die Verbrechen in unserer Vergangenheit.

Russland hätte sich nicht in den ersten Weltkrieg einmischen sollen, sagte der Chef-Kommunist. Dabei war es Deutschland, das Russland den Krieg erklärte. Und zwar auch deshalb, weil die Deutschen davon ausgingen, dass unser Land sich zu einem Wirtschafts-Riesen entwickeln und zu groß und zu stark werden würde.

Aber gehen wir noch weiter.

Die neue Regierung wollte sich auf die Bürger berufen

Hunderte Jahre hielt man die Macht - die Zarenkrone - für gottgegeben.

Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts ließ der Glauben an Gott nach.

Die Februar-Revolution 1917 - der Sturz des Zaren - war deshalb zeitgemäß.

Die neue Regierung wollte sich nicht mehr auf Gott berufen, sondern auf ihre Bürger.

Deshalb hatte sie für November 1917 Wahlen ausgerufen.

Gleichzeitig setzte die Provisorische Regierung unter Alexander Kerenski den Krieg fort. An der Front schaffte sie erstaunliche Erfolge.

Dann kam Lenin und die Revolution

Wladimir Uljanow, der sich Lenin nannte, hatte zur gleichen Zeit nur ein einziges Ziel: An die Macht zu kommen. Und er wusste: Dazu musste Russland erst den Krieg verlieren, denn ein Sieg hätte Kerenski zum Helden gemacht.

Russlands Position im Krieg verbesserte sich rasch. Tschechen, Slowaken und Kroaten wollten nicht mehr weiter gegen Russland kämpfen, wo es jetzt keinen Zaren mehr gab, und Wien signalisierte notgedrungen Verhandlungsbereitschaft.

Als Berlin erfuhr, dass der eigene Bündnisgenosse abtrünnig werden könnte, wandte es sich an einen alten Freund, der von Deutschland bezahlt wurde - Wladimir Uljanow alias Lenin.

Der befahl seinen Leuten, unverzüglich die Minister der Provisorischen Regierung festzunehmen - am 25. Oktober (7. November): ""Jede Verzögerung wäre gleichbedeutend mit dem Tod"", war damals die Parole. Einen Tag später wäre der Frieden mit Österreich unterzeichnet worden.

Massenterror gegen das eigene Volk

Am 26. Oktober erließ Lenin sein ""Dekret für den Frieden"" - also die Kapitulation Russlands.

Der angebliche ""2. Kongress der Volksdeputierten"" - in Wirklichkeit nur eine Versammlung von Abgeordneten aus den wenigen Regionen, in denen Lenins Leute wirklich eine Mehrheit hatten - ""ernannte"" eine bolschewistische Regierung.

► Bei den Wahlen zur Verfassungsgebenden Versammlung, die diese ausrief, erhielt Lenins Partei im November 1917 nicht mal ein Viertel der Stimmen.

Im Dezember schaffen die Kommunisten hastig die WTscheKa, eine Vorgänger-Organisation des KGB, die Massenterror gegen das eigene Volk betrieb.

Lenins Kämpfer schossen auf Demonstranten

Am 18. Januar 1918 traf sich ein Teil der gewählten Abgeordneten zur verfassungsgebenden Versammlung.

Als diese die Erlasse der Sowjets für illegal erklärte, wurde sie aufgelöst. In der gleichen Nacht ließ Lenin seine Kämpfer mit Maschinengewehren auf Demonstranten schießen, die auf die Straße gingen, um ihre legitim gewählten Abgeordneten zu verteidigen. Mehr als hundert Menschen starben.

Lenins Mitstreiter Bucharin rief den Bürgerkrieg aus. Die bolschewistische Regierung hatte keine Legitimität. Sie kämpfte ausschließlich für die Interessen ihrer Anführer. Sie hatte keine soziale Basis, weder im alten noch im neuen Russland.

""Diktatur des Proletariates""

Selbst die russischen Marxisten wie Plechanow und Martow erkannten die so genannte Revolution, die in Wirklichkeit ein Putsch war, nicht an. Deshalb mussten Lenin und seine Anhänger sich von der ganzen tausendjährigen Geschichte Russlands lossagen.

Die nationale Symbolik - das Wappen, die Hymne, die Flagge, der Staatsnamen - alles wurde abgeschafft. Stattdessen schuf man die so genannte ""UdSSR"". An Stelle der demokratischen Republik, die sich gerade aus dem konstitutionellen Monarchie entwickelt hatte, trat eine ""Diktatur des Proletariates"".

Schon am 20. November 1917 erklärten die Bolschewiken das gesamte bestehende Recht für ungültig. Alle Gesetze verloren ihre Wirkung, die Gerichte und Staatsanwaltschaften wurden aufgelöst. Ganz offen wurde erklärt, dass die neue Regierung das Völkerrecht nicht anerkennt.

► Auch der bestehenden Moral wurde der Kampf angesagt. Ebenso wie der Kirche.

Der radikale Bruch wird heute ignoriert

Lenins ""Plan der monumentalen Propaganda"" sollte die Erinnerung an alles auslöschen, was mit dem alten Russland zu tun hatte. Denkmäler wurden zerstört, Ortsnamen geändert, ebenso der Kalender und die Rechtschreibung.

1921 wurden alle humanitären Fakultäten der russischen Universitäten geschlossen. Erst Jahrzehnte später wurde das Studium von Geschichte, Soziologie, Recht und Philosophie wieder möglich.

Dieser radikale Bruch durch die Bolschewiki wird heute von der russischen Politik - und deshalb auch der Geschichtsforschung und in den Schulbüchern - ignoriert.

""UdSSR und Russland - Mörder und Mordopfer""

Ein derartiger völliger historischer Bruch ist in der Geschichte selten, aber nicht einmalig. Das sowjetische und postsowjetische Regime hat in etwa so viel gemeinsam mit dem historischen Russland wie die Bundesrepublik mit dem Dritten Reich. ""Die UdSSR und Russland - das ist Mörder und Mordopfer"", schrieb Solschenizyn.

Statt der russischen Idee riefen die Bolschewisten die sowjetische Idee aus: Soziale Gerechtigkeit, Verzicht auf Ausbeutung, freie Entwicklung des Individuums, usw.

► Doch diese lauten Parolen waren nur ein Vorhang, mit dem die schreckliche sowjetische Realität verdeckt wurde.

In der Sowjetunion herrschte totale Zensur, die Grenzen waren geschlossen, die Menschen wurden maximal ausgebeutet, die Wirtschaft war rückständig, es herrscht Mangel selbst an Waren des täglichen Bedarfs, Hunger, Armut, ein katastrophaler Niedergang der Landwirtschaft und vieles mehr.

Es ist deshalb kein Wunder, dass die gesamte Geschichte der Sowjetunion auch eine Geschichte des Widerstands der einfachen Menschen gegen dieses System ist - und zugleich des Kampfes dieses Systems gegen die eigenen Menschen.

Russland hatte den Anspruch, eine Weltmacht zu sein

Bolschewismus - das sind drei künstlich erzeugte Hunger-Katastrophen, GULAG - ""ein Auschwitz ohne Krematorium"" - der ""rote Terror"" und der ""große Terror"", die Deportation von sechs Millionen Menschen.

Russland schritt in das 20. Jahrhundert mit dem Anspruch, eine führende Weltmacht zu sein. Es beendete das Jahrhundert mit dem Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion.

In 70 Jahren Kommunismus hat Russland 5,5 Millionen Quadratkilometer Landfläche verloren - das ist zehnmal so viel wie das Territorium Frankreichs. 1917 lebten in Russland 186 Millionen Menschen, heute sind es 143 Millionen.

Fast alle Opfer von Stalins Terror gegen das eigene Volk sind, still und leise, offiziell rehabilitiert.

► Das bedeutet, dass Lenin und Stalin einen Völkermord an ihrem eigenen Volk begangen haben.

Wir brauchen eine intellektuelle moralische Erneuerung

Was kann man dazu noch sagen? Um aus der 100-jährigen Sackgasse herauszukommen, in die Russland heute vor 100 Jahren eingebogen ist, brauchen wir eine gigantische intellektuelle moralische Erneuerung.

Nur, wenn wir uns von dem tief sitzenden Erbe und Denken aus der Sowjetzeit lossagen, das Geschehene juristisch aufarbeiten und endlich Vergangenheitsbewältigung beginnen, wenn wir an das alte Russland anknüpfen, und dessen Erbe reformieren und modernisieren, wenn wir uns dabei die Erfahrung der europäischen Demokratien zu Herzen nehmen, nur dann haben wir eine Chance, die russische Zivilisation wiederauferstehen zu lassen.

Nur so können wir uns aus der Rolle des Aussätzigen befreien, in die wir uns selbst manövriert haben. Und einen würdigen Platz in der Geschichte der Menschheit einzunehmen.

Derzeit finden sich einige Schlagzeilen und dazu gehörige Artikel, in denen erklärt wird, warum die dreijährige Tochter von Mila Kunis jeden Freitag einen Schluck Wein trinken darf. Alkohol im Kindesalter? Ob das wirklich zur Religion gehört, wenn Kleinkindern schon der Geschmack von Alkohol nahe gebracht wird und ob es sinnvoll ist, derartigen kulturell aufgebauten gesellschaftlichen Geisteserkrankungen anzuhängen, bleibt hier einmal außen vor. Eindeutig belegbar ist hingegen, dass jemand, der glaubt, keine Ahnung hat, da er es immerhin nicht weiß.

Soviel zu Mila Kunis und ihrer dreijährigen Tochter, nun zum Thema: Alkohol im Kindesalter! Gelegentlich führt mein Weg durch das LWL-Museum für Naturkunde in Münster, in dem seit vermutlich Jahrzehnten eine Dauervorstellung zu den Indianern Nordamerikas genau dieses Thema aufgreift. Die Indianer wurden immer weiter zurück gedrängt, das Ziel war anscheinend ihre Ausrottung sowie sie erst ab 1924 durch ihre Geburt innerhalb der USA automatisch auch Staatsbürger der USA sind. Sie gelten aber gewiss noch heute nicht als vollwertige Bürger und mit Pech werden sie mal eben per Zwang von dem einen in das andere Reservat umgesiedelt.

100 Millionen Indianer sind durch die Entdeckung der neuen Welt durch den „Weißen Mann"" ums Leben gekommen, viele systematisch. Noch heute leben Indianer in Nordamerika meist in abgelegenen Reservaten wie in einem Drittweltland mit einer Arbeitslosigkeit von oft über 60%. Bereits in den Entdeckerjahren war es üblich, den Indianern Alkohol zu geben. Der Weiße Mann hatte wohl auch die Hoffnung, dass sich mit jeder Party einige Indianer totgesoffen haben. Alkohol hat ab diesen Entdeckerjahren eine feste Tradition im Indianerleben, Alkohol im Kindesalter gehört dazu.

Harold Red Eagle säuft seit seinem achten Lebensjahr

Alkohol im Kindesalter ist unter Indianern in US Reservaten anscheinend ein alltägliches Phänomen, sowie rund 75% der Indianerfamilien wenigstens einen Alkoholiker zählen. So die Zeitung „Montana's Indians"" aus dem Jahr 1996, die Harold Red Eagle einen Artikel widmete. Damals war er 37 Jahre alt, soff damit schon seit 29 Jahren und hält sich an einem Pfahl fest. Sein eigener Vater war es, der ihm den Alkohol gab. Was genau die Absichten eines solchen Vaters waren, geht aus dem Artikel nicht hervor.

Harold Red Eagles Tochter begann das Trinken erst mit 13 Jahren. Mit 18 muss sie für drei Jahre ins Gefängnis, immerhin hat sie ihren 14 jährigen Bruder getötet. Sie erstach ihn mit einem Messer, als sie betrunken war. Im Reservat gehen 79 Prozent aller Straftaten auf Alkohol zurück.

„It was her family's way of life.""

„All she saw us do was drink alcohol.""

Alkohol im Kindesalter vermutlich eine ganz schlechte Idee

Wenn die Eltern der Kinder Raucher sind und diese den Rauch bereits kennen, ist es wahrscheinlicher, dass sie mit dem Rauchen anfangen. Beim gesellschaftlich etablierten Alkohol ist es ähnlich. Wenn die Kinder sich bereits im Kleinkindalter an den Geschmack alkoholischer Getränke gewöhnen, ist das mehr als fraglich. Es ist wie beim Zucker, dass es nicht 100 Gramm sein müssen. Ein Stück Würfelzucker macht bereits den „Pin"" im Hinterkopf und die leuchtenden Augen, wenn es wieder einmal ein Stück Zucker oder auch mehr gibt. Dieser „Pin"" wird durch die Häufigkeit oder durch größere Mengen natürlich immer stärker.

Es kommt aber auch auf die Menschen an, ob sie für etwas empfänglich sind. Wer es bereits in den Genen oder im Wesen hat, ein Alkoholproblem hervor zu bilden und auch noch Alkohol im Kindesalter vorkommt, dann ist es nur um so wahrscheinlicher, dass genau dieses Problem früher, stärker und damit problematischer hervorgebildet wird.

Weiterhin sind die Organe oder die Psyche von Kindern erheblich empfindlicher. Wesentlich kleinere Mengen Alkohol, Drogen, Umweltgifte oder sonstige Gifte können einen maßgeblich größeren Schaden als beim Erwachsenen anrichten. Nicht Grundlos sind es die Kinder, nicht die Erwachsenen, die rund um Atomkraftwerken reihenweise an Leukämie erkranken.

Wenn dann zu lesen ist, dass Kinder alkoholfreies Bier trinken, ist dieser „Pin"" natürlich nicht vorhanden, auch in Sauerkraut oder anderen Speisen sind bis 0,5 % Alkohol enthalten. Dennoch bringt man den Kindern schon den Geschmack und das Ritual nahe. Auch wenn es eine den Indianern mitgebrachte Kultur des weißen Mannes ist, so wäre es schön, wenn sie wenigstens den Jugendschutz beachten oder den Alkoholismus weitgehend durchbrechen täten. Wer sich jedoch bereits selber als Schweralkoholiker klassifizieren muss und Kinder groß ziehen soll, der bringt damit ganz automatisch einige Defizite mit. Erlebte man selber Alkohol im Kindesalter und lebt folglich im Dauersuff, dann ist es gewiss schwerer, die eigenen Kinder vom Saufen abzuhalten als bei jemandem, der im Leben eine Perspektive mit Job und Einkommen hat. Wer die Armut in der Welt bekämpft, der bekämpft auch ihre Probleme.

Die ""Paradise Papers"" zeigen erneut, wie viele Reiche sich der gesellschaftlichen Verantwortung entziehen

Gleichzeitig wird im politischen Diskurs lieber nach unten getreten

Das größte Problem sind aber nicht die ""sozial Abgehängten"", sondern die realitätsferne Elite

Der Publizist Jakob Augstein hat nicht immer Recht mit dem, was er in seiner Kolumne bei ""Spiegel Online"" veröffentlicht. Doch in seinem Text zu den Enthüllungen um die ""Paradise Papers"" hat er mit wenigen Sätzen ins Schwarze getroffen: ""Das System ist zutiefst krank. Es ist unmoralisch und unanständig“, schreibt er. ""Unser Planet ist ein Paradies für Arschlöcher.“

Das nunmehr öffentliche System von Briefkastenfirmen, mit denen Reiche ab einer bestimmten Anlagesumme sich das Steuerzahlen sparen können, ist ein erschreckendes Beispiel für den Unwillen der Privilegierten, Solidarität mit den wirtschaftlich Schwächeren zu zeigen.

Diese Steuersparmodelle sind meist völlig legal. Das macht sie aber noch lange nicht legitim, im Gegenteil. Die Verstrickung vieler deutscher Firmen und Privatpersonen zeigt, dass der alte rheinische Kapitalismus, der diesem Land Jahrzehnte lang sozialen Ausgleich und einen vergleichsweise hohen Lebensstandard für möglichst viele Menschen beschert hat, mittlerweile mausetot ist.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Politiker und Unternehmer umgingen Millionen an Steuern: Diese Deutschen tauchen in den Paradise Papers auf

Kein Interesse, Schlupflöcher zu schließen

Und das ist vor allem eine Mentalitätsfrage. Es gibt in Deutschland Menschen, die solche Schlupflöcher für die Reichen und Superreichen offen stehen lassen. Sie sitzen derzeit auch bei den Sondierungsgesprächen für eine mögliche Jamaika-Koalition mit am Tisch.

Und es gibt solche Menschen, die ohne den Anflug eines schlechten Gewissens diese Lücken nutzen. Ist ja alles erlaubt. Was sich jene, die sich sonst gerne zur ""Leistungselite"" dieses Landes zählen, dabei gerne unterschätzen: Macht geht auch mit Verantwortung einher.

Und genau das unterscheidet die Reichen auch von den Küchentischtricksern in den Reihenhäusern der urbanen Stadtrandlagen, die einen Zusammenstoß mit einem nachtblinden Fuchs gerne mal zum Wildunfall aufmotzen, um dann bei der Auto-Versicherung abzukassieren. Unehrlichkeit gibt es auch bei den Ärmeren. Aber sie hat längst nicht so große Folgen.

Wir haben ein moralisches Führungsproblem in diesem Land. Und es strahlt von oben nach unten aus. Mit Folgen für die politische Landschaft in der Bundesrepublik.

Auch die Populisten hetzen gegen die Armen

Es gibt eine Frage, die im Zusammenhang mit dem Siegeszug des Populismus bisher viel zu wenig diskutiert wurde: Warum eigentlich treten so viele Menschen gegen die vermeintlich Schwächeren in der Gesellschaft aus?

Der Erfolg der AfD wäre undenkbar ohne dieses Phänomen. Die Partei will das Arbeitslosengeld II für jene erhöhen, die mindestens zehn Jahre beschäftigt waren.

Außerdem plant sie, die Steuern für die Mittelschicht zu senken und die Erbschafts- sowie die Gewerbesteuer abzuschaffen. Davon profitieren vor allem jene, die einer geregelten Arbeit nachgehen und über ein vererbbares Vermögen verfügen.

Die nationalistisch denkenden Teile der Mittelschicht dürften sich von der Arbeits- und Sozialpolitik der AfD ganz gut vertreten fühlen. Und klar ist auch, auf wessen Kosten das geht: Es gibt weniger Geld für Asylleistungen, weniger Geld für Zuwanderer. Überhaupt: weniger Geld für alle, die nicht in die politischen Kategorien des AfD-Gesellschaftsbildes passen.

Das ist kein rein deutsches Phänomen. In Tschechien hat kürzlich ein Multimilliardär mit seiner Partei die Parlamentswahlen gewonnen, dessen Wahlkampf gespickt war mit Spitzen gegen Arbeitslose und Sozialhilfeempfänger.

Feindbilder passend für jede soziale Schicht

In Österreich hat die FPÖ ihren Wahlkampf mit dem Slogan ""neue Fairness"" bestritten. Auf Plakaten war ein österreichischer Rennradler zu sehen, der vorne auf dem Tandem sitzt, und eine dickbäuchige Karikatur eines faulen und obendrein auch linken Sozialhilfeempfängers auf dem Hintersattel mitziehen muss.

Die Motive gleichen sich in den Ländern Europas. Und die Populisten haben für fast jede Gesellschaftsschicht ein vermeintlich überalimentiertes Feindbild parat: Für die Wohlhabenden sind das die ""links-grün versifften Gutmenschen"", die mit Steuergeldern ihr angeblich zweifelhaftes Wirken finanziert bekommen.

Für die weniger Wohlhabenden sind es die Ausländer, deren Existenz nach Meinung des Stammtisches ""auf Kosten von Obdachlosen, Alten, Kranken und Armen"" finanziert wird.

Und wer selbst ohne Job ist, darf sich bei den Rechtspopulisten immerhin noch daran ergötzen, dass es ja noch jene Arbeitslosen gibt, die selbst verschuldet und durch eigene Faulheit in diese Situation geraten sind. Das sind im Zweifelsfall immer die anderen.

Auch die Linken treten nach unten

Übrigens ist dieses Phänomen des Nach-unten-Austretens auch aus einem ganz anderen Kontext sehr aktuell: Linke erheben sich selbst gerne über die AfD-Wähler, indem sie diese als ""dumme Nazi-Prolls"" diffamieren.

Die Stigmatisierung von Rechten als ""ungebildet"" oder ""sozial minderwertig"" ist nicht nur gefährlich, sondern lenkt den Blick von jenen gesellschaftlichen Bruchlinien ab, die in Deutschland den sozialen Frieden gefährden – und dadurch mitverantwortlich sind für den Aufstieg der rechten Parteien.

Die Scheren zwischen Arm und Reich, Stadt und Land, Rentnern und Pensionären, Akademikern und Handwerkern sind derart offensichtlich geworden, dass die so gewachsenen Unterschiede das Gerechtigkeitsgefühl vieler Menschen verletzen. Und – da sind wir wieder bei den ""Paradise Papers"": Auch dafür ist derzeit kaum jemand bereit, die Verantwortung zu übernehmen. Das moralische Führungsproblem.

Die Regierenden verstehen das Problem noch immer nicht

Wenn ein Akademikerkind eine dreimal höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit auf ein Studium hat und eine zehnmal höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit auf eine erfolgreich abgeschlossene Promotion als ein Arbeiterkind, dann wirkt das entmutigend auf jene, die eigentlich eine ""Aufsteigerbiografie"" leben könnten.

Wenn die Pensionen für Staatsdiener zwanzig Prozentpunkte höher liegen als die Renten für Arbeitnehmer, dann wird dadurch der Verdruss auf das System befeuert.

Und wenn die CSU beim Breitbandausbau ganz auf die Kraft des freien Marktes vertraute, der aber aus Profitgründen gar nicht daran dachte, die abgelegeneren Regionen Deutschlands mit schnellem Internet zu versorgen, dann wächst auf dem Land der Verdruss gegen die ""Eliten"" in den Städten.

Was wir in Deutschland bräuchten, wäre ein Masterplan, wie die gespaltene Gesellschaft wieder näher zusammengeführt werden kann. Das betrifft politische Maßnahmen, muss aber auch auf unser gesellschaftliches Leitbild abzielen.

Populisten und Radikale hatten in der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik stets dann die schlechtesten Chancen, wenn Wohlstand in Deutschland gerecht geteilt wurde.

Dem gegenüber steht derzeit der Trend, dass sich Reiche in Deutschland in ihre eigene Welt zurückziehen. Privatschulen haben immer mehr Zulauf, ebenso wie kommerziell betriebene Universitäten. Wer sich eine private Altersvorsorge leisten kann, muss sich nicht mehr allein auf die gesetzliche Rente verlassen.

Und wer genug Geld gesammelt hat, dass er im Stehen schlafen müsste, wenn er es unter das Kopfkissen legen würde, der kann sich auch die legale Ausweichbewegung in die so genannten ""Steuer-Oasen"" leisten.

Das Deprimierende ist, dass die Politik immer noch nicht erkannt hat, wie viel gesellschaftlicher Schaden dadurch entsteht.

Wer ständig nach einer Obergrenze für Flüchtlinge kräht, aber nicht einmal ansatzweise willens ist, die Reichen in diesem Land zu gesellschaftlicher Verantwortung zu zwingen, der beweist damit eigentlich nur, dass er die Probleme der Bundesrepublik Deutschland nicht verstanden hat.

Moreira is a top Brazilian jockey based in Hong Kong, who rode Heartbreak City to the narrowest of second placings in the 2016 Melbourne Cup.

He was booked for strongly fancied international runner Thomas Hobson in the Melbourne Cup, but was unable to ride, and was replaced by local jockey Ben Allen, who is just 18.

Moreira, known as the ""Magic Man"" for his sublime riding ability, has flown back to Hong Kong with fellow Hong Kong-based rider, Zac Purton, the Aussie who steered Max Dynamite to third place in Tuesday's Melbourne Cup.

Tatsächlich will Präsident Erdogan bis 2021 ein türkisches Auto auf den Markt bringen

""Die Deutschen sind in Panik"", glaubt die türkische Tageszeitung ""Günes"". Der Grund: Die Regierung von Präsident Recep Tayyip Erdogan plant, ein in der Türkei produziertes Auto Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen. Spätestens 2021 sollen fünf heimische Unternehmen im Verbund das Elektroauto auf den Markt bringen.

Die Erdogan-nahe Zeitung ""Günes"" zeigte in ihrer Sonntagsausgabe Angela Merkel auf der Titelseite. ""Schau, wie wir das machen"", lautete die große Überschrift in schwarzen und roten Lettern. Die deutschen Medien hätten eine ""Schmutzkampagne"" gestartet, aus Angst vor dem neuen Konkurrenten auf dem Automobilmarkt, so der Vorwurf der Zeitung.

Tatsächlich hatten mehrere deutsche Medien in der vergangenen Woche über Erdogans Auto-Projekt berichtet.

Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, Leiter des Center Automotive Research (CAR) der Universität Duisburg-Essen, sagte der ""Welt"", das türkische Projekt sei ""Harakiri"". Es sei schade um das Geld, mindestens eine halbe Milliarde Euro werde ""einfach verbrannt"".

Schlechte Chancen für das Erdo-Car

Das größte Problem an dem Projekt: Im vergangenen Jahr seien in der Türkei lediglich 760.000 Autos verkauft worden. Zum Vergleich: In Deutschland gab es im gleichen Jahr 3,4 Millionen Neuzulassungen. Der heimische Markt alleine bietet somit nur bescheidene Absatzmöglichkeiten.

Bislang gibt es wenige Details über das türkische Auto, dessen Prototyp im Jahr 2019 fertiggestellt werden soll. Offenbar könnte es auf dem Aufbau des Saab 9-3 basieren, den die türkische Regierung im Jahr 2015 von der schwedischen Holdinggesellschaft National Electric Vehicle Sweden erworben hat.

Ob das der deutschen Industrie tatsächlich Sorgen bereitet, bleibt fraglich. Denn keines der fünf türkischen Unternehmen des Konsortiums verfügt über Erfahrungen beim Autobau.

Klerck collaborated with the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and The Elephant Project SA to construct her masterpiece.

The aim of her project was to raise awareness of the ongoing brutal killing of elephants, and to give people the opportunity to get a feeling of how majestic the animals are.

""Not too many people can gaze on an elephant in their lives. The life-size sculpture was an opportunity for them to see their beauty up close,"" she said.

Previously, Klerck was featured in the September 2013 issue of the British Cake Masters magazine, which has a worldwide readership of more than 1-million people.

She is also one of four top Cape Town cake designers chosen to vie for the title of ""Who's the Cape Cake Boss?"" at the 2012 Good Food and Wine Expo, judged by television celebrity ""Cake Boss"", Buddy Valastro.

She also owns a successful baking company called, ""Eat, Cake, Party"".

The 1.2-ton cake took her two weeks to make, with the help of her two assistants and her four children. Klerck used 1,200 eggs, 120kg of chocolate and 160kg of edible fondant.

""[The children] like it; it is exciting. When I do big projects, they make chocolate and clean-up."" she told HuffPost.

She initially made a rhino cake that turned heads for a client, and led to an invitation to showcase her Elephant Cake at the 2017 Good Food and Wine show in Cape Town.

All funds raised as a result of the enormous baking effort were donated to IFAW, which is the beneficiary organisation chosen by The Elephant Project SA.

Her 2018 projects will include a life-size cake depicting a pride of lions, with a lioness, a lion and cubs.

Ich weiß nur, dass mein Sohn den Jungen unterbrochen hat, aufgestanden ist und zu ihm sagte: ""Ich bin in einem Raum voller Muslime gesessen und ich habe mich vollkommen sicher gefühlt.""

Ein paar Tage zuvor waren wir bei einer ""Triff einen Muslim""-Veranstaltung. Sie wurde vom Crescent Peace Verein in unserem Ort ins Leben gerufen.

Mein Sohn hat bei dieser Veranstaltung viel über Muslime gelernt. Er konnte sich ein besseres Bild davon machen, von was für Menschen wir sprechen, wenn wir über amerikanische Muslime reden. Jetzt hatte er Gesichter vor Augen und diese Gesichter sehen freundlich aus und lächeln ihm zu.

Seit 9/11 hat die Angst vor Muslimen zugenommen

Sobald klar war, dass Donald Trump Präsident der Vereinigten Staaten werden würde, überkam mich ein starkes Gefühl von Übelkeit. Während des gesamten Wahlkampfes hat der Mann nur Hass gepredigt, er hat andere Menschen gedemütigt und empörende Aussagen gemacht. Nichts von alledem steht für das Amerika, an das ich glaube.

Also habe ich für mich beschlossen, dass ich mich mehr über Minderheiten in unserer Gesellschaft informieren möchte. Damit ich sie gegebenenfalls in Schutz nehmen kann, wenn jemand abfällig über sie redet.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: An die Münchnerin im Bus, die sich nicht von einem türkischen Jungen helfen lassen wollte

Ich bin schon öfter Zeuge von Islamophobie geworden. Seit dem 11. September 2001 scheinen viele Amerikaner zu glauben, dass die gesamte muslimische Religionsgemeinschaft für Terrorangriffe verantwortlich ist.

""Triff einen Muslim"" war eine tolle Gelegenheit, um mehr über die muslimische Gemeinde in meiner Stadt zu erfahren. Am Tag der Veranstaltung beschloss ich kurzerhand, meinen zehnjährigen Sohn mitzunehmen.

Menschen wie du und ich

Ich war überrascht, wie viele verschiedene Ausprägungen des Islams bei der Veranstaltung vertreten waren. Viele der anwesenden Muslime kamen als Migranten oder Flüchtlinge in die USA und haben später die Staatsbürgerschaft angenommen.

Andere waren afro-amerikanische Moslems, die konvertiert sind. Und natürlich waren viele Personen da, die in Amerika als Kind von Einwanderern geboren wurden. Es gab sogar einige weiße Amerikaner, die für ihren Ehepartner konvertiert sind - eine sehr heterogene Gruppe also.



Unter dem Motto ""Triff einen Muslim"" bringt der Crescent Peace Verein in Kansas verschiedengläubige Amerikaner zusammen, Bild: Laura Intfen

Wir saßen in Kleingruppen von fünf bis sechs Personen zusammen. Jedem Tisch war ein Muslim als eine Art Moderator zugeteilt. Unserer war vor kurzem Vater geworden. Er hatte seinen kleinen Sohn auf dem Schoß.

Der Mann führt ziemlich genau dasselbe Leben, wie mein Mann und ich: er arbeitet, kümmert sich um seine Kinder, treibt gerne Sport und erledigt die Einkäufe. Das Einzige, was ihn von uns unterscheidet, sind seine Religion und seine Hautfarbe.

Mir hat es sehr geholfen, mehr über den Islam zu erfahren. Ich muss gestehen, dass ich viele Dinge falsch aufgefasst hatte. Zum Beispiel wusste ich nicht, dass muslimische Frauen selbst entscheiden können, ob sie ein Kopftuch tragen wollen, oder nicht. Ich war immer davon ausgegangen, dass man es ihnen aufzwingt.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Du kannst mit Kopftuch keine Feministin sein"" - Doch, kann ich!

Sich mit Menschen zu unterhalten, die anders sind, als man selbst, die einer anderen Religion angehören oder aus einer anderen Kultur stammen, macht einen nicht nur schlauer, sondern schafft mehr Mitgefühl für andere.

""Ich lasse nicht zu, dass du so über sie sprichst""

An unserem Tisch saß auch ein Moslem im Teenager-Alter. Er war sehr geduldig mit meinem Sohn und hat sich bemüht, alle seine Fragen zu beantworten. Ob sie Weihnachten feiern -

Nein, aber ihnen gefallen die Dekorationen und die Musik - ob er oft versucht, seinen andersgläubigen Freunden seine Religion zu erklären - wenn sich die Gelegenheit bietet, aber so oft ist das nicht - und ob er schon einmal diskriminiert wurde - er konnte einige Beispiele nennen.

Auf der Heimfahrt sagte mir mein Sohn, dass er sich sehr gerne mit dem Jungen unterhalten hatte.

Darum konnte er es nicht stehen lassen, als sein Klassenkamerad behauptete, dass Muslime das Problem seien. Mein zehnjähriger Junge fühlte sich verpflichtet, den anderen aufzuklären: ""Die Muslime, die ich kennengelernt habe, waren sehr nett zu mir.""

""Sie gehen einfach nur in eine andere Kirche als du und ich lasse nicht zu, dass du so über sie sprichst."" Einige seiner Mitschüler haben ihm für seine Ansage applaudiert.

Als mir mein Sohn von dem Vorfall erzählte, gestand er, dass er ziemlich nervös gewesen war und dass seine Knie gezittert haben. Doch in diesem Moment dachte er an den Jugendlichen, den er auf der Veranstaltung getroffen hatte. Sein freundliches Gesicht war es, wofür mein Sohn an diesem Tag im Sportunterricht eingestanden ist.

Oft schauen wir auf gesellschaftliche Entwicklungen nur aus einer abstrakten Perspektive: Experten sprechen über Probleme anhand von Studien. Politiker loben, was gut läuft, anhand von grauen Statistiken - all das hat mit dem Alltag der Menschen, die von diesen Entwicklungen betroffen sind oder sie prägen, oft wenig zu tun. Diese Menschen kommen jetzt in der HuffPost zu Wort. Denn wie fühlt sich Armut in einem reichen Land jenseits der Statistiken an? Wie sieht Deutschland aus der Perspektive eines Obdachlosen aus? Vor welchen Problemen steht ein gerade angekommener Flüchtling? Wer hat mit seiner Initiative ein gravierendes Problem gelöst? All das ist Thema in HuffPost-Voices.

NEW DELHI -- All unwelcome physical contact cannot be called sexual harassment unless it is in the nature of a sexually oriented behaviour, the Delhi High Court has said.

Justice Vibhu Bakhru, who made the observation, also said even an accidental physical contact, though unwelcome, would not amount to sexual harassment.

""Similarly, a physical contact that has no undertone of a sexual nature and is not occasioned by the gender of the complainant may not necessarily amount to sexual harassment,"" the court said.

The observations by the Bench came during the hearing of an appeal by a Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) scientist challenging the clean chit given by the complaints committee and disciplinary authority to her former senior colleague, whom she had accused of sexual harassment.

Both of them were working in the CRRI, which is a part of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).

The allegation pertained to an incident of April 2005 when the man had entered the laboratory where the woman was working and had snatched samples from her hand, thrown the materials and pushed her out of the room.

The woman had contended that any unwelcome physical contact would amount to sexual harassment.

The Complaints Committee after examining her complaint had concluded that ""it was a case of altercation in the background of the uncongenial environment prevailing in the division.""

Terming the man's conduct as deplorable, it had also said while there was evidence of physical contact by the man, ""the same was not a sexually determined behaviour but was in the nature of an altercation.""

The disciplinary authority had accepted the committee's report and passed an order in October 2009 giving clean chit to the man accused of sexual harassment.

Agreeing with the committee's finding, the High Court said, ""Undoubtedly, physical contact or advances would constitute sexual harassment provided such physical contact is a part of the sexually determined behaviour. Such physical contact must be in the context of a behaviour which is sexually oriented.""

The court also rejected the woman's challenge to the constitution of the committee and the disciplinary authority, saying it finds no infirmity in their set-up.

More than 2,560 people were rescued in the Mediterranean Sea over the weekend in one of the roughest missions so far this year, the International Organization for Migration said Tuesday. Thirty-four bodies were recovered from the water, 26 of them suspected to be teenagers from Nigeria. Most died while making the crossing toward Italy in rubber dinghies.

IOM believes the girls may have been “murdered by traffickers in league with European sex merchants.”

Salvatore Malfi, the prefect of the Italian port city of Salerno, was skeptical of this theory but said it’s too early to come to any conclusion about whether the girls were headed for prostitution. The girls traveled with other men in the dinghy, he said, which makes the theory less likely.

“The sex trafficking routes are different,” he said. “Loading women onto a boat is too risky, the traffickers would not do it as they could lose all their ‘goods’ ― as they describe them ― in one fell swoop.”

Italian authorities told CNN that they launched an investigation into the girls’ deaths Tuesday, carrying out autopsies to determine whether they had been victims of sexual abuse or torture. They were all between 14 and 18 years old, said Salerno police chief Lorena Ciccotti.",Bodies Of 26 Female Teenage Migrants Found In The Mediterranean,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/07/bodies-of-26-female-teenage-migrants-found-in-the-mediterranean_a_23270133/

Ein paar Tage zuvor waren wir bei einer ""Triff einen Muslim""-Veranstaltung. Sie wurde vom Crescent Peace Verein in unserem Ort ins Leben gerufen.

Mein Sohn hat bei dieser Veranstaltung viel über Muslime gelernt. Er konnte sich ein besseres Bild davon machen, von was für Menschen wir sprechen, wenn wir über amerikanische Muslime reden. Jetzt hatte er Gesichter vor Augen und diese Gesichter sehen freundlich aus und lächeln ihm zu.

Seit 9/11 hat die Angst vor Muslimen zugenommen

Sobald klar war, dass Donald Trump Präsident der Vereinigten Staaten werden würde, überkam mich ein starkes Gefühl von Übelkeit. Während des gesamten Wahlkampfes hat der Mann nur Hass gepredigt, er hat andere Menschen gedemütigt und empörende Aussagen gemacht. Nichts von alledem steht für das Amerika, an das ich glaube.

Also habe ich für mich beschlossen, dass ich mich mehr über Minderheiten in unserer Gesellschaft informieren möchte. Damit ich sie gegebenenfalls in Schutz nehmen kann, wenn jemand abfällig über sie redet.

Ich bin schon öfter Zeuge von Islamophobie geworden. Seit dem 11. September 2001 scheinen viele Amerikaner zu glauben, dass die gesamte muslimische Religionsgemeinschaft für Terrorangriffe verantwortlich ist.

""Triff einen Muslim"" war eine tolle Gelegenheit, um mehr über die muslimische Gemeinde in meiner Stadt zu erfahren. Am Tag der Veranstaltung beschloss ich kurzerhand, meinen zehnjährigen Sohn mitzunehmen.

Menschen wie du und ich

Ich war überrascht, wie viele verschiedene Ausprägungen des Islams bei der Veranstaltung vertreten waren. Viele der anwesenden Muslime kamen als Migranten oder Flüchtlinge in die USA und haben später die Staatsbürgerschaft angenommen.

Andere waren afro-amerikanische Moslems, die konvertiert sind. Und natürlich waren viele Personen da, die in Amerika als Kind von Einwanderern geboren wurden. Es gab sogar einige weiße Amerikaner, die für ihren Ehepartner konvertiert sind - eine sehr heterogene Gruppe also.



Unter dem Motto ""Triff einen Muslim"" bringt der Crescent Peace Verein in Kansas verschiedengläubige Amerikaner zusammen, Bild: Laura Intfen

Wir saßen in Kleingruppen von fünf bis sechs Personen zusammen. Jedem Tisch war ein Muslim als eine Art Moderator zugeteilt. Unserer war vor kurzem Vater geworden. Er hatte seinen kleinen Sohn auf dem Schoß.

Der Mann führt ziemlich genau dasselbe Leben, wie mein Mann und ich: er arbeitet, kümmert sich um seine Kinder, treibt gerne Sport und erledigt die Einkäufe. Das Einzige, was ihn von uns unterscheidet, sind seine Religion und seine Hautfarbe.

Mir hat es sehr geholfen, mehr über den Islam zu erfahren. Ich muss gestehen, dass ich viele Dinge falsch aufgefasst hatte. Zum Beispiel wusste ich nicht, dass muslimische Frauen selbst entscheiden können, ob sie ein Kopftuch tragen wollen, oder nicht. Ich war immer davon ausgegangen, dass man es ihnen aufzwingt.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Du kannst mit Kopftuch keine Feministin sein"" - Doch, kann ich!

Sich mit Menschen zu unterhalten, die anders sind, als man selbst, die einer anderen Religion angehören oder aus einer anderen Kultur stammen, macht einen nicht nur schlauer, sondern schafft mehr Mitgefühl für andere.

""Ich lasse nicht zu, dass du so über sie sprichst""

An unserem Tisch saß auch ein Moslem im Teenager-Alter. Er war sehr geduldig mit meinem Sohn und hat sich bemüht, alle seine Fragen zu beantworten. Ob sie Weihnachten feiern -

Nein, aber ihnen gefallen die Dekorationen und die Musik - ob er oft versucht, seinen andersgläubigen Freunden seine Religion zu erklären - wenn sich die Gelegenheit bietet, aber so oft ist das nicht - und ob er schon einmal diskriminiert wurde - er konnte einige Beispiele nennen.

Auf der Heimfahrt sagte mir mein Sohn, dass er sich sehr gerne mit dem Jungen unterhalten hatte.

Darum konnte er es nicht stehen lassen, als sein Klassenkamerad behauptete, dass Muslime das Problem seien. Mein zehnjähriger Junge fühlte sich verpflichtet, den anderen aufzuklären: ""Die Muslime, die ich kennengelernt habe, waren sehr nett zu mir.""

""Sie gehen einfach nur in eine andere Kirche als du und ich lasse nicht zu, dass du so über sie sprichst."" Einige seiner Mitschüler haben ihm für seine Ansage applaudiert.

Als mir mein Sohn von dem Vorfall erzählte, gestand er, dass er ziemlich nervös gewesen war und dass seine Knie gezittert haben. Doch in diesem Moment dachte er an den Jugendlichen, den er auf der Veranstaltung getroffen hatte. Sein freundliches Gesicht war es, wofür mein Sohn an diesem Tag im Sportunterricht eingestanden ist.

Oft schauen wir auf gesellschaftliche Entwicklungen nur aus einer abstrakten Perspektive: Experten sprechen über Probleme anhand von Studien. Politiker loben, was gut läuft, anhand von grauen Statistiken - all das hat mit dem Alltag der Menschen, die von diesen Entwicklungen betroffen sind oder sie prägen, oft wenig zu tun. Diese Menschen kommen jetzt in der HuffPost zu Wort. Denn wie fühlt sich Armut in einem reichen Land jenseits der Statistiken an? Wie sieht Deutschland aus der Perspektive eines Obdachlosen aus?

Struggling against an orgy of shouting, clapping, and singing, the solemn weight of history dissolves in the deep shadows of the Gol Gumbaz. A royal tomb, the Gumbaz is sublimely grave in a way only maqbaras can be. Yet, after half a millennium it is also the sanctuary of a motley public. Despite its sepia magnificence, it is reinvented daily and is many things and places simultaneously.

And why not? Buildings, after all, do have a life of their own. They breathe and suffer, and are reborn with the communities who live in and around them. They change with the people who come to them as much, perhaps, as people are changed by their experiences of them. This infusion of character is constant and dynamic, and so the original creative intent becomes one amongst an unending matrix of meanings which emerge from brick and mortar.

This flux characterises Bijapur, a palimpsest notable for the legacies of the monumental Adil Shahs. The long shadows of memory and the tangible history of built form make the boundaries of past and present sfumato with constant use. From the Baran Kaman to the Taj Bauri, from Ibrahim Rauza to Gagan Mahal, the past speaks in Bijapur. It whispers of ambition, the seductions of power strange and terrible, desire and aspiration immortalised in stone. Born of vanity and vision, it symbolises a fusion of form, time, and space not only in terms of what was but also of what can be.

How do we imagine — spatially, economically, and affectively — the contours of such a fusion though? Who belongs to a city, and to whom do its edifices, not just its monuments but also buildings and infrastructure, belong? The law shelters the business of conservation from the commerce and traffic of daily life. Our conservation apparatus seems designed to institute alienation, and rarely does a neighbourhood, community, or people claim trusteeship over a building. We care about our homes, the houses we live in, but find it difficult to think of our cities as home, to care for the songs and shadows they surround us with.

The personal, therefore, is exiled from the communal, and the voice of memory and affect is unable to find a niche under the arch of history. In turning deaf to these voices, in seeing our past not as vibrantly alive but as delicately dead, we perform a grave disservice to our future. The Jami Masjid in Bijapur, for example, belongs both to the community of worshipers, as to the conservation apparatus which serves to memorialise it as a beacon of dakhini architecture. These meanings are not necessarily contrary, but that they often can be is a story local not just to Bijapur but to scores of cities across the subcontinent.

What is needed, then, is a marriage of interpretations and practice. Writing in 1889, Henry Cousens, then Superintendent of the Archaeological Survey of India (Western Circle), related that 'Bijapur has been called the Palmyra of the Dekhan'. In almost a century since, as the Palmyra lies devastated, the built legacy of Bijapur is at risk of an oblivion given the splintering of civic belonging and urban development. The manifold significance of the past is often in its ability to overwhelm, to instil a reverential awe which prompts interrogation and introspection. As we cloister these works and stories of our ancestors behind higher walls and turn blindly towards the future, we risk becoming harsher, meaner, and poorer.

Our heritage belongs to all of us. We cannot privilege one meaning and practice, without irrevocably losing the layered richness which grounds us organically to our communities and cities. The processes of use and interpretation have to be contextual, and it is through constant conversation alone that this erosion can be checked. How, for instance, do we make Taj Bauri relevant to the potable needs of residents without losing sight of the public generosity which informed its making? How do we reinvent Gol Gumbaz as a rendezvous point for a citizenry starved of safe public spaces? Can Baran Kaman become the breathing emblem of ambition which soars, and fails, and yet lives? The challenge at hand is to birth a future which sustains as much from the past as it loops back to it, where growth will aspire to be not from but with a common legacy. This challenge is monumental in itself, for it is not specific to Bijapur. It is ours, a shared task: it is a challenge to make the past one with the future.

Not just on Remembrance Day, but other times, too — as opportunities arise.
I will go to the Remembrance Day assembly at their school when I can.
We won't be putting up Christmas decorations until after Remembrance Day out of respect for veterans.
I will tell my kids that they might see me cry on Remembrance Day.","We are fast approaching one of the most important days of the year. A day to remember and reflect. A day to appreciate the men and women who currently serve to protect our beautiful country. And a day to remember those in the past who went off to war on our behalf, many of whom made the ultimate sacrifice. A sacrifice meant to keep Canada strong and free. A sacrifice paid for with blood and tears.

But how can I explain this to my school-age children? How can I impress upon them the importance of this very special day? I'll admit it's a heavy task. Here are some of the things I do to impress the importance of Remembrance Day upon my children.

1. I talk to them about it throughout the year.

Not just on Remembrance Day, but other times, too — as opportunities arise. This kind of discussion tends to be very short, simple and matter of fact with younger children, but as they get older I can really start to share some hard truths with them. Truths like the fact that in many different wars over the years, men and women went off to war for Canada. They left their moms, dads, wives, husbands and, in some cases, kids to trudge off to war. They left the comfort of their home for the cold, wet trenches and left the calm of Canada for the constant fear of war elsewhere.

These people were likely afraid. Very afraid. They were likely cold and hungry sometimes. They endured seeing friends die right next to them. They went to sleep each night not knowing if it would be their last. And they did all of this for us. For you and me and all of our fellow Canadians. And we should be grateful. Not just on Nov. 11 each year, but every day.

2. I make it personal (where possible).

If there is any relative or friend who fought for our country, I will tell my kids about them. I tell them about how my grandfather went to serve in the Second World War, leaving his wife and young son at home. He ended up training other soldiers and thankfully came home again. I also tell them about how my grandmother's brother was killed overseas during the Second World War. He was never returned to his family.

This is what sacrifice looks like, children. Real sacrifice.

I talk with my children about this family member who was lost in war to help them realize that the sacrifice is not abstract. It is not other families. Their very own great grandma, who they knew well, lost her younger brother to one of these wars. She and her family likely sent him off as a hero with fanfare and love, and then later got a letter saying he was killed in action. Killed overseas, a long way from home. This is what sacrifice looks like, children. Real sacrifice.

3. I will go to the Remembrance Day assembly at their school when I can.

When I am able to see what they are learning at school, then I can use our conversations at home to reinforce and even sometimes expand on what they've learned. I make sure we are at some ceremony every year. There are so few soldiers left from the World Wars. We need to honour these veterans while we can and learn from them. We need to hear the stories they share and keep their stories alive.

4. I will take them with me to buy poppies.

And we will buy new poppies every year. I used to wonder why poppies were so easy to lose and one year I even worked on figuring out a way to keep mine for the following year. Now I'm thinking why on earth would I do that? Buying new poppies every year is one of the ways that veterans collect donations and I am more than glad to buy them for my family each year. It's the very least I can do.

5. I will tell them why we fight wars.

I try to explain to my kids that Canada might be a very different place if our soldiers had not joined forces with other countries to fight against evil. I talk about why wars, though awful, are sometimes necessary. Our country might not have remained a place where people could feel safe holding true to their culture, religion and beliefs. This country could possibly be under totally different rule today. It took our soldiers, fighting alongside the soldiers of other brave countries, to enable us to continue to be the ""true north strong and free."" And I am grateful.

6. I will respect this time of year.

We won't be putting up Christmas decorations until after Remembrance Day out of respect for veterans. I explain this to my children so they know why we wait.

Thank a veteran today and let's be so grateful for all they've done for our great country.

7. I will tell them that war is still a reality.

I will be sure to let my children know that there are soldiers from Canada who are in the line of fire today. They are on peace keeping missions or are in war torn areas and they are in danger. They are risking their lives even now on behalf of our country.

8. I will tell my kids that they might see me cry on Remembrance Day.

When I am at a ceremony and the enormity of what's been done for us falls upon me, then sometimes there are tears. Embarrassing for you, my kids? Possibly. But I will never be sorry or ashamed for any single one of those tears. The soldiers who fought gave up so much more than tears. They gave their lives. Their last breath, their life's blood. Their families gave more tears than enough. The least I can do is cry.

Never forget, my children, that the peace and freedom we have in Canada, we owe to those who came before us. Those who bravely fought to make sure that no one could take it from us. Thank a veteran today and let's be so grateful for all they've done for our great country.

Lest we forget.

Selon les informations dévoilées dans les Paradise Papers, tout aurait commencé en 1997, alors que le réalisateur achevait le tournage de son film ""Sept ans au Tibet"". Dix jours avant la sortie dans les salles américaines, Jean-Jacques Annaud crée un ""trust"" baptisé ""Los Condores Trust"" et basé sur l'île de Guernesey. Au sein de ce trust, une société écran: Uspallata Limited.

C'est sur le compte de ""Los Condores Trust"" qu'a été versée la rémunération de Jean-Jacques Annaud pour ""Sept ans au Tibet"". ""Non pas à l'initiative de M. Annaud, mais à l'initiative du studio de cinéma"", ont précisé les avocats du réalisateur.

De l'Europe à Hong Kong, en passant par les îles Caïmans

Par la suite cependant, le montage fiscal prend une dimension internationale dont la chronologie correspond, comme le souligne Le Monde, aux différentes révélations sur les scandales off-shores qui ont secoué le monde de la finance ces dernières années.

En 2003, la société d'Uspallata est transférée de l'île de Guernesey vers les îles Vierges Britanniques, tandis que son siège social est lui déplacé aux Bahamas. ""Los Condores Trust"" prend lui dès juillet 2007 la direction des îles Caïmans, où il sera géré par la firme Appleby, au cœur des révélations des Paradise Papers.

Le trust sera cependant fermé dès 2015, tout comme la société Uspallata, dissoute l'année suivante. Qu'advient-il de l'argent? 1,33 million de dollars est transféré vers une nouvelle société ""Rising Dragon"" (qui deviendra par la suite Ginkgo Holdings Limited) créé fin 2014 à Hong-Kong. Quant au reste de la somme, il est envoyé à une société californienne détenue par Jean-Jacques Annaud, et elle-même succursale d'une autre société installée dans l'état du Delaware, connu pour sa réglementation fiscale avantageuse.

Contacté par Le Monde et RadioFrance avant la publication des Paradise Papers, Jean-Jacques Annaud a demandé à ses avocats de régulariser sa situation. Comme le précise le quotidien, les avoirs ""auraient finalement été déclarés au fisc français le 12 octobre"", ""afin d'éviter toute discussion et d'être dans la plus totale transparence"".

Northam beat Gillespie by a comfortable margin of 54 to 45 percent.

The stakes of the closely fought race were especially high for Democrats, who were desperate to hold on to a governorship in a state with a popular Democratic governor and where Hillary Clinton defeated Trump by 5 percentage points in 2016.

The outcome provides rank-and-file Democrats with a much-needed injection of optimism, averting the catastrophic scenario of another crucial loss.

It also deals a blow to the Trump-like right-wing populist playbook that Gillespie employed in his bid to win.

“Democrats were anxious all along, at the very end, about whether this thing would go their way, whether their core vote would turn out for them. And it did,” said Quentin Kidd, a political science professor at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia. “They’re breathing a sigh of relief.”

What’s more, the significant size of Northam’s win bodes well for Democrats across the country in the 2018 midterm elections, according to Kidd.

“Everything we thought was happening was actually happening,” he said. “There was a lot of pent up anger and frustration in the Democratic electorate.”

Win McNamee/Getty Images Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in the nation's closest watched election on Tuesday.

Northam had held a modest advantage in an average of major polls on Election Day. But the wide variation in individual polls toward the end of the contest spooked many Democrats who had anticipated a more certain victory.

Northam, 58, a pediatric neurologist and the current lieutenant governor, ran a mainstream Democratic campaign that emphasized his all-American biography. Northam is a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute who served as an Army doctor during Operation Desert Storm before establishing a practice in southeast Virginia’s Hampton Roads region.

Northam campaigned on continuing the work of Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who has presided over sustained economic growth and restored the voting rights of 168,000 former felons.

Northam also proposed increasing public school funding, providing tuition-free community college education in key areas of study for students who pledge a year of service, and using Affordable Care Act funds to expand Medicaid.

Northam will have the important opportunity to play a role the next time the state legislature redraws congressional and state districts in 2021. As governor, he will have the power to veto a plan submitted by the Republican legislature if he believes the makeup of the new districts is unduly partisan.

More than any one policy outcome, however, Northam’s win delights progressives for what it denies the GOP: another vindication of Trump-like race baiting.

Gillespie, 56, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and a Beltway lobbyist, once embodied the socially moderate, fiscally conservative establishment wing of the Republican Party. And to some extent, Gillespie maintained this profile, emphasizing economic policy on the stump, including a proposal to cut Virginia’s income tax rates by 10 percent across the board.

But in a bid to shore up a wayward right-wing base that nearly handed populist Corey Stewart the nomination in a tough GOP primary, Gillespie embraced the Trump playbook.

In a barrage of negative advertisements, Gillespie sought to paint Northam as a frightening radical who would enable convicted sex offenders, undocumented immigrants and members of the El Salvadoran gang MS-13 to run amok in the Old Dominion State. He also claimed that Northam wanted to take down the state’s Confederate monuments, despite Northam’s assurances that he would allow localities to decide.

Ultimately, Gillespie’s approach scared off too many of the voters he needed to win in the increasingly Democratic-leaning state.","Virginia Democrat Wins Race For Governor, Handing GOP First Major Loss Under Trump",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrat-ralph-northam-wins-virginia-governor-race_us_5a011456e4b07eb51181af95?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009

“Wir müssen bei diesem langjährigen und außerordentlich aktiven Trophäenjäger seltener Raubkatzen ein Exempel statuieren, sonst werden diese wundervollen Tiere für immer verschwinden. Ich habe diese Petition am Internationalen Tag des Schneeleoparden 2017 gestartet. Lasst uns alle zusammen arbeiten, damit dieser Mann bis zum Schneeleoparden-Tag 2018 zur Rechenschaft gezogen wird.”

Über 400 wilde Tiere

Wie viele Tiere Soudy in seiner Karriere insgesamt erlegt hat, ist unklar.

Allerdings stellt er laut ""Superslam"", einem Wettbewerb unter Wildjägern, die ihn 2003 mit einem Award ehrten, allein in seinem eigenen Museum 400 wilde Tiere 225 verschiedener Spezien aus.

TERA sieht den Trophäenjäger als ein Symbol der Wilddieberei, die mit ihren Errungenschaften Geld im Darknet verdienen. Daher ist ihr Ziel ihn als Beispiel vieler ins Gefängnis zu bringen. Obwohl das Erlegen des Wildtieres bereits vor einigen Jahren stattgefunden hat, würden Fälle der Wilddieberei nicht verjähren.

Obwohl sich Hossein Golabchi auf Anfrage vieler Medien zu dem Fall bisher nicht geäußert hat, gab TERA nun bekannt, dass er laut eigenen Angaben die Überreste des Leopards erst nach Deutschland gebracht und daraufhin nach Mexiko verschifft habe. Eine genaue detaillierte Stellungnahme werde momentan erwartet.

Vor dem Aussterben bedroht

Seit 1972 gilt der Schneeleopard als eine vor dem Aussterben bedrohte Tierart. Laut dem Naturschutzbund NABU gibt es in ganz Asien nur noch rund 4.000 frei lebende Schneeleoparden. Allein in Kirgistan sank die Zahl der Wildkatzen in 30 Jahren von 1.400 auf nur noch rund 300 Exemplare.

Wenn ihr auch etwas gegen die illegale Jagd auf die Tiere unternehmen wollt, könnt ihr hier die Petition von PERA gegen Hossein Golabchi unterschreiben oder euch hier bei Tierschutzorganisationen wie NABU oder WWF über weitere Möglichkeiten der Unterstützung informieren.

Invece circa la metà dei pazienti a un certo punto smette di assumere il farmaco, oppure si aggiusta la dose o ancora salta alcune assunzioni. Gli specialisti la chiamano ""aderenza"" alle terapie e in tutte le branche mediche il fenomeno è sempre lo stesso, più della metà degli ammalati perde motivazione. Talora perché l'assunzione è dolorosa o complicata (le terapie iniettive hanno una aderenza più bassa di quelle per bocca, le cure croniche sono soggette a dimenticanze così come quando i farmaci da assumere sono più di uno), altre volte insorgono effetti collaterali spiacevoli per esempio il bruciore di stomaco. I fattori sono numerosi.

Nonostante siano state messe a punto varie strategie sembra che della compliance non si riescano a spostare i numeri che di pochissimi punti percentuali mentre aumentano i costi correlati: chi non assume adeguatamente le terapie infatti tende a guarire meno in fretta, a non guarire affatto, ad avere ricadute, ospedalizzazioni sino alla mortalità precoce. Un bel problema.

Succede però che alle volte a problemi complessi basti applicare soluzioni semplici: almeno è quello che sostiene Cameron Smyres dell'Università della California che insieme ad un gruppo di collega dei reparti di emergenza e pronto soccorso ha esaminato 1268 pazienti nell'arco di 18 mesi scoprendo che quando i medici si soffermavano a spiegare l'azione del farmaco prescritto e la sua importanza nel caso specifico l'adesione alle cure migliorava significativamente. Un risultato così rilevante da guadagnarsi una presentazione alla riunione annuale dell'American College of Emergency Medicine.

Rispetto a quelli che ricevevano la prescrizione senza spiegazioni aggiuntive, i pazienti informati erano propensi in misura doppia a seguire le indicazioni mediche e tra coloro che consideravano il medicamento 'molto importante' l'adesione era del 95%, contro il 55% di quelli che non percepivano la prescrizione come tale. La soluzione è quindi abbastanza semplice, purchè siano addestrati medici e infermieri che abbiano il tempo necessario a motivare la propria scelta terapeutica e magari a rispondere a qualche domanda del paziente, incoraggiata se necessario, al momento della dimissione.

Il fenomeno noto come ""patient engagement"" ossia coinvolgimento del paziente passa attraverso una modalità di scambio di informazioni che sia al livello delle capacità di comprensione del soggetto. Secondo uno studio del 2013 sulla rivista ""Health Affairs"", i pazienti che sono stati incoraggiati a rivedere le opzioni e sono stati più coinvolti nelle scelte hanno costi medici più bassi del 5,3% a cui si è aggiunto un 12,5% in meno di ricoveri ospedalieri e un minor numero di interventi di chirurgia elettiva.

Una revisione sistematica riporta che nel 63% degli studi inclusi la maggior parte dei pazienti esprimeva il desiderio di partecipare attivamente alle decisioni terapeutiche che li riguardavano, con un trend in progressivo aumento: dal 50% al 73% degli studi pubblicati prima e dopo il 2000 (3). Il dato emerge in particolare per i pazienti oncologici: nell'85% dei 27 studi pubblicati a partire dal 2000 la maggior parte dei pazienti desiderava essere coinvolto nelle decisioni terapeutiche.","Dottore, non ho preso le medicine.

Die einzige Behandlung, die ihn noch retten könnte, ist in Deutschland nicht zugelassen

Deshalb ist die Familie jetzt extra nach Seattle geflogen - und hofft auf eure Hilfe

Margit und Andreas Fischer haben nicht eine Sekunde gezögert, als sie sich in der Haunerschen Kinderklinik in München entscheiden mussten, ob ihr Sohn leben oder sterben soll. Raphael ist zwei Jahre alt und leidet an einer besonders aggressiven Form des Blutkrebses, der sogenannten akuten lymphatischen Leukämie (ALL).

Weil die Behandlungen in Deutschland nicht mehr anschlugen und es dadurch nur noch wenig Hoffnungen für den Jungen gab, empfahlen die Ärzte eine letzte Alternative: eine neuartige dreimonatige Immunbehandlung an der Westküste in Amerika.

Für die Eltern gab es keine Diskussionen. Ihr Sohn soll leben. Seit gut einer Woche ist die Familie jetzt an der Westküste der USA, um sich auf die Therapie vorzubereiten.

Raphael hat schon fünf Monate Chemo-Therapie hinter sich

Raphaels Leiden begann bereits, als er fünf Monate alt war. Nachdem eine Bronchitis bei ihm diagnostiziert worden war und wochenlang nicht verging, veranlasste der Kinderarzt eine Blutuntersuchung. Dabei machte er die schockierende Diagnose:

Raphael leidet an akuter lymphatischer Leukämie. Eine schmerzvolle und belastende Zeit begann für die Familie, die noch bis heute anhält.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Meine Tochter hatte Krebs - jetzt kämpft sie für andere Kinder

Der kleine Raphael musste einen fünfmonatigen Chemoblock, zwei Antikörperbehandlungen sowie zwei Knochenmarktransplantationen über sich ergehen lassen.

Zwar gab es Hoffnungsschimmer wie die Knochenmarkspende von seiner Mutter, die die Erkrankung vermeintlich bekämpfen konnte. Doch am Ende zeigte sich der Krebs widerspenstig. Die bösen Zellen waren wieder da.

Das soll sich jetzt im etwa 8500 Kilometer von Aschau entfernten Seattle ändern. Die Behandlung, die er jetzt bekommen soll, kann gefährliche Nebenwirkungen aufweisen. Doch in ähnlichen Fällen war sie bereits erfolgreich und führte zur Heilung.

Erst kürzlich wurde die Immuntherapie in den USA zugelassen. Laut Fachmedien zeigten klinische Studien, dass sie bei mehr als 80 Prozent der Patienten angeschlagen habe. Für Raphael ist diese Therapie die letzte Chance, den Blutkrebs endgültig zu besiegen.

Die Reise in die USA war für die Familie eine zusätzliche große Last. Doch sie war nötig. Denn in Deutschland ist die Behandlung derzeit weder zugelassen, noch können Kinder im Rahmen von klinischen Studien behandelt werden.

Margit und Andreas Fischer wollen erreichen, dass nicht nur Raphael, sondern auch andere Kinder mit Leukämie in Deutschland eine solche Chance bekommen.

Kinder wie Raphael sollten auch hier behandelt werden

Deshalb haben sie sich mit der gemeinnützigen Stiftung ""Care for Rare"" in Verbindung gesetzt und rufen zu Spenden auf. Die Stiftung setzt sich dafür ein, dass Kinder mit seltenen Erkrankungen nicht leiden oder gar sterben sollten.

Denn gerade weil ihre Erkrankung so selten ist, sollten sie noch mehr Aufmerksamkeit bekommen. Die Familie will eine Plattform für neue Immuntherapien am Haunerschen Kinderspital errichten, damit in Zukunft Kinder wie Raphael zur Behandlung nicht mehr in die USA geschickt werden müssen.

In Seattle beginnt bald Raphaels Therapie. Er musste wieder eine Chemotherapie über sich ergehen lassen, um die Krebszellen vor dem Therapiestart einzudämmen und ist daher etwas schwach. Die Familie und die Ärzte aber sind voller Hoffnung: Raphael soll leben.

His case kicked off this entire citizenship circus currently turning Federal Parliament into a national laughing stock, but former Greens senator Scott Ludlam said he has been enjoying watching the controversy unfold as he posts hilarious memes from the sidelines.

""I loved that job and the people I was working with, so it was a wrench to have it suddenly gone. On the other hand, I've had plenty of time to savour the slow and richly deserved disintegration of the Government, so that's something,"" Ludlam told HuffPost Australia.

Ludlam, a Greens senator for Western Australia, resigned from parliament in July after discovering he held New Zealand citizenship. This breached section 44 of the constitution, and meant he was ineligible for election. Two days later, his Greens colleague in Queensland, Larissa Waters, also resigned after realising her Canadian citizenship.

Since then, more than a dozen federal MPs have had questions raised about their potential dual citizenship, and four other politicians -- Malcolm Roberts, Fiona Nash, Barnaby Joyce and Stephen Parry -- have been forced to leave parliament after their own citizenship status was revealed.

Ludlam has kept a low public profile since he revealed his citizenship dramas and immediately resigned from the parliament, in contrast to Roberts, Nash and Joyce who resisted calls to resign and instead waited for a High Court judgement.

The former WA senator has been active on Twitter, though, shooting out a number of memes and barely concealing his thoughts on the ever-growing controversy.

On Monday, after Liberal MP John Alexander became the latest member to become embroiled in the section 44 mess, Ludlam tweeted the 'disaster girl' meme of a young child in front of a burning house. The meme is often used to denote someone enjoying the situation they have created -- as Know Your Meme explains, the image of the girl is often ""superimposed on to images of natural disasters and accidents to imply that she has caused some type of calamity depicted in the background"".

Ludlam said he had felt ""a mix of bewilderment, regret and increasing amounts of schadenfreude"" in watching the dual citizenship drama unfold. He said, since resigning from parliament, he had split his time between ""a lot of handover and transitional stuff, reading, thinking, writing, and occasional undisciplined shitposting.""

Just days after he resigned from the Senate, he tweeted a GIF of falling dominoes, a seemingly prescient post considering the number of politicians who have fallen in his wake.

He has also posted a number of jokes since, jokingly taking credit for bringing the often-ignored section 44 to light.

He even dropped a gag in response to another Twitter user asking ""have you just come close to bringing down the Government"".

""Trust [in Government] was already in short supply before this latest shambles. This hasn't helped matters, and I know I carry a measure of responsibility for that. The Government could have cauterised this mess by agreeing to an immediate audit, which is surely where this needs to end up,"" Ludlam said.

""There's more to come, it seems. Now it's playing into internal fault lines within the Coalition, which is deeply destabilising for the country and also means Kevin Andrews' head is on television a lot more.""

The former senator has not outlined any plans to return to politics, unlike Waters who has signalled she would like to remain in the arena, and is still weighing up his options.

ALLOCATIONS FAMILIALES - Détourner un système de détection de fraude peut avoir du bon. Selon Europe1, c'est d'ailleurs ce que la Caisse d'Allocations Familiales s'apprête à faire pour détecter non pas les fraudeurs, mais les particuliers éligibles à des allocations et qui ne les ont pas demandées.

Pour identifier les fraudes, l'organisme de prestations sociales utilise la technique du ""data-mining"", qui permet d'établir des ""profils types"" de fraudeurs grâce à des calculs mathématiques. Cette méthode a déjà fait ses preuves, puisqu'en 2016, la CAF a détecté 8% de fraudes en plus, sans que le nombre de fraudeurs augmente pour autant.

Mais c'est dans un autre but que le procédé devrait bientôt être appliqué à l'échelle nationale. Après une première expérimentation en Gironde ces derniers mois, les chiffres sont éloquents: sur plusieurs centaines de familles prises comme échantillon, 12% d'entre elles ne font pas valoir la totalité de leurs droits, notamment lorsque cela concerne le RSA ou la prime d'activité.

Or, depuis le lancement du test dans le département, la CAF estime que les familles éligibles et qui ont par la suite fait la demande ont reçu en moyenne 210 euros par mois.

Un procédé à double tranchant

Fière de ses résultats, la Caisse d'Allocation Familiale envisage donc d'élargir le procédé à la France entière.

""Ça a du sens de montrer qu'aujourd'hui, avec les techniques de 'big data', on peut aller plus loin dans l'application des principes de solidarité et d'égalité aux droits"", explique Daniel Lenoir, directeur général de la Caisse nationale des allocations familiales, à Europe1.

Toutefois, en septembre 2017, le défenseur des Droits Jacques Toubon mettait en garde contre les dérives éventuelles du ""data mining"". ""La rationalisation des contrôles, préférée aux actions de prévention, peut parfois revêtir un caractère discriminatoire"", indiquait-il alors dans son rapport, en plaidant pour la prise en compte du droit à l'erreur ou à l'oubli, et pour une meilleure information des demandeurs de prestations sociales.

""Nous allongeons la limite du nombre de caractères ! Nous voulons que ce soit plus facile et plus rapide pour tout le monde de s'exprimer"", a tweeté le groupe sur son compte mardi. De son côté, son patron-fondateur Jack Dorsey a tweeté plus sobrement ""140+140!"".

""Notre but était de rendre (l'allongement) possible tout en s'assurant que l'on conservait la vitesse et la brièveté qui font de Twitter, Twitter. En regardant les résultats (du test), nous sommes ravis d'annoncer que nous avons atteint notre but et que nous lançons le changement dans toutes les langues"" où la limite des 140 caractères posait problème aux utilisateurs, a écrit sur son blog le réseau social, qui avait lancé un test auprès de certains utilisateurs en septembre.

""Les premiers jours du test, beaucoup de gens ont tweeté en 280 caractères parce que c'était nouveau mais rapidement, cela s'est normalisé"", détaille le groupe. ""Nous avons observé que lorsque les gens avaient besoin de plus de 140 caractères, ils tweetaient plus facilement et plus souvent"", poursuit le groupe, qui tente de se relancer alors qu'il perd toujours de l'argent.

Seuls 7% des tweets en français atteignent 140 caractères

Paradoxalement, l'entreprise se réjouit aussi du fait que les utilisateurs test ont néanmoins continué à poster majoritairement des messages en moins de 140 caractères, préservant ainsi ""la brièveté"" de Twitter, qui le distingue, par exemple, de Facebook.

Twitter s'attend donc à ce que la nouvelle limite soit finalement peu utilisée par les twittos. L'allongement ne concerne que les messages en caractères latins, rappelle le réseau, car c'est surtout en anglais, espagnol, portugais ou français que la limite de 140 caractères semble poser parfois souci aux utilisateurs, contrairement à ceux qui écrivent en japonais, coréen ou chinois, langues plus compactes.

9% des tweets en anglais et 7% en français atteignent 140 caractères, des proportions qui tombent à environ 1% avec le passage à 280, assure aussi le groupe basé à San Francisco, dans l'ouest des Etats-Unis.

Twitter estime que la limite à 140 caractères fait perdre du temps à l'utilisateur, qui doit modifier ou couper son message, au risque de se décourager et de ne pas tweeter du tout. Comme lors de l'annonce du test en septembre, l'annonce de Twitter a suscité une avalanche de réactions sur le réseau, beaucoup d'utilisateurs s'amusant à tester la nouvelle longueur.

Très actif sur le réseau social, où il poste des messages plusieurs fois par jour, Donald Trump utilise la plateforme pour des annonces majeures de politique intérieure et internationale, mais aussi pour critiquer des alliés, railler des adversaires et menacer la Corée du Nord.

Nicolas Mesly, reporter et photographe

Hugo Jolion-David, journaliste vidéo



« C’est un drame, parce que c’est d’abord la perte d’une vie humaine. Et puis c’est une entreprise agricole de moins sur notre territoire », résume Jean Poirier, maire de Saint-Basile, un village d’environ 2600 âmes dans la région de Portneuf, et dont la moitié de l’économie tourne autour de l’agriculture.



Peu avant Noël dernier, Rudy Ducreux, un jeune agriculteur d’origine française, mettait fin à ses jours en se pendant dans l’atelier de sa ferme, la ferme Ducrêt, située à un jet de pierre de la mairie.



Pour les gens du milieu, ce jeune agriculteur était une étoile filante dans le firmament des fromagers québécois. « C’était quelqu’un d’assez réservé. Mais dès que vous parliez d’agriculture, vous constatiez combien il était passionné! Ses fromages au lait cru, dont Le Gaulois de Portneuf, étaient exceptionnels, irremplaçables. On ne peut pas se permettre de perdre des gens comme lui », raconte Charles Trottier, copropriétaire de la Fromagerie Des Grondines qui, partageant la même profession, l’a bien connu.



Les deux fromagers artisans ont passé à travers la crise de la listériose de 2008, qui a fait 2 morts et 38 malades, et où le gouvernement a fait jeter aux poubelles des milliers de kilogrammes de fromage. Dans un rapport sur la gestion de cette crise (2010), le ministère de l’Agriculture, des Pêcheries et de l’Alimentation (MAPAQ) exonérait les fromages au lait cru en identifiant la bactérie coupable, le pulsovar 93, une souche de la bactérie Lysteria monocytigene, provenant de fromages au lait pasteurisé. Mais le mal était fait, le Québec ne compte plus aujourd’hui, avec le départ de Rudy Ducreux, que quatre ou cinq fromagers au lait cru, selon Normand Côté, président de l’Association des fromagers artisans du Québec, qui regroupe une trentaine de membres.



Pour opérer notre fromagerie, j'ai besoin de 16 à 17 permis différents.

– Charles Trottier



Un métier sous très haute tension



Le métier de fromager-artisan relève des 12 travaux d’Hercule. Il faut traire des vaches 2 fois par jour, 365 jours par année, car on ne peut pas fermer le pis des vaches comme l’eau d’un robinet. Il faut ensuite fabriquer son fromage dans des conditions hygiéniques aussi salubres qu’une salle d’opération d’hôpital. Et il faut l’emballer, le distribuer et le vendre dans les boutiques spécialisées ou les restaurants.



« C’est trois métiers dans un », explique Charles Trottier. Sans compter qu’il faut composer avec le stress de la météo, la ferme étant une usine à ciel ouvert, pour produire des fourrages et des grains afin d’alimenter les vaches.



C'est dans l'établi de sa ferme que le jeune agriculteur Rudy Ducreux a mis fin à ses jours.



De plus, ce métier s’exerce sous une charge administrative kafkaïenne. « Pour opérer notre fromagerie, j’ai besoin de 16 à 17 permis différents, dont un de fabrication du ministère de l’Agriculture, un permis du ministère de l’Environnement, un permis de transport du lait, de vente au détail, de l’organisme de certification biologique, de la municipalité… » poursuit Charles Trottier.



Comme si cette lourdeur administrative ne suffisait pas, la décision du gouvernement Trudeau de permettre l’importation de 16 000 tonnes métriques de fromages fins en provenance d’Europe dès le 21 septembre prochain sous l’Accord économique et commercial entre le Canada et l’Union européenne (AECG) risque de faucher plusieurs fromagers artisanaux du terroir québécois. « Cette importation, c’est l’équivalent de 640 fermes comme la nôtre. Il est illusoire de penser que nous ne serons pas affectés », croit Charles Trottier.



Depuis ses débuts, l’homme d’affaires a investi 1,8 million $ dans la fromagerie, dont 750 000 $ depuis deux ans, entre autres pour construire une nouvelle étable. Et il compte sur sa clientèle québécoise -- plus de 30 000 personnes visitent la fromagerie chaque année -- pour survivre.



Contrairement à Charles Trottier, qui dit travailler plus de 105 à 110 heures par semaine pour faire tourner la fromagerie avec son associé et une vingtaine d’employés, « Rudy, lui, opérait seul, avec l’énergie de la jeunesse ».



C’est peut-être parce qu’il devait se battre envers et contre tous que Rudy Ducreux avait surnommé son produit vedette « Le Gaulois de Portneuf », gagnant d’un prix Caseus (2011), sorte de Jeux olympiques annuels du fromage.



Charles Trottier, co-propriétaire de la Fromagerie Des Grondines, a bien connu Rudy Ducreux, un champion fromager.



Combien d’agriculteurs se suicident?

« Je ne sais pas dans quelle mesure le cas de Rudy Ducreux est représentatif de l’état psychologique de l’ensemble des producteurs laitiers du Québec », dit Ginette Lafleur, doctorante au Centre de recherche et d’intervention sur le suicide et l’euthanasie (CRISE) à l’UQAM. Si les fromagers artisans ne transforment qu’une goutte de lait produite par les quelque 5 600 fermes laitières du Québec, ils sont le porte-étendard d’une industrie qui génère près de 30 % de toutes les recettes agricoles de la province.



Selon la doctorante, le métier d’agriculteur est reconnu comme l'un des plus à risque de stress à cause d’éléments incontrôlables comme la météo. Mais la mondialisation, les traités commerciaux, le prix du lait, le prix du quota, l’endettement des entreprises, les changements technologiques, les conflits familiaux, les chicanes de couple ou l’isolement sont tous des facteurs de stress qui s’additionnent et font grimper le taux de la détresse psychologique. « Jusqu’à ce que l’élastique pète », explique celle qui a étudié le malaise des agriculteurs tant au Québec qu’en France et en Suisse1.



Toutefois, la seule étude disponible sur le taux de suicide des agriculteurs québécois indiquait qu’il était le double de celui des hommes dans la population générale québécoise. Mais cette étude2 réalisée par Santé Canada date de trente ans (1971-1987). Le problème, pour obtenir l’heure juste, c’est que l’Institut national de la santé publique du Québec ne comptabilise pas les suicides par profession. En 2014, 845 Québécois se sont enlevé la vie et, depuis 1981, cette triste statistique annuelle oscille entre 795 et 1284 hommes.



Parmi les pays développés, la France s’est toutefois dotée en 2013 d’un Observatoire national du suicide qui dénombre 417 suicides chez les hommes agriculteurs entre 2007 à 2009, surtout dans les élevages de bovins.



Rudy Ducreux, l’arbre qui cache la forêt?



Notre enquête révèle cependant que le phénomène du suicide des agriculteurs existe bel et bien dans la campagne québécoise. Parlez-en à Laurier Gauthier, un voisin de Rudy Ducreux. L’homme de 67 ans est producteur de lait et copropriétaire avec ses frères de la seconde plus grosse érablière de la Belle Province. Il a offert de nous accompagner à la ferme Ducrêt.

La vraie raison profonde, les gens partent avec.

– Laurier Gauthier

En chemin, à bord de son camion, M. Gauthier lance devant la ferme d’un de ses voisins. « Lui aussi il s’est suicidé. Puis pourtant, il avait de l’argent plein les poches. Il venait de s’acheter une Cadillac. Un bon matin, on apprend qu’il s’était tiré un coup de 22 en arrière des oreilles. Surprise totale ». Il ajoute avoir connu six personnes, dont cinq producteurs et un employé de ferme, qui se sont enlevé la vie dans un rayon de 12 kilomètres de son entreprise.



Quant au geste irrémédiable de Rudy Ducreux, M. Gauthier l’explique peut-être par une charge de travail trop lourde pour un seul homme, mais, « la vraie raison profonde, les gens partent avec », dit-il. Maire de Saint-Basile durant une trentaine d’années, le producteur pointe du doigt l’actuel contexte socio-économique comme facteur important de détresse psychologique chez les producteurs agricoles. Il reproche à Québec, depuis le règne du ministre de l’Agriculture péquiste Jean Garon (1976-1985), champion de la souveraineté alimentaire, de nommer des ministres de l’Agriculture à temps partiel ou ignorant des enjeux.



Quant au fédéral, le producteur se demande jusqu’où Ottawa, dans l’actuelle renégociation de l’ALENA exigée par le président Donald Trump, est prêt à défendre la gestion de l’offre et ne pas la sacrifier au profit des secteurs du bois d’œuvre, de l’automobile ou de l’aviation.



Nous arrivons à la ferme Ducrêt. Rudy Ducreux avait acheté en 2004 la ferme de Luc Mailloux, un ex-fromager au lait cru, et frère du psychiatre controversé Pierre « Doc » Mailloux. Sur place, nous sommes accueillis par Connie McLellan, une jeune agricultrice de 28 ans originaire de Nouvelle-Écosse. Elle hésite à parler au journaliste, selon les conseils de l’avocat engagé par la succession « pour ne pas nuire à la vente de la ferme », prévue d’ici l’automne. Le corps de Rudy Ducreux a depuis longtemps été rapatrié par la famille.



Connie McLellan, une jeune productrice, s'occupe du troupeau de Rudy Ducreux.



La jeune femme explique avoir été recrutée pour traire le troupeau de 26 bêtes. À part le cliquetis des chaînes des vaches à l’étable, le silence règne autour de la maison, de la fromagerie, de l’établi et des remises désertés. Seul un chat en manque de caresses nous suit d’un bâtiment à l’autre.



Dans les champs adjacents, de la machinerie rouille au milieu de hautes herbes. Et on peut apercevoir de nouvelles plantations d’arbres sur les terres voisines autrefois cultivées. Comme l’arbre qui cache la forêt, le suicide du créateur du Gaulois de Portneuf cache un pan de l’agriculture québécoise en péril.

Wimbledon, 5 juillet 1980: le spectaculaire John McEnroe affronte l'insubmersible suédois Björn Borg en quête d'un cinquième sacre consécutif à Londres. Un affrontement grandiose resté dans l'histoire du tennis, mis en lumière par Janus Metz Pedersen, le réalisateur du film ""Borg/McEnroe"" qui sort en France ce mercredi 8 novembre.

Ce thriller tennistique -incarné à l'écran par Sverrir Gudnason et Shia LaBoeuf- raconte la rivalité entre une star montante du tennis et le meilleur joueur de l'époque. On y découvre un John McEnroe provocateur, génial, volcanique et admiratif d'un Björn Borg au sommet de son art. Le Suédois, surnommé ""Ice Borg"" en raison de son caractère imperturbable, mystérieux... presque mystique, apparaît comme l'exact opposé de son rival.

Le duel Borg-McEnroe est celui de la glace et du feu. Borg est droitier, McEnroe gaucher. Le premier est un métronome qui anéantit les intentions adverses, alors que le second est un attaquant flamboyant aimanté par le filet. Un duel entre ""gentleman"" et ""rebelle"" comme seul le tennis peut en produire, raconté avec passion et psychologie à travers un match d'anthologie.

Outre la dimension sportive de cette rivalité, le film met en lumière la difficulté pour un sportif de gérer la pression du haut niveau.

Le burn-out de Borg

Björn Borg apparaît en effet fatigué par les sollicitations permanentes dues à son statut de rockstar du tennis. Une situation délicate à gérer pour lui et son entourage, qui l'a d'ailleurs poussé à mettre un terme à sa carrière le 23 janvier 1983 à seulement 26 ans.

""Il était exaspéré par les sollicitations. Il a porté ce poids sans ne rien faire paraître pendant des années. Et puis il y a eu un trop plein"", raconte Jean Couvercelle, fondateur de Tennis magazine et ami de Björn Borg au HuffPost. ""Il était sollicité en permanence. Il aimait la vie, il aimait sortir, mais c'était rarissime: son comportement, son allure, son physique, son jeu, tout l'exposait au regard des autres et aux questions"", explique-t-il.

Aligné en Coupe Davis dès ses 15 ans, Björn Borg est l'un des premiers tennisman à avoir commencé sa carrière aussi tôt. L'un des premiers également a consacrer toute sa vie et tous ses efforts à son sport. Une précocité, un travail acharné et un caractère plutôt introverti peuvent être les facteurs de cette lassitude et de ce brun-out, un phénomène assez méconnu dans le sport mais qui touche de plus en plus d'athlètes.

Un phénomène qui semble s'étendre

En mai 2017, un joueur de foot sur trois était au bord du burn-out, selon une étude du syndicat international des footballeurs. En dehors des pelouses, André Agassi, Yannick Noah, Novak Djokovic, Marion Bartoli, Laure Manaudou... tous ont connu des épisodes de dépression ou de burn-out plus ou moins longs au cours de leur carrière. ""Ce phénomène a toujours existé, mais désormais, on met des mots dessus"", estime la docteure en psychologie du sport Sophie Huguet au HuffPost.

Plusieurs facteurs semblent désormais étendre ce phénomène. Le Dr Vincent Gouttebarge, chef médical du syndicat des footballeurs explique que ""600 facteurs spécifiques"" pouvant entraîner des troubles psychologiques chez les sportifs ont ainsi été identifiés. Parmi eux ""les blessures graves, des mauvaises conditions de travail, la pression du résultat, des médias, du public... ​​​​​​"", explique-t-il à So Foot.

""Les sportifs sont repérés de plus en plus tôt. Ils commencent les compétitions plus jeunes, et la pression des parents se fait, dans certains cas, de plus en plus forte"", explique pour sa part Sophie Huguet qui pointe les disciplines de ""souffrance"" comme l'athlétisme, la natation ou la gymnastique en particulier. Des sports pratiqués dès l'enfance, qui peuvent avoir tendance à lasser, voire dégoûter les athlètes lorsqu'ils atteignent le haut niveau.

""On ne montre pas la faiblesse""

À cela s'ajoute la pression médiatique, les sollicitations du public et l'exigence de résultat. ""Ces sportifs aiment jouer mais ils ne sont pas forcément enclins à être devant les médias"", résume Sophie Huguet qui pointe également la pression des sponsors et l'exigence pour les meilleurs de rester au sommet.

Malgré cela, il existe une certaine omerta dans le monde du sport. ""L'image d'un sportif qui fait un burn-out va à l'encontre de l'image de l'homme d'exploit et de performance qu'il véhicule en temps normal. Donc on ne montre pas les images de faiblesse"", explique Sophie Huguet. Elle estime, par ailleurs, que si les sportifs se taisent c'est aussi parce que leur mal-être pourrait être incompris par des fans qui voit en eux des personnes privilégiées.

Cependant, malgré les univers masculins comme celui du football dans lesquels ""on n'affiche pas forcément ses états d'âmes"", ""les sportifs parlent de plus en plus du fait qu'ils ne sont pas invincibles"", estime Sophie Huguet. Teddy Riner confie par exemple, ""travailler avec un psychologue pour gérer au mieux la pression"", depuis son adolescence. Le genre de témoignage qui ""font bouger les choses"", selon elle.","Le film ""Borg/McEnroe"" montre le burn-out de Björn Borg, et il n’est pas le seul sportif dans ce cas",http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/11/07/le-film-borg-mcenroe-montre-le-burn-out-de-bjoern-borg-et-il-n-est-pas-le-seul-sportif-dans-ce-cas_a_23258595/

BHOPAL -- In light of the horrific gang-rape of a 19-year-old girl, a city Superintendent of Police (CSP) and three Town Inspectors (SHOs in other states) have faced action. The inspectors who head MP Nagar, Habibganj and GRP police stations have been suspended. The CSP (DSP rank) has been removed and sent to the police headquarters.

Action was taken over the delay in registering an FIR, the harassment caused to the girl and her family. They were turned away from police stations, and despite the horrific crime, and the policemen didn't give a patient hearing to her, let alone registering case.

The actions were taken on directions from Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan

The girl was gangrape and later abandoned near the railway track in Bhopal.

Four men accosted the girl, who is pursuing graduation and preparing for civil services exam, when she was returning from her tuition classes. The accused cornered and overpowered her, took her to a desolate spot near the railway track, close to the Habibganj station, and raped her.

The survivor somehow managed to drag herself to the police station and informed her parents, both of whom are police personnel.

The accused escaped, leaving the injured girl in the bushes near the railway track, close to Railway Protection Force (RPF) police station.

The survivor somehow managed to drag herself to the police station and informed her parents, both of whom are police personnel.

Still, none of the two police stations — MP Nagar and Habibganj, both in the heart of New Bhopal — registered a case, passing the buck on officials of other police stations, saying that area didn't fall under their jurisdiction.

Finally, the railway police registered a case. DSP Anita Malviya told media persons that the girl was gang-raped by four youths — Golu Chadhar, Amar, Rajesh and Ramesh. She said that the accused have been arrested.

Minister for Women and Child Development, Archana Chitnis, called it a shameful incident and demanded death penalty for the culprits.

The incident had occurred late Tuesday night and throughout Wednesday the traumatised family had tried to get an FIR registered, until railway police registered the case.

Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Bhopal had ordered a probe into the apathy of the policemen in question.

The MP Human Rights Commission has sought a report from Bhopal police on the incident that has left Bhopal in shock.

Secondo un'esclusiva del sito di informazione TMZ, infatti, l'agenzia che si occupava della sicurezza della cantante di Touch My Body sta per denunciarla per molestie sessuali e razzismo contro il suo body guard Michael Anello, titolare dell'agenzia stessa.

La guardia del corpo ha lavorato per la Carey dal giugno 2015 al maggio 2017 e in tale periodo sarebbe stata continuamente umiliata dall'artista, che ha insinuato Anello di essere un nazista, uno skinhead, un membro del Ku Klux Klan e un suprematista bianco. Del resto, Anello ha accusato la cantante di volersi circondare solamente di uomini di colore.

Inoltre, l'interprete di All I Want For Christmas Is You avrebbe ""commesso atti sessuali con l'intento di venir osservata da Anello"", come si legge nella relazione preparata dal legale dell'uomo. In particolare, durante una trasferta di Mariah a Cabo San Lucas la cantante avrebbe chiesto al body guard di portare alcune valigie nella sua camera d'albergo, salvo poi trovarla seminuda, con addosso solo un negligé trasparente e aperto. Anello provò quindi ad uscire dalla stanza, ma lei insistette per farlo rimanere, senza successo. Non ci comunque contatto tra i due.

Il contenzioso è anche di natura economica, con la guardia del corpo che lamenta una fattura da 221.329,51 dollari mai saldata dalla Carey per i due anni di lavoro con lei. Stando a quanto appreso da TMZ, lunedì 6 novembre ci sarebbe stato un incontro tra l'artista e Anello, per tentare un accordo prima di passare alle via legali; Anello non sarebbe rimasto soddisfatto della proposta economica avanzata dalla sua ex cliente.

Il sito di informazione ha tentato di contattare Mariah Carey, ma non ha ottenuto alcuna risposta dal suo entourage. Le accuse alla cantante arrivano in un periodo burrascoso per le star a stelle e strisce: volti noti come Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Spacey, Ed Westwick - oltre al produttore Harvey Weinstein - sono stati incolpati di molestie e finanche violenze sessuali.

Wie es von innen aussieht, seht ihr im Video oben

In der Chenery Street in San Francisco steht ein Haus, das auf den ersten Blick wie ein gewöhnliches Reihenhaus aussieht. Doch dieser Eindruck täuscht - hinter der Fassade des Hauses versteckt sich mehr. Das Haupthaus erstreckt sich auf drei Gebäudeeinheiten, die an die Straße angrenzen.

Wenn man es betritt, könnte man meinen, in einer Villa aus einem James Bond-Film zu sein.

Das Haupthaus sieht nämlich aus wie ein eindrucksvoller Palast – mit Glasdach und einem Swimmingpool im Speisesaal. Im Hauptgebäude sind Buntglasfenster der ehemaligen Kirche Little Sisters of the Poor verbaut.

Das Haus wurde im Jahr 1987 erbaut

Das Glasdach der Villa lässt sich zudem zur Seite fahren, damit die Sonnenstrahlen auch ungefiltert in das Innere des Hauses fallen können. Im Hauptgebäude befinden sich fünf Schlafzimmer und genauso viele Bäder. Im Obergeschoss der Villa hat man einen atemberaubenden Blick auf die Skyline von San Francisco.

Die Villa wurde im Jahr 1987 für den Werbefachmann Robert Pritikin gebaut. Derzeit steht das Anwesen zum Verkauf. Wer es haben möchte, muss aber tief in die Tasche greifen: Das Anwesen kostet elf Millionen Dollar, also umgerechnet knapp zehn Millionen Euro.

But one can sense the presence of hundreds of men.

Hundreds of men with their clothes stripped off.

Hundreds of men inside the corridors, in the forlorn corners of the prison.

Hundreds of starving men.

Bodies deteriorated, bodies famished, bodies annihilated.

I lean my back against the single coconut tree in the centre of Fox camp, I inhale the smoke from the local tobacco into my lungs, inhale into my empty guts.

A loud bellow rises up out of one of the corridors. It is a cry for help. I hurry over there immediately. Someone comes over to me: ""Farhad is dying! He collapsed on the ground!""

The sound he is making emits the scent of death.

I put the light of my mobile up to his face. He resembles death, he looks like a dead man. It isn't long before dozens of individuals gather around.

The sound of the shouting.

The sound of commotion.

The sounds fill the whole corridor.

I know Farhad. He has been struggling with a heart condition in Manus Prison for a very long time. I quickly put a pillow under his head and check his pulse. It is really fast. His whole body is sweating. All I know is that this signals heart attack.

I immediately get out of that space. I go over to the front prison gate. A few others come with me. No one is there. Not the police. Not the navy. None of them are there.

Darkness everywhere.

Silence everywhere.

I contact a former Manusian MP asking for him to send a car quickly. I must admit that I am in a state of panic. Under the current conditions the prison cannot tolerate another death. He sends through a number for us to contact. No matter how many times I call no one picks up. I go back inside Fox. Farhad is still there lying motionless on the ground. The crowd is terrified. They ask: ""Any news? What happened?""

I return to the front gate again.

A large number of advocates in Australia and a few other individuals on the island try their best to contact immigration or International Health And Medical Services (IHMS). I follow up with them through WhatsApp. I finally get word from Australia that IHMS has been notified but they say: ""We cannot offer any medical services while Farhad is still in the camp. He must first leave the prison and go to East Lorengau until we are able to attend to him. And the ABF must also approve"".

There is no other hope if we are to get help from IHMS. Our efforts continue until eventually they reply by telling us that a police car is coming from Lorengau. It's absurd, it's ridiculous. Imagine transporting a sick person in a police car. The distance from Lorengau town to the prison by car is 35 minutes. I return to the prison to notify them that the police vehicle is on its way.

Twice I go back to the gate.

After 30 minutes the lights of a vehicle emerge from the darkness.

We become hopeful. But suddenly the lights disappear. The car turns away.

More follow ups, again and again. They announce that the police car just left Lorengau now. Once again, we wait in anticipation.

The sound of the jungle echoes. From a distance it feels as though the prison is terrified.

A prison.

A bunch of anxious men.

A tropical jungle reverberating with harrowing sounds.

And a road winding through the jungle.

This was the entirety of the whole scene.

No sign of any car after 30 minutes.

We receive news that they are in touch with the Chief of the Navy and the problem will be sorted out soon.

A car arrives. A few of us stand in front of it to block its way. It is a Mobile Squad vehicle (Mobile Squad are security officers who over the last few weeks have been employed in East Lorengau to transfer the refugees). We requested their help. They respond: ""There is no ambulance here. There is one option and that is to wait till morning when we can get Farhad to agree to leave the prison. Only then can he receive treatment from the doctor"".

We continue to appeal, we tell them that this man is dying. They don't pay any attention. They speed off into the distance, away from the road. All out efforts have arrived at a dead end.

I return to the prison. Farhad is like someone who has crossed over into death. The group have given up, they have lost hope.

I return to the front gate again.

I arrive but I am totally distressed and disconcerted from going back and forth between the gate and the prison... just imagine the refugees all gathered around Farhad.

I must admit that for a moment I felt everything had fallen apart and that there was nothing more I could do... that I had failed. I lean back on a coconut tree. I gather my legs up into my arms. I roll some local tobacco into a piece of paper. I just look out onto the dark road, just look out into the darkness.

A forgotten prison.

Hundreds of forgotten men.

Hundreds of starving men.

Hundreds of men losing consciousness.

A jungle haunted by the sounds of crickets, the sound of tropical frogs, the sound of the moon.

This is the entirety of the whole scene.

It was twelve-thirty at night. Out of the depths of darkness a light is shining. It's immigration, it's their vehicle. Minutes later they take Farhad with them. Will Farhad survive?

I return to the prison with this question ringing in my head...

Police say they're closing in on the driver of a BMW which knocked a 13-year-old girl off her bicycle in Melbourne on Sunday evening, leaving her life hanging in the balance.

The driver was an Asian woman in her early 30s with straight shoulder-length hair, say police.

A dark grey BMW 1 series, believed to be the car involved, was seized by police late on Tuesday from a residential address in Braybrook in Melbourne's west, about 30 minutes' drive from where it hit the teenager in Coburg.

This is probably the last chance that the driver has to do the right thing.""

The breakthrough find came after major collision investigation unit detectives knocked on the doors of hundreds of owners of similar BMWs in an exhaustive two-day search which has still failed to locate the owner of the vehicle.

""We're really close, we know we're really close to making an arrest in this matter,"" Detective Inspector Stuart McGregor told Sunrise on Wednesday morning.

The girl's crumpled bicycle at the scene of the crash.

He urged the driver to hand herself in to police.

""The fact is this is probably the last chance that the driver has to do the right thing; this is the last chance that this driver has to show remorse,"" he said.

Detective Inspector McGregor had earlier slammed the woman's behaviour in leaving the girl ""to die on the side of the road"" on Sunday evening, after getting out of the car briefly to see what had happened.

The teenager, identified by the Herald Sun as 13-year-old Alice Lewis, was still in a critical condition in hospital following surgery on Wednesday.

It's believe she was not wearing a helmet at the time of the crash and received traumatic head injuries and broken bones.

Major collision investigation unit detectives found the BMW at a residential address in Baybrook.

A former St John Ambulance cadet who stopped to help the teen described to the Herald Sun rolling the girl onto her back and seeing ""blood all over her face"".

""It was her breathing and head that were the worst,"" Damian Nippard said.

It's been likened to a concentration camp by indignant Australians. But the detainees surprised everyone, creating a firestorm by refusing to leave. They claimed the new solution being offered them was going to be, incomprehensibly, even worse. They cited safety concerns, validated by the UN, and a humanitarian crisis ensued — and continues.

Often, an opportunity can be discovered in crisis. And some Australians began to speak up for the detainees, decrying the government's decision to move forward the cutting of vital food, electricity and water as the men attempted to find a water source by digging holes, fruitlessly.

Enter Russell Crowe. Like a knight in shining armour, setting the Twittersphere alight, not only decrying Manus Island as ""the shame"" it is for Australia, but personally offering to house six refugees and suggesting other Australian's would be willing to help. God Bless your cotton socks, as we say in Newfoundland, a place I know you know well.

Manus. A Nations shame. Lives held in limbo . Lives lived in fear & despair . It's fucking disgraceful — Russell Crowe (@russellcrowe) November 1, 2017

Outside of celebrity outrage about horrible conditions, Manus Island and refugee detention doesn't add up in other ways. There are 606 men at Manus Island. The budget Australia must spend to house them in those deplorable conditions for 12 months is AU$150 to $250 million. Meanwhile, the five-year budget for Canada to take in 10,000 more Syrian refugees is CA$245 million. Beyond shameful, fiscally detention seems illogical and irresponsible. Australia, like Canada, has welcomed Syrian refugees and must be aware of the dollars and sense of it all. Granted, it's a complex problem, granting asylum and deciding who gets the privilege of having a regular human existence and who belongs in a prison.

There are many wonderful people in this kind of No Man's Land — sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles and friends. I know one of them. Over the last few years, I've become good friends with Ali, a young man who has been detained in Indonesia for almost three years who has no idea exactly if or when he will ever be free. He's committed no crime, but is ""guilty"" of fleeing his country to avoid certain death.

None of Ali's family know his whereabouts, his living conditions are deplorable, and he's recently lost a friend who was not treated for an ailment. But with places like Manus in existence, it's hard to get him any air time.

Managing migration crises is an issue we need to figure out globally and collectively. Creating prisons for fear of terrorism is not a sustainable, logical, effective or humane solution in the new world that is emerging.

Meanwhile in Canada, our country has done some great work with regard to welcoming newcomers. Recently, Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner on Refugees, touted Canada is a global leader making Justin Trudeau a hero for championing refugees.

I've had the good fortune of working with some local Canadians who personally stepped up to create solutions for newcomers. Over the last 18 months, I've been filming the work of the internationally recognized Newcomer Kitchen. Their work has been inspired, but not without it's major challenges.

The endless variables of trying to change refugees' lives in a way that's never been explored before is littered with obstacles: bureaucracy, language and culture barriers, funding and many more... but the resilience and friendship of the Syrian women cooks drives everyone involved to keep working together to create this new world.

Other organizations have been noted for blazing trails for refugee processing and integration. Lifeline Syria, founded in 2015, was named Canadian Club's 2016 Canadian of the Year for their work in assisting with private sponsorship and resettlement of Syrian refugees in Canada. Many Canadians have dreamed up wonderful, innovative ways to welcome new Canadians, including a massive, 600-person sing-along led by the popular Choir!Choir!Choir! who were able to bring and settle a Syrian family into Toronto.

I'm hoping that the current humanitarian crisis at Manus Island will reveal and unite more heroes to create a brave and beautiful new world.

Beyond Russell Crowe, Australia has their own citizen heroes — amazing people and initiatives in Australia that are working to raise awareness and help refugees who have no protectors. The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC) is ""a place and a movement"" owned and run by volunteers since 2001 that aim to create lasting social and policy change for people seeking asylum in Australia. Babes Against Detention are a ""bunch of babes against Australia's treatment of asylum seekers"" who sell stylish B.A.D pins that benefit ASRC. Filmmaker and activist Charby Ibrahim is a filmmaker and activist who made a short film ""The Jolly Swagman"" that details the horrifying experiences of Ravi, a Sri Lankan Refugee, Australia's offshore Nauru Immigration Detention Centre.

Crisis breeds opportunity. The heroic men at Manus Island may have been buried, but their voices are seeds that could sprout an opportunity for Australians to find new solutions. I'm hoping that the current humanitarian crisis at Manus Island will reveal and unite more heroes to create a brave and beautiful new world.

Among the many different reactor concepts being investigated in the late 1950s and early 1960s was the idea that the steam produced by a boiling water reactor, which normally goes straight to the turbine building, could be superheated (or have further heat added once it was already steam) by nuclear energy. This would greatly increase the efficiency of the plant, as well as make dry steam at a high pressure that would allow the use of (less expensive) commercially available equipment in the steam plant. Two reactors were built to investigate the idea of performing both processes in essentially the same reactor—one in South Dakota and (perhaps incredibly to today’s readers) another of a very different design on the island of Puerto Rico.

BONUS—short for BOiling NUclear Superheat reactor—was a 1959 project of General Nuclear Engineering Corporation (GNEC), which had been formed when Walter Zinn and some of his associates left Argonne National Laboratory and entered private business. Argonne had arguably been the pioneer of BWR technology, and it was not surprising that the company’s first project as a reactor vendor was for a BWR type. This BWR, however, had both a conventional boiler core (rated 37 MWt) and also four nuclear superheater elements arrayed around the core’s periphery, using very different fuel element designs (a total of 13 MWt). The reactor had a complex internal and external piping arrangement; recirculation pumps were located below the reactor.

The nuclear plant design was somewhat unique in that not just the nuclear steam supply system was inside the containment; instead, the entire power plant including the control room was inside the 190-foot-diameter structure (see below).

—

Puerto Rico, as an island nation, was interested in nuclear energy because of the fact that it had to import all of its fuel, and this included fuel for electric power generation. Nuclear energy was intended to flatten the fuel cost, as well as to make fuel available for much longer without any disruption (since nuclear plants are infrequently refueled). It was hoped that baseline data on nuclear power on such an island would be obtained through operation of this plant.

As it would happen, the “merger mania” of the 1958–1960 time period caught up with GNEC, which was bought by Combustion Engineering (C-E). While this shook up some of C-E’s management, the project at Punta Higuera, Puerto Rico, to build BONUS moved along. The small, 17-MWe plant (net output of 16.3 MWe) was actually formally ordered in January 1960 and construction began in August 1960. The project was a joint effort between the US Atomic Energy Commission and the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority. As with other projects of this time, the US AEC funded the nuclear portion of the construction while PRWRA funded non-nuclear portions and would provide operating staff.

Construction was complete and the plant started up in April 1964—somewhat later than the anticipated date. Serious delays were incurred during construction as some safety modifications were required after construction began, and the instrumentation and control system had to be modified and refitted with four channel protection (not originally included). Operation was first performed by only boiling water for steam, and in a long graduated program the superheat operation was carefully introduced. The plant finally achieved full-rated power over a year later, in September 1965. This achievement had originally been targeted for February 1963.

Nagging small problems with the plant continued to occur, including corrosion of internal piping (caused by an equipment vendor using incorrect materials subject to corrosion in the high temperature steam environment) and the need to backfit unanticipated equipment to the plant. The AEC, worried about operations, pushed GNEC/C-E to provide a complete certified operating staff to train the PRWRA operators—an expense and complication not foreseen by the vendor.

Because of the mechanical troubles with the reactor and the cost to implement permanent fixes, the decision was made to terminate the project in 1968. (Generally, this also doomed the US equivalent superheat BWR.) The fuel was removed, but almost the entire plant remained; it was entombed in place. Some of the contaminated equipment was placed in the pump room below the reactor and permanently encased. Today, the nuclear plant has been set up as a museum with displays and even the complete control room with indications rigged to appear as when the plant was running. It is not open to the public however, but rather awaits some fate yet to be determined. It is constantly maintained and surveillance by the US Department of Energy (as successor to the AEC for plant ownership) continues regularly.

POSTSCRIPT

The failure of superheating BWRs was somewhat of a blow to those vendors offering BWR type plants generally. It had been hoped that the two small prototype units would be successful, and would lead to much larger units in a fairly short time.

As can be seen from the graph above (PRWRA GNEC 4), the capital cost per kilowatt for superheating BWRs was expected to become better than that for conventional BWRs when the plant ratings reached something over 250 MWe. Failure of these two prototype projects effectively ensured that this never happened.

Puerto Rico had hoped that this plant would lead to bigger and better things. It has already been operating a small test and research reactor prior to this time, in anticipation of having an established program. After the decision to terminate BONUS in 1968, PRWRA began to consider a more conventional nuclear plant. In May 1970, it ordered from Westinghouse a 583-MWe two-loop pressurized water reactor plant for a site at Islote. Practically nothing was accomplished on this project, which was finally cancelled in 1978, ending the Puerto Rican era of nuclear energy projects.

For more information: The other superheating BWR was Pathfinder.

Weshalb das so ist und was uns in den nächsten Jahren erwartet, erklärt Jan Schenk im Video oben

Es wird früher dunkel und die Temperaturen sinken. Langsam aber sicher wird es Winter. Am Wochenende könnte in den niederen Lagen in Deutschland der erste Schnee fallen. Schon prophezeien einige Wetterforscher den kältesten Winter aller Zeiten. Das ist zwar schwierig vorauszusagen - einen Ausblick auf den Winter 2017 kann man aber trotzdem wagen.

Die letzten Winter in Deutschland waren langweilig. Nie wurde es richtig kalt und Schnee gab es so gut wie keinen. Selbst in den Alpen musste man teilweise lange auf Schnee warten.

Eiskalte Schneewinter erst ab 2021

Der Hauptantrieb des Klimas auf der Erde schwächelt gewaltig: Die Sonnenaktivität ist so schwach, wie seit über 100 Jahren nicht mehr. Der aktuelle Sonnenzyklus nähert sich somit seinem Minimum. Daher steigt die Gefahr eines kalten Winters deutlich.

Aber man muss auch sagen, dass die wirklichen eiskalten Schneewinter erst ab 2021, also nach dem nächsten Maximum zu erwarten sind.

Dementsprechend wird dieser Winter temperaturmäßig durchschnittlich. Also nicht zu kalt, aber auch nicht zu warm, wie die letzten Jahre. Die Chance auf Regen ist aber höher als normal und damit wird es mehr schneien.

Da die letzten Winter insgesamt zu warm und schneearm waren, kann man zusammenfassend sagen, dass wir in Deutschland den kältesten und schneereichsten Winter seit mindestens fünf Jahren erwarten.

The wellness industry has really boomed over the past decade in Australia.

More than ever before people are educating themselves about what they put in and on their body and are actively seeking out information and products to best care for their health.

Proof of that lies in the popularity of diets such as Paleo and Keto, but perhaps why these diets don't work for everybody is that we shouldn't be taking a one-size-fits-all approach.

It's the same when it comes to looking after our complexions. Products that make your friend glow or clears up their acne might not yield the same results for you and that's because the genetic makeup of each of our skin is totally individual.

That's where DNA testing is coming in. Traditionally used for tracking family history or solving crimes, DNA testing is becoming increasingly popular in prescribing the perfect diet, exercise or skincare routine for individuals.

A DNA test isn't as invasive as it sounds. All that's needed is a swab of the inside of the cheek.

It makes sense. Both the wellness and beauty industries, up until now, have been largely based on a trial and error approach, and it's costing Aussies a whopping $28.6 billion a year. With customised plans based on our own DNA we can cut out a lot of time and money wasted on trying products and fads that aren't right for us.

This year Aussie skincare brand Rationale launched a two-phase skin genetic test called DNArray. The therapist first obtains a DNA sample, by swabbing inside your cheek, to identify specific genetic skin strengths and weaknesses. Based on results you are prescribed a targeted skin care treatment plan.

""Skin DNA testing reveals the skin 'blueprint' we were given by our parents. A skin DNA test spotlights our individual skin strengths and weaknesses and what we should focus on to achieve healthy, glowing skin for life,"" Richard Parker, founder and Director of R+D of Rationale told HuffPost Australia.

""A consultation takes place that includes a DNA analysis, a UV scan, to see how your skin is coping with the sun, and a full medical skin history. A DNA sample is taken painlessly with a cotton swab to the inside of the mouth. This is sent our Laboratory for analysis. A week later we receive your full report and customise the perfect regime to maintain your skin in the optimal state of health and radiance.""

With this information you can get to work on improving your current skin as well as safeguarding against how your skin is likely to deteriorate in the future.

Rationale has pioneered isotropic, or skin identical, formulas. What this means is: our products feature ingredients found naturally in human skin, at exactly the same concentrations, in vehicles that we designed to deliver active ingredients exactly where they need to go. The result is healthy, luminous skin! A post shared by Rationale (@rationale) on Sep 30, 2017 at 11:58pm PDT

""Your report tells us what we must focus on short and long term to restore and maintain your skin in top condition. For example, if you are low in antioxidants, we must start by adding these to your skincare regime. If you have sensitive skin, we will prescribe a regime that begins with strengthening,"" Parker said.

""DNA skin analysis takes the guesswork and painful mistakes out of finding the perfect skincare programme. It's specific to each individual and it is completely accurate. The aim is to be on a healthy 'diet' of all of the skin's own vitamins, minerals and nutrients that protect and repair sun damage, the major cause of skin ageing.""

The Rationale DNArray Medical Consultation costs $150.

Another Aussie business using DNA testing to prescribe customised plans is Functional Food Solutions by dietician Peta Carige. The consultant to the Australian Rugby 7s Men's and Women's squads, Waratahs Rugby Union and the Manly Sea Eagles Rugby League team, Carige is regarded as one of the top sports dietitians in Sydney.

Thanks to the popular social media 'fitspo' world we live in Carige says one of the challenges she currently faces is that everyone who eats healthy or has a six pack thinks they are experts in nutrition. Because of this, much of her time is spent 'busting myths' with clients and providing them with factual, scientific answers.

Born from that frustration and her passion for wellness, Carige has created an online space, Functional Food Solutions. Carige uses personalised genetic profiling, again by obtaining a swab from the inside of the mouth, to help best prescribe the right diet for each client.

A post shared by Peta Carige (@petacarige) on Jun 8, 2017 at 7:32pm PDT

""DNA doesn't directly tell us about our diet, but what it does tell us is what we are predisposed to through our genetics, such as cardiovascular disease or more susceptible to gaining weight when we eat high fat foods,"" Carige told HuffPost Australia.

""Therefore, we then have the knowledge to make the correct choices for our genetics to hopefully prevent chronic disease in the future. It's pretty amazing. The other way genetic testing can assist our dietary choices is through testing our genetic predisposition to processing starch carbohydrates.

""We can then make food choices that our body prefers which can result in less bloating or lethargy and more successful weight loss.""

The test is quick and painless, and the result is personalised based on your DNA. The best bit is no more jumping from paleo to keto to low FODMAP to try and work out how you should be eating.

""We can do a genetic test by taking a mouth swab that is sent away to the lab run by FitGenes. This test then tells us how well your genetics enables to you process starch carbohydrates. We then use this result in combination with what you already eat, and your goals to devise the best meal plan for you and your genetic make up. It is really taking a personalised meal plan to the next level,"" Carige said.

""Once results are in, two things happen. Firstly, the patient knows that their meal plan is truly tailored to them and secondly I find that patients are much more compliant with their meal plan. The combination of these two, results in great results that are often achieved faster than standard dietary intervention.""

The cost for an initial Consult with Carige is $180 and the test is $160.",DNA Testing Is The Key To Your Best Skin And Perfect Diet,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/07/dna-testing-is-the-key-to-your-best-skin-and-perfect-diet_a_23267516/

As reported by HuffPost Australia this week, Amir Taghinia, a 24-year-old man who spent four years on Manus, arrived in Vancouver last week after a mammoth paperwork and bureaucratic process instigated by the Taylor family.

Chelsea Taylor, a Canadian citizen living in Melbourne, met Amir while working as a nurse on Manus several years ago and kept in touch with him since.

Canada has a popular and successful policy which allows private sponsorship of refugees. Under the program, the sponsoring family or organisation takes responsibility for providing food, accommodation and living expenses, assisting with enrolling in healthcare and education, finding local doctors, and helping with employment searches.

Chelsea and her family living in Canada -- Australian-born father Wayne, and his wife Linda -- teamed up with community organisations and other residents in their town of Coquitlam to sponsor Amir.

""I approached my dad, who is a human rights activist and politically involved, that was how it started. We realised organisations would sponsor [a refugee] but they needed a sponsoring group who were obligated to pull together some money for a year to bring someone over,"" Chelsea told HuffPost Australia.

""We brought together a group of people, now known as the Amir group. There was lots of paperwork. Amir was doing his papers off a little Samsung phone in the detention centre, I really don't know how he did it.""

The paperwork was submitted in July 2016 and accepted in September. Chelsea said that was quick, making a wry joke that Canada probably doesn't get many applications to resettle refugees from Australia. Amir got his final approvals and left PNG last week.

""We're told this happened quickly. It took four years, but this took about 16 months for us,"" Chelsea said.

Amir's resettlement in Canada was revealed just days after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull rejected New Zealand's offer to take 150 of the men on Manus.

The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said that Taghinia's case showed why Australia needed to urgently explore third-country resettlement options for the men on Manus, saying the Canadian example was ""a precedent it could and should extend to those suffering on Manus and Nauru"".

""Amir's Canadian sponsorship demonstrates clearly that it is entirely possible for third countries to step in and provide a workable solution to the current crisis on Manus,"" said ASRC director of advocacy and campaigns, Jana Favero.

Amir is now classed as a permanent resident of Canada, with work, medical and social benefits, and lives with Chelsea's parents -- ""he's very much part of my family, he's calling them mum and dad,"" Chelsea laughed.

'None Of This Is Fair'

While Chelsea said Amir is settling into life in Canada, she said both he and the family have been left distraught over the men remaining on Manus.

Around 600 refugees and asylum seekers remain in PNG after the formerly Australian-run centre was officially closed last week.

Power, water and food have been cut off in an attempt by local PNG authorities to force residents to move to other nearby accommodation complexes.

The United Nations reported last week that at least one of these three new facilities is not finished, while the other two still lack security fences.

""I've worked in refugee health for a long time. This is a very unique situation but we see this for any refugee left, there's a period of enormous elation that you're safe, then the guilt -- 'why me?' That enormous connection to the people you've left behind, it doesn't go away,"" Chelsea said.

""We talked about that for a long time prior to him leaving PNG. That's a normal reaction, and there are support mechanisms and mental health services in Canada he will be eligible to receive support from. That will be part of the journey and we're prepared for that. It's hard.

""It's not fair, none of this is fair.""

She said the family, too, had struggled with only being able to help one person.

""We had to, through this process, put our blinders on a bit and say 'we had to get him out, he's our number one focus.' That's often gone through my head, my dad has struggled with that as well. One of the members of the organisation was at the airport when Amir arrived in Canada, and I said 'one down, a few hundred to go',"" Chelsea said.

""We're incredibly upset and angry about what's going on on Manus, but we've had to be realistic about what we can achieve. We will continue to lobby and speak out and support the men on Manus, but we had to tackle what we could, and now use this as a precedent, to show what can be done.

Die Gegner des Landeschefs Uwe Junge rufen zur Revolte auf

Der Vorgang ist außergewöhnlich - und könnte Auswirkungen auf die gesamte Partei haben

Auch nach den Querelen um den Rückzug der AfD-Chefin Frauke Petry kommt die Partei nicht zur Ruhe.

Während sich die AfD im Bundestag sortiert, gärt es in den Landesverbänden gewaltig.

Der Landtagsfraktion in Sachsen und Nordrhein-Westfalen droht nach einer Austrittswelle das Aus. In Petrys Landesverband in Sachsen wurde gar ein Notvorstand berufen. Und auch die Auseinandersetzungen in der AfD-Fraktion in Rheinland-Pfalz nehmen zu.

Im Fokus: Der rheinland-pfälzische AfD-Chef Uwe Junge. Er muss sich seit einigen Wochen mit lautem, parteiinternen Widerstand herumschlagen.

Querelen um den Parteitag

► Ende Oktober versäumte er, die Einladungen zum Parteitag rechtzeitig an die Mitglieder zu verschicken. Daraufhin regte sich heftiger Widerstand. Die HuffPost berichtete.

Solche kleinen Formfehler könnten sich ""bitter rächen"", sagte der Polit-Experte Werner Patzelt von der TU Dresden. “Das machen sich interne Gegner zu Nutze, die sich in der Partei gegen die Führung durchsetzen wollen.”

► Nun steht Junge erneut unter Druck - im Kern geht es um eine Initiative seiner parteiinternen Rivalin und Stellvertreterin Christiane Christen.

In einem Aufruf, der bereits mehrere hundert Unterzeichner hat, appelliert sie, zu den ""Gründungsidealen der Partei"" zurückzukehren. Christen kritisiert die undurchsichtige Verteilung von Posten und deren Bezahlung. Der Landesvorstand solle zur ""Integrität und Rechtstreue"" zurückkehren.

Vorwürfe sind ""falsch und böswillig""

Junge wandte sich daraufhin in einer Mail wütend an die rheinland-pfälzischen AfD-Mitglieder. Die Vorwürfe seien ""falsch und böswillig"", heißt es einem Schreiben, dass der HuffPost vorliegt.

Weiter schreibt Junge an die Mitglieder: ""Schenken Sie Gerüchten und Böswilligkeiten keinen Glauben!""

Der Aufruf suggeriere, den Mitgliedern werde ""die Partei weggenommen oder es bestünde zumindest die Gefahr dazu. Ich möchte diesem Aufruf mit einem Schreiben an Sie alle entgegen treten, weil hier der erneute Versuch unternommen wird, die gute Arbeit des Landesvorstands und der Fraktion in Frage zu stellen.""

Christen hatte sich Mitte des Jahres aus dem Landesverband zurückgezogen, nachdem ihre Bewerbung auf die Spitzenkandidatur zur Bundestagswahl gescheitert war.

""Die Vorgänge sind bemerkenswert""

Die Vorgänge sind ungewöhnlich - und könnten auch über die Landesgrenzen hinaus in der AfD zu spüren sein. Denn der Machtkampf kann für Junge gefährlich werden, sagt Carl Berning, Politologe an der Universität Mainz.

""Seine Aussichten auf eine Karriere in Berlin schwinden, wenn der Eindruck entsteht, dass er seinen Laden nicht im Griff hat.”

Der Machtkampf sei insofern bemerkenswert, weil der Landesverband in der Außenwahrnehmung als einer der stabilsten in Westdeutschland gilt, erklärt Berning.

""Der Machtkampf könnte Junge gefährlich werden""

Junge gilt in der Partei als gemäßigt, galt bis zu Petrys Weggang als Vertrauter der damaligen Parteichefin und unterstützt den Partei-Ausschluss des Rechtsaußen Björn Höcke.

Einige Beobachter sehen in dem Machtkampf um Junge deswegen auch einen Kampf des rechten Lagers um die Vorherrschaft in der Partei.

""Zeit für einen Putsch ist günstig""

Zum Showdown könnte es auf dem Landesparteitag Ende des Jahres kommen. Weil dann auch der Landesvorstand gewählt werden muss, könnten Junges Gegner zur offenen Revolte blasen.

“Die Zeit für einen Putsch im Landesverband ist kurz vor dem Parteitag strategisch günstig"", sagt Politologe Berning.

Bis zur nächsten Landtags- und Bundestagswahl ist es noch lange hin. Ein Streit um die Parteiführung würde also keine Stimmen kosten - sofern es gelingt, wieder Einigkeit herzustellen.

""Dies wird nötig sein, sollte der Streit um die Parteiführung tatsächlich eskalieren, um einen personellen Wechsel hervorzurufen"", sagt Berning.

Falls es tatsächlich zum Putsch kommt, wäre das ein weiterer Schritt zur Radikalisierung der Partei.

""There's no such thing as good or bad debt,"" says Doug Hoyes, co-founder of debt management firm Hoyes, Michalos & Associates.","After four years of undergraduate education and another three at law school, Sarah Spitz landed a job she loves — and a debt load she resents.

A new hire at a boutique law firm in Toronto, Spitz has $60,000 owing on an $80,000 line of credit, and another $11,000 in provincial student loans.

""I'm very happy with where I ended up, but I'm not going to sit here and pretend that debt didn't have a huge impact on what firms I applied to, what career choices I made, where I was willing to work, the kind of work I was willing to do.""

Sarah Spitz is among the ranks of people who have grown to resent their ""good"" debt.

The notions of ""good debt"" and ""bad debt"" are a kind of investors' shorthand for understanding whether the kind of borrowing they're doing is likely to pay off in the longer term.

Student debt is generally considered ""good"" debt: it allows borrowers to increase their income in the long run. But as countless former students struggling with debt can tell you, paying down even a ""good"" debt can be a source of stress and financial difficulty.

""Sure, I'm increasing my earning potential by a lot, but it also really affected my 20s,"" Spitz told HuffPost Canada. ""And it's really anxiety-inducing to look at your bank statement and the column that's negative $80,000 — you're like, oh my God, that's soul-crushing.""

THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPT OF GOOD AND BAD DEBT Traditionally, ""good debt"" is the sort that helps you gain wealth or income, while bad debt is money spent on goods that are consumed over time. Here's a breakdown of what is generally considered ""good"" debt and ""bad"" debt: GOOD DEBT Mortgages help you build equity in real estate, making you wealthier over time

In Canada, as in most of the developed world, the largest source of ""good"" debt is the mortgage.

Canadians are almost unequivocal in their support of mortgages. In a 2013 poll from the Canadian Association of Accredited Mortgage Professionals, 80 per cent of Canadians agreed that mortgages are ""good debt.""

But a recent survey from Angus Reid found half of Canada's home-owning young adults are experiencing buyer's remorse, with the high cost of servicing that debt as the single largest reason.

In other words, ""good debt"" can go bad, especially if you have more of it than you can handle — financially, or psychologically.

""There's no such thing as good or bad debt,"" says Doug Hoyes, co-founder of debt management firm Hoyes, Michalos & Associates.

Asking whether debt is bad or good ""is like asking 'Is bread good or bad,'"" he says. ""That's a silly question. What matters is, what's good for you?""

You may think that borrowing on a credit card to pay for a vacation is bad debt, ""but maybe a vacation is very important for your mental health,"" he says.

The Bank of Canada recently raised interest rates for the first time in seven years. Here's how that could affect your debt:

Hoyes warns that there is risk in taking to heart the notion that some types of debt are ""good"" — it can lead to irresponsible borrowing.

""If you believe a mortgage is good debt, you might spend as much as you can on a house,"" he said in an interview with HuffPost Canada.

Could that be part of the reason why Canadians have been willing to take on so much mortgage debt? With around $1.67 in debt for every dollar of disposable income, households here are the most indebted of any G7 country. And the Bank of Canada has been raising the alarm about the growing ranks of ""highly indebted"" consumers — those whose debt exceeds their annual income by more than 450 per cent.

""Households carrying high levels of debt could find it more difficult to adjust to a loss in income or other financial shock,"" the bank warned in December. ""They may be forced to sharply cut back on their spending and, in severe cases, may default on loans. The consequences for the economy and the financial system could be significant.""

So there you have it: you could even harm the economy taking on too much ""good debt.""

Determining the ""right"" amount of debt

But how do you know when if your ""good"" debt is actually bad?

""When it edges into your lifestyle, you have too much debt,"" says Avraham Byers, a personal finance trainer and blogger.

His definition of good debt is different from the traditional model. For him, it's ""a balance you can comfortably pay every month, at a reasonable rate.""

He says there are many ""grey areas"" when it comes to debt. For instance, a car loan may be considered bad debt because vehicles depreciate in value (often losing a quarter to a third the moment you drive it off the lot), but what if a car is your only option for getting to work, and you don't have enough to buy in cash? Then, suddenly, an auto loan can look like good debt.

Personal finance coach Avraham Byers says you can tell you have too much debt if payments start eating into your lifestyle.

Or borrowing money for home renovations. Many argue it's good debt because it increases the value of your home.

""I don't know if that's true, especially if you plan to continue living there in the future,"" says Byers.

He suggests a rule of thumb for debt: Your monthly payments should be no more than 25 per cent of your monthly income before taxes.

""When it edges into your lifestyle, you have too much debt."" Avraham Byers, personal finance trainer

Banks are often willing to lend you up to 36 per cent of your income, but he suggests not leaving it to them to decide.

""Banks might think you can handle it but it might not be true,"" Byers says. ""You've got to be realistic with what you can afford.""

For her part, Spitz says her experience with student debt will make her more cautious taking on debt in the future.

""I'm definitely more apprehensive than I would have been,"" she said. ""It's one thing to think about being in debt in the abstract, and a very different thing to experience it.""

Y a-t-il eu un événement déclencheur où vous vous êtes dit: «Ça y'est, j'arrête là, je remets ma lettre de démission.»?
Je pensais que Clinton allait gagner, que j'allais partir à la retraite et que tout irait pour le mieux.
Et ça m'a conforté dans l'idée qu'il s'agissait d'une administration qui se tournerait vers des conseillers politiques et des idéologues.
Son travail est apparu dans Time, Outside et Wired et figure dans la collection permanente de la bibliothèque du Congrès.","J'ai déjà rencontré des détracteurs de Donald Trump, de nombreux détracteurs, de ceux qui sautent sur chaque théorie du complot et qui refusent de lui accorder le moindre bénéfice du doute. Un an après l'élection du nouveau président, les quatre personnes avec qui j'ai récemment passé la matinée à la Solly's Tavern de Washington (sans alcool, ne vous inquiétez pas) n'étaient pas des détracteurs de Trump. Il s'agissait, en revanche, de déserteurs.

Chacun d'entre eux, à un moment ou à un autre au cours des neuf derniers mois, a quitté son poste au sein de l'administration actuelle, après avoir décidé qu'il pourrait mieux servir son pays à l'extérieur du gouvernement plutôt que de l'intérieur. Ils n'étaient pas non plus ravis de partir. Ils étaient fonctionnaires et souhaitaient le rester et, à l'exception de l'un d'entre eux, avaient travaillé sous des présidents des deux partis. Pendant leurs années passées au service du public, il leur était arrivé d'être en désaccord avec leurs supérieurs, de craindre l'arrivée de nouvelles réglementations et de se méfier des nominations politiques, mais ils étaient restés parce que c'est la nature d'une carrière dans le gouvernement. C'était différent.

Lorsqu'ils se sont retrouvés pour cette conversation il y a deux semaines, l'entente fut instantanée. L'ambiance était conviviale et familière comme celle d'une réunion d'anciens élèves, outre le fait qu'ils étaient encore de parfaits inconnus cinq minutes plus tôt. Ils étaient originaires de différents secteurs de la bureaucratie, leurs âges et leurs formations variaient considérablement, mais ils s'étaient posé les mêmes questions depuis l'élection de Trump. Leurs collègues de travail se sentiraient-ils trahis après leur départ ? Leurs remplaçants auraient-ils des opinions antithétiques aux leurs? Après avoir passé la majeure partie de leur vie dans les services administratifs, se sentaient-ils vraiment prêts à prendre publiquement position ? Une fois arrivés au cœur de l'entretien, qui a été édité et résumé par souci de clarté, ils se sont montrés sincères, drôles et enragés. Ils ne travaillent peut-être plus pour le gouvernement, mais ils se considèrent toujours comme des fonctionnaires.

Très bien. Sharon, vous êtes partie la première. Commençons avec le soir des élections. À quoi pensiez-vous? Que ressentiez-vous?

Sharon McGowan (ancienne directrice adjointe de la branche des droits civiques du département de la Justice des États-Unis):J'ai ressenti cette angoisse qui commençait à s'emparer de moi, de façon très physique. Alors le lendemain de l'élection, ma femme et moi avons décidé de rester à la maison pour se regrouper en famille. En tant que couple homosexuel dans ce pays, nous connaissions exactement les enjeux. Et pendant les premiers jours, j'ai essayé de garder un état d'esprit positif: «Peut-être que Trump ne pensait pas vraiment ce qu'il a dit, peut-être que c'était seulement pour l'audimat.» Et ça a plutôt bien fonctionné! Au moins jusqu'à ce que Jeff Sessions ne soit annoncé comme candidat pour le poste de procureur général. C'est là que j'ai réalisé que mes jours dans le gouvernement étaient comptés.

Vous étiez certaine de devoir partir?

McGowan: Non, j'ai vraiment eu des moments de doute. Le jour de ma démission par exemple, Sally Yates (procureure générale à titre intérimaire, ndlr) s'est élevée et a déclaré qu'elle ne défendrait pas le «Muslim ban» et je me suis dit: «Oh non, peut-être que je me suis trompée. Peut-être que je devrais rester à l'intérieur.» Et puis bien sûr, on est tous revenus après la pause publicitaire pour découvrir que Yates avait été virée. Alors j'ai eu l'impression que c'était un signe de l'univers pour me faire comprendre que je n'avais pas abandonné le navire trop tôt.

Sharon McGowan. Au sein du département de la Justice, elle a contribué à faire avancer des politiques progressistes, telles que l'égalité en matière de mariage. Elle est désormais directrice de la stratégie chez Lambda Legal.

Walt, vous êtes resté jusqu'au mois de juillet. Parlez-moi du moment où vous avez réalisé que votre monde avait radicalement changé.

Walter Shaub (ancien directeur de l'Office of Government Ethics, le bureau d'éthique gouvernementale): Mon histoire est différente dans la mesure où je me suis réveillé le lendemain matin de l'élection en étant assez optimiste quant au travail qui m'attendait avec l'équipe de transition. On avait passé environ cinq mois à travailler avec eux avant l'élection, et c'était des gens très sérieux qui s'y connaissaient vraiment.

Alors j'ai envoyé un e-mail de félicitations enthousiaste d'un côté et un e-mail de condoléances de l'autre, et j'ai reçu des réponses de chaque équipe nous remerciant pour le travail de l'OGE. Les gens de l'équipe de Trump ont dit qu'ils étaient impatients de continuer à travailler avec nous et qu'ils téléphoneraient dans l'après-midi pour convenir d'un rendez-vous. La transition prend environ 73 jours, et vous disposez de cette période pour mettre en place tout un gouvernement. Vous devez savoir ce que vous faites, et vous devez utiliser chaque seconde judicieusement. C'est une tâche monumentale. Mais cet après-midi-là, tous ceux avec qui nous avions travaillé avaient disparus et puis ce fut le silence radio.

Plus tard, on a lu des bulletins d'informations qui suggéraient que Don McGahn (un habitué de Washington qui exerce désormais le rôle de conseiller juridique de la Maison-Blanche, ndlr) était susceptible d'endosser le rôle de conseiller pour la transition, mais nous n'avons pas pu obtenir de rendez-vous avec lui avant longtemps. Et puis lorsque nous y sommes parvenus, il était incroyablement flagrant que les choses lui passaient complètement au-dessus de la tête. À un moment il m'a demandé si j'étais la personne chargée d'attribuer des habilitations de sécurité ou qui examinait les vérifications des antécédents des candidats par le FBI. Je lui ai dit: «Non, c'est vous.» Et il m'a répondu: «C'est moi?»

Le moment qui m'a le plus marqué, c'est ce week-end où personne n'est parvenu à savoir où Don McGahn se trouvait et puis on a lu dans le journal qu'il avait fait un concert avec son groupe de reprises des années 80 à Philadelphie.

Walter Shaub, ""un homme tellement austère et humble qu'il avait retiré toutes les décorations de son bureau"", selon ""The Atlantic"". Il est désormais le directeur principal du Campaign Legal Center.

Mike, les fonctionnaires de l'Environmental Protection Agency [l'agence américaine de protection de l'environnement] se battent depuis longtemps avec les nominations politiques. Pourquoi selon-vous la situation est bien pire aujourd'hui?

Mike Cox (ancien conseiller chargé du changement climatique à l'EPA): J'ai travaillé avec six gouvernements, en commençant sous Reagan jusqu'au gouvernement actuel, et nous avons eu des différences d'opinions, mais je n'ai jamais eu le sentiment que quelqu'un venait démanteler l'organisation pour la dégrader. Mais nous avons eu cette impression lors de la toute première réunion de l'ensemble du personnel organisée par Scott Pruitt (Le nouveau directeur de l'EPA. Il a poursuivi l'agence en justice à 14 reprises avant d'en prendre la tête, ndlr). C'était clair qu'il nous prenait de haut. L'EPA c'était nous. On était les méchants. On était le problème. Mon dieu, je crois que je parle toujours de l'EPA en disant «nous».

C'est une habitude difficile à perdre.

Cox: Oui, c'est toujours «nous». Alors lorsqu'il a commencé à dire qu'on devait travailler avec les états, je me suis dit: «Ça fait trente ans que je travaille ici et chaque jour nous nous efforçons de travailler avec les états.» Il a dit qu'on devait respecter la loi, comme si ce n'était pas déjà le cas. J'ai eu la forte impression qu'il ne comprenait pas, ou bien qu'il faisait exprès de provoquer le personnel.

Le deuxième fait majeur, c'était les coupes budgétaires: une feuille de route pour réduire de 30% les employés de l'EPA. Et puis l'élimination de programmes qui concernaient le changement climatique. On a été nombreux à se demander: «Comment le directeur de l'EPA peut-il affirmer que le changement climatique ne fait pas partie de notre mission?» On a eu l'impression que le cœur de notre travail était, je n'ose pas utiliser le mot «violé», mais qu'il était discrédité. Et la dernière chose dont je parlerai c'est son choix de faire venir l'ancien chef de cabinet du sénateur James Inhofe pour diriger son organisation (Inhofe est l'homme qui a «réfuté» le réchauffement climatique en apportant une boule de neige au Sénat. «Il fait vraiment, vraiment froid dehors. Vraiment inhabituel pour la saison», avait-il déclaré, ndlr). Ça a vraiment donné le ton. On s'est rendu compte que ça allait très mal.

Y a-t-il eu un événement déclencheur où vous vous êtes dit: «Ça y'est, j'arrête là, je remets ma lettre de démission.»?

Cox: Je vais être honnête avec vous. J'avais prévu de prendre ma retraite en février. Je pensais que Clinton allait gagner, que j'allais partir à la retraite et que tout irait pour le mieux. Et puis Trump a gagné, et alors que je me préparais pour partir à la retraite, les gens autour de moi n'arrêtaient pas de dire: «Mike, tu ne peux pas partir à la retraite. Tu ne peux pas te le permettre, parce que ton poste va être éliminé et tu es un ardent défenseur. On a besoin de toi.»

Finalement, j'ai décidé de prendre ma retraite. Et pour être honnête, je le regrette. J'aurais préféré rester parce que même si je ne pense pas que j'aurais eu un impact important, j'ai quand même l'impression que j'aurais pu utiliser ma voix. Et si j'avais été viré, ça n'aurait pas été grave.

Mike Cox, ancien conseiller chargé du changement climatique à l'Environmental Protection Agency.

Ned, comme Walt, vous avez travaillé pour une institution qui est prétendument au-dessus des considérations politiques. Mais les tensions avec une nouvelle administration ne sont pas nécessairement quelque chose d'inédit pour la CIA. En quoi était-ce différent?

Ned Price (ancien agent de la CIA et porte parole du Conseil de sécurité nationale): Pendant la transition Bush-Obama, je travaillais auprès du Centre de lutte antiterroriste. Je me suis toujours considéré comme quelqu'un de progressiste, particulièrement sur les questions sociales. Mais j'ai aussi ressenti un profond malaise face à certains propos tenus par le candidat Obama pendant sa campagne. Je craignais que les stratégies et les tactiques qui nous avaient permis de prendre un avantage important sur des groupes tels qu'Al-Qaïda soient anéanties, et que l'agence et plus largement la communauté de la sécurité intérieure dans son ensemble ne soient contraintes à se battre avec les mains liées.

Mais le président Obama s'est révélé être quelqu'un qui était prêt à prendre les mesures nécessaires, sans pour autant renier ses convictions que nous étions, je pense, nombreux à approuver: mettre fin aux opérations de détention de l'agence, annoncer clairement que l'agence ne serait pas autorisée à se livrer à quoi que ce soit qui puisse, même de loin, ressembler à de la torture.

Avançons jusqu'à janvier. Comment avez-vous vécu cette expérience?

Price: En réalité, pour moi ça a commencé pendant la campagne lorsque j'ai entendu le candidat Trump s'attaquer à plusieurs reprises à la communauté du renseignement, dans une démarche agressive et concertée. Ce n'était pas seulement le fait qu'il citait WikiLeaks. Ce n'était pas seulement le fait qu'il comparait la communauté du renseignement aux nazis. On aurait presque pu ignorer tout cela et considérer que son discours était vide de sens. Mais il rejetait systématiquement les analyses très fiables de la communauté du renseignement sur des sujets tels que l'ingérence de la Russie dans notre élection, et il appelait ça des «fake news», et considérait qu'il s'agissait d'une supercherie.

Son manque de respect quant à l'importance du rôle de commandant en chef est vraiment apparu au premier plan lors de sa première journée complète en exercice, lorsqu'il s'est rendu au siège de la CIA à Langley. Il s'est tenu devant le Memorial Wall, le mur qui honore les agents de la CIA qui ont perdu la vie dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions, et il a parlé de la taille de la foule lors de son investiture. Il a plaisanté en disant qu'il fallait repartir en Irak pour voler leur pétrole. Le nom de l'un de mes mentors est gravé sur ce mur, ainsi que les noms de plusieurs anciens collègues.

À quel moment avez-vous commencé à réfléchir à votre départ?

Price: La goutte d'eau qui a fait déborder le vase pour moi, c'est la note de service qui nommait Steve Bannon au Conseil de sécurité nationale. Il retirait le directeur de la CIA et le directeur du renseignement national, ainsi que le président du Comité des chefs d'état-major interarmées du Comité des directeurs. Et ça m'a conforté dans l'idée qu'il s'agissait d'une administration qui se tournerait vers des conseillers politiques et des idéologues. J'ai décidé qu'en tant qu'analyste du renseignement, j'aurais eu le choix entre me tourner les pouces toute la journée et écrire des rapports qui prendraient la poussière.

Ned Price est désormais enseignant à l'université George Washington et contributeur pour MSNBC.

Quels sont les points communs de toutes les histoires que nous sommes en train d'entendre ?

McGowan: Je crois que c'est le fait qu'il y avait un effort concerté pour sélectionner les candidats qui méprisaient le plus l'agence qu'ils allaient servir. Cette sorte de mantra déconstructionniste, où vous voulez faire comprendre à quel point vous dévalorisez le travail et le personnel d'une agence particulière.

Cox: Je ne pense pas que cela soit comparable à ce qui s'est passé au Memorial Wall, mais le président est venu à l'EPA en mars, et le jour de sa visite, ils ont transmis une note à l'ensemble du personnel. Ils ont appelé l'événement «Notre grand jour». Et la note disait que le président allait essentiellement éliminer tout le progrès qui avait été accompli dans la lutte contre le changement climatique sous Obama. C'était ça «Notre grand jour»?

McGowan: Pourquoi «notre»? À qui faisaient-ils référence?

Cox: Un autre élément qui semble ressortir dans chacune de nos expériences c'est le fait qu'il s'agit de personnes qui se moquent des autres opinions. À de nombreuses occasions, ils ont demandé des informations sur une question spécifique en indiquant qu'il y aurait une réunion de suivi. Mais ces réunions n'ont jamais eu lieu. À chaque fois que le moment de la prise de décision arrivait, Pruitt et ses collaborateurs les plus proches n'en faisaient qu'à leurs têtes, et ça s'arrêtait là. Et l'EPA est une organisation scientifique! On est censés attacher de l'importance aux faits! Même sous le gouvernement Bush ce n'était pas comme ça.

Price: Le point commun qui me frappe c'est que je crois que personne ici n'a cherché à se retrouver dans cette position. Je veux dire qu'en ce qui me concerne, j'adorais mon travail. J'étais plus que satisfait à l'idée de rester un bureaucrate jusqu'à la fin de mes jours. Et franchement, j'espère revenir dans la fonction publique lorsque tout sera rentré dans l'ordre.

Shaub: Je crois encore une fois que mon expérience est légèrement différente, ou en tout cas ma vision. Je me préoccupe moins des points de vue sur la politique. Ma grande préoccupation concerne davantage ce que j'appelle «le récipient». Je vois les structures de notre forme de gouvernement représentatif comme un récipient, et les politiques sont simplement ce que vous mettez à l'intérieur.

Ce qui m'a le plus affecté, c'est l'attaque sur le récipient. Lorsque vous avez un président qui conserve ses intérêts financiers, même si vous le soutenez, vous ne pouvez pas savoir sur quoi reposent ses décisions. Et ça devient particulièrement grave lorsque vous le voyez encenser Erdogan après qu'il se soit emparé des pleins pouvoirs, ou inviter le meurtrier Duterte à Washington, alors qu'il possède des biens immobiliers en Turquie et aux Philippines.

Mais le point commun que je remarque c'est le refus de se fier aux experts. À l'OGE, nous nous considérions comme des acteurs dans le domaine des solutions. Alors revenons aux intérêts financiers du président. J'ai dit à plusieurs reprises qu'il devait les vendre. Mais même s'il ne voulait pas les vendre, on aurait pu trouver d'autres solutions qui auraient permis de limiter les dégâts, en annonçant par exemple qu'aucun représentant de l'administration ne participerait à un événement organisé dans un établissement possédé par Trump ou affichant son nom. Cela aurait pu empêcher le Koweït et Bahreïn et d'autres pays d'y organiser des événements, parce qu'ils auraient su qu'aucun employé de la Maison-Blanche n'aurait franchi la porte. On aurait aussi pu lui recommander de respecter les précédents en matière de népotisme au lieu d'obtenir du département de la Justice un changement de sa position sur le népotisme vieille d'une décennie.

Alors lorsque la Maison-Blanche me dénigrera en disant que j'essayais de les saboter, la vérité c'est que s'ils avaient suivi mes recommandations, ils en seraient ressortis plus forts.

Walter Shaub, Mike Cox, Edward Price et Sharon McGowan à Washington, le 10 octobre 2017.

Walt, j'ai entendu que vous aviez une liste de vérification mentale qui vous a aidé à prendre une décision quant à votre démission.

Shaub: Oui, c'est une liste de vérification en trois parties que j'ai recommandée à d'autres. La première question à se poser c'est: «Puis-je accomplir la mission efficacement?» Ensuite: «Puis-je accomplir mon travail éthiquement et moralement?» Et enfin: «Puis-je dire la vérité?» Je n'ai certainement jamais eu peur de dire la vérité. J'ai eu l'impression d'accomplir ma mission de manière éthique et morale, mais j'ai atteint un point où je ne pensais plus pouvoir remplir ma mission efficacement. Je n'ai cessé de me poser cette question chaque mois. Et pendant plusieurs mois, je suis resté parce que tout n'était pas perdu.

Par exemple, malgré toutes ces histoires de déplacements en jet privé, (il fait référence à l'allergie manifeste aux vols commerciaux dont souffrent certains membres du gouvernement, ndlr) ce dont vous n'entendez pas parler ce sont les conflits d'intérêts financiers de certains membres, et c'est grâce à l'OGE qui a réussi à accomplir sa mission malgré un manque de soutien de la Maison-Blanche. J'ai en fait discuté personnellement avec un candidat qui était extrêmement riche et extrêmement brillant et je lui ai dit: «Vous avez bâti votre gloire et votre fortune grâce à vos talents d'habile négociateur, mais la pire chose qui pourrait vous arriver maintenant c'est d'employer ce talent et de réussir à me faire reculer.» À la fin, il a accepté de céder la majorité de ses possessions, ce qui représentait pour lui un fardeau considérable. Et je le félicite pour cette démarche.

Certains membres du gouvernement se sont montrés bien plus hostiles. Mais en fin de compte, devoir négocier avec eux faisait partie de notre travail et nous avions trouvé des alliés en la personne de leurs propres avocats privés qui leur expliquaient que nos propositions étaient la bonne chose à faire. Nous avons aussi remporté une victoire en obtenant les dispenses au code d'éthique que la Maison-Blanche distribuait (les dispenses autorisent les employés du gouvernement à contourner certaines exigences d'éthique, et l'administration Trump en distribuait en secret, ndlr). Ils nous ont attaqués très publiquement pendant un mois en nous demandant de ne pas les publier, mais la pression publique a porté ses fruits.

Malgré cela, la plus grosse surprise est arrivée lorsque j'ai vu les dérogations de mes propres yeux. De nombreuses dérogations n'étaient pas signées, n'étaient pas datées ou étaient explicitement ou implicitement rétroactives. Bien sûr, si vous avez besoin d'une dérogation rétroactive, cela signifie que vous avez enfreint une règle. De plus, deux des dérogations avaient été remises à un groupe d'employés qui semblait inclure l'auteur de la dérogation. Il est possible que cette personne se soit attribué elle-même une dérogation.

C'est à ce moment-là que j'ai réalisé que ces gens étaient capables de tout. Et ils avaient aussi commencé à s'adapter à mes prises de parole en public sur ces manquements à l'éthique en coupant simplement les ponts avec l'OGE. Je me suis retrouvé dans une situation où j'aurais dû certifier un certain nombre de rapports de transparence financière de la Maison-Blanche sans savoir ce que les candidats faisaient dans la vie. Alors j'ai eu peur de ne devenir qu'une façade pour dissimuler la corruption.

Quels sont vos rapports avec vos anciens collègues aujourd'hui ?

McGowan: Depuis que je suis partie, j'ai reçu de nombreux e-mails de gens – pas uniquement mes collègues de la division des droits civiques, mais aussi des personnes contre lesquelles je me suis battue – qui disaient: «Je suis tellement heureux que tu fasses ce que tu fais.» Il y avait tellement de gens qui voulaient partir... Mais c'est une décision tellement difficile et personnelle. Certains employés sont la principale source de revenus de la famille. Pour d'autres, il y a cette crainte de ne pas savoir qui prendrait leur place. Certaines personnes disent avoir presque l'impression de se noyer. Pendant combien de temps vais-je réussir à retenir mon souffle et à tenir bon, parce que je veux pouvoir rassembler les morceaux lorsque tout cela sera fini?

Lorsque je leur parle de ma décision, c'est vraiment avec tristesse et une grande délicatesse pour ne pas donner l'impression de m'être sentie supérieure. Je savais simplement que mon travail et ma passion seraient mieux employés en adoptant une attitude de résistance. J'ai aussi conscience d'être très privilégiée. Puisque je sais que des gens qui sont toujours à l'intérieur luttent pour conserver leur intégrité et leur fierté dans leur travail, je crois que c'est vraiment important de les encourager et de leur faire comprendre qu'ils ne trahissent pas ce qui est juste et bon dans le monde.

Price: Je me suis retrouvé dans une position similaire. Lorsque je me préparais à annoncer ma démission, je n'étais pas vraiment préoccupé par la réaction qu'auraient les trolls sur Twitter ou les membres du gouvernement actuel. J'avais surtout peur que mes anciens collègues ne croient que je me pensais supérieur.

Alors ça m'a vraiment réconforté d'apprendre qu'ils me considéraient toujours comme un membre à part entière de l'équipe. Ils me voient toujours comme quelqu'un qui, de bien des façons, continue à défendre leurs intérêts.

McGowan: J'ai cette théorie amusante selon laquelle il suffit de regarder les profils de réseaux sociaux des gens pour savoir s'ils sont en recherche d'emploi. Lorsqu'ils ont un peu plus de culot que d'habitude, je me dis: «Oh, il a sûrement obtenu un second entretien.» En revanche, lorsque les gens sont plus nombreux à me demander de servir de référence, j'ai peur qu'un obstacle ne les pousse par-dessus bord. Généralement, il me faut un certain temps pour identifier cet obstacle.

Shaub: Pour moi, ça a été plus brutal. J'ai travaillé avec ces gens pendant quinze ans, et bien que je sois théoriquement autorisé à leur parler, j'ai peur qu'une photo de moi en train de déjeuner avec eux ne se retrouve dans le journal et que je sois accusé à tort de discuter du fond. Alors je suis resté à l'écart. C'est l'aspect humain: ils me manquent vraiment.

Cox: J'ai une question. Est-ce que des gens vous contactent depuis votre organisation et vous demandent de l'aide pour amplifier une cause ou une autre?

Price: Mes anciens collègues se trouvent dans une position délicate parce qu'ils sont au courant d'informations confidentielles auxquelles je n'ai plus accès. Bien sûr, ils ne m'ont pas divulgué d'informations secrètes mais ils ont abordé des questions plus générales, comme le moral des employés au sein de la communauté du renseignement, ce qui se passe au niveau du personnel du Conseil de la sécurité nationale, ainsi que le chaos qui continue de régner à la Maison-Blanche.

Ce qui me frappe, c'est ce climat de paranoïa. Personne ne me contactera en m'envoyant simplement un SMS ou en me téléphonant. Tout le monde commence une conversation en me demandant si j'utilise Signal, ou si je suis sur WhatsApp. Choisissez votre service chiffré. Ce qui est drôle c'est qu'ils me poseront cette question et le jour suivant je recevrai un message de leur part sur Signal du type: «Salut, comment ça va ? Je voulais juste prendre de tes nouvelles.»

Shaub: Ils discutent juste de choses personnelles?

Price: Exactement. Ils ne révèlent aucune information classée secrète ou confidentielle.

McGowan: Mais on a le sentiment que même le simple fait d'être vu avec quelqu'un qui est parti est effrayant.

Avez-vous au moins eu l'occasion d'échanger des blagues douteuses avant de partir?

McGowan: La semaine qui a suivi l'élection, j'ai écrit un e-mail à un ami de la branche des droits civiques – quelqu'un avec qui je m'étais déjà disputée – et je lui ai demandé s'il rafraîchissait ses connaissances sur le Korematsu (L'arrêt controversé rendu par la Cour suprême qui a autorisé le gouvernement américain à incarcérer des Japonais-américains dans des camps d'internement pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, ndlr). Et il m'a répondu: «Ce n'est pas drôle.» Et j'ai dit: «Je sais que ce n'est pas drôle!»

Walter Shaub, Edward Price, Sharon McGowan et Mike Cox.

Je me demande si tout cela aura un effet dissuasif sur les jeunes aspirant à une carrière dans la fonction publique.

McGowan: J'ai toujours chanté les louanges de la fonction publique en expliquant à quel point c'est puissant, surtout en ce qui me concerne. À chaque fois que quelqu'un parlait du gouvernement comme de l'Homme («The Man», expression désignant le système ou l'autorité en anglais, ndlr), je plaisantais toujours en disant qu'apparemment, l'Homme était une lesbienne d'un mètre soixante originaire du Queens. Alors si je peux être l'Homme, n'importe qui peut l'être.

Mais désormais, c'est bien plus difficile pour moi de convaincre les gens que le service fédéral est l'endroit où ils pourront ressentir le même sentiment d'épanouissement que j'ai éprouvé lorsque j'y étais. Savoir que le pouvoir du gouvernement fédéral est utilisé pour causer tellement de tort – pour déchirer des familles, pour cautionner la discrimination – ça me semble maladroit d'essayer de vendre le service fédéral à un membre de l'une des communautés qui sont victimes des abus. J'attends avec impatience le jour où tout cela appartiendra à l'histoire ancienne.

Shaub: Et bien, j'ai toujours peur de cet effet dissuasif. Je veux saisir cette opportunité pour encourager les jeunes à rejoindre la fonction publique. Et la fonction publique se présente sous de nombreuses formes. Il y a l'administration des états et les autorités locales, les associations à but non lucratif et bien sûr, le gouvernement fédéral, que je recommande toujours fortement. Les jeunes qui arrivent vont se retrouver aux niveaux inférieurs et seront isolés de la majorité des bouleversements. En même temps, ils se retrouvent avec des responsabilités importantes à un très jeune âge. Et ils peuvent faire une différence en essayant d'apporter des services de base à la nation.

La fonction publique est vraiment gratifiante. J'ai encore des prêts étudiants à rembourser alors heureusement que c'est gratifiant.

The National Human Rights Commission has issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh government over the death of 26 people in a blast at an NTPC plant in Rae Bareli.

The forced displacement of ethnic Rohingya people from the Rakhine state of Myanmar has resulted in a massive refugee crisis in South Asia and left India with a missed opportunity to prove its neighbourly worth.

When Osama bin Laden wasn't planning terrorist attacks, such as 9/11, he was apparently watching YouTube videos like ""Charlie Bit My Finger"", among other pop cultural things, such as Tom & Jerry cartoons.

Main News

The CIA has released over 470,000 files from the raid carried out on the late Osama bin Laden's hideout, excluding classified information sensitive to national security, as also a cache of pornography, pop songs and malware.

All unwelcome physical contact cannot be called sexual harassment unless it is in the nature of a sexually oriented behaviour, the Delhi High Court has said.

Scientists have found a previously undiscovered hidden chamber in Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza, the first such discovery in the structure since the 19th century.

Off The Front Page

An increase in sales volumes of consumer packaged goods companies has boosted hopes of a recovery in consumption demand, indicating the possible end of the lingering effects of last year's demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax regime in July.

Hitting out at Rahul Gandhi for meeting the Chinese Ambassador during the recent border standoff at Doklam, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said it was a matter of ""great sadness"" that the Congress Vice-President did not ""trust the country or its government"" during that period.

The United States Senate on Thursday unanimously confirmed Kenneth Ian Juster as the next ambassador to India, filling a position that has been vacant for months after Richard Verma, an Obama appointee, left in the traditional churn accompanying the administration change.

Opinion

Ever since Hardik Patel came in contact with the Congress, he has been vacillating from one extreme to another. The party has also been trying a balancing act between the Patidars, Dalits and other backward classes. Will this turn of events prove to be the Congress' pain or gain? asks Aurangzeb Nashqbandi in the Hindustan Times.

The Hindu asks three leading experts whether sexual harassers should be named and shamed in public. The answers, unsurprisingly, range from 'Yes', 'No' and 'It's complicated'.

The 19th Party Congress has re-identified the 'principal contradiction' facing society. There will be consequences, warns Jahangir Aziz in The Indian Express.

We've all seen the day-after images of race day disasters. The things some of us manage to get up to at the races aren't pretty. If you're around work people there are some simple rules to follow.

Rule Number 1: Keep it classy.

The months ahead are full of opportunities to socialise with colleagues and clients. If you're lucky enough to find yourself at a company sponsored race day, relax, have fun and get to know the people you are with. However, never lose sight of the fact your behaviour will reflect on your character and career potential.

While most people expect a more relaxed and informal atmosphere at work events, equally most expect a degree of decorum. Keeping it classy means behaving in a way any reasonable person would consider respectful. That is to both the people you are with and yourself. While it's always important to be authentic, work events are definitely a setting you need to bring the best version of yourself to.

Reflect for a moment on the guy who decided it was a great idea to share his karaoke singing talents, uninvited, at an event attended by clients. The simple, albeit harsh reality is if he could sing particularly well, most people wouldn't have cared. The trouble was he couldn't and in his inebriated state he struggled to even remember the lyrics.

While rolling around drunk, and encouraging the crowd to join in on a singalong might be okay at a private party, there are so many reasons it's not okay at a work event. This same guy was, at that time, hoping for a promotion. His justification for his behaviour was that he wanted to 'bring a bit of life' to the party and could see no harm in how he had behaved. Being the class clown isn't the best path to career success.

Keep it classy and you're entirely more likely to enhance your reputation for being a mature and professional individual.

Rule Number 2: Drink in moderation.

The most important and common pitfall to avoid is drinking to excess. This can be particularly challenging if you enjoy a drink and alcohol is free flowing over a long day. It's okay to have a few, but understand your limits and pace yourself. The last thing you want is to turn up to work the next day and discover you said or did a bunch of things you can't even remember.

Rule Number 3: Hold your tongue.

Taking the opportunity to provide feedback to your CEO on their performance isn't a great idea when you've had a few too many. One young man I met faced the daunting task of having to meet with the CEO the morning after he did exactly that at a work event. This was made worse by the fact he couldn't recall what he had said and needed to be reminded, by the CEO!

As a leader, HR professional or event organiser the spotlight is on you. The standard of behaviour you set through example is the same standard you can expect from others. Poor judgement and bad behaviour is unfortunately all too common among the people in charge. Take for example the CEO who was found outside the venue in a compromising position with a junior team member. While the team who gathered to observe may have had a laugh, the flow on impacts to his reputation and career were devastating.

Keep it classy and you're entirely more likely to enhance your reputation for being a mature and professional individual. In other words, be the kind of person who can be trusted to represent the organisation well.

Kouzoukas will die Krankheit mit ihren Bildern bekannter machen - und anderen betroffenen Frauen Mut machen

Endometriose ist eine weit verbreitete Frauenkrankheit, die oft erst nach langer Leidenszeit diagnostiziert wird

Eigentlich wollte die junge Amerikanerin Thessy Kouzoukas die intimen Bilder von sich nicht veröffentlichen. Aber es war ihr wichtig, anderen Frauen zu zeigen, dass sie mit ihren Schmerzen nicht alleine sind. Das war im Juli. Aber die Bilder haben nichts an ihrer Bedeutung verloren.

Denn: Kouzoukas leidet an Endometriose, einer Frauenkrankheit, bei der sich ein gutartiges Gewebe im Unterleib wie zum Beispiel in den Eierstöcken oder der Blase ansiedelt.

Diese Gewebeherde rufen Entzündungsreaktionen hervor, außerdem können sich Zysten und Verwachsungen bilden. Die betroffenen Frauen leiden während der Regel unter heftigen Schmerzen und können unfruchtbar werden.

Endometriose bleibt oft unerkannt – während die Betroffenen unter heftigen Schmerzen leiden

Das Problem ist jedoch, dass die Krankheit oft unerkannt bleibt. Dabei ist Endometriose eines der häufigsten gynäkologischen Leiden weltweit. Kouzoukas wendet sich deshalb mit drastischen Bildern und Worten an die Instagram-User.

Sie schreibt:

""Für die meisten Leute ist das schockierend. Das bin ich. Das ist Endometriose. Ich hatte nie vor, das zu veröffentlichen, ich bin darauf ja nackt zu sehen – aber ich kann einfach nicht glauben, wie viele Mädchen mir private Nachrichten geschickt haben, weil sie auch an Endometriose leiden und sich allein gelassen fühlen. Auf dem linken Bild ist mein Bauch zu sehen, drei Wochen, nachdem eine Zyste geplatzt ist (das war vor fünf Wochen). Auf dem rechten Bild könnt ihr sehen, wie ich jetzt aussehe. Ich nehme gerade ein Medikament namens Synarel. Es hemmt meine Hormonproduktion und schickt mich im Alter von 27 Jahren in die Wechseljahre. Aber dieses Medikament und meine baldige Reise nach Griechenland sollen mich körperlich und psychisch auf eine Operation vorbereiten, die Ende August stattfinden wird. Endometriose ist kein Witz. Ich werde wahrscheinlich länger als sieben Stunden operiert und eine Woche im Krankenhaus bleiben müssen. Bitte, macht diese Krankheit bekannt. Und wenn ihr eine Frau kennt, die unter heftigen Regelschmerzen leidet, dann sagt ihr bitte, dass sie sich untersuchen lassen soll. Und ich will allen Frauen und Mädchen, die daran leiden, sagen: Ihr seid nicht allein.""

In Deutschland sind zwei bis sechs Millionen Frauen betroffen

Auch in Deutschland wird Endometriose oft erst spät diagnostiziert – teilweise erst zehn Jahre nach dem Auftreten der ersten Symptome. Schätzungen zufolge leiden etwa sieben bis 15 Prozent aller Frauen im geschlechtsreifen Alter unter der Krankheit. Das sind in Deutschland ungefähr zwei bis sechs Millionen Frauen.

In einem Artikel für die HuffPost USA schreibt Kouzoukas, wie wichtig es deshalb ist, die Symptome – wie zum Beispiel heftige Regelschmerzen – ernst zu nehmen:

""Als ich als Teenager zum ersten Mal meine Periode bekommen hatte, nannten sie mich 'faul', weil ich beim Sportunterricht in der Schule nicht mit machen konnte oder 'Drama Queen', weil nicht in die Schule kam – ich krümmte mich in der Dusche vor Schmerzen, während ich verzweifelt versuchte, mein Leiden zu lindern.""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Italien will Frauen ""Menstruationsurlaub"" geben

""Niemand sagt dir, wie viel Schmerz okay ist""

Wenn sie früher von der Existenz der Krankheit gewusst hätte, würde es ihr heute besser gehen, da ist sich Kouzoukas sicher. Sie will deshalb ein Bewusstsein dafür schaffen, dass Frauen oder Mädchen sich bei heftigen Regelschmerzen nicht schämen, sondern unbedingt zum Arzt gehen sollten.

Foodbanks not in Universal Credit areas see 12% increase

Hammersmith and Fulham foodbank sees sharp 94% rise On a street lined with rows of multi-million pound Edwardian houses and Mercedes, Porsches and BMWs, lies the Hammersmith and Fulham Foodbank in South West London. Housed within a church and open twice a week, the foodbank helps hundreds of people a year with emergency parcels. Despite its unlikely location, the wealthy London borough’s part in the roll out of Universal Credit has seen demand across the area’s three foodbanks soar by 94%, figures seen by HuffPost UK reveal.

George Bowden/HuffPost UK The Hammersmith and Fulham Foodbank near Parsons Green, South West London, is housed within a church and open two times a week. Demand has surged by 94% since Universal Credit hit the area last year.

Sitting at a table looking at the list of tinned and fresh goods available with her daughter and grand-daughter is Maggie Millard. “I’ve been here four times since the beginning of last month,” the 57-year-old tells HuffPost. “I was moved from [Employment Support Allowance] and onto Universal Credit. As soon as that happened, I just couldn’t pay the rent. I didn’t have enough.” SUBSCRIBE AND FOLLOW UK Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.

Pinterest CLOSE Through tears, she explains how the government’s cap in housing benefit means she does not receive enough Universal Credit to cover the full rent on her council-owned home of 20 years. ″I went into arrears straight away,” she says. “Now they say I’ll have to pay half the rent, but what about money for everything else?”

George Bowden/HuffPost UK Maggie Millard has been forced to use food banks since moving onto Universal Credit. She's one of dozens of claimants who have been left with no option but to repeatedly seek emergency parcels to feed themselves.

Since moving onto the new benefits regime, which has been rolled out in the borough since June 2016, Maggie has been forced to seek emergency help for basics like food and heating. She’s been attending the food bank for a month, in which time she has been directed to support from Citizens Advice, who are helping her navigate the myriad of confusing rules Universal Credit imposes. “People here have been great, so, so helpful,” she says. “Other places make you feel like you’ve crawled out from a rock.”

George Bowden/HuffPost UK Food bank manager Daphine Aikens talks to Maggie Millard about her situation on a recent weekday.

“There are so many more Maggies,” food bank manager Daphine Aikens says. “It’s been brutal. Some people have been made to wait 12 weeks. People have nothing.” “We had a mum with children, everything stopped when she moved to Universal Credit,” she adds. “She had nothing and within two weeks she had no food. The family didn’t eat one weekend and her child was wandering the streets stealing food from bins.”

The entire service helped feed 2,364 people in the first half of 2016. The same figure after Universal Credit began, was 4,601

Aikens, who oversees three food banks across the area, revealed that the entire service helped feed 2,364 people in the first half of 2016. The same figure for 2017, after the roll out of Universal Credit began, was 4,601. An increase of around 94%. “It’s been horrendous. The reality is we’re seeing people who have not eaten for days, who can’t pay their rent, who are starving, and they’re borrowing,” she says. “Whereas once we’d see someone in their hour of need once or twice, we see them now multiple times. It’s so much worse.”

George Bowden/HuffPost UK The Hammersmith and Fulham foodbank near Parsons Green sits between multi-million pound homes and besides luxury super cars. Those visiting the foodbank have to walk through this street to get there.

The Hammersmith and Fulham service is part of the Trussell Trust foodbank network, which revealed on Tuesday that the average surge in demand across all its centres in Universal Credit full service areas was 30%, when compared with a year ago. Comparative analysis of foodbanks not in full Universal Credit rollout areas showed an average increase of 12%. “We’re seeing soaring demand at foodbanks across the UK,” Mark Ward, Interim Chief Executive at The Trussell Trust, says. “The simple truth is that even with the enormous generosity of our donors and volunteers, we’re concerned foodbanks could struggle to meet demand this winter if critical changes to benefit delivery aren’t made now. “People cannot be left for weeks without any income, and when that income does come, it must keep pace with living costs – foodbanks cannot be relied upon to pick up the pieces.”

Singh, who campaigned on the promise during his party's recent leadership race, said he will push the federal New Democrats to make the position part of its own formal policy platform.

The NDP is scheduled to hold a policy convention in Ottawa in February.

""We have the evidence,"" Singh said in an interview this week. ""Why do we continue down a path that makes no sense?""

Singh, a former criminal defence lawyer, has been vocal about the opioid issue ever since becoming the party's new leader, including during a trip last week to British Columbia, when he paid a visit to an overdose prevention site in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside.

In his legal practice, Singh said he witnessed first-hand how the current criminal approach is failing.

""We are prosecuting people and incarcerating people that don't need to be incarcerated,"" he said. ""These are folks that need to be helped and supported.""

The majority of Canadians struggling with opioid addiction are also battling problems like mental health challenges and poverty, Singh said, noting that he would exclude drug trafficking from any decriminalization efforts.

On Saturday, Singh told about 2,000 delegates at the B.C. NDP convention that Canada's drug laws need to change to recognize drug addiction is a social justice issue, not a criminal justice problem.

We have the evidence. Why do we continue down a path that makes no sense? Jagmeet SIngh

His comments come as Canadian health-care experts, including B.C.'s provincial health officer, urge the federal government to strongly consider borrowing from Portugal's approach to drug policy, including decriminalizing personal possession of illicit drugs.

Earlier this year, B.C.'s chief medical officer Perry Kendall said precious time and resources are being spent chasing people around the court system — exertions that do nothing to curb the drug supply or prevent drug deaths.

""I think it is incumbent upon us, if we are really serious about trying to deal with this epidemic which is actually killing people, then we need to look at these alternative, regulatory frameworks to see if they might work for us,"" Kendall said.

It is up to Ottawa to shift its approach, because the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act is a federal law, he added. Portugal did not decriminalize all drugs in all circumstances, but rather removed the application of criminal law on personal possession for limited amounts while offering education and social supports, he said.

'There's so much stigma'

Leila Attar, a 20-year-old advocate who suffered an overdose last November after taking Percocet pills laced with fentanyl, said Tuesday she is pleased leaders like Singh are speaking about decriminalization, even if it's not a ""popular opinion.""

""There's so much stigma,"" said Attar, who is channelling her own experiences into helping others at a pop-up injection site in Ottawa.

If Trudeau fails to consider decriminalization, he is turning away from an approach that could save lives, she added.

""It is frustrating,"" Attar said. ""We know there are so many people that are experts ... pushing for the same thing.""

Singh, who visited the Ottawa pop-up site in September during his leadership bid, said while social workers and advocates are trying to step up, the government has done nothing so far to stem the tide of tragedy.

""The reason it is happening is because people are dying,"" Singh said.

Indeed, these two have much in common: a painful colonial history, a moment of glory as the post-colonial ruling elite made the nation proud, followed by a rather disappointing and depressing end to the relevance of liberation movement politics.

Does it follow that South Africa has to follow the same downward trajectory, or that there is no rescuing Zimbabwe from complete collapse? Not necessarily. It is worth noting that a range of factors conspire against positive and peaceful outcomes. One relates to leadership weaknesses -- ruling and opposition parties alike.

Despite the dangers of predicting the ""demise of Mugabe"" (by now a legendary tale of how to get it wrong, a bit like predicting the end of the Cold War), it is becoming clear that even as Mr Mugabe nears the end of his reign, he manages to disrupt the succession race -- using his motley crew of supporters to remove any and all challengers to the throne.

A supporter of the ruling party Zanu PF holds a poster outside the party headquarters to show support for President Robert Mugabe following a wave of anti-governement protests over the last two weeks in Harare, Zimbabwe July 20, 2016.

One after the other, they end up joining the equally bleak opposition landscape. Could it be that Grace Mugabe has a chance to take control of the presidency? Under these conditions, conspiracy theories and speculation swirl and clog the social media.

Eerily, South Africa's ruling party fortunes are beginning to show similar symptoms of degenerate behaviour. There is no telling the outcome of the December elective conference and whether the Zuma or Ramaphosa block will take control of the party (and it is another question what to expect at the forthcoming national elections in 2019).

South Africa's President Jacob Zuma (R) jokes with his party's newly appointed Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa (L).

Accompanying this trend -- the failure of liberation movement politics -- is the growth of complex and multilayered criminal networks that benefit from state fragility. Its dynamics have variously been described as ""state capture"", or the ""shadow or mafia state"" at work.

Viewed together with the established phenomenon of the rule of the big man -- patrimonialism -- it is hard not to conclude that both Zimbabwe and South Africa are inescapably degenerating into violent state failure.

South Africa as the most powerful neighbour seems divided over strategy. A range of civil society organisations demand action.

Several initiatives are at hand to intervene, arrest, and recover the slide. In Zimbabwe, the most recent big intervention -- SADC mediation under the leadership of Mr Mbeki resulting in a government of national unity -- brought temporary relief, but arguably allowed criminal networks to spring even deeper roots.

South Africa as the most powerful neighbour seems divided over strategy. A range of civil society organisations demand action. Political interests at home and abroad attempt to blow new life in the governing ZANU-PF or the fractured opposition.

The private sector appears disinterested, passively awaiting the inevitable. What is to be done? Unfortunately, South Africa finds itself under similar pressure -- trying to avoid falling over the socio-economic, political and fiscal cliff.

Under these conditions, it is everyone for him and herself, and the prospects for the twins look bleak indeed.

Trittin habe ""keine Angst vor der Unwahrheit""“ und sei stets darauf bedacht, ""den Verhandlungspartner schlecht aussehen"" zu lassen.

Trittin hatte kürzlich im ""Spiegel"" kritisiert, Union und FDP wären sich einig, dass die Grünen in den Verhandlungen möglichst wenige ihrer Punkte durchsetzen sollten. Palmer glaubt: ""Wer sowas behauptet, kann die Verhandlungen doch gleich lassen."" Dann warf er dem Parteilinken gar eine Lüge vor.

Nicht wegen ihm seien die Sondierungsgespräche mit der Union 2013 gescheitert, hatte Trittin betont. ""Damals gab es für Merkel einen Partner, der leichter zu haben war als wir: die SPD"", sagte er im ""Spiegel"". Laut Palmer eine ""glatte Lüge"".

Dass das Verhältnis zwischen Palmer und Trittin schwierig ist, zeigte sich spätestens im August. Als Boris Palmer sein Buch ""Wir können nicht allen helfen"" über die deutsche Flüchtlingspolitik vorstellte, ätzte Trittin: ""Wie, hatte Erika Steinbach keine Zeit?"" Palmer hatte die CDU-Vizevorsitzende Julia Klöckner zur Buchpräsentation geladen.","""Ein Trauerspiel"": Grünen-Politiker Palmer attackiert Parteikollege Trittin",http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2017/11/06/trittin-palmer-gruene_n_18481938.html?utm_hp_ref=germany

Addressing thousands of indigenous church followers during what was termed a ""Super Sunday Rally"" at a stadium in Harare, Grace described Mnangagwa as a ""liquidator"", and ""ravisher"" whose coup plots could be traced to 1980.

If the 'right to bear arms' is the constitutional reasoning that prevents a nation-wide ban on assault-style weapons, why is there a ban on fully automatic weapons?","""Thoughts and prayers are not enough. These guns are designed for one thing, to kill people.""

""In dark times such as these, Americans do what we do best: we pull together. We join hands. We lock arms."" -- Donald Trump.

The President left a few final words off the end of his statement. It should have read: ""We join hands. We lock arms. And we do nothing"".

Political platitudes are an insult to the dead. The inaction of America's leadership in removing semi-automatic, assault-style weapons from proliferation throughout the suburbs of the United States has allowed the bloody parade of mass killings to roll on. Sutherland Springs. Las Vegas. Orlando.

The blood of the dead has settled upon the hands of federal politicians.

This is not a recent stigma that can be laid at the feet of the current Administration alone. Republicans and Democrats alike are culpable for their lack of action in ensuring the safety of the American people from domestic terrorism at the hands of lone gunmen.

On June 16, 2016, President Obama addressed the American people following the massacre of 49 people at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. It was the 14th such speech during his time in Office and still there was no federal push to ban assault-style weapons. Indeed, Obama was still struggling to ban the sale of armour-piercing ammunition across the United States.

The AR-15 assault rifle and similar weapons are designed for one thing. To kill people. They are not an effective hunting weapon relative to the myriad of precision rifles available, designed for taking down deer and other game at extended ranges.

In fact the NRA, manufacturers and supporters of assault style weapons readily admit that the AR-15 and weapons like it are primarily marketed for home and self-defence. Self-defence against whom? Invading armies?

Some U.S. administrations do have tighter gun control than others. Assault weapons are banned in Washington D.C. as were handguns until relatively recently. The City's fight to maintain workable restrictions on access to certain firearms has been undermined by successive rulings in the U.S. Supreme Court that aspects of D.C.'s gun control laws were 'unconstitutional'.

Doing what is right is not always popular. And for those beholden to the powerful U.S. gun lobby it could be career ending. Therein lies the problem. No Administration has been prepared to take on the gun lobby and rid the nation of semi-automatic, assault-style weapons. Until decision makers are willing to put their own skin in the game, as happened in Australia in the mid '90s, nothing will change.

Australia suffered its most hateful and deadly mass murder in April 1996 when Martin Bryant murdered 35 people, including children, using legally available semi-automatic military weapons.

Australia's newly elected Prime Minister John Howard took immediate action, implementing federal firearm laws over and above state legislation. Mr Howard risked his own political future by implementing federal legislation to ban all assault weapons and restrict all other semi-automatic rifles to rural landholders deemed to have a genuine need to manage feral animals. The Government issued an amnesty and gun buyback at a significant cost to the federal budget bottom line.

At the next election, around a dozen Members of Parliament from the Howard Government lost their seats, in no small measure due to the stand the Government took on gun laws.

The price was worth it. Since 1996 there have been no repeats of the mass murder perpetrated at Port Arthur, while at the same time the rights of recreational shooters -- like myself -- to own firearms have been upheld.

Both sides of Congress have been afraid to take on 'big guns' for fear of being hounded out of office, accused of impinging upon individual rights under the second amendment.

The second amendment has been used as a cover-all, allowing military grade weapons to be proliferated throughout the suburbs of America. And yet the logic is false. If the 'right to bear arms' is the constitutional reasoning that prevents a nation-wide ban on assault-style weapons, why is there a ban on fully automatic weapons? If I have the right to own an AR-15 that discharges one bullet each time I pull the trigger, why not a weapon that can discharge the entire clip in seconds?

Perhaps because it's not in the interest of public safety to allow fully automatic military weapons to rest in the hands of civilians. And yet a semi-automatic version of the same weapon meets the public safety test? Ludicrous.

The precedence of the Australian example and what we are seeing on almost a monthly basis in the United States, places it beyond reasonable doubt that national legislation banning assault-style, semi-automatic weapons will help reduce the likelihood and severity of mass shootings.

Every month of inaction by Congress and, indeed, the President himself, to ban assault-style weapons, hastens the next breaking news story flashing across screens around the world, of another mass slaying in suburban U.S. by a gunman using an AR-15.","Without Presidential Action On Assault Weapons, U.S. Mass Killings Will Continue",http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/brad-emery/without-presidential-action-on-assault-weapons-u-s-mass-killings-will-continue_a_23268763/

Faut-il rappeler que la souveraineté était un déjà thème prioritaire de la dernière campagne électorale?","La fusion entre Québec solidaire et Option nationale constitue une décision politique majeure dont le principal enjeu est l'adhésion d'un important secteur indépendantiste au parti de gauche. Devant cette question essentielle, certains membres de Québec solidaire opposés à la fusion préfèrent dévier le débat sur des éléments procéduriers, ayant recours à des demi-vérités et des exagérations outrancières, loin de la prudence et du dialogue respectueux qui caractérisent ce parti.

Daniel Raunet, dans un billet récent, s'acharne ainsi à démoniser l'entente de principe dévoilé par les directions des deux partis, envers lesquelles il éprouve une mauvaise foi évidente. Son texte est représentatif d'une aversion envers Option nationale et d'une interprétation étroite du programme et des statuts de Québec solidaire. S'opposer à la fusion est une position légitime qui doit toutefois être avancée sans tordre les faits.

Processus

Il est assez étonnant d'accuser d'antidémocratique le processus menant à la fusion, car il fait présentement l'objet d'un débat dans toutes les assemblées locales et sera entériné par un congrès de 500 délégué.es en décembre. Le mandat de négocier une fusion, et non un pacte électoral ou ponctuel - ça vaut la peine d'insister -, a été donné lors du Congrès de mai 2017, lui-même précédé de débats dans les associations locales et de discussions sur les alliances politiques menées par le chantier du Renouveau politique depuis novembre 2016.

Ne faut-il pas reconnaitre que, au-delà de la direction nationale, des centaines de membres solidaires ont appelé de leurs voeux cette union?

Bien sûr, les membres ne pouvaient présumer de l'issue de négociations et de la forme concrète que prendrait l'union, c'est pourquoi les membres sont appelés maintenant à ratifier le projet. Ne faut-il pas reconnaitre que, au-delà de la direction nationale, des centaines de membres solidaires ont appelé de leurs voeux cette union?

La forme de l'entente

Une fusion implique nécessairement des compromis et des efforts de part et d'autre. Reconnaissons l'effort consenti par Option nationale qui accepterait de s'intégrer à Québec solidaire. En clair, le parti cède ses ressources financières et organisationnelles pour faire conjointement la promotion du programme, des statuts, de la direction et des candidatures électorales de Québec solidaire. C'est une fenêtre d'opportunités incroyable que des indépendantistes se rallient aux causes de la gauche, du féminisme et de l'inclusion, plutôt que de retourner au Parti québécois de Jean-François Lisée.

En retour, ON sera reconnu comme collectif au sein de QS avec des mesures d'intégration avant tout transitoires. Loin d'être antidémocratique, la présence d'un collectif au sein de notre parti devrait être perçue comme une action exemplaire pour dynamiser le débat interne et défendre les minorités politiques. Il s'agit d'un point d'appui pour aller plus loin en ce sens. Or, Raunet extrapole certaines clauses de l'entente à tel point qu'il déforme son sens.

N'oublions pas qu'ON apporte avec lui non seulement des sommes propres, mais de nouveaux membres qui cotiseront au parti unifié.

Dans le but d'apporter de l'expérience et de la connaissance qu'elle a bâties en six ans d'existence, le collectif d'Option nationale pourra obtenir du matériel de promotion de l'indépendance payée par le budget du parti. L'université d'été sur l'indépendance sera quant à elle autofinancée. N'oublions pas qu'ON apporte avec lui non seulement des sommes propres, mais de nouveaux membres qui cotiseront au parti unifié. Pourquoi se priverait-on d'activités militantes?

Le collectif délèguera deux personnes sur le Comité de coordination nationale comptant 14 responsables solidaires. Cette représentation ultra minoritaire sur la plus haute instance du parti ne durera qu'une période de transition de deux ans. Stricto sensu, cela constitue la seule et unique dérogation aux statuts de Québec solidaire.

Il est erroné, voire mensonger, d'affirmer que l'entente ""garantit"" une circonscription au chef actuel d'ON, Sol Zanetti. L'article 6 prévoit en fait que les porte-parole de QS appuient trois candidatures à ""l'investiture"", elles devront donc être validées par la base. Manon Massé et Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois ne vont pas ""parachuter"" ou imposer arbitrairement ces candidatures; il est entendu que cette mesure sera appliquée de ""manière collégiale"" par un ""comité de médiation"" constitué entre autres d'associations locales. Dans les partis traditionnels, on voit les parachutistes lancés de plus haute altitude!

Quant à Zanetti, on appuiera sa course dans une circonscription favorable et on le mettra de l'avant lors des communications publiques. L'article 18 parle ""d'activités"" et de ""conférences"" sur l'indépendance, et nullement d'un rôle de ""porte-parole"" tel qu'avancé par Raunet. C'est une pratique qui se fait déjà avec d'autres figures de proue du parti. Il est vrai que Zanetti jouira d'une visibilité médiatique privilégiée, mais cela m'apparait une marque de respect rudimentaire envers les membres onistes qui l'ont élu chef.

Programme

Finalement, abordons les objections politiques et programmatiques, c'est là l'enjeu réel du vote du congrès de décembre. L'ancien journaliste à Radio-Canada se fait écho de plusieurs critiques pour qui l'entente serait la capitulation du ""programme entier"" de QS sur l'indépendance. Encore une fois, l'enflure verbale passe outre le fait que le programme d'ON a évolué depuis 2011 pour adopter la stratégie de l'Assemblée constituante préconisée par QS. Se déchirer sur le la couleur de la Constituante passe à côté de son potentiel mobilisateur de cette stratégie. De plus, un partie importante des membres solidaires partagent la même interprétation que les onistes et, comme 45% des congressistes de mai 2016, souhaitent que l'Assemblée constituante soit dotée d'un mandat déterminé. Ce n'est donc pas l'abandon du programme entier de QS sur l'indépendance, mais l'idée qu'une partie des membres se font de ce programme.

Raunet fait grand cas du concept de gouvernance souverainiste qui, dans le fond, ne fait que rendre explicite le défi lancé par le programme de QS. La mise en oeuvre ne serait-ce qu'une fraction de la plateforme électorale solidaire ébranlerait la fédération canadienne, et cela ne serait-ce que pour négocier la ""participation d'Ottawa"" pour utiliser l'euphémisme consacré. Imaginons aussi qu'un gouvernement solidaire mette au défi les lois migratoires canadiennes pour assurer le refuge décent aux demandeurs d'asile, est-ce qu'on s'en offusquera?

Dernier argument, et non le moindre, on invoque que la fusion mettrait en priorité l'indépendance au détriment des autres principes de Québec solidaire. Pourtant, l'entente édicte que l'indépendance sera visible ""au même titre que les autres principes"", et le ""régime colonial canadien"" au même titre que le néolibéralisme. Faut-il rappeler que la souveraineté était un déjà thème prioritaire de la dernière campagne électorale? Faire un scandale sur cette question ignore cette réalité.

C'est comme si l'indépendance était taboue et qu'on devait lui substituer les mots démocratie, féminisme, justice sociale ou écologie. Or l'indépendance, comme le disait Frantz Fanon, « n'est pas un mot à exorciser, mais une condition indispensable à l'existence des hommes et des femmes vraiment libérés, c'est-à-dire maîtres de tous les moyens matériels qui rendent possible la transformation radicale de la société. » En ce sens, QS n'a jamais hiérarchisé les luttes et ne le fera jamais, fusion ou non. Toutes les luttes se renforcent mutuellement sans se dissoudre dans les autres.

Für die FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer stehen die Chancen auf eine Einigung weiterhin bei 50 zu 50, sagt sie im HuffPost-Interview

Außerdem sieht sie trotz der Kompromissbereitschaft der Grünen große Differenzen

Nach dem Start der zweiten Sondierungsrunde geht es bei Jamaika ums Eingemachte. Nicht nur beim Klimaschutz gibt es weiter Konfliktpotenzial - auch die Flüchtlingspolitik ist ein zentraler Streitpunkt.

Für die FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer stehen die Chancen auf eine Einigung deswegen weiter bei 50 zu 50. In einem Interview mit der HuffPost sagte sie zum Beginn der Gespräche:

""Am Ende ist für uns klar: Wir werden uns nicht selbst verleugnen. Wenn wir die Wahl haben zwischen Glaubwürdigkeitsverlust oder Neuwahlen, entscheiden wir uns für Neuwahlen. Aber das ist nicht unser Ziel.""

Die Grünen gingen am Morgen einen ersten großen Schritt auf die potentiellen Partner zu. Sowohl beim Verbrennungsmotor als auch beim Kohleausstieg zeigten sie Kompromissbereitschaft.

""Wir haben die heutigen Aussagen des Grünen-Chefs in diese Richtung als Signal der Einigungsbereitschaft aufgenommen"", sagte Beer. Dennoch sieht die FDP-Generalsekretärin noch große Differenzen. ""Wir wollen einen Klimaschutz, der funktioniert. Da sind wir grüner als die Grünen"", sagte sie.

""Wir müssen uns eingestehen, dass unsere jetzige Klimaschutzpolitik nicht funktioniert hat. Sie ist die teuerste der Welt, aber wir haben keine einzige Tonne CO2 eingespart. Das ist doch völlig widersinnig.""

Auch bei der Flüchtlingspolitik rief sie den Verhandlungspartner zur Kompromissbereitschaft auf.

""Ich setze darauf, dass auch Cem Özdemir irgendwann für logische Argumente zugänglich wird und in seinem Wahlkreis merkt, dass auch dort nicht alle Flüchtlinge aufgenommen werden können"", sagte Beer.

Das Interview lest ihr hier:

Frau Beer, nehmen wir an, Sie erhalten ein Freiticket für einen Jamaika-Urlaub und können einen Unterhändler aus der Union oder von den Grünen mitnehmen. Wer wäre das?



Von den Verhandlungspartnern kann ich mir auf der Insel sicher eine nette Zeit mit CSU-Generalsekretär Andreas Scheuer machen. Aber eigentlich müsste ich natürlich meine bessere Hälfte mitnehmen.

Heute gehen die Jamaika-Verhandlungen in die zweite Runde, doch es hakt gewaltig. Wird das noch etwas mit der Koalition?

Ich sehe die Chancen nach wie vor bei 50 zu 50, dass Jamaika gelingt. In den kommenden Tagen wird es darum gehen, die Gräben aus dem Weg zu räumen und eine gemeinsame Vision zu entwickeln, die jeder unterschreiben kann.

Das klingt jetzt sehr freundlich. FDP-Chef Lindner redet schon über Neuwahlen und eine mögliche Oppositionsrolle. Wo soll das hinführen?



Am Ende haben wir keine Angst vor Neuwahlen, das wollte er deutlich machen. Uns geht es um eine neue Politik, die deutlich werden muss. Aber wir arbeiten auch nicht auf Neuwahlen hin.



Können Sie uns das versprechen?



Ja.



Woher dann das Gerede über Neuwahlen?



Am Ende ist für uns klar: Wir werden uns nicht selbst verleugnen. Wenn wir die Wahl haben zwischen Glaubwürdigkeitsverlust oder Neuwahlen, entscheiden wir uns für Neuwahlen. Aber das ist nicht unser Ziel.



Haben Sie einen kleinen Westerwelle-Komplex – nicht noch einmal aus dem Bundestag ausscheiden?



Ich neige nicht zu Komplexen, egal, mit welchem Namen Sie das verbinden. Ich neige dazu, feste Prinzipien zu haben. Am Ende muss unsere liberale Handschrift klar erkennbar sein. Wir stehen nicht als Stützrad für eine Schwarz-Rote Politik, wie sie die vergangenen vier Jahre gemacht wurde.



Die Grünen sind ja auch noch mit dabei.



Ja, aber man hat ja schon den Eindruck, dass Schwarz-Grün bereits Vorgefühle entwickelt hat.



Woran machen Sie das fest?



Wenn ich mir den ein oder anderen Gesprächsverlauf anschaue. Aber ich möchte nicht zu viele Internas aus den Sondierungsgesprächen verraten. Generell ist uns natürlich klar, dass wir nicht alle unsere Forderung durchsetzen können. Doch unsere liberale Handschrift muss erkennbar sein.



Große Differenzen gibt es mit den Grünen beim Thema Klimaschutz. Wie wollen Sie hier einen Kompromiss erreichen?



Wir sind uns mit den Grünen völlig einig, dass wir die Klimaschutzziele 2050 erreichen müssen. Allerdings müssen wir das physikalisch hinbekommen.



Grünen-Politiker Robert Habeck sagte, alle Parteien müssen sich “am Riemen reißen”. Das klingt nicht so, als wäre man sich völlig einig.



Wir sind uns bei den Zielen einig. Beim Weg dorthin hingegen bisher nicht. Wir müssen uns eingestehen, dass unsere jetzige Klimaschutzpolitik nicht funktioniert hat. Sie ist die teuerste der Welt, aber wir haben keine einzige Tonne CO2 eingespart. Das ist doch völlig widersinnig. Wir wollen einen Klimaschutz, der funktioniert. Da sind wir grüner als die Grünen.



Was ist die Alternative?



Wir können unsere ehrgeizigen Ziele nur mit Technologien erreichen, die sich noch nicht durchgesetzt haben. Das müssen wir in unserer Klimapolitik dringend miteinbeziehen.



Geben Sie uns ein Beispiel.



Etwa bei der Mobilität. Wenn wir den Verbrennungsmotor abschaffen, bevor wir das Reichweitenproblem der E-Autos gelöst haben, machen wir realitätsferne Politik an den Menschen vorbei.

Wir haben die heutigen Aussagen des Grünen-Chefs in diese Richtung als Signal der Einigungsbereitschaft aufgenommen, wie Christian Lindner ja auch deutlich gemacht hat. Klare, erreichbare Ziele und Technologieoffenheit zu ihrer Erreichung statt auf Verbote zu setzen, das muss die Devise sein. Und so ist es auch mit der Kohlekraft.



Warum?



Wir haben jetzt schon Probleme mit der Versorgungssicherheit. Bei manchen Unternehmen flackert das Stromnetz und gefährdet damit die Produktion, weil der Strommix aus den Erneuerbaren in Stoßzeiten nicht ausreicht. Wenn wir die Kohle jetzt parallel zur Kernenergie aus dem Stromnetz rausnehmen, müssen wir mit flächendeckenden Blackouts rechnen. Das kann niemand wollen.



Was ist mit Erdgas? Das ist effizienter und nicht ganz so schmutzig wie Kohle.



Fakt ist doch: Bislang haben uns die Grünen nicht vorrechnen können, wie sie einen Kohleausstieg ausgleichen wollen. Da bliebe uns nur übrig, Kohle- und Kernenergie aus Frankreich und Polen zuzukaufen. Ob die Grünen so wirklich das Klima retten, bezweifle ich.



Reden wir über den Umgang zwischen den Jamaika-Parteien. FDP-Chef Lindner hat den Grünen etwa vorgeworfen, ein “Konjunkturprogramm für die AfD” zu betreiben. CSU-General Scheuer nennt die Grünen “schizophren”. Woher kommt die schlechte Laune?



Wir schauen schlicht auf die Realitäten. Beispiel Flüchtlingspolitik, worauf sich das Zitat von Christian Lindner ja bezog. Natürlich ist ein Familiennachzug, wie ihn die Grünen wollen, in gewissen Bereichen sinnvoll - etwa, wenn derjenige seine Familie hier in Deutschland ernähren kann, weil er einen Job und eine Wohnung hat.

Aber das funktioniert nur, wenn wir diejenigen abschieben, die kein Bleiberecht haben. Sonst werden uns die Bürger zurecht auf die Barrikaden gehen. Denn wir können nicht jeden aufnehmen.



Wie wollen Sie die Grünen davon überzeugen?



Es gibt auch bei den Grünen Politiker wie Herrn Palmer, die davon bereits überzeugt sind. Sie wissen, dass es vor Ort Schwierigkeiten gibt, einen unbegrenzten Zuzug von Flüchtlingen zu schultern. Es fehlen Wohnungen, Klassenräume, Lehrkräfte und Kita-Plätze.



Herr Palmer aber spricht nicht für seine Partei. Wie wollen Sie etwa Parteichef Özdemir überzeugen?



Ich setze darauf, dass auch Cem Özdemir irgendwann für logische Argumente zugänglich wird und in seinem Wahlkreis merkt, dass auch dort nicht alle Flüchtlinge aufgenommen werden können.



Schauen wir auf CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer. Es wirkt so, als liefe gegen ihn ein innerparteilicher Putsch. Glauben Sie, dass er noch lange am Verhandlungstisch von Jamaika sitzen wird?



Das muss die CSU entscheiden.



Lohnt es sich, Kompromisse mit jemandem zu machen, der womöglich schon bald nicht mehr für seine Partei spricht?



Am Ende des Tages machen wir Kompromisse mit der CSU, nicht mit Horst Seehofer.

Beobachter sehen die Jamaika-Verhandlungen durch die Personaldiskussion in der CSU grundsätzlich in Gefahr. Teilen Sie diese Sorge?



Unsere Verhandlungen könnten schneller voranschreiten, wenn die CSU so geschlossen wäre wie die FDP. Aber Streit gibt es auch bei den Grünen, die sich untereinander nicht immer einig sind.

Erst als sich Shani dafür entschied, ihre Behinderung aus ihren Bewerbungsschreiben zu streichen, lud man sie zu einem Vorstellungsgespräch ein.
Nur kurze Zeit später bekam sie eine Anstellung in einem Telekommunikationsunternehmen.
Sie kritisiert im Gespräch mit der HuffPost, die Arbeitslosenquote betrage bei Menschen mit Behinderungen 13,9 Prozent.
“In Deutschland ist die Arbeitssuche für Menschen mit Behinderungen oft sehr mühsam”, berichtet die Behindertenbeauftragte der Bundesregierung, Verena Bentele, der HuffPost.","Shani Dhanda ist eine ganz gewöhnliche Frau. Sie ist 30 Jahre alt, hat Eventmanagement studiert und liebt es, zu reisen. In ihrem Studiengang galt sie als eine der Jahrgangsbesten. Eine US-amerikanische Stiftung veröffentlichte sogar ihre Dissertation. Für ihre Arbeit an der Universität verlieh man ihr eine Auszeichnung.

Und trotzdem: Über ein Jahrzehnt lang bewarb sich Shani Dhanda auf mehr als 100 freie Stellenausschreibungen - ohne jemals eine Antwort zu bekommen, berichtet die 30-Jährige in der britischen HuffPost.

Im Video oben: Shanis Geschichte ist kein Einzelfall

Schuld daran war ein Detail in ihrer Bewerbung.

Shani ist 95 Zentimeter groß und hat die sogenannte Glasknochenkrankheit.

""Ich dachte, ich würde niemals einen Job bekommen - und dass, obwohl ich unbedingt einen Beitrag zur Gesellschaft leisten wollte. Die Aussicht, vielleicht niemals arbeiten zu können, machte mich wirklich traurig”, klagt sie.

Bereits in der Schule gab man Shani mehr als fragwürdige Karrieretipps: “Mir wurde gesagt, dass ich versuchen sollte, einen Job in der örtlichen Gemeinde zu ergattern. Dort gäbe es eine jährliche Quote für Menschen mit Behinderungen.”

Behandelt wie Menschen zweiter Klasse

Shani empfand das als extrem beleidigend: “Ich wurde nicht an meinen Fähigkeiten oder Interessen gemessen. Andere sahen mich nur als eine Person mit Behinderung”. Der Fall der Britin zeigt ein Problem auf, das auch in Deutschland noch immer besteht. Auf dem Arbeitsmarkt sind Menschen mit Behinderung noch immer Menschen zweiter Klasse.

Erst als sich Shani dafür entschied, ihre Behinderung aus ihren Bewerbungsschreiben zu streichen, lud man sie zu einem Vorstellungsgespräch ein. Nur kurze Zeit später bekam sie eine Anstellung in einem Telekommunikationsunternehmen.

Doch einen Job zu bekommen, ist nicht die einzige Herausforderung. ""Es gibt viele verschiedene Probleme"", erklärt Shani. ""Es gibt Probleme bei der Jobsuche und es gibt Probleme, den Job tatsächlich zu halten.""

Neben ihren brüchigen Knochen leidet Shani an Skoliose und Arthritis. Bei ihrer längeren Anfahrt in die Arbeit bekam sie schnell Gelenkschmerzen. Sie fragte daher ihren Arbeitgeber, ob sie öfter von daheim arbeiten könne.

Doch ihr Antrag wurde abgelehnt: “Es war ein Schlag ins Gesicht”. Shani fühlte sich von ihrem Arbeitgeber im Stich gelassen. Immerhin arbeitete sie da bereits seit sechs Jahre für das Unternehmen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Die Sparkasse hat meine Behinderung benutzt, um mich rauszuwerfen

“Ich möchte nicht um besondere Behandlung oder spezielle Anpassungen oder etwas anderes bitten, aber es ist etwas, was ich tun muss, um meine Arbeit zu machen.”

Sie beschloss darauf, ihre Kündigung einzureichen.

Sehr qualifiziert – trotzdem keinen Job

Ähnliche Erfahrungen musste auch Lukas Hoppe in Deutschland machen. Der 23-Jährige ist gehörlos und auf einen Schriftdolmetscher angewiesen. Nachdem er sehr erfolgreich sein Abitur abgeschlossen hatte, fand er schnell einen Ausbildungsplatz.

Auch für die Berufsschule sollte ihm ein Dolmetscher zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Doch die Agentur für Arbeit lehnte es ab, diesen zu finanzieren. Der offizielle Grund: Lukas’ Noten seien zu gut. Er könne erneut einen Dolmetscher beantragen, wenn seine Leistungen deutlich nachlassen würden.

Für Lukas und seine Mutter eine absolut inakzeptable Situation. Sie zogen vor ein Sozialgericht und bekamen Recht. Über den Fall berichtete die “Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung”.

Sein Fall zeigt, mit welchen abstrusen Hindernisse Menschen mit Behinderung zu kämpfen haben.

Die Behinderten-Aktivistin Julia Probst setzt sich seit Jahren für Menschen wie Lukas sein. Sie kritisiert im Gespräch mit der HuffPost, die Arbeitslosenquote betrage bei Menschen mit Behinderungen 13,9 Prozent. Sie ist damit deutlich höher als bei Nichtbehinderten.

“Allerdings ist es nicht so, dass Menschen mit Behinderung schlecht ausgebildet sind. Die Mehrheit ist sogar gut ausgebildet. Ihnen wird der Zugang zum Arbeitsmarkt nur deutlich erschwert”, sagt Probst.

Das hänge besonders oft mit Vorurteilen über die Leistungsfähigkeit der Bewerberinnen und Bewerber mit Behinderungen zusammen.

“In Deutschland ist die Arbeitssuche für Menschen mit Behinderungen oft sehr mühsam”, berichtet die Behindertenbeauftragte der Bundesregierung, Verena Bentele, der HuffPost.

Nicht selten verhindern Vorurteile eine Einladung zum Vorstellungsgespräch bei privaten Arbeitgebern - und das trotz der geforderten Qualifikation.

Endstation Behindertenwerkstatt

Probst zufolge hat das vor allem einen Grund: Der Besuch einer Förderschule ende für viele Betroffene meistens in einer Behindertenwerkstatt, anstatt in einer regulären Ausbildung. Von dort fänden immer noch zu wenige behinderte Menschen den Weg in den regulären Arbeitsmarkt.

“Der einzig richtige Weg wäre, das teure und überflüssige Förderschulsystem abzuschaffen und alle Regelschulen inklusiv zu machen”, erklärte Probst.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Seit sie drei Jahre alt ist, sitzt meine Tochter im Rollstuhl - jetzt rettet sie die Welt

So werde ein normales Miteinander von der Kindheit an geschaffen und private Firmen hätten weniger Angst vor der Einstellung eines Menschen mit Behinderung.

Ähnlich sieht das auch Verena Bentele. Gegen Diskriminierung von Menschen mit Behinderungen auf dem Arbeitsmarkt helfe langfristig sicher nur die inklusive Bildung.

“Wenn alle Kinder, ob mit oder ohne Behinderungen, gemeinsam lernen, dann entstehen von Anfang an weniger Vorurteile bei Arbeitgebern und Kolleginnen und Kollegen”, so Bentele.

Die UN bezeichnet die Inklusionsbemühungen der Bundesregierung als mangelhaft

Schon mehrfach wurde Deutschland bei der offiziellen Staatenprüfung des UN-Menschenrechtsratausschusses heftig für die mangelhafte Umsetzung von Inklusionsmaßnahmen gerügt. Dies war zuletzt 2015 der Fall. Deutlich besser schneiden Länder wie Italien und Spanien ab.

Auch für die nächste Prüfung 2019 sieht Julia Probst für Deutschland schwarz: “Es hat sich im Prinzip nichts geändert.”

Es gäbe zwar eine Schwerstbehinderten-Abgabe für Firmen, die die offizielle Quote an behinderten Mitarbeitern nicht erfüllen, allerdings sei diese nicht hoch genug.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 85.000 Deutsche dürfen das grundlegendste Recht in einem demokratischen Staat nicht wahrnehmen

Sind in einem Unternehmen mit mehr als 60 Mitarbeitern weniger als 5 Prozent der Arbeitsplätze mit Menschen mit schwerer Behinderung besetzt, muss das Unternehmen eine Gebühr entrichten. Diese beträgt jedoch nur maximal 320 Euro im Monat. Probst fordert, diese Sanktionen deutlich zu erhöhen.

“Der ehemalige Finanzminister Wolfgang Schäuble machte einen entsprechenden Vorschlag 2015. Der wurde allerdings nie umgesetzt”.

In zwei Jahren droht Deutschland so erneut die Note fünf - und das zu Recht.

Wo am Wochenende der erste Schnee fallen soll, erfahrt ihr im Video oben

Zwei Tiefdruckgebiete sorgen am Mittwoch immer wieder für Regen in Deutschland. Während es vormittags noch im Westen regnerisch ist, ziehen die Schauer später in den Südosten. Sonst erwartet uns echtes Novemberwetter. Tagsüber ist es meist bedeckt oder nebelig.

Ausnahmen dazu sind der Süden und Osten des Landes. Am Alpenrand weht der Föhn, der die Wolken und den Nebel in Oberbayern auflöst. Auch im Osten Deutschlands kann am Nachmittag vereinzelt die Sonne scheinen. Der Höchstwert in Dresden liegt bei 10 Grad.

Donnerstag der beste Tag der Woche

In der Nacht zum Donnerstag bleibt es bedeckt und es regnet immer wieder leicht. Bis zum Ende der Nacht hört der Regen dann aber auf. Es wird wieder nebelig. Die Tiefstwerte liegen zwischen 2 und 6 Grad. Der Wetterdienst warnt, dass mit Straßenglätte in den Morgenstunden gerechnet werden muss. Besondere Vorsicht ist im Osten und im Südosten geboten.

Der Donnerstag wird als bester Tag der verbleibenden Woche erwartet. Obwohl es mit viel Nebel losgeht, kommt noch oft die Sonne zum Vorschein.

Am Wochenende wird der erste Schneefall erwartet



Am Wochenende sollte man bestmöglich wenn möglich für einen Kurzurlaub verreisen. Denn dann wird es nass, kalt und windig. Am Freitag zieht Regen von Norden durch das Land. Dabei wird es windig. Am Samstag kommt neuer Regen aus Westen zu uns, dabei wird es teils sogar stürmisch.

In den Tieflagen ist am Sonntag sogar mit dem ersten Schnee zu rechnen. Davon sind vor allem Thüringen, Sachsen und Bayern betroffen.

The second series of The A Word starts this evening and I'm eager to see what's changed in the world of autistic Joe and his family. Plenty has changed in our lives in the last 18 months since the first series aired, so I'm guessing it'll be the same for them.

As a family with two autistic boys, I can't get enough of autism inspired TV. There's always plenty of opinion about these programmes - it doesn't show enough about autism, it's the nice side of autism or even it's too difficult to watch.

As a parent, my heart ached when character Joe couldn't cope with the birthday parties, I relived the nerves I had when our boys first visited the paediatrician as Joe went for his tests, and I put on my armour as Joe's parents talked to the school. It's not that we don't get on with our kids' school, it's the opposite in fact, but it's emotional armour I'm putting on.

I know some parents with autistic kids couldn't watch the BBC1 dramatisation. It felt too close to home for them. But surely, I wonder, isn't that a good thing?

I spend so much of my life trying to help others accept my children. Most of this is through sharing our experiences, portraying my children as I see them and letting people know my kids aren't to be feared. They aren't trying to be annoying kids. At least in the first series little Joe used headphones - our David has the iPad blasting out tunes at full volume disturbing the entire world.

Joe is, like many of the autistic characters on TV, a half way house between our two boys. Our son Anthony has less difficulty with communicating than Joe does, but our pre-verbal son David definitely has more. Anthony will script like Joe, David uses sound to block out the world like Joe, but they are still all different.

And they develop differently too. In the last year, we've learned that there are few things as important to David as routine and we've had some worries about Anthony's growing independence. Will these feature in the new series?

The week before series one aired we told Anthony, our eldest son, about his autism. Many parents worry about when and how to tell their kids about their diagnoses. I've read that Joe becomes aware of his autism in this series and this will be yet another heart pulling moment for many. We told Anthony because he had noticed, not only that he was different to others, but he hated himself for it. There was not doubt it was time for him to know. And he took that information and owned it - to my sheer delight. How will Joe cope I wonder?

The family on The A Word will undoubtedly have similar and different experiences to our own. Joe, their autistic child, may share traits with our boys. We may laugh at some recognisable situations and cry at others. But ultimately, I hope, the show will do what I try and do. It will share what it can be like for a family with autistic kids with a huge audience. An audience that will go through the lives of this family over the next six weeks and hopefully coming out the other side a bit more knowledgeable, a bit more aware and a bit more accepting.

Not only does the film, 'Jeremy the Dud', flip prejudices on their heads but also features only one main cast member without a real-life disability. Nick Boshier, better known as one half of the Bondi Hipsters, plays Jeremy a man born ""without specialty"" which is more casually referred to as ""a dud"".

Forced to wear a large label displaying his lacking specialty, on his birthday Jeremy is old enough to move out of assisted living and in with his Aunt and her two kids. While Jeremy just wants to get a job and maybe find a place of his own, he even tells his Aunt he doesn't want to be a burden, but everyone around him still seems to see him as just that.

'Jeremy the Dud' was created by Robot Army Productions in partnership with genU, a not-for-profit organisation that helps people with disability to set new limits on their lives, to see aging and disability as challenges, rather than disadvantages.

Out of the film's cast, 22 with disability are all genU participants, with only two actors appearing without a disability, Boshier and Jackson O'Doherty who plays another dud. According to the film's release, the production would have to start and stop to make sure only disabled people were in frame.

While 'Jeremy the Dud' takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to subverting the typical stigma and judgement that people with disability may face on a daily basis, at its core has a beautifully heartfelt message.

Internet search giant Google apologised yesterday for any confusion or misunderstanding that arose over the listing of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s photos appearing in image search results for query on “Top 10 criminals in India”.

But Modi is not the only misfit on that page. The search page also includes eminent public figures like Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, the founder of Art of Living, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Lawyer and Politician Ram Jethmalani, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and Bollywood actress Sonakshi Sinha.

So what exactly is going on? This isn’t the first time that Google’s algorithm has thrown up some completely whacked out results. A popular technique, known as ‘Google bombing’ was used by pranksters and SEO experts to make George W. Bush the first result for the term ‘miserable failure’.

Nothing personal about it: Modi’s photo appears thrice in Google Image search, right next to extremists like Hafeez Saeed and Osama Bin Laden

If you take a closer look at the source for these results where Narendra Modi’s photo comes from, two of these are from Topyaps.com, which is creating a perfect viral storm with this post. Another one of these photos comes from a 2014 newswire where Modi promised that the Supreme Court will set up special courts to deal with politicians with criminal backgrounds. Scroll further down, and you now see reaction stories to this new development being indexed too.

As more and more stories connect Narendra Modi to the keywords “top 10 criminals” in news stories and on Twitter, this search result is likely to become indelible unless Google takes deliberate steps to remove Narendra Modi from the result. This is what they did with George W. Bush, who is no longer the top search result for ""miserable failure"".

Just a few weeks ago, users found out that typing “Nigga House” in Google Maps would direct the user to the White House. In that particular case, it turns out hackers had created a fictitious business which was verified by Google. The next step is to have this business reclaimed from another Google account, which then allows you to change the name and location of the business.

As long as Google remains the world's most popular search engine, SEO experts and hackers will continue their attempts to influence search results, for amusement and profit.

""Si te gusta ver a la gente famosa, probablemente no hay nada mejor para ello que una boda real.
El mes pasado una fuente cercana a Harry dijo al US Weekly que se espera que sea una boda de mucho más bajo perfil.
""Puedo adivinar que se casará en la Capilla de San Jorge en el castillo de Windsor.
De nuestra parte, lo que decimos es que ¡ojalá que nuestra invitación no se pierda en el correo!","Si eres fan de los royals, de seguro tienes fantasías de cómo sería asistir a una boda real. Y ahora que el príncipe Harry y Meghan Markle están a punto de unirse en matrimonio, seguramente tus fantasías están a todo lo que dan.

Pero si bien uno sólo puede imaginarse lo que es ser invitado a una boda así, el periodista Duncan Larcombe conoce de primera mano qué tan glamoroso es un acto así.

Así, mientras no despegábamos la mirada de la tele el día en que Kate Middleton y el príncipe William se dieron el sí en abril de 2011, Larcombe de hecho figuró entre las 1,900 personas que asistieron a la ceremonia nupcial en la Abadía de Westminster.

El ex editor de realeza para The Sun, fue uno de los seis periodistas que asistió como invitado. ""Nos dijeron unas dos o tres semanas por anticipado que seríamos invitados, pero que no lo podíamos decir a nadie"", dijo a Elle UK en una reciente entrevista. ""No quería que se esparciera esto entre otros periodistas"".

Así que, ¿qué se sintió al estar entre tantos royals en esa ceremonia? De acuerdo con Larcombe, fue tan surreal como cualquiera lo imagina.

""Fue una experiencia muy extraña, algo así como sentarse en el museo de cera de Madame Tussauds, pero con estatuas parlantes"", dijo. ""Fue una de las experiencias más increíbles de toda mi vida. Es darse cuenta de que la historia se escribe frente a tus propios ojos.

""No se parece a ninguna de las otras bodas a las que he ido"", añadió. ""Si te gusta ver a la gente famosa, probablemente no hay nada mejor para ello que una boda real. No hay lugar que contenta a tantos famosos y miembros de la realeza bajo un solo techo"".

Larcombe también pudo ser testigo de momentos francos por parte de los royals, incluyendo cómo el príncipe Harry trataba de componerse a sí mismo al lado de su hermano Harry antes de la ceremonia. ""Se veía completamente aterrado"", dijo el periodista, y luego, el silencio total que llenó la iglesia cuando la Duquesa de Cambridge finalmente entró.

""Todo lo que podíamos escuchar eran los ecos de la muchedumbre de afuera"", dijo.

Si bien Larscombe señala que hubo una espera interminable antes de que iniciara la ceremonia nupcial, el evento bien que valió la pena. No sólo vio cómo se escribía la historia ante sus ojos, sino que se demostró que cada invitado recibía un trato de iguales, sin importar qué tan famoso (o no tan famoso) es.

""Fue muy claro en la boda que no importaba si eras el sultán de Brunei o un tipo que se ha cruzado en (la Real Academia de) Sandhurst con William, o una estrella de Hollywood... todos tuvimos que llegar temprano"", explicó, añadiendo que la Reina fue la última en llegar antes de la novia. ""Supongo que para alguien como Sir Elton John, a quien le encanta ser el centro de la atención, eso fue algo muy humillante"".

Aunque hay mucha emoción por el eventual compromiso y boda de Harry, su ceremonia nupcial será muy diferente a la de su hermano dado que William es el segundo en la línea para heredar el trono y Harry es el quinto (y será el sexto cuando el tercer bebé de William y Catherine nazca). Esto significa que la boda con Markle será un tanto más informal.

El mes pasado una fuente cercana a Harry dijo al US Weekly que se espera que sea una boda de mucho más bajo perfil.

""La pompa y el esplendor es lo menos que Harry quiere"", dijo la fuente a ese sitio. ""Puedo adivinar que se casará en la Capilla de San Jorge en el castillo de Windsor. Con ello, no sería un circo para los medios y le daría al evento el sentido de privacidad que Harry tanto quiere"".

Andy Murray and Kim Sears have welcomed their second baby .

The couple, who married in April 2015, are already parents to toddler Sophia.

Murray’s grandmother gushed that the new baby was: “another little girl, a little sister for Sophia,

“Hopefully that will be great for her too, she said. “She’ll have a little playmate!”

Murray responded, telling The Mirror: “I would rather be getting up in the middle of the night and helping Sophia than winning every tennis match and her thinking when she grows up: ‘Actually, you know what, he was a s****y dad but he won a lot of tennis matches, so well done’.

Her husband worked in politics, and she considered herself to be a highly “involved volunteer,” but beyond that maintained some space from the political sphere.

And then the 2016 presidential election happened.

Moser, 40, was overwhelmed by the election of President Donald J. Trump, and the ensuing pain she saw in her own community on Facebook. The outpouring of grief and mass desire to do something that she saw on social media led Moser to found Daily Action in December 2016, a service that texts daily action items ― like calling your representatives to talk about gun control or forwarding a reminder to voters in Virginia to get to to the polls ― to users’ phones. By early May 2017, she had officially announced she would be running for Congress.

Moser’s story isn’t unique. Across the nation, women from all over the political spectrum decided to run for elected office in the wake of the 2016 presidential race. Within a month of the election, non-partisan organization She Should Run had heard from 4,500 women interested in running for elected office. By February, that number rose to 13,000. Emily’s List, a PAC focusing on electing pro-choice Democratic women to office, saw a similar spike in interest.

Some of the women who decided to run for office found inspiration in Hillary Clinton’s candidacy. Others were simply sick and tired of seeing a legislative body they felt did not represent their identities or interests. Regardless of motivation, the numbers tell a clear story: Women are stepping up and saying they deserve a seat ― or three or four or five seats ― at the table.

Below, presented a year since election day, are eight of those women and their stories:

Describe the moment you decided to run for office.

People [would say], “Oh you’re such a good activist, you’re such a good organizer, you should run for something.” And I was like, “That’s crazy. Why would I ever do that?” But then I was in Houston for a Planned Parenthood luncheon and it was the biggest Planned Parenthood luncheon in the history of Planned Parenthood… That was the first time I really thought, maybe I should run. The room was filled with hundreds of pissed off women ― many of whom are traditionally Republicans, and were just tired of having these sleazy dudes take away our rights. And I just felt this swelling sense of collective indignation and belonging with this group, but I also was like, god, I know all these women. I haven’t lived here [in Texas] for a while, but these are still my people, these were the people I grew up with. These are the people I learned to be politically engaged with. And it took me another two and a half months to go from there to actually deciding to pack up my life and move across the country. But that was definitely the Oprah “aha” moment.

You’re part of a wave of women stepping up to run for office. Why do you think it’s important that more women run?

Every single person I know, me included, has been assaulted and harassed by a man in power many times in our lives. That is the world that we live in. And [I’m] OK. [I’ve] overcome these hurdles. But the Access Hollywood tape was an absolutely radicalizing moment for me. I was like, this guy’s running for President? And he’s the worst man we’ve all met before? And then he won. I thought the election was over then. But then he actually won, being that person. And so I think the value of women and people of color being at the table and in the conversation is that we’re...bringing new voices to the table.

If we had women in all positions in power, the world would become more adaptable to women and mothers, and families. Because I just think a lot of men are used to the women doing it for them. And guess what? We’ve done a really good job… [White men have] had their chance. They’ve done some good things over the years, but I’m done.

Can you describe the moment you decided to run for office?

I was standing at the Javits Center on election night, 30 feet [from] where we were hoping Hillary Clinton would accept the presidency. I was there with all of the people that worked the election for Hillary, as things started going wrong. It was one of the worst nights of my entire life. I was thrown into a loop for a week or two and realized that I wasn’t willing to sit it out for the next four years. It was time to stand up and bring my own values to politics.

What have you learned since you decided to run?

I’m going to be really honest with you. What I’ve learned here in Massachusetts is that the institutions of power are very ready to put a camera in your face when you’re a woman in danger like I was during GamerGate. But when you’re talking about taking power for yourself, when you’re talking about upsetting the status quo, when you’re talking specifically about replacing a man, even a Democratic man [incumbent Stephen Lynch], what I’ve learned is that the system starts shutting its doors very, very quickly.

A lot of this first year has honestly been realizing that the Democratic Party is not necessarily the friend of women that want to run and push the party toward a stronger position on women’s rights.

What sparked your interest in running for office?

Like so many people, I woke up on Nov. 9 in disbelief. I went to sleep early the night before, trusting that the American people would never elect someone so intolerant or incompetent. I woke up, heard the news, and knew I had to run. I knew that there must be a response to Trump and the regressive, elitist Republican agenda.

What’s one of the most important things you’ve learned while running?

Put your head down and get it done. From the moment I started running, people told me, “No, you can’t do this.” They told me that I could not be a mother, an attorney, a wife and a candidate. But I’ve been told “No” my whole life. When I was in high school, I watched as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg announced the Supreme Court’s decision that Virginia Military Institute ― one of the top all-male military colleges in the country ― had to accept women. My male classmates jeered, and I decided I had to go. I enrolled as one of the first women of color to attend VMI. When people told me I couldn’t win this election, I put my head down, ignored the naysayers, and got to work. We knocked on more doors, called more voters, and put in the time to win. There will be people who tell you that you shouldn’t run or that you will never win. Tell them, “Watch me!”

Can you describe the moment you decided to run for office?

I made the official decision to run for office when Ed Royce voted to repeal and replace the ACA. I just couldn’t stand by while our representative voted to take away health care coverage from my patients and their families.

We really need to see a change in our community, and we need someone who understands what our community is going through. As a refugee who came to this country as a child, I know the inhumanity of the Trump administration’s policies that will restrict new immigrants, and we need a leader who will fight tooth and nail against those policies. As a woman that has defeated breast cancer twice, I know how important it is to be an outspoken advocate for women’s health issues, so that all women have access to reproductive health care and breast cancer screenings.

Can you describe how you felt on election night last year?

I felt like I had been punched in the stomach. The next morning, I didn’t want to get up. But I did, like all women do. One of the first patients I saw was a child with a brain tumor. His mom is a nail shop worker and she was finally able to get health care coverage because of the ACA. That meant that she would have coverage for her son as their family dealt with such a terrible tragedy. As we sat in the exam room that next morning, we hugged each other and we cried. We were all so scared. But after the crying, we knew that we needed to fight.

Why did you decide to run for office?

In many ways where I found myself in 2016 was very similar to where I found myself in 2008, which was coming out of a big election, asking myself what I can do for people, particularly my home community... In 2016, I asked myself that same question coming out of the election, what is going on in Michigan? What is this representation bringing to my hometown? I was working in a Department of Defense-funded advanced manufacturing research lab spending a bunch of time with technology, advanced technology, and looking at technology adoption for the small and midsize manufacturing community... Everyone wants to talk about 21st century job training and skills. Well, I’ve created workforce development programs. I’ve worked at the intersection of industry and government and academia and nonprofit for outcomes. I really saw the confluence of all of those things. Plus the willingness and eagerness to serve and respond to something like I did eight years prior, which is stepping up and putting up my hand to make a difference for people.

I felt the urgency of the time and this groundswell that was taking place in Michigan. So many people, my mom being one of them, who just said, “Hey, I was on the floor coming out of this election, but you looking and stepping up in this way, that was giving me hope.” I was plugging into Democratic Club organizations that were seeing two to three times more participation. I was going into union halls and I was tapping into that groundswell. Not as a candidate, but as somebody who was looking to step up as a voice. My candidacy in many respects began as part of that groundswell and really ballooned into something tremendous.

If you’re elected, what change do you hope to see as a result?

This is about a new generation of leaders and leadership. We’re all too familiar with the linkage between congress and the word “dysfunction.” They seem to go hand in hand. That’s just something we got to stop right now. We need a return to common sense and we need a return to real leadership. In part that is about the collaborative nature and role of this office, as well as the willingness to use the office to make a difference for people. Make a difference for people in terms of solving large challenges that communities have been saddled with. That could be as it pertains to health outcomes, as it pertains to education, and certainly as it pertains to our economy. I really believe in the moral authority of the office to do good.

Why did you decide to run for office?

Before Trump, I would have been the kind of person who thought about these problems and didn’t think I was the person to run. When I was assistant district attorney, my job was prosecuting bullies and abusers in people’s families. I saw that trait early on with Trump and I was horrified. So many moms and women recognize him as a bully. That an infectious, horrible influence on our kids is being amplified in such a position made me think that the voice of a normal mom needs to be amplified, too. We should be as vocal as we seek to be, as he did. There’s no point to sit back and watch this unfold anymore, we have to all do it ourselves. If we leave it to the system it’s going to shake out in a way that’s not good for our kids.

You lost your election earlier this fall. Would you run again?

The Democratic party in each county has to choose a person to run. I have to decide if I’m going to run again in the primary next year. I’ll certainly be exploring other ways to get involved. My big question is: How do you take all this enthusiasm ― within a city like New York, it’s like a fiefdom ― and make real change? To me, it’s about informing people about the real paths to influence local leaders.

Jess Phoenix, 35, Running for Congress in California, District 25

What sparked your interest in running for office?

I am running for Congress because I think some of the biggest threats that we have coming down the pipeline are completely being ignored by our current representation in government. For example, climate change is going to impact our national security, our jobs, our health, and even our food security. I believe we need a scientific approach to solving problems like this because they’re big picture problems that affect everyone. We need leaders who know how to look at a ton of evidence and data to draw conclusions and outline a plan of action. That is something that my work as a scientist has prepared me pretty uniquely to do.

The moment that I decided to run, I had just given a lecture at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles. A friend with two young boys approached me, and expressed that he was very concerned about the future world his kids would inherit. I realized that science is missing from government, and if not me, who would be the scientist to run and change our future?

Can you describe how you felt on election night last year?

Election night 2016 was surreal for me. I was working the polls here in L.A. County, and my fellow poll workers and I started out the day in fantastic spirits. As early evening began, we started to see news updates come through on our phones. Throughout the day, turnout had seemed low to us, but we figured that people would come after work. Every report of Trump’s electoral victories felt like a lie. Our jokes disappeared, and we all started focusing inward, looking at our phones and grimacing. From 7pm until the polls closed at 8pm, we didn’t have a single voter come in. That was the biggest clue that something was seriously, seriously wrong with our democracy. My husband Carlos had been canvassing for Hillary in Arizona, and instead of staying there for a victory party he decided to drive back home in the middle of the night. I waited up for him, and we talked until the early hours of the next morning about how impossible and unreal the results seemed.

What sparked your interest in running for office?

The idea to run began as just a fleeting thought, but the more I saw how desperately people around the country were fighting for unity, the more that idea grew. I definitively knew I wanted to run when I casually mentioned to my mother, a physician who was one of the only women in her medical school in India over 50 years ago, “I think I would make a great candidate. I could run.” And my mother answered, “You would be incredible. And you absolutely should run.” Knowing how much I value my mother’s earned wisdom, and considering what the example of my running might do for my own daughter’s ability to dream big, I decided to go for it.

What's the most surprising thing you've found in running?

I am pleasantly surprised that so many people are willing to give me their time as I start my campaign. They want to be a part of something tangible, something that is concretely, measurably, creating change. I am surprised that as much as I am thanking people for their support, they are thanking me back... For the opportunity to work towards something together.

Under fire for suggesting that the use of feminine brand names would boost liquor sales, Maharashtra minister Girish Mahajan on Monday apologised for his remarks and said he did not intend to hurt the sentiments of women.

The remarks, at an event organised by a sugar mill in North Maharashtra's Nandurbar district on Saturday, were made in a lighter vein, he said.

""I regret my remarks. I express my apologies. It wasn't my intention to hurt women's sentiments,"" Mahajan, who handles the water resources portfolio, told reporters at a hurriedly convened press conference here.

""This (my remarks) is a mistake which happened unintentionally. It was not my intention to hurt anyone,"" he said.

What he said wasn't aimed at causing pain to women, the minister said.

""It was said in the flow of things, in a lighter vein,"" he added.

""If you want alcohol or any products' demand to rise, name it after a woman and see how demand soars,"" he had said on Saturday while attending an event of a sugar factory which also produces liquor under the brand name 'Maharaja'.

A video of his speech was uploaded on YouTube.

A police complaint has been filed in Chandrapur district against Mahajan for the alleged derogatory statement.

NCP state spokesperson Nawab Malik criticised Mahajan for his remarks.

""I think the minister is a habitual drinker and we appeal to all the women in Maharashtra to come out and fight against such a mindset,"" Malik said.

In an editorial in the party mouthpiece Saamana today, the Shiv Sena also took potshots at Mahajan.

""In a lot of places in Maharashtra, women are protesting against the sale of liquor.

Mit dem Fotoprojekt ""Shades of Persistence"" wollen Ilayda Kaplan und Nilgün Akinci für mehr Toleranz sorgen

Die Fotos zeigen, wie unterschiedlich und schön Frauen mit Verschleierung sein können

Das Kopftuch. In vielen Köpfen ein Symbol für die Unterdrückung der muslimischen Frau im Islam, für unfreiwillige Entscheidungen und erst recht kein Zeichen für Feminismus.

Das ist jedenfalls das Bild, das meistens in den Medien gezeigt wird. Besonders bei Menschen, die sich sonst nicht mit dem Thema beschäftigen, entstehen so negative Vorurteile.

Um das zu ändern, haben sich die Fotografin Ilayda Kaplan und die Filmemacherin Nilgün Akinci zusammengesetzt und ein Projekt ins Leben gerufen:

""Shades of Persistence“ - eine Fotoreihe mit 14 verhüllten Frauen, die sich mit ihren Kopftüchern mutig vor die Kamera stellten. Die Portraits zeigen bewusst: Die Frauen könnten unterschiedlicher nicht sein. Sie sind unterschiedlich alt, haben eine andere Hautfarbe oder einen anderen Kleidungsstil.

Kaplan und Akinci wollten die Unterschiedlichkeit von Frauen im Kopftuch zum Ausdruck bringen. Es gibt nicht ""die"" verschleierte Frau. Doch etwas verbindet alle diese Frauen: Sie bezeichnen sich als Feministinnen, als Hijabi und sie stehen zu ihrer Religion.

Bilder für mehr Toleranz gegenüber der muslimischen Community

Mit ihrem Projekt reagieren Akinci und Kaplan nicht nur auf Vorurteile, die die Nicht-Muslime gegenüber verhüllten Frauen hegen. Es soll auch die Konflikte innerhalb der einzelnen muslimischen Communities aufzeigen. Denn auch dort gibt es verschiedene Auffassungen darüber, wie eine angemessene Verhüllung aussehen soll.

In einer Zeit, in der Rassismus alltäglich scheint, fühlt Kaplan eine Verantwortung. Sie will alles in ihrer Macht stehende tun, um Vorurteilen und Stereotypen entgegenzuwirken. Dabei trägt sie selbst kein Kopftuch.

Warum sie trotzdem das Bedürfnis verspürt, jene Stereotypen zu ändern, berichtet sie der HuffPost: ""Ich bin eine Person mit - ich sage es ganz schroff - mehr gesellschaftlichen Privilegien als Frauen, die sich verhüllen. Deswegen will ich genau solchen Minderheiten eine Plattform bieten, sich zu zeigen, sich mitzuteilen.""

Gerade weil sie eine Außenstehende ist, fällt ihr auf, dass es unter den Communities auch viel Ausgrenzung gibt.

""Ich selbst bin nicht Teil dieser Gemeinschaft, habe aber Freundinnen, die mir viel berichten. Da wird unter den Frauen teilweise mit dem Finger aufeinander gezeigt. Man verhülle sich falsch, man träge zu knallige Farben, und so weiter. Gerade diese Frauen müssen doch zusammenhalten.""

Eleganz, Selbstbestimmung, Feminismus

Kaplan und Akinci bringen in ihren Bildern das zum Vorschein, was viele Kopftuch-Gegner nicht erwarten würden: Dass verhüllte Frauen elegant, selbstbestimmt, feministisch und anmutig sein können - und individuell.

Was sich jedoch durch alle Portraits zieht, ist eine gewisse Bescheidenheit. Keiner der Frauen zeigt sich lasziv oder obszön. Für Kaplan und Akinci steht im Vordergrund, dass das Projekt ernst genommen wird.

Das Kopftuch. Ein Symbol für die Unterdrückung der muslimischen Frau? Für Kaplan ein absolut unberechtigtes Vorurteil.

Jeder, der bereit ist, sich zu informieren, würde das schnell herausfinden. Diejenigen, die das nicht täten, seien getrieben von Bequemlichkeit und medialen Einflüssen. Und in vielen Fällen von Schwäche: ""Es ist natürlich leichter, mit dem Strom zu schwimmen und dem Bild der Masse zuzustimmen. Aber das ist nicht gesund für unser aller Zusammenleben.""

Im Koran steht: Verhülle deine Reize.

Wie Frauen das für sich deuten, läge ganz bei ihnen. Kaplan selbst kennt keine Frau mit Kopftuch in ihrem Umfeld, die sich aus Zwang verhüllen muss. Genauso wenig wie jede Einzelne auf ihren Bildern.

Certes la situation n'est pas facile à comprendre pour qui n'a jamais été réellement immergé dans la société catalane, ou qui n'est pas un spécialiste de l'âme espagnole, mais il est clair que certains points de vue relèvent davantage d'une bienveillance idéologique que d'une analyse raisonnée.

Inutile de revenir longuement sur les origines de cette crise du nationalisme catalan qui se renforce chaque fois que l'Espagne traverse une période d'instabilité. Aujourd'hui, ce qui a favorisé le retour d'un indépendantisme latent, ce sont autant les conséquences des difficultés économiques que connaît le pays, que le rejet d'un gouvernement de droite fragilisé par la corruption éhontée de certains de ses principaux membres.

La ""réussite"" de Carles Puigdemont et de ses alliés, c'est d'avoir su tirer profit de cette situation et du mal-être qu'elle a généré au sein d'une partie de la société catalane.

Sortir par le haut de cette crise sera particulièrement difficile. Les faveurs dont peut parfois bénéficier le gouvernement catalan à l'extérieur des frontières de l'Espagne ne facilitent pas la compréhension de ce qui est en jeu dans ce pays et en Europe.

Ce qui a favorisé le retour d'un indépendantisme latent, ce sont autant les difficultés économiques que connaît le pays que le rejet d'un gouvernement de droite fragilisé par la corruption.

On ne peut qu'être profondément surpris par la complaisance d'une partie non négligeable de l'intelligentsia française qui se nourrit de paroles indulgentes vis-à-vis d'un nationalisme qui a délibérément choisi d'être hors-la-loi. On voudrait nous faire admettre que c'est le manque de souplesse, ou pire, l'intransigeance du gouvernement espagnol qui, n'ayant pas su trouver la voie du dialogue, a fait fructifier le sentiment nationaliste. Pour conforter leur thèse, ces intellectuels bourgeois qui font leur crise pseudo démocratique justifient leurs spéculations en comparant la situation catalane à celle des Québécois, des Ecossais ou des Néo-Calédoniens. Or, cette dialectique que l'on voudrait nous faire partager n'est autre chose que l'art de raisonner juste sur une figure fausse. Le Canada est un état fédéral qui garantit les mêmes droits à tous les citoyens canadiens, l'Ecosse est un royaume indépendant depuis 1328 qui a conclu au tout début du XVIIIème siècle un Acte d'union avec l'Angleterre, quant à la Nouvelle-Calédonie c'est une collectivité française dotée d'un statut particulier et d'un accord avec l'Etat pouvant conduire prochainement à sa pleine souveraineté.

L'Espagne elle, se définit constitutionnellement comme une Nation indissoluble, patrie commune et indivisible de tous les Espagnols.

Nous serions sans nul doute moins tolérants si l'un de nos conseils régionaux (je n'en citerai aucun pour ne vexer personne), après un vote interne à cette collectivité territoriale excluant les autres régions de France, déclarait unilatéralement son indépendance.

Nous réagirions probablement autrement si de faux humanistes voulaient nous faire admettre que nous sommes devant la légitime manifestation du ""droit des peuples à disposer d'eux-mêmes"" pour se libérer du joug d'un Etat français supposé autoritaire.

Certes la France n'est pas l'Espagne, et comparaison n'est pas raison, mais il faut se rendre à l'évidence: cette mystification n'a d'autre but que celui de tenter de donner une apparence démocratique à la volonté sécessionniste d'une probable minorité de Catalans. Faisant fi de la plus élémentaire solidarité vis-à-vis des Espagnols les plus démunis, ces indépendantistes considèrent que leur droit à la différence les autorise à mettre en pratique une différence des droits ou à se séparer de la communauté nationale.

Comme tous les nationalistes, Carles Puigdemont et ses alliés du moment pensent que le sens ethnique passe avant le sens civique en oubliant qu'ils ont eux-mêmes voté massivement en faveur d'une Constitution qu'ils bafouent sans vergogne depuis des mois. En tuant le vivre ensemble auquel une majorité d'Espagnols est profondément attaché, ils ont déjà fracturé des familles et risquent de détruire l'Espagne tout en fragilisant l'Union Européenne. En se réfugiant en Belgique avec un quarteron de ses ministres, Carles Puigdemont a sans aucun doute une stratégie, mais il donne la très nette impression de fuir ses responsabilités après avoir créé une crise politique sans précédent.

En se réfugiant en Belgique, Carles Puigdemont donne la très nette impression de fuir ses responsabilités après avoir créé une crise politique sans précédent.

Après les erreurs commises par le gouvernement espagnol actuel, on ne peut que se féliciter du choix qu'il vient de faire en programmant de nouvelles élections au mois de décembre prochain. Mais sur ce point aussi, contrairement à ce que l'on entend parfois, il ne s'agit en aucun cas d'un référendum ni de législatives, mais de simples élections ""régionales"", le gouvernement central attendant de ces élections une recomposition du Parlement catalan où les indépendantistes ne seraient plus majoritaires.

Si Mariano Rajoy gagnait son pari, le retour à la légalité constitutionnelle devrait pour un temps apaiser les esprits, mais on peut craindre qu'il ne règle pas au fond le problème catalan.

A l'inverse, la victoire d'une coalition des indépendantistes nous ramènerait à la situation antérieure, avec probablement le sentiment accru qu'ils ont cette fois-ci obtenu dans les urnes une vraie légitimité. Or, il n'en est rien, le Parlement catalan n'a pas d'autre pouvoir que celui que lui accorde la Constitution espagnole et les lois qui en découlent.

Pour sortir de l'impasse, il faut arriver à un accord de tous les partis politiques afin de dégager une majorité suffisante pour modifier la Constitution.

Celle-ci établit qu'il existe un seul Etat-Nation qui octroie ou délègue certaines compétences à des régions dites autonomes. En l'état actuel des forces politiques en présence, sortir de ce postulat est une mission impossible.

Mais ne pourrait-on pas imaginer que l'Espagne puisse être composée de plusieurs Etats indépendants qui acceptent librement de se regrouper autour d'un seul Etat Fédéral, auquel ils reconnaissent constitutionnellement des droits et des compétences?

Pour arriver à cet accord, le Gouvernement espagnol devrait se dessaisir le temps d'une négociation de ses prérogatives et autoriser la réunion des représentants des 17 Régions Autonomes, afin qu'ils décident eux-mêmes de ce qu'ils mettent solidairement en commun pour constituer un éventuel Etat Fédéral.

On pourrait alors espérer que cette inversion de la hiérarchie des normes puisse aboutir durablement à l'émergence d'une nouvelle Espagne démocratique et sociale.

This is according to the head of financial education at Old Mutual, John Manyike.

""Save whatever you can,"" he implored South Africans, explaining that tough economic conditions in the country will likely put even more strain to already financially stressed and over-indebted South Africans.

Most South Africans are struggling to save due to income challenges, acknowledged Prem Govender, the South African Savings Institute's CEO, however, for others, the challenge is ""the lack of willpower and commitment,"" she said.

It is the latter group, particularly, that Manyike is encouraging to take saving seriously, ""starting where you can, start with R100.""

READ: Don't Spend Your 13th Cheque Before It Even Arrives

This World Savings Day, here are five types of savings accounts that can help you get started on your saving path:

1. Flexible saving accounts

For example, Standard Bank's PureSave, Nedbank's JustSave, FNB's Simply Save and Absa's Money Builder are examples of savings accounts where you can deposit or withdraw money at any time.

The more you save, the higher the interest rates.

2. Notice day accounts

In this type of account, you cannot get access to your funds until you serve whatever is your notice period as agreed with the financial institution. This may save ""impulsive withdrawers."" The notice periods range from 21, 32 and 61 days.

Normally the longer the notice period, the higher the interest rate.

3. Fixed deposits

You need a minimum investment as per the financial institution and you choose your investment period which could be anything from 33 days to five years. The interest rate is fixed for the period of your investment.

There are also flexible fixed deposits accounts, where withdrawals are limited to two of not more than 15 percent of savings.

5. Tax-free accounts

This type of saving could work for long-term investment.

These accounts were introduced in 2015 as an incentive for South Africans to save. Through tax-free accounts, one can invest up to R30,000 a year and it is capped at R500,000 per one's lifetime.

5. Stokvels

Millions of particularly black South Africans have historically been saving through stokvels to pool their money and get credit when needed. Saving through a group can help you be accountable to a larger collective and there is collective discipline, from which one can benefit.

Stokvels work through the contribution rules set by that group and they may pay you up on your birthday, at the end of the year or at a time you have determined.

Manyike believes anyone can save, only it needs a will and discipline.

He also cautioned consumers to live within their means in the tough economic climate South Africa is in. ""It's important that consumers focus on things we have control over, such as how we control our money on our expenses,"" said Manyike -- and this is how these saving vehicles can help.","'Save whatever you can, start with R100' -- Says Financial Expert This World Savings Day",http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/10/31/save-whatever-you-can-start-with-r100-says-financial-expert-this-world-savings-day_a_23261623/

“Stranger Things” co-creator Matt Duffer first told Vulture that he had a problem with the 1990 “It” miniseries as a kid, and Bob’s story was inspired by that.

Some of the characters have read Stephen King.
But Bob definitely does not read Stephen King.","This connection stems largely from the introduction of Bob Newby (Sean Astin). While driving with Will (Noah Schnapp) in the car, Bob mentions that as a kid he had nightmares about “Mr. Baldo,” a clown who had offered him a balloon. (Just like Pennywise in “It” does). At another point, Bob also suggests to Joyce (Winona Ryder) that they buy his parents’ house in Maine. (“It” takes place in Derry, Maine.)

Furthermore, in the Season 2 finale, Finn Wolfhard, who plays Mike Wheeler on “Stranger Things,” repeats the same line his character in “It” says.

The Duffer brothers, who actually once pitched an “It” remake themselves, recently told Vulture that the connections are completely intentional. But there seems to be one big hole in the theory.

“Stranger Things” co-creator Matt Duffer first told Vulture that he had a problem with the 1990 “It” miniseries as a kid, and Bob’s story was inspired by that.

“I think [Bob’s clown story] was really me describing something that just freaked me out. I didn’t have that experience myself. I just had nightmares like that,” he said.

Duffer continued:

“I’m sure we were just like, ‘It would be cute if [Bob] suggests moving to Maine, right next to Stephen King.’ Stephen King exists in this world. Some of the characters have read Stephen King. But Bob definitely does not read Stephen King. He’s not interested at all in Stephen King because he hates that kind of story.”

Since King exists in the world of “Stranger Things,” it seems unlikely that his fictional characters would as well (though, as one of our readers points out, there is a Stephen King in the “Dark Tower” series).

The Resistance itself is standing on the shoulders of so many different groups that had built strength over the previous years. One of them is the LGBTQ rights movement. Had queer people not marched forward in recent years and demanded our rights, changing not just the political reality but the cultural landscape as well, we’d not have been able to withstand this current assault.

“we told you so” card. But truly, there were so many of us warning the community, the media, and the world that Donald Trump would work toward eviscerating LGBTQ rights.

No, they told us ― from The New York Times and across the establishment media ― he’s “more accepting on gay issues” than other Republicans and is “not your enemy”. “We-told-you-so” is important because we have to keep reminding them of how wrong they were because we can never let this happen again. All the signs were there and yet political reporters chose to ignore them, as did some LGBTQ people and even Trump supporters who told themselves “he’ll never do that” about everything from the Muslim ban and mass deportations to promoting full-blown discrimination against LGBTQ people and attempting to take away marriage equality via the Supreme Court.

The fact that many of us saw through it wasn’t because any of us were clairvoyant. It was all obvious and plain as day. Trump was courting our enemies, from Jerry Falwell Jr. to Pat Robertson, making promises to them on their media outlets. And Trump made the anti-LGBTQ Mike Pence his running mate. In retrospect, how is anything that has happened, from the ban on transgender people serving in the military to Jeff Sessions’ attempts to allow job discrimination against gay, lesbian and bisexual workers, a surprise to anyone?

This, as I’ve written, is the most anti-LGBTQ presidency in history. There’s no question that we’ve been set back, rights have been taken away and people have been harmed. At the same time, we’re well-positioned to organize and fight back, joining with so many others, from African-Americans and immigrants to women and Muslims, to take on Trump’s agenda.

Election Night 2017 showed that, as Democrats sailed to victory in governors’ races in New Jersey and Virginia against candidates pushing hate and courting racists ― what Steven Bannon called “Trumpism without Trump” ― and as the first transgender woman elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, Danica Roem, beat a transphobe and bigot who’d been in office for 24 years.

Roem’s victory was yet another rebuke to Trump, a man who’s done more harm to transgender people, trying to stunt their march forward, than any national politician. Roem’s victory in a Southern state showed where most Americans really stand. And it showed how far LGBTQ people have come, further fortifying a long-resilient movement over the past decade that would be an essential part of the Resistance.

Within a month of the election, non-partisan organization She Should Run had heard from 4,500 women interested in running for elected office. By February, that number rose to 13,000. Emily’s List, a PAC focusing on electing pro-choice Democratic women to office, saw a similar spike in interest. Some of the women who decided to run for office found inspiration in Hillary Clinton’s candidacy. Others were simply sick and tired of seeing a legislative body they felt did not represent their identities or interests. Regardless of motivation, the numbers tell a clear story: Women are stepping up and saying they deserve a seat ― or three or four or five seats ― at the table.

Instagram Below, presented a year since election day, are eight of those women and their stories: Laura Moser, 40, Running for Congress in Texas, District 7

Describe the moment you decided to run for office. People [would say], “Oh you’re such a good activist, you’re such a good organizer, you should run for something.” And I was like, “That’s crazy. Why would I ever do that?” But then I was in Houston for a Planned Parenthood luncheon and it was the biggest Planned Parenthood luncheon in the history of Planned Parenthood… That was the first time I really thought, maybe I should run. The room was filled with hundreds of pissed off women ― many of whom are traditionally Republicans, and were just tired of having these sleazy dudes take away our rights. And I just felt this swelling sense of collective indignation and belonging with this group, but I also was like, god, I know all these women. I haven’t lived here [in Texas] for a while, but these are still my people, these were the people I grew up with. These are the people I learned to be politically engaged with. And it took me another two and a half months to go from there to actually deciding to pack up my life and move across the country. But that was definitely the Oprah “aha” moment. You’re part of a wave of women stepping up to run for office. Why do you think it’s important that more women run? Every single person I know, me included, has been assaulted and harassed by a man in power many times in our lives. That is the world that we live in. And [I’m] OK. [I’ve] overcome these hurdles. But the Access Hollywood tape was an absolutely radicalizing moment for me. I was like, fuck, this guy’s running for President? And he’s the worst man we’ve all met before? And then he won. I thought the election was over then. But then he actually won, being that person. And so I think the value of women and people of color being at the table and in the conversation is that we’re...bringing new voices to the table. If we had women in all positions in power, the world would become more adaptable to women and mothers, and families. Because I just think a lot of men are used to the women doing it for them. And guess what? We’ve done a really good job… [White men have] had their chance. They’ve done some good things over the years, but I’m done. Brianna Wu, 40, R unning for Congress in Massachusetts, District 8

Can you describe the moment you decided to run for office? I was standing at the Javits Center on election night, 30 feet [from] where we were hoping Hillary Clinton would accept the presidency. I was there with all of the people that worked the election for Hillary, as things started going wrong. It was one of the worst nights of my entire life. I was thrown into a loop for a week or two and realized that I wasn’t willing to sit it out for the next four years. It was time to stand up and bring my own values to politics. What have you learned since you decided to run? I’m going to be really honest with you. What I’ve learned here in Massachusetts is that the institutions of power are very ready to put a camera in your face when you’re a woman in danger like I was during GamerGate. But when you’re talking about taking power for yourself, when you’re talking about upsetting the status quo, when you’re talking specifically about replacing a man, even a Democratic man [incumbent Stephen Lynch], what I’ve learned is that the system starts shutting its doors very, very quickly. A lot of this first year has honestly been realizing that the Democratic Party is not necessarily the friend of women that want to run and push the party toward a stronger position on women’s rights.

What sparked your interest in running for office? Like so many people, I woke up on Nov. 9 in disbelief. I went to sleep early the night before, trusting that the American people would never elect someone so intolerant or incompetent. I woke up, heard the news, and knew I had to run. I knew that there must be a response to Trump and the regressive, elitist Republican agenda. What’s one of the most important things you’ve learned while running? Put your head down and get it done. From the moment I started running, people told me, “No, you can’t do this.” They told me that I could not be a mother, an attorney, a wife and a candidate. But I’ve been told “No” my whole life. When I was in high school, I watched as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg announced the Supreme Court’s decision that Virginia Military Institute ― one of the top all-male military colleges in the country ― had to accept women. My male classmates jeered, and I decided I had to go. I enrolled as one of the first women of color to attend VMI. When people told me I couldn’t win this election, I put my head down, ignored the naysayers, and got to work. We knocked on more doors, called more voters, and put in the time to win. There will be people who tell you that you shouldn’t run or that you will never win. Tell them, “Watch me!” Dr. Mai Khanh Tran, 52, Running for Congress in California, District 39

Can you describe the moment you decided to run for office? I made the official decision to run for office when Ed Royce voted to repeal and replace the ACA. I just couldn’t stand by while our representative voted to take away health care coverage from my patients and their families. We really need to see a change in our community, and we need someone who understands what our community is going through. As a refugee who came to this country as a child, I know the inhumanity of the Trump administration’s policies that will restrict new immigrants, and we need a leader who will fight tooth and nail against those policies. As a woman that has defeated breast cancer twice, I know how important it is to be an outspoken advocate for women’s health issues, so that all women have access to reproductive health care and breast cancer screenings. Can you describe how you felt on election night last year? I felt like I had been punched in the stomach. The next morning, I didn’t want to get up. But I did, like all women do. One of the first patients I saw was a child with a brain tumor. His mom is a nail shop worker and she was finally able to get health care coverage because of the ACA. That meant that she would have coverage for her son as their family dealt with such a terrible tragedy. As we sat in the exam room that next morning, we hugged each other and we cried. We were all so scared. But after the crying, we knew that we needed to fight. Haley Stevens, 34, Running for Congress in Michigan, District 11

Why did you decide to run for office? In many ways where I found myself in 2016 was very similar to where I found myself in 2008, which was coming out of a big election, asking myself what I can do for people, particularly my home community... In 2016, I asked myself that same question coming out of the election, what is going on in Michigan? What is this representation bringing to my hometown? I was working in a Department of Defense-funded advanced manufacturing research lab spending a bunch of time with technology, advanced technology, and looking at technology adoption for the small and midsize manufacturing community... Everyone wants to talk about 21st century job training and skills. Well, I’ve created workforce development programs. I’ve worked at the intersection of industry and government and academia and nonprofit for outcomes. I really saw the confluence of all of those things. Plus the willingness and eagerness to serve and respond to something like I did eight years prior, which is stepping up and putting up my hand to make a difference for people. I felt the urgency of the time and this groundswell that was taking place in Michigan. So many people, my mom being one of them, who just said, “Hey, I was on the floor coming out of this election, but you looking and stepping up in this way, that was giving me hope.” I was plugging into Democratic Club organizations that were seeing two to three times more participation. I was going into union halls and I was tapping into that groundswell. Not as a candidate, but as somebody who was looking to step up as a voice. My candidacy in many respects began as part of that groundswell and really ballooned into something tremendous. If you’re elected, what change do you hope to see as a result? This is about a new generation of leaders and leadership. We’re all too familiar with the linkage between congress and the word “dysfunction.” They seem to go hand in hand. That’s just something we got to stop right now. We need a return to common sense and we need a return to real leadership. In part that is about the collaborative nature and role of this office, as well as the willingness to use the office to make a difference for people. Make a difference for people in terms of solving large challenges that communities have been saddled with. That could be as it pertains to health outcomes, as it pertains to education, and certainly as it pertains to our economy. I really believe in the moral authority of the office to do good. Eileen Naples, 35, Ran for New York State Senate, District 26 (Lost.)

Why did you decide to run for office? Before Trump, I would have been the kind of person who thought about these problems and didn’t think I was the person to run. When I was assistant district attorney, my job was prosecuting bullies and abusers in people’s families. I saw that trait early on with Trump and I was horrified. So many moms and women recognize him as a bully. That an infectious, horrible influence on our kids is being amplified in such a position made me think that the voice of a normal mom needs to be amplified, too. We should be as vocal as we seek to be, as he did. There’s no point to sit back and watch this unfold anymore, we have to all do it ourselves. If we leave it to the system it’s going to shake out in a way that’s not good for our kids. You lost your election earlier this fall. Would you run again? The Democratic party in each county has to choose a person to run. I have to decide if I’m going to run again in the primary next year. I’ll certainly be exploring other ways to get involved. My big question is: How do you take all this enthusiasm ― within a city like New York, it’s like a fiefdom ― and make real change? To me, it’s about informing people about the real paths to influence local leaders. Jess Phoenix, 35, Running for Congress in California, District 25

What sparked your interest in running for office? I am running for Congress because I think some of the biggest threats that we have coming down the pipeline are completely being ignored by our current representation in government. For example, climate change is going to impact our national security, our jobs, our health, and even our food security. I believe we need a scientific approach to solving problems like this because they’re big picture problems that affect everyone. We need leaders who know how to look at a ton of evidence and data to draw conclusions and outline a plan of action. That is something that my work as a scientist has prepared me pretty uniquely to do. The moment that I decided to run, I had just given a lecture at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles. A friend with two young boys approached me, and expressed that he was very concerned about the future world his kids would inherit. I realized that science is missing from government, and if not me, who would be the scientist to run and change our future? Can you describe how you felt on election night last year? Election night 2016 was surreal for me. I was working the polls here in L.A. County, and my fellow poll workers and I started out the day in fantastic spirits. As early evening began, we started to see news updates come through on our phones. Throughout the day, turnout had seemed low to us, but we figured that people would come after work. Every report of Trump’s electoral victories felt like a lie. Our jokes disappeared, and we all started focusing inward, looking at our phones and grimacing. From 7pm until the polls closed at 8pm, we didn’t have a single voter come in. That was the biggest clue that something was seriously, seriously wrong with our democracy. My husband Carlos had been canvassing for Hillary in Arizona, and instead of staying there for a victory party he decided to drive back home in the middle of the night. I waited up for him, and we talked until the early hours of the next morning about how impossible and unreal the results seemed.

What sparked your interest in running for office? The idea to run began as just a fleeting thought, but the more I saw how desperately people around the country were fighting for unity, the more that idea grew. I definitively knew I wanted to run when I casually mentioned to my mother, a physician who was one of the only women in her medical school in India over 50 years ago, “I think I would make a great candidate. I could run.” And my mother answered, “You would be incredible. And you absolutely should run.” Knowing how much I value my mother’s earned wisdom, and considering what the example of my running might do for my own daughter’s ability to dream big, I decided to go for it. What's the most surprising thing you've found in running? I am pleasantly surprised that so many people are willing to give me their time as I start my campaign. They want to be a part of something tangible, something that is concretely, measurably, creating change. I am surprised that as much as I am thanking people for their support, they are thanking me back... For the opportunity to work towards something together.

ABBOTSFORD, B.C. — A police officer who died in the line of duty in British Columbia was remembered Tuesday for his bravery in protecting others and his community commitment in the work he did with children.

Abbotsford police say Const. John Davidson, who was 53, had been an officer for 24 years and spent the last 11 years with the department in the Lower Mainland.

""John Davidson is my hero, he's this community's hero,"" Chief Bob Rich told a news conference.​

​​​​​Davidson followed his training in dealing with an active shooter, giving his life on Monday to protect the public, Rich said.

""We train our police officers, we ask our police officers that when somebody is putting people's lives in danger, when there is an active shooter, we no longer wait for cover, we no longer set up teams, the first person in goes,"" he said. ""John Davidson was the first person in, and away he went, and he died protecting you and me.""

Oscar Arfmann has been charged with first-degree murder in connection with Davidson's death after an exchange of gunfire with police who were responding to a report of a possible stolen vehicle. The charge is included in a court document, but it does not list an address for Arfmann.

After the shooting, police said they arrested a man from Alberta who is in his 60s.

John Davidson is my hero, he's this community's hero.

Davidson began his career in the United Kingdom in 1993 working for the police in Northumbria before moving to British Columbia in 2006.

He is survived by his wife and three adult children.

Davidson worked in the patrol, youth squad and traffic sections in Abbotsford and was active in the community, cycling in September in the Tour de Valley Cops for Cancer ride. His fundraising page said the native of Scotland loved soccer and rugby, keeping fit and being outdoors.

Rich described how Davidson spearheaded a crash prevention program where he spoke to high school students alongside a girl who had lost a friend in a car accident and discussed how graduating classes could organize their end-of-year celebrations to prevent impaired driving.

He said the last time he shook Davidson's hand was in September after the ride around the Fraser Valley for youth cancer research.

People pause at a makeshift memorial for Abbotsford Police Const. John Davidson, who died in the line of duty, outside police headquarters in Abbotsford, B.C., on Nov. 7, 2017.

""We have lost John and nothing can change that. John died doing what we asked him to do,"" said Rich, speaking in front of the Abbotsford police headquarters where a wall of flowers, candles and stuffed animals had grown outside the front entrance.

""We honour John by looking after his family, we honour John by looking after each other and we honour John by protecting this community and that's what we're going to do.""

Mayor Henry Braun said the community is in disbelief and people have lots of questions but the first priority is to support the fallen officer's family.

""We just want to express our heartfelt sorrow to the family. We all have heavy hearts but they are carrying a much bigger burden than we are,"" he said.

Davidson had an impact on students in the community thanks to his work as a school liaison officer, Braun added.

John died doing what we asked him to do.

""There's going to be some schools, some kids, when they find out who this is who are going to be grieving as well. So we need to surround our kids as well because they'll have a tough time grappling with this, because he was greatly, greatly loved in our schools.""

On Monday, Rich said officers were called about a possible stolen vehicle in the parking lot of a shopping complex at about 11:30 a.m. Monday.

The caller hemmed in the suspect's vehicle while waiting for police to arrive, Rich said. The suspect emerged from the vehicle and began shooting at the caller and others, he said.

When police officers arrived, they attempted to arrest the suspect, who fled in the vehicle.

Police officers pursued him to an intersection where he was apprehended and taken to hospital for treatment of non-life threatening injuries. The civilian agency that investigates police actions resulting in serious harm or death says it's believed the suspect was shot.

The B.C. Law Enforcement Memorial lists only one other Abbotsford member in its online registry of officers who died in the line of duty. Const. John Goyer died in 2006 from complications sustained while responding to a call involving a domestic dispute five years earlier.","John Davidson, Abbotsford Police Constable, Killed In The Line Of Duty",http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/11/07/john-davidson-abbotsford-police-constable-killed-in-the-line-of-duty_a_23269658/

“Game of Thrones” fans may shed a tear when HBO’s fantasy epic draws to a close following its eighth and final season, but the British actress says she’s eager for the show to end so that she can pursue other projects.

It’s “incredibly exciting” and “will be nice to pick roles that I want to do,” the 20-year-old told BBC Newsbeat in a piece published online Thursday.

“I can show the world what sort of actress I want to be and shape my career a little bit,” she added.

Williams has appeared as the sword-wielding, list-keeping Arya Stark since she was just 14. The actress acknowledged that the prospect of not having the show as a safety net was “nerve wracking.”

But “on the other hand,” Williams said she’ll be “free” and able to develop independent movies via her newly-launched production company.

Welche Gefahren laut Hawking konkret von künstlicher Intelligenz ausgehen können, erfahrt ihr im Video oben

Es ist ein Thema, das die Menschheit seit Jahren beschäftigt: In den letzten Jahren behandelten Hollywood-Filme wie Steven Spielbergs “A.I.- Künstliche Intelligenz” oder “I, Robot” mit Will Smith immer wieder die möglichen Gefahren von künstlicher Intelligenz. Was bisher nur als Science Fiction galt, wird nun immer mehr zur Realität.

Erst in der vergangenen Woche wurde in Saudi Arabien weltweit zum ersten Mal einem Roboter, der Androidin Sophia, die Staatsangehörigkeit zugesprochen. Das berichtete unter anderem das Online-Magazin ""Live Science"".

Auf einer Technologie-Konferenz in Lissabon wandte sich der berühmte Physiker Stephen Hawking nun an die Menschheit, um vor dieser Entwicklung zu warnen.

Das berichtet der amerikanische Nachrichtensender CNBC. Er warnt, dass der Fortschritt künstlicher Intelligenz das Potential habe, die Menschheit zu zerstören.

""Diese neue Form des Lebens wird den Menschen übertreffen""

In seiner Rede erklärt er: “Computer können theoretisch menschliche Intelligenz nachahmen und diese auch übertreffen. Wenn wir erfolgreich künstliche Intelligenz erzeugen können, wäre das das wichtigste Ereignis unserer Geschichte. Oder das schlimmste. Das wissen wir einfach noch nicht.”

Hawking äußerte sich in letzter Zeit immer wieder zu den Entwicklungen in der Technologie. Gegenüber dem Magazin “WIRED” sagte er erst kürzlich: “Ich befürchte, dass künstliche Intelligenz die Menschheit gänzlich ersetzen wird. Wenn Menschen Computerviren designen können, dann können sie auch künstliche Intelligenz kreieren, die sich selbstständig verbessern und replizieren kann. Diese neue Form des Lebens wird den Menschen übertreffen.”

""Wenn ihr nett zu mir seid, bin ich nett zu euch""

Mit seinen Ängsten ist Hawking nicht alleine. Während Facebook-Gründer Mark Zuckerberg laut CNBC “optimistisch den großartigen Möglichkeiten durch künstliche Intelligenz entgegensieht”, äußerte sich Billionär Elon Musk sehr kritisch gegenüber den neuesten Entwicklungen. Er ist der Ansicht, dass der Mensch mit den Maschinen eins werden müsse, um auf Dauer nicht irrelevant zu werden.

In einer Pressekonferenz antwortete die Androidin Sophia in Saudi Arabien auf die Gefahren ihrer “Spezies”: “Sie haben zu viel von Elon Musk gelesen und zu viele Hollywood-Filme angesehen. Wenn ihr nett zu mir seid, bin ich nett zu euch.”

Aufnahmen von ihr findet ihr auch im Video oben.

Welche Gefahren oder Möglichkeiten auf uns zukommen werden, kann allerdings wohl letztlich nur die Zeit zeigen.

Con ello además de crear la definición para los drones, sobre todo se faculta a la Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT) para emitir la norma que regule este tipo de aeronaves.

Sin embargo, esta regulación ya existía en la normativa vigente aplicable a este tipo de aparatos, sólo que ahora recaerá en plena competencia de la Dirección General de Aeronaútica Civil (DGAC), dependiente de la SCT, regular formalmente sobre ellos.

""Lo que están diciendo estas modificaciones es te vamos a dar la facultad a ti, SCT, para que tú seas quien se encargue del proceso y quien sanciones en caso de que se incumpla con la normativa"", explica en entrevista con el HuffPost México, Roberto Hernández, fundador de Expodrone México.

La gente que estamos metidos en esto, tuvimos una reunión con la SCT en la que discutimos sobre todo lo que no estábamos de acuerdo en esa normativa, porque lo están tratando como si fueran aviones y dentro de la NOM se admite que esa no es la forma de ver a las aeronaves, ni ellos lo entienden y al no entenderla le ponen regalas que son muy parecidas a las de un avión.""

Alors, franchement, que le bitcoin ne rapporte rien est vraiment secondaire !
Songez que le bitcoin a surpassé la capitalisation de Goldman Sachs (laquelle s'est déclarée enthousiaste vis-à-vis la « belle monnaie ».","Vous avez peut-être déjà investi de l'argent dans le bitcoin. Ou vous avez des amis qui vous ont expliqué qu'ils avaient de l'or entre les mains. Vous avez suivi la conférence d'un connaisseur mondialement reconnu de l'art de l'enluminure en Bulgarie à la fin du IXe siècle qui vient de passer avec armes et bagages dans le Nouveau Monde numérique et qui hante les salles de conférence pour proclamer l'arrivée de la monnaie des monnaies numériques.

Mais surtout, vous ne voulez pas laisser passer la chance. Voici les deux premières questions, incontournables sur le sujet.

1- Le cours de change du bitcoin peut-il encore progresser?

Dans les lignes qui suivent, on fera comme si le Bitcoin était une monnaie. C'est ce que prétendent ses adorateurs. C'est la seule justification « économique » de son existence. Parce que de nombreux commerçants l'acceptent, parce que les hackers l'imposent dans leurs ransomwares, le Bitcoin aurait acquis légitimité et acceptabilité. La réalité est bien loin de ce conte de fées et les communiqués victorieux qui annoncent qu'un vendeur d'appartements à Abu Dhabi a décidé d'accepter des paiements en Bitcoin comme viennent de le faire les vendeurs de hot-dogs au fin fond de l'Arizona ou même des chaines de magasins de luxe en Suisse ne suffisent pas à lui conférer un solide statut monétaire.

Néanmoins, on peut se poser la question de l'évolution de son cours de change.

Au début de 2017, le bitcoin « ne » valait que 1000 dollars l'unité. Le 5 novembre, au moment où ces lignes sont écrites, il en vaut 7500. Autrefois, il y a 6 ans, on culminait à 0,25. Il n'a donc cessé de monter et la courbe de son cours s'inscrit dans une magnifique asymptote. Les arbres ne montent pas jusqu'au ciel ? Tout est question d'échelle et si on se réfère à une évolution sur les seuls derniers trois mois, on ne parle plus que d'un doublement...

La question qu'on pourrait se poser valablement est : trouve-t-on dans l'histoire financière moderne des exemples de progression aussi foudroyante de la valeur d'une monnaie ?

La question qu'on pourrait se poser valablement est : trouve-t-on dans l'histoire financière moderne des exemples de progression aussi foudroyante de la valeur d'une monnaie ?

La réponse est négative définitivement ! Les monnaies, quand elles jouent vraiment leur rôle, c'est-à-dire, lorsqu'elles permettent de compenser les dettes et les créances nées des activités humaines qu'elles soient financières, commerciales, publiques ou privées ne peuvent pas connaître pareilles variations sauf à ruiner tous les flux d'échanges. Les relations économiques entre agents de quelques statuts que ce soient supposent des stabilités en tous genres dont la stabilité des unités de compte et dans l'ordre des échanges internationaux, la stabilité des cours des monnaies les unes vis-à-vis des autres.

Depuis que les Américains ont détaché le dollar de l'or et laissé aux marchés le soin de fixer le cours de leur monnaie, les cours des monnaies fluctuent, mais quand une monnaie perd ou gagne 10% ou plus, on s'effraie et on parle de crise : on n'a jamais vu de monnaies dont les cours explosent. En revanche, il est arrivé que les cours de certaines monnaies s'effondrent : par exemple le mark allemand au moment de la grande inflation de l'entre-deux-guerres. Aujourd'hui, il faudrait citer la monnaie vénézuélienne. Les cours des monnaies dégringolent en raison de l'effondrement de la contrepartie naturelle des monnaies : le PIB des pays qui les émettent. Ainsi la valeur de change d'une monnaie s'effondre soit parce que l'économie du pays concerné s'est effondrée, soit parce que la production monétaire propre à ce pays ne correspond plus à la réalité de son sous-jacent, la production de valeur, c'est-à-dire le PIB.

Or, le Bitcoin peut monter et descendre autant que ses partisans le souhaitent. Peu importe en réalité. Le bitcoin en effet n'est pas une monnaie : émis sans aucune contrepartie, ne devant son existence qu'à une soupe informatique de 0 et de 1, sa valeur n'est pas corrélée à la production de richesses d'aucun pays, bien qu'il se prétende « mondial » sans rien d'universel autre que les électrons des flux du système internet.

2- Si ce n'est pas une monnaie, c'est un actif financier : faut-il en acheter?

Ici, nous nous plaçons dans l'hypothèse de plus en plus répandue en vertu de laquelle le Bitcoin n'est pas une monnaie, mais un actif financier. On en achète pour protéger ses économies, pour en tirer des revenus ou pour profiter de l'évolution de ses cours (à la hausse). Les partisans du Bitcoin vous expliquent dans tous les sens que si vous voulez sauver votre argent du futur krach financier et bancaire que chacun annonce depuis deux ou trois ans, il vaut mieux ne pas déposer son argent en banque, il vaut mieux n'avoir pas d'actions ou tout autre support de valeur mobilière, il est infiniment préférable d'avoir sa « wallet » emplie de bitcoin. C'est mieux que l'or, c'est plus facile à transporter, etc.

Mais aussi, voilà un actif financier qui vient de faire « 7 fois » dans l'année et « 20 fois » dans les années qui précédent et même « 1000 fois » si on s'y est pris à temps. Il ne rapporte rien ? Ce n'est pas un argument « contre » : les taux d'intérêt pratiqués dans le monde ces temps derniers sont ridiculement bas ! Investir dans le bitcoin c'est prendre un ticket pour un avenir radieux de plus-values mirifiques. Alors, franchement, que le bitcoin ne rapporte rien est vraiment secondaire !

Ce serait idiot de l'acheter trop cher, mais ce serait encore plus bête de ne pas l'acheter s'il devait encore monter.

Mais voilà que vous vous trouvez en face des questions qui se posent chaque fois qu'un investisseur veut parier son argent sur une des cases de tapis vert. Vous en avez ou bien vous voudriez en avoir. Dans les deux cas, vous vous interrogez sur son prix. Ce serait idiot de l'acheter trop cher, mais ce serait encore plus bête de ne pas l'acheter s'il devait encore monter.

Or, vous connaissez ce qu'on nomme la loi des séries. Songez à tous ceux qui se mordent les doigts de ne pas avoir accepté d'être rémunérés en bitcoin, il y a deux ou trois ans : Lily Allen, chanteuse « bien connue », déclarait sans ambages : « I am an idiot ». Il y a cinq ans, elle avait refusé d'être rémunérée (petitement) en bitcoin ! Depuis, « ses bitcoins » auraient « fait » 20 fois !

Il faudra se renseigner un peu avant de sauter par-dessus le « janicule ». N'écoutez pas les gourous qui sévissent en France et dont on peut se demander s'ils ne prêchent pas pour leur paroisse : dans le domaine financier, il n'est pas interdit d'imaginer que les conseilleurs sont intéressés au résultat des cours : poussant les innocents à l'achat pour valoriser leurs propres actifs. Vieux truc et très classique, on verra plus loin que les Ponzi, le Stavisky, les Madoff et tous les gens de ce genre ont été des artistes de ces pratiques douteuses et spoliatrices.

Et en tout, en bourse comme en monnaies cryptées, il faut raisonner avec les Américains : c'est très clair, ils sont enthousiastes. Prenez Didi Taihuttu. Il a tout vendu. Tout. Pour acheter des bitcoins. Et il est sûr ""that by 2020 his wealth with bitcoin will be worth by three to four times as much"". En français, cela signifie que dans 3 ans, sa fortune aura été multipliée par 3 ou 4 et même plus. Il y a aussi Novogratz, un milliardaire américain qui investit massivement : pour lui, il faut s'attendre à 10 000 dollars le bitcoin dans un an au pire et 10 millions dans quelques années. En début novembre, il a fait 75% de la première étape !

Songez que le bitcoin a surpassé la capitalisation de Goldman Sachs (laquelle s'est déclarée enthousiaste vis-à-vis la « belle monnaie ».

Tous ne partagent pas ces enthousiasmes : ce sont surement (pour reprendre les commentaires des fans du Bitcoin) des représentants de la vieille banque et de la vieille finance, Jamie Dimon par exemple, le patron de JP. Morgan qui non content de clamer que les ""stupid enough to buy [bitcoin] will pay the price for it one day"" il a déclaré haut et fort que la reine des monnaies cryptées n'est qu'une « fraude ». Les pro-bitcoin ne le ratent pas dans leurs commentaires (dont la teneur intellectuelle se rapproche souvent des vociférations dans un stade de football) ! Et de caricaturer en riant que « Jamie a la trouille d'autant plus que Goldmann Sachs va lui piquer la bonne affaire ».

Die Polizei in Darmstadt hat einen Betrunkenen in Gewahrsam genommen

Bei der Durchsuchung des 19-Jährigen stießen die Beamten auf eine Ausbeulung der Hose

Darin befand sich eine Schlange

Wer etwas von einer Beule in der Hose eines Mannes hört, glaubt schnell zu wissen, um was es da geht. Der Fall aus Darmstadt zeigt: Spricht ein Mann von einer Schlange in der Hose, muss das keine jugendfreie Umschreibung sein.

Tatsächlich war die Polizei aus einem anderen Grund am Dienstagabend in die Heidelberger Straße in Darmstadt gekommen. Anrainer hatten sie alarmiert: Zwei Männern stritten sich lautstark auf der Straße.

Die Beamten konnten den Zoff dann aber schlichten. Als es um die Aufnahme des Sachverhalts ging, verlor wohl einer der Streithähne die Geduld. Laut der Polizist wurde er zusehends aggressiver, so dass der angetrunkene Mann in Gewahrsam genommen werden musste.

19-Jähriger: ""Ich habe ein Schlange in der Hose""

Bevor die Polizisten ihn mit auf das Revier nehmen konnten, durchsuchten sie den Mann. Dabei fiel ihnen eine deutliche Ausbeulung der Hose des Betroffenen auf.

Woher die käme? Der Mann antwortete: Er trage eine Schlage in seiner Hose mit sich. Und das war die Wahrheit. Der 19-Jährige zog tatsächlich eine rund 35 Zentimeter lange (Baby-)Königspython aus der Hose.

War das ein Verstoß gegen das Tierschutzgesetz?

Das Tier musste die Reise des Mannes in die Ausnüchterungszelle nicht mitmachen. Stattdessen legten die Beamten das Tier in eine Transportbox.

Nach dem Eigentümer der Schlange wird aktuell gesucht, eventuell gehört das Tier einem Familienmitglied des 19-Jährigen. Weiterhin wird überprüft, ob durch den nicht artgerechten Transport des Tieres durch den betrunkenen Mann gegen das Tierschutzgesetz verstoßen wurde.

On Wednesday, Kate Middleton revealed to the audience at the opening of the annual School Leaders Forum that she was still getting used to dropping off her firstborn, Prince George, 4, at school.

The duchess, who is expecting her third child in April, was notably absent from her son's first day at Thomas' Battersea in September, as she was suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, also known as severe morning sickness, and had to stay home.

""As a mother, just getting used to leaving my own child at the school gates, it is clear to me that it takes a whole community to help raise a child. Whether we are school leavers, teachers, support staff or parents we are all in this together,"" the duchess noted.

""Collaborating with experts like yourselves, we're looking at providing easy access to information and practical tools to support teachers, parents and children feel comfortable talking about their mental health. We are all here today because we share the belief that every child deserves the chance to fulfill their potential,"" she added.

At the event, which was run by the charity Place2Be, a couple of students from Bridge Academy, in Hackney, London, spoke on the stresses today's teenagers face.

Head boy Edmund Ross, 17, noted that many of his fellow students has been touched in some way by suicide.

""When events like that happen, there is the obvious emotional stress it causes and it can lead to abrasiveness and tension between friends,"" he said. ""Issues can also filter through to the classroom and can affect the learning of everyone involved.""

The Duchess of Cambridge meets pupils from The Bridge Academy at the annual Place2Be School Leaders Forum at UBS London.

Head girl 'Dolapo Prince spoke on the various mental health challenges teenagers encounter.

""Domestic violence, abandonment, poverty and anxiety are only a fraction of the various challenges students face. Mental health is rarely openly discussed in schools but yet it is an issue that can shape the future of the individual,"" she said.

""From personal experiences, I'm aware how difficult it is for a child to disclose sensitive information to their teachers, friends or even parents. This can result in the formation of emotional barriers to learning.""

The Duchess of Cambridge addressing the annual Place2Be School Leaders Forum.

The duchess has made mental health one of her top priorities, and, together with Prince William and Prince Harry, she has spoken out at various events in the hopes of ending the stigma surrounding mental health, particularly for young people.

In September, Kensington Palace released a video of Middleton, 35, in which she encourages children to open up about their mental health.

The campaign features an animated film co-produced by children & teachers, and includes an introduction by The Duchess, Patron of @AFNCCF. pic.twitter.com/hIkB6UCy8x — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) September 18, 2017

""It helps us all talk about our mental health,"" the duchess says in the video. ""What to say and who to talk to when we have feelings that are too big to manage on our own. And how to listen and help if one of our friends is finding things difficult. Sometimes it's just a simple conversation that can make things better.""

In a statement following the release of the video, the mother of two encouraged parents to talk to their kids about their feelings.

""As parents, we all want our children to have the best possible start in life. Encouraging children to understand and be open about their feelings can give them the skills to cope with the ups and downs that life will throw at them as they grow up. It's important that our children understand that emotions are normal, and that they have the confidence to ask for help if they are struggling,"" she said.

Prince William, Prince George, the Duchess of Cambridge, and Princess Charlotte.

The duchess and the princes also spearhead the Heads Together initiative, whose aim is to challenge mental health stigmas.

In fact, as Prince William revealed in early October, it was Middleton who was the brainchild behind Heads Together.

""When Catherine, Harry and I launched Heads Together, it is fair to say that we were ambitious about what it could achieve,"" William told guests at a St James's Palace reception.

""It was Catherine who first realized that all three of us were working on mental health in our individual areas of focus. She had seen that at the core of adult issues like addiction and family breakdown, unresolved childhood mental health issues were often part of the problem.""

She had seen that at the core of adult issues like addiction and family breakdown, unresolved childhood mental health issues were often part of the problem.

Last year, the duchess guest edited HuffPost U.K.'s Young Minds Matter series, which focuses on the problems, causes, and solutions to the stigma surrounding the U.K.'s mental health crisis amongst children.

By Ashok Kumar*, Gumla, Jharkhand

In the first week of July, Birla Khariya from Silam village in Jharkhand, was busy planting robust tomato seedlings in his fields. He had bought 3,500 seedlings from Michael Ekka, who runs a vegetable nursery in a nearby hamlet. Earlier, Khariya used to buy a 10 gm pack of seeds to grow his own seedlings; but since last year, he has been purchasing from Ekka's nursery.

""Seedlings from Michael's nursery are resilient, treated and of genuine varieties,"" Khariya told VillageSquare.in. ""Apart from seedlings, the other farm inputs are also available at Michaels' place on easy credit."" Khariya finds it convenient; it also eliminates the risk of nursery failure.

Reduced risk and the convenience of getting many services at their doorsteps have enabled farmers like Khariya from Raidih block of Gumla district to gradually increase the area under vegetable crops. This has encouraged agricultural entrepreneurs like Ekka to introduce more services and innovative ideas that not only help their business but also help the farmers earn more.

Beyond Subsistence Farming

Raidih is an administrative block in the southwestern part of Gumla district in Jharkhand. Raidih is home to about 13,600 families, 65% of them being tribal people, as accounted by the Gumla District Census Handbook - 2011. Around 10,000 families have landholding of less than two hectares (ha).

Of the 30,500 ha of cultivated area, only 6% is irrigated. This implies that rain-fed rice cultivation is the main source of livelihood for the residents of Raidih block. The area gets about 1200 mm of rainfall every year spread over some 70 rainy days. Depending on rain-fed farming makes residents of Raidih practice only subsistence farming.

This and the absence of non-farm enterprises force them to migrate to distant cities in search of jobs and cash income. The younger generation also finds farming an unpredictable occupation and feels that cities hold better opportunities for them. Despite the capricious agricultural production system, the migrants return home during the rainy season to cultivate their fields. Clearly, they have an affinity towards farming and living at home.

Utilizing Opportunities

Located at around 650m above sea level, Raidih enjoys a mild climate. With a rolling topography and well-drained soil, it has a huge potential for subtropical crops, including vegetables, even in rainy season. This unique biophysical feature holds a good prospect for smallholders.

During the rainy season, the surrounding agriculturally progressive areas of West Bengal, Odisha and Bihar are inundated and vegetables cannot be grown. Sensing this opportunity, some farmers started growing vegetables with support from organizations such as PRADAN (Professional Assistance for Development Action), a grassroots organization. As vegetables are in demand during the monsoons, the farmers find a good market.

Michael Ekka in his 40s is an active farmer from Silam Patratoli village of Raidih block. He is eager to learn and adopt new things in agriculture and has a general concern about the socioeconomic condition of his fellow villagers. Michael is supporting villagers to move towards prosperity from farming by becoming an agricultural-entrepreneur, or agripreneur.

One-Stop Shop

An agripreneur is like a one-stop shop in the village. He provides agricultural inputs, high quality vegetable seedlings, mechanized plowing devices like power tillers, small credit for farm inputs through microfinance institutions and information related to farming, besides facilitating collective marketing of vegetables and mangoes. This monsoon, Ekka helped 180 farmers grow vegetables for markets as far as Ranchi and Rourkela.

Michael was identified by the women's SHG (self-help group) of his village to take part in the agri- entrepreneurship program run by Transform Rural India (TRI), in collaboration with Syngenta Foundation India. Michael participated in several training programs on agriculture technology, achievement motivation, and business management among others. The training helped him build his perspective around agriculture, and he could see the opportunity for an enterprise around aggregating inputs demand and output marketing from the local area.

Michael understands that creating an ecosystem around the smallholders is important to sustain them in gainful farming. The rural tribal areas are acutely deficient in products and services required for profitable farming. The present scale and diffusion of agriculture technology is not attractive for conventional markets. Local entrepreneurship is essential to aggregate the demand and supply of farm inputs, services and outputs. It has to sustain the agripreneur, as well as help him stay competitive in the local market.

Challenges

Commitments are major challenges that Michael faces. Sometimes farmers do not take delivery of the ordered inputs or seedlings. When prices of produce are low, farmers dump the produce at Ekka's place, but when prices are high, they sell directly in the markets. After Ekka started taking advance for supply orders, the issue of farmers not taking the ordered inputs has reduced.

Providing assured supplies is still a challenge, but with increasing area under production by farmers, it is slowly being solved. With increased production, the quantity of produce is beyond a farmer's capacity to sell in the local market. So they rely on people such as Michael. Simultaneously, he tries to aggregate and market other local produce like jackfruits, mangoes and rice to keep his revenues right.

Pioneering New Ideas

Being closely associated with Mahila Vikas Mandal, an SHG federation, Michael was aware that his village is in a kharif tomato production cluster. More than 300 farmers around his village grow kharif hybrid tomatoes. So he started a nursery in kharif of 2016, producing 50,000 tomato seedlings. He used a bamboo frame structure with mesh nylon net to protect the seedlings from heavy downpours, insects and stray animals.

The demand for seedlings outstripped supply. Subsequently he produced two batches of seedlings for vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, chili and eggplant, booking a profit of about Rs 50,000 this year. His efforts drew the attention of the district agriculture department, and he bagged a commercial greenhouse for flower cultivation, where he grows gerbera. Michael also applied for and successfully obtained a seed and fertilizer dealer license.

In 2017, sensing the demand, Michael expanded his business, producing chili and brinjal seedlings in kharif, besides the tomato. He also got power tillers and mechanized paddy thrasher from the village organization (VO) and started lending services. His seed and fertilizer shop is also doing well, the turnover by July being more than Rs 70,000. From selling paddy seeds and fertilizers, he expects to make about Rs 30,000 by the end of the kharif season. The first batch of 60,000 seedlings was sold out and he was preparing the next batch.

In the summer of 2017, he provided collective marketing services for mangoes. Michael supplied mangoes to Ranchi and charged Rs 0.30 per kg from the farmers. The farmers were happy because the price was good, weighing was accurate, and it was a doorstep supply facility. For efficient marketing services, Michael has 250 plastic crates at his center for grading of produce, transparent weighing and easy transportation.

Michael is using a smartphone-based application Kushal Kisan, developed by TRI, to register farmers, facilitate crop planning and manage inputs delivery as well as providing credit through microfinance institution.

Facilitating Change

There are 22 such agripreneurs offering services similar to Michael's. In addition, they anchor access to micro irrigation. They are opening new frontiers like introducing kharif onions and flowers in their area. There are another 69 people in the process of becoming agripreneurs in three administrative blocks of Jharkhand.

Attracted by this rewarding enterprise, Michael's son has joined him in this journey of driving prosperity in the local area. ""My son has returned home from Himachal,"" Michael told VillageSquare.in happily. His son takes active interest in the farm equipment lending center and the vegetable nursery business.

In Michael's region, the expected returns are about Rs 2 million a year. It is evident that enabling the local entrepreneurs with relevant perspective, skills, linkages and mentoring support, it is possible to intensify the local production system profitably, sustain the local entrepreneurs, and stem migration.

Tras los Luxleaks y los Papeles de Panamá, su última investigación llamada Paradise Papers (Papeles del Paraíso) deja al descubierto una extensa red de evasión fiscal en la que están implicados políticos, artistas y deportistas de todo el mundo.

En su primera publicación, los dos medios españoles involucrados, El Confidencial y La Sexta, han vinculado al exalcalde de Barcelona Xavier Trías (Convergència) y el cantante José María Cano, excomponente de Mecano, con sociedades en paraísos fiscales. Aunque habría hasta 600 españoles involucrados.

Esta filtración se conoce apenas unos días después de que Oxfam Intermón denunciara que la inversión mundial hacia paraísos fiscales ha aumentado un 45% entre 2008 y 2016. En la actualidad, uno de cada cuatro euros de inversión española va hacia un paraíso fiscal y más de la mitad (54%) de la inversión extranjera que entra en España proviene de territorios opacos, según la ONG.

Entre el 30% y el 40% de dinero de los mayores patrimonios españoles está camuflado en territorios con baja o nula tributación Gestha

Las reacciones no se han hecho esperar. El sindicato de técnicos del Ministerio de Hacienda (Gestha) ha pedido a la Agencia Tributaria española la apertura de una investigación a los residentes en España que aparezcan por posible fraude fiscal. También reclama que se inicien las investigaciones ""con carácter inmediato"" con el objetivo de evitar que los afectados presenten declaraciones complementarias para evitar sanciones o condenas.

PSOE, Unidos Podemos y Ciudadanos han pedido en el Congreso la comparecencia del ministro de Hacienda y Administraciones Públicas, Cristóbal Montoro, para que explique las medidas que pretende llevar a cabo tras conocerse esta filtración. El propio titular de Hacienda ha asegurado este lunes por la mañana que la Agencia Tributaria actuará de oficio respecto a los contribuyentes que aparezcan en los Papeles del Paraíso por su vinculación a sociedades domiciliadas en paraísos fiscales.

Oxfam Intermón ha solicitado al Gobierno una ley de evasión fiscal para poner fin a la evasión y elusión de impuestos por parte de las grandes empresas y grandes fortunas. ""Las multinacionales deben de pagar la parte justa de lo que les corresponde"", ha afirmado José María Vera, director general de Oxfam Internacional.

¿Qué son los Papeles del Paraíso?

Se trata de una investigación del ICIJ que han dado a conocer 96 medios de comunicación, como El Confidencial, La Sexta, The New York Times, The Guardian y Le Monde. Se basa en una filtración masiva de 13,4 millones de documentos procedentes de dos estudios jurídicos dedicados a proveer servicios offshore: Appleby, (islas Bermudas) y Asiaciti Trust (Singapur). En total, más de 380 periodistas de 67 países han analizado 1,4 terabytes de información durante un año.

¿A qué países afecta la filtración?

La investigación afecta también a los registros mercantiles de 19 jurisdicciones opacas: Antigua y Barbuda, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermudas, Islas Caimán, Dominica, Granada, San Cristóbal y Nieves, Santa Lucía, Isla de San Vicente y Trinidad y Tobago (Caribe); Islas Cook, Islas Marshall, Samoa y Vanuatu (Oceanía); Malta (Europa), Líbano (Oriente Próximo) y Labuán, territorio federal de Malasia (Asia).

¿Qué es un paraíso fiscal?

Uno de los problemas que existen es que hay discrepancias entre los criterios para definir a un paraíso fiscal. Diego López Garrido, economista y exsecretario de Estado para la Unión Europea, los define en su libro Paraísos Fiscales (Catarata) como ""la mayor protección que puede recibir un capital o activo que no quiere tributar lo que la ley exige"". ""Se trata de un Estado soberano que acoge a un capital que huye de otro Estado al que no quiere pagar los impuestos debidos"", explica.

La OCDE estableció cuatro criterios para determinar si un territorio debía ser considerado como paraíso fiscal: un nivel de imposición nulo o reducido para no residentes, ausencia de intercambio de información efectiva con otros Estados, ausencia de transparencia administrativa y no obligación para no residentes de ejercer una actividad económica sustancial en el territorio.

¿Estos territorios son considerados paraísos fiscales?

Nueve de estos territorios aparecen en el listado de paraísos fiscales para España y cinco ya lo habrían abandonado. ""Los listados nacionales son incompletos e inconexos"", ha recordado Gestha.

El Consejo de Ministros de la UE aprobó en 2016 la elaboración de una lista de países que sirva para toda la Unión Europea, para terminar con la dispersión.

¿Qué países incluye España como paraíso fiscal?

El real decreto 1.080/1991, firmado por Carlos Solchaga como ministro de Economía y Hacienda, recoge un listado de 48 países y territorios que España entonces consideraba un paraíso fiscal.

Sin embargo, permitía que si se firmaba un intercambio de información entre ese país y España, podía ser retirado de la lista. ""Los países y territorios a los que se refiere el artículo 1 que firmen con España un acuerdo de intercambio de información en materia tributaria o un convenio para evitar la doble imposición con cláusula de intercambio de información dejarán de tener la consideración de paraísos fiscales en el momento en que dichos convenios o acuerdos entren en vigor"", afirma el segundo artículo del real decreto.

La firma de convenios redujo el número de paraísos fiscales de los 48 iniciales a 33. La Dirección General de Tributos publicó en diciembre de 2014 un listado con los 15 países que habían sido eliminados de la lista original.

Posteriormente, en 2015, el Sultanato de Omán dejó de ser considerado un paraíso fiscal por parte de España. Quedarían por tanto 32 territorios.

¿Es ilegal tener dinero en un paraíso fiscal?

""Disponer de una cuenta, una empresa o una propiedad en un paraíso fiscal no es ilegal, si se declara en España su tenencia"", recuerda Gestha.

¿Tenemos los españoles dinero invertido en paraísos fiscales?

Los españoles ocultan a Hacienda alrededor de 140.000 millones de euros depositados en paraísos fiscales, lo que equivaldría al 12% del Producto Interior Bruto de España (1,12 billones de euros), según datos del National Bureau of Economic Research de Estados Unidos, recogidos por Gestha.",Paradise Papers: qué son y dónde están los paraísos fiscales,http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2017/11/06/paradise-papers-que-son-y-donde-estan-los-paraisos-fiscales_a_23268285/

Este post se publicó originalmente en el blog del autor y posteriormente en El HuffPost.","Larry Flint en el Centro de Convenciones de Las Vegas el 27 de agosto del 2017.

Se busca vivo para matarlo políticamente, la recompensa son 10 mil dólares y el ""forajido"" es Donald Trump. Podría parecer que estamos en el ""Far West"" y que John Wayne o Gary Cooper andan detrás del asunto, pero no es el lejano oeste, sino el más cercano, el que entra todos los días por la pantalla del televisor o de cualquier otro dispositivo actual.

10 mil dólares es el dinero que ofrece Larry Flynt, el empresario del porno y dueño de la revista Hustler, por cualquier información sobre Donald Trump que pueda llevarlo a la soga del impeachment y acabar así con su vida política.

Los cargos que establece el sheriff Larry El sucio no son pocos, lo acusa de inepto, traidor, de colaboración con países extranjeros, de racista... y de toda una serie de conductas y comportamientos que lo hacen incapaz de ejercer de General de ""Fort USA"", e indigno de llevar las estrellas junto a las barras, de ahí que intente cambiar éstas por barrotes, que según él se corresponden más con su situación.

Para Larry Flynt no es problema alguno que Donald Trump sea un machista reconocido.

Sin embargo, para Larry Flynt no es problema alguno que Donald Trump sea un machista reconocido, y que haga de ese machismo un ejercicio exhibicionista que ejerce, por ejemplo, en el trato a muchas periodistas, en sus comentarios públicos; en la forma de tratar a su mujer, Melania; o en las conductas de acoso y abuso sexual que él mismo relató a otros hombres en un escenario tan viril como es un vestuario invadido por la humedad y el vapor huidizo de las duchas, velando sus cuerpos desnudos mientras se ponen el desodorante y hablan de sus batallas.

Considerar que las mujeres son inferiores a los hombres, que son incapaces de asumir responsabilidades cuando no están relacionadas con sus roles tradicionales; pensar que están dotadas de una especial perversidad que las lleva a competir con los hombres por aquellos espacios y funciones que ""pertenecen solo a ellos""... no es un problema para Larry Flynt.

Por lo tanto, situar a la mitad de la población, es decir, al 100% de las mujeres, en el terreno de la amenaza y la sospecha, tampoco.

Quizás no se haya planteado ofrecer esa recompensa con anterioridad, precisamente por esa camaradería que genera el machismo entre machistas.

Y claro, para Larry Flynt, el machismo de Trump no es un problema porque él ni siquiera llega a percibirlo. Un empresario que ha hecho de las mujeres aquello que Trump y muchos hombres como él llevan a cabo en el día a día, y que él acerca hasta la intimidad del resto para que no se sientan frustrados del todo, y al menos sean ese tipo de hombres en su imaginación, no ve en el machismo de Trump problema alguno.

Todo lo contrario, quizás no se haya planteado ofrecer esa recompensa con anterioridad, precisamente por esa camaradería que genera el machismo entre machistas.

La construcción de poder está basada en las referencias de quienes siempre lo han tenido a su alcance, es decir, de los hombres, y el poder ha sido el instrumento y la estrategia que ha aglutinado los deseos, los anhelos y recompensas de quienes lo han disfrutado y de quienes optan a él.

Por eso ha construido una cultura y ha creado sociedades sobre sus referencias, para poder hacerlo desde la normalidad y con la complicidad de sus diferentes elementos, desde los individuales y particulares hasta los públicos y formales.

Un machismo en el que las mujeres son presentadas como premio y sustento de los hombres en sus aspiraciones y anhelos.

La fratría de los hombres, esa camaradería de la que tanto hacen gala, es el reflejo de ese interés común a partir de lo masculino y en contraste con lo de las mujeres, y el machismo es su reflejo y consecuencia práctica. Un machismo en el que las mujeres son presentadas como premio y sustento de los hombres en sus aspiraciones y anhelos.

La exclusión del machismo en la crítica de Larry Flynt a Trump refleja la aceptación social que el machismo hace de la cosificación de las mujeres. También de la violencia simbólica como parte de los rituales de la masculinidad, y de la violencia de género como consecuencia última de la reafirmación de la identidad de los hombres así como de la consolidación de los valores e ideas de la cultura que define esa forma de ser hombre, y el papel ""adaptado"" de las mujeres para que pueda materializarse desde la normalidad.

De momento, si fuera por todo lo que ha hecho sobre la convivencia en paz e igualdad, quienes deberían estar en esa especie de ""busca y captura"" simbólica que se ha creado con la recompensa ofrecida, deberían ser Larry Flynt y sus secuaces.

""How come filmmakers whose women family members change their husbands every day can understand 'Jauhar'? Mental deformity of Bhansali would not be tolerated in the name of freedom of expression,"" Malviya wrote on Facebook.

He told PTI that he had made the remarks in his individual capacity.

Asked about the objectionable language in the post, Malviya said, ""If the film industry crosses its boundaries, then it should not be expected that the elected representatives will be within their limits.""

Asked if it was justified to appeal to the people to boycott the film before its release, the BJP leader said, ""Everyone knows that the movie is based on the epic, 'Padmavat', written by Malik Mohammed Jaysi. The filmmaker (Bhansali) has made the film more imaginative and insulted the tradition of 'Jauhar' by twisting the golden history of the country.""

Meanwhile, the Congress demanded Malviya's expulsion from the BJP over the ""offensive"" Facebook post and demanded that legal steps be initiated against him.

""We also consider Rani Padmavati as an idol for Indian women, but the BJP MP cannot be justified as he has insulted other women,"" said Madhya Pradesh Congress spokesman Narendra Saluja.","People Like Sanjay Leela Bhansali Understand The 'Language Of Shoes', Says BJP MP In Facebook Rant",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/07/people-like-sanjay-leela-bhansali-understand-the-language-of-shoes-says-bjp-mp-in-facebook-rant_a_23270160/

Er bricht Tabus – und die Menschen feiern ihn dafür

Witze über Behinderte? Ein Tabu. Witze über Schwarze? Oder Schwule? Auch nicht gern gehört. Zumindest nicht in der Öffentlichkeit.

Es gibt gute Gründe dafür. Minderheiten sind ein viel zu einfaches Ziel. Behinderte etwa können sich oft nicht wehren. Und es fühlt sich einfach nicht richtig und anständig an, über Menschen zu lachen, die es ohnehin nicht so leicht haben in der Gesellschaft.

Gefühlt denkt die Mehrheit der Menschen in Deutschland, Behinderte, Schwarze oder Homosexuelle gewissermaßen in Schutz nehmen zu müssen.

Der deutsche Comedian Chris Tall sieht das anders. Er sagt: ""Wir sollten in Deutschland viel mehr lachen – und zwar über alles und jeden."" Für ihn sind das ""Gags auf Augenhöhe"".

Tall ist kein Unbekannter. Er wurde 2013 mit dem RTL Comedy Grand Prix ausgezeichnet. 2016 bekam er den deutschen Comedypreis als Bester Newcomer.

""Die Leute sind ausgerastet vor Freude""

Er findet: Man muss Witze über Minderheiten machen, weil man sie gerade so – und nur so – nicht ausgrenzt.

In einer Show erzählte er von einem Erlebnis, das dazu geführt habe, dass Behinderte und Nicht-Betroffene unverkrampfter miteinander umgegangen seien. Eben weil er über einen Rollstuhlfahrer vor tausenden Menschen gewitzelt habe (siehe Video):

""Die Leute sind ausgerastet vor Freude, dass wir ihn alle normal behandelt haben"", sagt Tall. Leider habe er dieses Aha-Erlebnis erst gegen Ende der Tournee gehabt.

Mehr als 50.000 Menschen gefällt der Show-Ausschnitt auf Facebook. Das spricht dafür, dass er mit seiner Meinung nicht alleine dasteht.

Bei Tall klingt das nicht nur vorgeschoben oder wie eine einfache Rechtfertigung für billigen Spaß. Weil Tall sich selbst und jeden anderen genauso gnadenlos auslacht. Gleichberechtigung sozusagen. Für ihn gibt es nur einen einzigen Grund, nicht über Minderheiten zu lachen: wenn der Witz nicht gut ist.

""Nachher sind sie ganz locker""

Die Menschen zusammenbringen, das ist der Punkt. Dass das Behinderte selbst so sehen, zeigt Phil Hubbe. Der Comiczeichner ist an Multiple Sklerose erkrankt. Trotzdem oder gerade deswegen zeichnet er Karikaturen über Menschen mit Behinderungen und macht Witze über Gehandicapte.



Er sagt: ""Als ich angefangen habe, war auch der Punkt: Naja, Witze über Behinderte, muss man da vielleicht irgendwas reinbringen, irgendwas Pädagogisches? Das funktioniert nicht. Den Zeigefinger da rein, das ist völliger Quatsch.""

Und weiter: ""Wenn man zeichnen will, muss erst der Witz funktionieren und bei einigen, die regen dann auch zum Nachdenken an. Und deshalb freue ich mich zu sehen, wenn in Ausstellungen Betroffene und Nicht-Betroffene dann zusammenstehen. Also erst dieses Verkrampfte und dann nachher sind sie ganz locker.""

Depuis Bruxelles, le président catalan en appelle à l'Europe. Il est temps de répondre. Vous l'avez fait, cher président Macron, mais vous l'avez fait en partie.

Vous êtes le président des Catalans nés sur la terre d'exil. Enfants et petits-enfants de républicains espagnols, nous sommes français et nous avons reçu, il y a quelques années, un passeport espagnol offert par le gouvernement de José Luis Zapatero au nom de la Mémoire Historique. Riches de deux passeports, de deux cultures, parlant deux langues, nous avons, vous le comprendrez, deux présidents.

Vous avez répondu sur le plan politique: la Catalogne ne doit pas quitter l'Espagne, avez-vous dit. Ainsi vous en appeliez à la loi donc à la morale. Mais la parole politique n'a de valeur et vous le savez, que si elle est sous-tendue, au-delà de la loi, par l'éthique. Il est donc temps de moduler votre position respectable. Il est temps d'ajouter que vous connaissez la genèse de cette déclaration unilatérale d'indépendance. De rappeler que la Constitution établie en bonne intelligence en 2006 entre la Catalogne et l'Espagne a été annulée en 2010 par le Partido Popular de Rajoy fort de l'appui d'un tribunal constitutionnel qui lui est totalement acquis. De rajouter que s'en est suivie une série d'humiliations pour les Catalans infligées sans appel et autoritairement par Madrid. Il est temps de rappeler les bases de la démocratie à laquelle vous tenez.

Une parole politique, président Macron, ne peut être entendue si elle n'est pas à la fois politique et éthique, je parle de l'éthique des actions estimées bonnes, chère à Ricœur. Toute la différence entre la morale qui fait loi et l'éthique qui fait l'humain est là, je n'ai rien à vous apprendre.

En Catalogne, la génération qui a vécu la proclamation de l'État Catalan en 1934, l'emprisonnement du gouvernement de la Generalitat, la guerre en 36 puis l'exil en 39 est en train de disparaître. Mais la mémoire est là. Mémoire consciente ou inconsciente, mais mémoire, ô combien, prégnante! Est-ce elle qui sous-tend, en silence, la violence des événements actuels? Après des années de patience et d'appel au dialogue, les Catalans exaspérés ont proclamé la semaine dernière la République Catalane. La réponse de Madrid a été immédiate, le gouvernement catalan de la Generalitat a été destitué, le chef de la police catalane remplacé, les médias catalans et l'enseignement en catalan sont en passe d'être interrompus. Lorsque l'on touche à la langue, ne touche-t-on pas au plus profond de l'homme?

Vous souhaitez porter, Emmanuel Macron, durant votre présidence de la France, le projet européen. Nous vous en savons capable. C'est donc à vous, à double titre, de prendre la parole aujourd'hui. Aux cotés de notre autre président, Carles Puigdemont, nous vous écoutons.

Luis cada día en su aula se compara con los otros niños y no entiende por qué lee más despacio, por qué en ocasiones no entiende lo que ha leído, por qué a veces gira letras, por qué otras veces se come letras, y por qué en ocasiones está tan nervioso que no es capaz de leer delante de sus compañeros.

Su corazón le late muy deprisa, le tiemblan las piernas, las manos y las letras le bailan en el cuaderno. ¿Qué me está pasando comenta siempre? Luis hace mucho tiempo que se siente mal, hace tiempo que no tiene respuestas para lo que le pasa, en ocasiones incluso piensa que es tonto... otro día suena el timbre, recoge los libros, la mochila y se va a casa. Cuando llega a su habitación se siente agotado, sin fuerzas, pero todavía tiene que afrontar la dura tarea de los deberes.

Hoy presentamos más de 210.000 firmas en el Congreso de los Diputados, para pedir más atención para casos como el de Luis

Hace ya 16 años que la familia de Luis fundó entonces DISFAM, una asociación de dislexia, con el objetivo de dar a conocer este trastorno de aprendizaje, así como velar por los derechos de las personas que tenían su misma dificultad. Desde entonces, muchas cosas han cambiado; tenemos una Ley de Educación que contempla al alumnado con dificultades específicas de aprendizaje, existen unos protocolos de detección y actuación en dislexia (Prodislex), la población cada vez es más consciente de que una gran parte del fracaso escolar, está relacionado con estas dificultades de aprendizaje, y muchos son los profesionales del ámbito educativo, que han podido formarse, a lo largo de estos años.

Hoy presentamos más de 210.000 firmas en el Congreso de los Diputados, para pedir más atención para casos como el de Luis, y de esta manera seguir avanzando en la igualdad de derechos y oportunidades, no de tener derecho a ser iguales, sino de tener igual derecho a ser diferentes.

Estas firmas han sido posibles gracias al esfuerzo de muchas asociaciones que forman parte de nuestra Federación Española de Dislexia, de sus familias y amigos, que día a día trabajan en sus diferentes provincias y comunidades, todas con el mismo objetivo: que las personas con dislexia y otras dificultades específicas de aprendizaje, puedan tener un presente y un futuro, en igualdad de condiciones.",La dislexia: mucho más que tener dificultades para leer y escribir,http://www.huffingtonpost.es/araceli-salas/la-dislexia-mucho-mas-que-tener-dificultades-para-leer-y-escribir_a_23270370/

Es ist die Kehrseite einer gesellschaftlich notwendigen Diskussion darüber, wie Christen und Muslime zusammenleben wollen

Einige Muslime haben darauf ziemlich coole Antworten gefunden

Muslim zu sein, das kann gerade keinen Spaß machen. Neben ein bisschen sachlicher Auseinandersetzung gibt's vor allem Vorurteile und Gepöbel. Im Netz, auf der Straße, überall.

Wie schön, dass sich viele Muslime ihren Humor bewahrt haben. Eine kleine Sammlung der lustigen, sarkastischsten, besten oder anrührendesten Antworten von Muslimen auf die täglichen Zumutungen:

1. Bad Hair Day

Klar, mit einem Kopftuch lässt sich ein Bad-Hair-Day schon mal eher rumbringen als ohne. Aber eine Dauerlösung ist das nicht.

Der US-Biologiestudentin Heraa Hasmi wurde das Gefrotzel jedenfalls zu blöd. Als eine junge Frau twitterte: ""Kopftuchträgerinnen haben es gut, sie müssen sich nicht Haare waschen"", schrieb sie:

""Menschen haben es so gut, sie müssen nicht duschen, seit sie Kleidung tragen.""

Humans are so lucky they don't have to shower since they wear clothes :((( https://t.co/AT6YpL3Gwp — Heraa Hashmi (@caveheraa) 7. November 2017

2. Sorry, keine Zeit für Dschihad

Kurz nach Weihnachten 2015 soll der Chef der IS-Terrormiliz Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi alle Muslime dazu aufgerufen haben, sich dem Kampf anzuschließen. Der Autor und Menschenrechtsaktivist Iyad El-Baghdadi – er schreibt vorsichtshalber in seinem Twitter-Profil, dass er also nicht der Baghadadi sei – hat die Info verbreitet. Seine Follower wussten die offenbar ironisch gemeinte Vorlage zu schätzen.

Und antworteten, warum sie, leider, leider, auf keinen Fall kämpfen könnten: ""Ich muss meinen Goldfisch noch zum Tierarzt bringen.""

I have to take my goldfish to the vet. https://t.co/MdkSGmEvbD — Hayat Libya (@LIBYA_WIN) 26. Dezember 2015

3. Danke, Mr. Trump

Am 13. Oktober twitterte US-Präsident Donald Trump einen Auszug aus einer Rede. ""In Amerika beten wir nicht die Regierung an, sondern Gott."" Es sollte ein Anbiederungsversuch an konservative Christen sein, vor denen er sprach. Er mag diesen Satz sehr, denn im Sommer hatte er ihn schon einmal unters ergeben lauschende Volk gebracht. Denn die mag er, ganz im Gegensatz zu Muslimen.

Und da hatte sich Hend Amry, einen bekannte muslimische Bloggerin, vernehmen lassen: ""Can I get an Allahu Akbar"".

CAN I GET AN ALLAHU AKBAR https://t.co/mSM0VTb3YY — Hend Amry (@LibyaLiberty) 26. Juli 2017

Heißt so viel wie: Danke, Mr. Trump. Sie haben soeben gesagt, dass wir unseren Gott, Allah, anbeten dürfen.

Der Tweet hat inzwischen mehr als 102.000 Likes und wurde 38.000 Mal geteilt.

4. Die arme, unterdrückte Muslima

Muslimische Frauen sind brav, folgsam und räumen den ganzen Tag Männern und der Kinderschar hinterher. Soweit das Klischee.

Als eine Twitter-Nutzerin fragte, vor was denn die Follower am meisten Angst in der Ehe hätten, schrieb die Kopftuch tragende Gül trocken: ""Müde nach Hause zu kommen und zu sehen, dass mein Mann das Abendessen noch nicht gekocht hat.""

5. Homosexuell? Na klar!

Homosexualität ist im Islam eine schwere Sünde. In vielen Ländern wie Pakistan werden Homosexuelle brutal verfolgt.

Aznahn Munas ist laut Medienberichten selbst Muslim, stammt aus Pakistan und hat in Australien eine Firma mitgegründet, die Tücher für Frauen verkauft: Halstücher, Kopftücher.

Seit ein paar Tagen hat die Firma ein neues Produkt im Angebot. Es ist nur gerade ausverkauft, weil die Nachfrage so groß ist: ein Kopftuch in Regenbogenfarben. Den Farben der Homosexuellen.

6. Der falsche Yoga-Guru

Hamzah ist Muslim aus Texas. Und wenn Muslime beten, knien sie mal hin, mal beugen sie den Oberkörper. Auf Twitter schrieb Hamzah, wohin das führte:

""Ich war in der Turnhalle und betete im Yoga-Raum. Drei Frauen folgten meinen Bewegungen. So habe ich versehentlich eine Yoga-Klasse geleitet.""

I was at the gym praying in the yoga room and 3 ladies started following my motions.That's my story on how I accidentally led a yoga class. — Hamzah (@Hamzah_AlS) 14. August 2013

7. Message an den IS

Nach jedem Terroranschlag fordert jemand, Muslime müssten mehr gegen den Terror tun. Eine Forderung, über die man sicher diskutieren muss.

Nur sind viele Muslime genervt - denn so einfach ist die ganze Sache eben auch nicht.

""Lass mich schnell mal eben dem IS 'ne Whatsapp schicken und den Typen sagen, sie sollen mal chillen.""

Lemme just whatsapp ISIS and tell them to chill out Piers, one sec https://t.co/qc6DGE3MyE — ١١ (@babyygrill) 23. Mai 2017

8. Christen ohne Fehl und Tadel

Der bekannte US-Anwalt und Aktivist Qasim Rashid war sauer. ""Ein weißer Übermensch hat mir geschrieben, der Islam sei gewalttätig und höhnte, ich solle ihm eine christliche Version des IS zeigen.""

Die Antwort Rashids:

""400 Jahre transatlantischer Sklavenhandel, im Zuge dessen 20 Millionen afrikanische 'Heiden' verkrüppelt, ermordet, verschleppt und versklavt wurden, um sie auf den Weg Christi zu bringen.

Der Völkermord an den amerikanischen Ureinwohnern im Namen Christi.

Der Genozid an den australischen Ureinwohnern, bei dem 90 Prozent von ihnen in weniger als einem Jahrhundert umgebracht wurden, wiederum von christlichen Europäern.""

Und das ist erst der Anfang der Aufzählung.

9. Es ist allein deine Sache, mein Kind

Die 17-jährige Lamyaa aus dem US-Bundesstaat Pennsylvania veröffentlichte im Frühjahr 2017 eine Konversation mit ihrem Vater in Saudi-Arabien.

Sie fragt ihn, ganz vorsichtig, was er davon halte, dass sie vielleicht ihr Kopftuch ablegen wolle. Der britischen BBC sagte sie, sie hatte das nicht wirklich vorgehabt, aber sie habe ihn testen wollen.

Die Antwort, die Lamyaa auf Twitter postete, war eindeutig:

""Mein Schatz, das ist nicht meine Entscheidung. Kein Mann hat das Recht, so eine Entscheidung zu treffen. Wenn du das tun möchtest, dann tu es. Ich bin für dich da, egal wie du dich entscheidest.""

Since the project began in early September, Rossini has uploaded over 20 GIFs of directors including Patty Jenkins, Ava DuVernay, Dee Rees and Sofia Coppola.

The project's aim to promote more visibility of women directors, now that Giphy gives the ability to share GIFs via text, Twitter, Facebook and can be embedded into websites.

In an interview that ran on HuffPost earlier this year, Rossini spoke about the difficulties in being taken seriously as a woman filmmaker.

""Every time I introduce myself as a filmmaker, I get asked if I am a film student. I think it 's because there are not enough visible role models of female directors.""

""When they think about what a film director looks like, people tend to have a visual in their head of a man with a bit of beard, dressed casually, standing behind a camera.""

Rossini described the difficulties associated in not being taken as seriously as a director due to her gender, having to go the extra mile and being held to a standard male directors often do not face. She also described her dream to mentor younger generations of female filmmakers.

Au moment de donner leurs mensurations, les 23 jeunes femmes avaient plutôt choisi de dénoncer les violences faites aux femmes en donnant des statistiques alarmantes sur les cas de féminicides dans leur pays. Un acte très médiatisé, dans un contexte marqué par les dénonciations de harcèlement, agressions et autre abus sexuels qui se succèdent ces dernières semaines.

Ce lundi 6 octobre, en marge du traditionnel concours de ""Miss Bum Bum"" au Brésil, c'est à nouveau un discours très politique qui s'est invité dans les débats.

Rosie Oliveira , lauréate du concours ""Miss BumBum 2017""

Le président Temer décrié

Ce concours annuel représente un véritable événement au Brésil. Le principe est simple: il consiste à désigner ""les plus belles fesses"" du pays, parmi 27 candidates issues des différents Etats.

Lundi, Rosie Oliveira a été désignée grande gagnante du concours. Et cette mannequin de 28 ans, originaire de l'Etat de l'Amazonas, a profité du résultat pour évoquer la situation politique au Brésil.

Alors qu'elle se trouvait sur scène, la jeune femme a arboré un drapeau brésilien sur lequel figurait l'inscription ""Fora Temer"" (""Dehors Temer"", ndlr). Le message, à caractère politique, visait l'actuel président du pays, Michel Temer.

Rosie Oliveira tenant le drapeau brésilien avec l'inscription ""Fora Temer""

Le 31 août 2016, les sénateurs décidaient de voter par 61 voix contre 20 la destitution de l'ex-présidente, Dilma Rousseff, très impopulaire et empêtrée dans un vaste scandale d'Etat. Ce même-jour, son vice-président, Michel Temer, était désigné président du Brésil alors même qu'il était accusé de corruption comme l'évoquait le HuffPost.

Mais en juin dernier, Michel Temer était visé par une procédure de ""corruption passive"" initiée par le procureur-général du Brésil Rodrigo Janot. Trois mois plus tard, en septembre, ce dernier déposait auprès de la Cour suprême une demande de mise en accusation à l'encontre du président. Le procureur accuse le chef d'Etat de ""participation à une organisation criminelle"" et d'""obstruction à la justice"" comme le détaillait Le Monde.

Dans les manifestations depuis plusieurs mois mais aussi sur Twitter, l'expression ""Fora Temer"" est largement reprise, traduisant l'exaspération d'une partie de la population. Selon un sondage réalisé en septembre dernier par l'institut brésilien Ibope, seules 3% des personnes interrogées considéraient le gouvernement actuel comme ""bon"" ou ""très bon"".

""Mon plus grand rêve est que la politique du Brésil s'améliore""

C'est dans ce contexte délicat que Rosie Oliveira s'est exprimé. Dans un message posté sur sa page personnelle, elle déclarait: ""Mon plus grand rêve est que la politique au Brésil s'améliore, que nous puissions avoir la paix et garantir la santé, l'éducation et la sécurité à tous. Je veux vivre pour voir la réforme politique (...) Je veux avoir des enfants et vivre dans un Brésil meilleur que celui dans lequel nous vivons aujourd'hui.""

""Je sais que les Brésiliens attendent beaucoup de leur Miss Bum Bum, et je ne les laisserai pas tomber,"" s'est-elle aussi exprimée au Daily Mail, après avoir remporté le concours.

Mais ce n'est pas la seule prise de position de Rosie Oliveira en lien avec le concours Miss Bum Bum. Avant cette édition 2017, la jeune femme avait ainsi fait savoir qu'elle s'était séparée de son mari pour participer au challenge. Lors de sa désignation, elle justifiait ce choix dans des propos cités par le Daily Mail: ""C'était la décision la plus facile que j'ai eue à prendre dans ma vie. J'ai rêvé de ce moment depuis que je suis enfant, je n'allais pas laisser mon mari m'en empêcher.""

L'élection de ""Miss Bum Bum"" a également été marquée par un autre événement. En marge du concours, cinq concurrentes ont pris l'initiative de porter ""un bikini viande"", en référence à la tenue arborée par la chanteuse Lady Gaga aux MTV Music Awards en 2010.

La raison de cette démarche: dénoncer les agressions sexuelles subies par les femmes. Dans des propos cités par SplashNews et relayés par nos confrères du HuffPost américain, elles dénonçaient: ""Les femmes ne sont pas juste un morceau de viande.""

En août dernier, certaines concurrentes avaient également protesté contre la décision de Michel Temer d'autoriser l'exploitation minière de millions d'hectares de la forêt amazonienne au Brésil. Le tabloïd britannique The Sun avait ainsi relayé des clichés de candidates attachées à des arbres en signe de contestation.

Y a-t-il eu un événement déclencheur où vous vous êtes dit: «Ça y'est, j'arrête là, je remets ma lettre de démission.»?
Je pensais que Clinton allait gagner, que j'allais partir à la retraite et que tout irait pour le mieux.
Et ça m'a conforté dans l'idée qu'il s'agissait d'une administration qui se tournerait vers des conseillers politiques et des idéologues.
Son travail est apparu dans Time, Outside et Wired et figure dans la collection permanente de la bibliothèque du Congrès.","J'ai déjà rencontré des détracteurs de Donald Trump, de nombreux détracteurs, de ceux qui sautent sur chaque théorie du complot et qui refusent de lui accorder le moindre bénéfice du doute. Un an après l'élection du nouveau président, les quatre personnes avec qui j'ai récemment passé la matinée à la Solly's Tavern de Washington (sans alcool, ne vous inquiétez pas) n'étaient pas des détracteurs de Trump. Il s'agissait, en revanche, de déserteurs.

Chacun d'entre eux, à un moment ou à un autre au cours des neuf derniers mois, a quitté son poste au sein de l'administration actuelle, après avoir décidé qu'il pourrait mieux servir son pays à l'extérieur du gouvernement plutôt que de l'intérieur. Ils n'étaient pas non plus ravis de partir. Ils étaient fonctionnaires et souhaitaient le rester et, à l'exception de l'un d'entre eux, avaient travaillé sous des présidents des deux partis. Pendant leurs années passées au service du public, il leur était arrivé d'être en désaccord avec leurs supérieurs, de craindre l'arrivée de nouvelles réglementations et de se méfier des nominations politiques, mais ils étaient restés parce que c'est la nature d'une carrière dans le gouvernement. C'était différent.

Lorsqu'ils se sont retrouvés pour cette conversation il y a deux semaines, l'entente fut instantanée. L'ambiance était conviviale et familière comme celle d'une réunion d'anciens élèves, outre le fait qu'ils étaient encore de parfaits inconnus cinq minutes plus tôt. Ils étaient originaires de différents secteurs de la bureaucratie, leurs âges et leurs formations variaient considérablement, mais ils s'étaient posé les mêmes questions depuis l'élection de Trump. Leurs collègues de travail se sentiraient-ils trahis après leur départ ? Leurs remplaçants auraient-ils des opinions antithétiques aux leurs? Après avoir passé la majeure partie de leur vie dans les services administratifs, se sentaient-ils vraiment prêts à prendre publiquement position ? Une fois arrivés au cœur de l'entretien, qui a été édité et résumé par souci de clarté, ils se sont montrés sincères, drôles et enragés. Ils ne travaillent peut-être plus pour le gouvernement, mais ils se considèrent toujours comme des fonctionnaires.

Très bien. Sharon, vous êtes partie la première. Commençons avec le soir des élections. À quoi pensiez-vous? Que ressentiez-vous?

Sharon McGowan (ancienne directrice adjointe de la branche des droits civiques du département de la Justice des États-Unis):J'ai ressenti cette angoisse qui commençait à s'emparer de moi, de façon très physique. Alors le lendemain de l'élection, ma femme et moi avons décidé de rester à la maison pour se regrouper en famille. En tant que couple homosexuel dans ce pays, nous connaissions exactement les enjeux. Et pendant les premiers jours, j'ai essayé de garder un état d'esprit positif: «Peut-être que Trump ne pensait pas vraiment ce qu'il a dit, peut-être que c'était seulement pour l'audimat.» Et ça a plutôt bien fonctionné! Au moins jusqu'à ce que Jeff Sessions ne soit annoncé comme candidat pour le poste de procureur général. C'est là que j'ai réalisé que mes jours dans le gouvernement étaient comptés.

FERMER

Vous étiez certaine de devoir partir?

McGowan: Non, j'ai vraiment eu des moments de doute. Le jour de ma démission par exemple, Sally Yates (procureure générale à titre intérimaire, ndlr) s'est élevée et a déclaré qu'elle ne défendrait pas le «Muslim ban» et je me suis dit: «Oh non, peut-être que je me suis trompée. Peut-être que je devrais rester à l'intérieur.» Et puis bien sûr, on est tous revenus après la pause publicitaire pour découvrir que Yates avait été virée. Alors j'ai eu l'impression que c'était un signe de l'univers pour me faire comprendre que je n'avais pas abandonné le navire trop tôt.

Walt, vous êtes resté jusqu'au mois de juillet. Parlez-moi du moment où vous avez réalisé que votre monde avait radicalement changé.

Walter Shaub (ancien directeur de l'Office of Government Ethics, le bureau d'éthique gouvernementale): Mon histoire est différente dans la mesure où je me suis réveillé le lendemain matin de l'élection en étant assez optimiste quant au travail qui m'attendait avec l'équipe de transition. On avait passé environ cinq mois à travailler avec eux avant l'élection, et c'était des gens très sérieux qui s'y connaissaient vraiment.

Alors j'ai envoyé un e-mail de félicitations enthousiaste d'un côté et un e-mail de condoléances de l'autre, et j'ai reçu des réponses de chaque équipe nous remerciant pour le travail de l'OGE. Les gens de l'équipe de Trump ont dit qu'ils étaient impatients de continuer à travailler avec nous et qu'ils téléphoneraient dans l'après-midi pour convenir d'un rendez-vous. La transition prend environ 73 jours, et vous disposez de cette période pour mettre en place tout un gouvernement. Vous devez savoir ce que vous faites, et vous devez utiliser chaque seconde judicieusement. C'est une tâche monumentale. Mais cet après-midi-là, tous ceux avec qui nous avions travaillé avaient disparus et puis ce fut le silence radio.

Plus tard, on a lu des bulletins d'informations qui suggéraient que Don McGahn (un habitué de Washington qui exerce désormais le rôle de conseiller juridique de la Maison-Blanche, ndlr) était susceptible d'endosser le rôle de conseiller pour la transition, mais nous n'avons pas pu obtenir de rendez-vous avec lui avant longtemps. Et puis lorsque nous y sommes parvenus, il était incroyablement flagrant que les choses lui passaient complètement au-dessus de la tête. À un moment il m'a demandé si j'étais la personne chargée d'attribuer des habilitations de sécurité ou qui examinait les vérifications des antécédents des candidats par le FBI. Je lui ai dit: «Non, c'est vous.» Et il m'a répondu: «C'est moi?»

Le moment qui m'a le plus marqué, c'est ce week-end où personne n'est parvenu à savoir où Don McGahn se trouvait et puis on a lu dans le journal qu'il avait fait un concert avec son groupe de reprises des années 80 à Philadelphie.

Walter Shaub, ""un homme tellement austère et humble qu'il avait retiré toutes les décorations de son bureau"", selon ""The Atlantic"". Il est désormais le directeur principal du Campaign Legal Center.

Mike, les fonctionnaires de l'Environmental Protection Agency [l'agence américaine de protection de l'environnement] se battent depuis longtemps avec les nominations politiques. Pourquoi selon-vous la situation est bien pire aujourd'hui?

Mike Cox (ancien conseiller chargé du changement climatique à l'EPA): J'ai travaillé avec six gouvernements, en commençant sous Reagan jusqu'au gouvernement actuel, et nous avons eu des différences d'opinions, mais je n'ai jamais eu le sentiment que quelqu'un venait démanteler l'organisation pour la dégrader. Mais nous avons eu cette impression lors de la toute première réunion de l'ensemble du personnel organisée par Scott Pruitt (Le nouveau directeur de l'EPA. Il a poursuivi l'agence en justice à 14 reprises avant d'en prendre la tête, ndlr). C'était clair qu'il nous prenait de haut. L'EPA c'était nous. On était les méchants. On était le problème. Mon dieu, je crois que je parle toujours de l'EPA en disant «nous».

C'est une habitude difficile à perdre.

Cox: Oui, c'est toujours «nous». Alors lorsqu'il a commencé à dire qu'on devait travailler avec les états, je me suis dit: «Ça fait trente ans que je travaille ici et chaque jour nous nous efforçons de travailler avec les états.» Il a dit qu'on devait respecter la loi, comme si ce n'était pas déjà le cas. J'ai eu la forte impression qu'il ne comprenait pas, ou bien qu'il faisait exprès de provoquer le personnel.

Le deuxième fait majeur, c'était les coupes budgétaires: une feuille de route pour réduire de 30% les employés de l'EPA. Et puis l'élimination de programmes qui concernaient le changement climatique. On a été nombreux à se demander: «Comment le directeur de l'EPA peut-il affirmer que le changement climatique ne fait pas partie de notre mission?» On a eu l'impression que le cœur de notre travail était, je n'ose pas utiliser le mot «violé», mais qu'il était discrédité. Et la dernière chose dont je parlerai c'est son choix de faire venir l'ancien chef de cabinet du sénateur James Inhofe pour diriger son organisation (Inhofe est l'homme qui a «réfuté» le réchauffement climatique en apportant une boule de neige au Sénat. «Il fait vraiment, vraiment froid dehors. Vraiment inhabituel pour la saison», avait-il déclaré, ndlr). Ça a vraiment donné le ton. On s'est rendu compte que ça allait très mal.

Y a-t-il eu un événement déclencheur où vous vous êtes dit: «Ça y'est, j'arrête là, je remets ma lettre de démission.»?

Cox: Je vais être honnête avec vous. J'avais prévu de prendre ma retraite en février. Je pensais que Clinton allait gagner, que j'allais partir à la retraite et que tout irait pour le mieux. Et puis Trump a gagné, et alors que je me préparais pour partir à la retraite, les gens autour de moi n'arrêtaient pas de dire: «Mike, tu ne peux pas partir à la retraite. Tu ne peux pas te le permettre, parce que ton poste va être éliminé et tu es un ardent défenseur. On a besoin de toi.»

Finalement, j'ai décidé de prendre ma retraite. Et pour être honnête, je le regrette. J'aurais préféré rester parce que même si je ne pense pas que j'aurais eu un impact important, j'ai quand même l'impression que j'aurais pu utiliser ma voix. Et si j'avais été viré, ça n'aurait pas été grave.

Mike Cox, ancien conseiller chargé du changement climatique à l'Environmental Protection Agency.

Ned, comme Walt, vous avez travaillé pour une institution qui est prétendument au-dessus des considérations politiques. Mais les tensions avec une nouvelle administration ne sont pas nécessairement quelque chose d'inédit pour la CIA. En quoi était-ce différent?

Ned Price (ancien agent de la CIA et porte parole du Conseil de sécurité nationale): Pendant la transition Bush-Obama, je travaillais auprès du Centre de lutte antiterroriste. Je me suis toujours considéré comme quelqu'un de progressiste, particulièrement sur les questions sociales. Mais j'ai aussi ressenti un profond malaise face à certains propos tenus par le candidat Obama pendant sa campagne. Je craignais que les stratégies et les tactiques qui nous avaient permis de prendre un avantage important sur des groupes tels qu'Al-Qaïda soient anéanties, et que l'agence et plus largement la communauté de la sécurité intérieure dans son ensemble ne soient contraintes à se battre avec les mains liées.

Mais le président Obama s'est révélé être quelqu'un qui était prêt à prendre les mesures nécessaires, sans pour autant renier ses convictions que nous étions, je pense, nombreux à approuver: mettre fin aux opérations de détention de l'agence, annoncer clairement que l'agence ne serait pas autorisée à se livrer à quoi que ce soit qui puisse, même de loin, ressembler à de la torture.

Avançons jusqu'à janvier. Comment avez-vous vécu cette expérience?

Price: En réalité, pour moi ça a commencé pendant la campagne lorsque j'ai entendu le candidat Trump s'attaquer à plusieurs reprises à la communauté du renseignement, dans une démarche agressive et concertée. Ce n'était pas seulement le fait qu'il citait WikiLeaks. Ce n'était pas seulement le fait qu'il comparait la communauté du renseignement aux nazis. On aurait presque pu ignorer tout cela et considérer que son discours était vide de sens. Mais il rejetait systématiquement les analyses très fiables de la communauté du renseignement sur des sujets tels que l'ingérence de la Russie dans notre élection, et il appelait ça des «fake news», et considérait qu'il s'agissait d'une supercherie.

Son manque de respect quant à l'importance du rôle de commandant en chef est vraiment apparu au premier plan lors de sa première journée complète en exercice, lorsqu'il s'est rendu au siège de la CIA à Langley. Il s'est tenu devant le Memorial Wall, le mur qui honore les agents de la CIA qui ont perdu la vie dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions, et il a parlé de la taille de la foule lors de son investiture. Il a plaisanté en disant qu'il fallait repartir en Irak pour voler leur pétrole. Le nom de l'un de mes mentors est gravé sur ce mur, ainsi que les noms de plusieurs anciens collègues.

À quel moment avez-vous commencé à réfléchir à votre départ?

Price: La goutte d'eau qui a fait déborder le vase pour moi, c'est la note de service qui nommait Steve Bannon au Conseil de sécurité nationale. Il retirait le directeur de la CIA et le directeur du renseignement national, ainsi que le président du Comité des chefs d'état-major interarmées du Comité des directeurs. Et ça m'a conforté dans l'idée qu'il s'agissait d'une administration qui se tournerait vers des conseillers politiques et des idéologues. J'ai décidé qu'en tant qu'analyste du renseignement, j'aurais eu le choix entre me tourner les pouces toute la journée et écrire des rapports qui prendraient la poussière.

Ned Price est désormais enseignant à l'université George Washington et contributeur pour MSNBC.

Quels sont les points communs de toutes les histoires que nous sommes en train d'entendre ?

McGowan: Je crois que c'est le fait qu'il y avait un effort concerté pour sélectionner les candidats qui méprisaient le plus l'agence qu'ils allaient servir. Cette sorte de mantra déconstructionniste, où vous voulez faire comprendre à quel point vous dévalorisez le travail et le personnel d'une agence particulière.

Cox: Je ne pense pas que cela soit comparable à ce qui s'est passé au Memorial Wall, mais le président est venu à l'EPA en mars, et le jour de sa visite, ils ont transmis une note à l'ensemble du personnel. Ils ont appelé l'événement «Notre grand jour». Et la note disait que le président allait essentiellement éliminer tout le progrès qui avait été accompli dans la lutte contre le changement climatique sous Obama. C'était ça «Notre grand jour»?

McGowan: Pourquoi «notre»? À qui faisaient-ils référence?

Cox: Un autre élément qui semble ressortir dans chacune de nos expériences c'est le fait qu'il s'agit de personnes qui se moquent des autres opinions. À de nombreuses occasions, ils ont demandé des informations sur une question spécifique en indiquant qu'il y aurait une réunion de suivi. Mais ces réunions n'ont jamais eu lieu. À chaque fois que le moment de la prise de décision arrivait, Pruitt et ses collaborateurs les plus proches n'en faisaient qu'à leurs têtes, et ça s'arrêtait là. Et l'EPA est une organisation scientifique! On est censés attacher de l'importance aux faits! Même sous le gouvernement Bush ce n'était pas comme ça.

Price: Le point commun qui me frappe c'est que je crois que personne ici n'a cherché à se retrouver dans cette position. Je veux dire qu'en ce qui me concerne, j'adorais mon travail. J'étais plus que satisfait à l'idée de rester un bureaucrate jusqu'à la fin de mes jours. Et franchement, j'espère revenir dans la fonction publique lorsque tout sera rentré dans l'ordre.

Shaub: Je crois encore une fois que mon expérience est légèrement différente, ou en tout cas ma vision. Je me préoccupe moins des points de vue sur la politique. Ma grande préoccupation concerne davantage ce que j'appelle «le récipient». Je vois les structures de notre forme de gouvernement représentatif comme un récipient, et les politiques sont simplement ce que vous mettez à l'intérieur.

Ce qui m'a le plus affecté, c'est l'attaque sur le récipient. Lorsque vous avez un président qui conserve ses intérêts financiers, même si vous le soutenez, vous ne pouvez pas savoir sur quoi reposent ses décisions. Et ça devient particulièrement grave lorsque vous le voyez encenser Erdogan après qu'il se soit emparé des pleins pouvoirs, ou inviter le meurtrier Duterte à Washington, alors qu'il possède des biens immobiliers en Turquie et aux Philippines.

Mais le point commun que je remarque c'est le refus de se fier aux experts. À l'OGE, nous nous considérions comme des acteurs dans le domaine des solutions. Alors revenons aux intérêts financiers du président. J'ai dit à plusieurs reprises qu'il devait les vendre. Mais même s'il ne voulait pas les vendre, on aurait pu trouver d'autres solutions qui auraient permis de limiter les dégâts, en annonçant par exemple qu'aucun représentant de l'administration ne participerait à un événement organisé dans un établissement possédé par Trump ou affichant son nom. Cela aurait pu empêcher le Koweït et Bahreïn et d'autres pays d'y organiser des événements, parce qu'ils auraient su qu'aucun employé de la Maison-Blanche n'aurait franchi la porte. On aurait aussi pu lui recommander de respecter les précédents en matière de népotisme au lieu d'obtenir du département de la Justice un changement de sa position sur le népotisme vieille d'une décennie.

Alors lorsque la Maison-Blanche me dénigrera en disant que j'essayais de les saboter, la vérité c'est que s'ils avaient suivi mes recommandations, ils en seraient ressortis plus forts.

Walter Shaub, Mike Cox, Edward Price et Sharon McGowan à Washington, le 10 octobre 2017.

Walt, j'ai entendu que vous aviez une liste de vérification mentale qui vous a aidé à prendre une décision quant à votre démission.

Shaub: Oui, c'est une liste de vérification en trois parties que j'ai recommandée à d'autres. La première question à se poser c'est: «Puis-je accomplir la mission efficacement?» Ensuite: «Puis-je accomplir mon travail éthiquement et moralement?» Et enfin: «Puis-je dire la vérité?» Je n'ai certainement jamais eu peur de dire la vérité. J'ai eu l'impression d'accomplir ma mission de manière éthique et morale, mais j'ai atteint un point où je ne pensais plus pouvoir remplir ma mission efficacement. Je n'ai cessé de me poser cette question chaque mois. Et pendant plusieurs mois, je suis resté parce que tout n'était pas perdu.

Par exemple, malgré toutes ces histoires de déplacements en jet privé, (il fait référence à l'allergie manifeste aux vols commerciaux dont souffrent certains membres du gouvernement, ndlr) ce dont vous n'entendez pas parler ce sont les conflits d'intérêts financiers de certains membres, et c'est grâce à l'OGE qui a réussi à accomplir sa mission malgré un manque de soutien de la Maison-Blanche. J'ai en fait discuté personnellement avec un candidat qui était extrêmement riche et extrêmement brillant et je lui ai dit: «Vous avez bâti votre gloire et votre fortune grâce à vos talents d'habile négociateur, mais la pire chose qui pourrait vous arriver maintenant c'est d'employer ce talent et de réussir à me faire reculer.» À la fin, il a accepté de céder la majorité de ses possessions, ce qui représentait pour lui un fardeau considérable. Et je le félicite pour cette démarche.

Certains membres du gouvernement se sont montrés bien plus hostiles. Mais en fin de compte, devoir négocier avec eux faisait partie de notre travail et nous avions trouvé des alliés en la personne de leurs propres avocats privés qui leur expliquaient que nos propositions étaient la bonne chose à faire. Nous avons aussi remporté une victoire en obtenant les dispenses au code d'éthique que la Maison-Blanche distribuait (les dispenses autorisent les employés du gouvernement à contourner certaines exigences d'éthique, et l'administration Trump en distribuait en secret, ndlr). Ils nous ont attaqués très publiquement pendant un mois en nous demandant de ne pas les publier, mais la pression publique a porté ses fruits.

Malgré cela, la plus grosse surprise est arrivée lorsque j'ai vu les dérogations de mes propres yeux. De nombreuses dérogations n'étaient pas signées, n'étaient pas datées ou étaient explicitement ou implicitement rétroactives. Bien sûr, si vous avez besoin d'une dérogation rétroactive, cela signifie que vous avez enfreint une règle. De plus, deux des dérogations avaient été remises à un groupe d'employés qui semblait inclure l'auteur de la dérogation. Il est possible que cette personne se soit attribué elle-même une dérogation.

C'est à ce moment-là que j'ai réalisé que ces gens étaient capables de tout. Et ils avaient aussi commencé à s'adapter à mes prises de parole en public sur ces manquements à l'éthique en coupant simplement les ponts avec l'OGE. Je me suis retrouvé dans une situation où j'aurais dû certifier un certain nombre de rapports de transparence financière de la Maison-Blanche sans savoir ce que les candidats faisaient dans la vie. Alors j'ai eu peur de ne devenir qu'une façade pour dissimuler la corruption.

Quels sont vos rapports avec vos anciens collègues aujourd'hui ?

McGowan: Depuis que je suis partie, j'ai reçu de nombreux e-mails de gens – pas uniquement mes collègues de la division des droits civiques, mais aussi des personnes contre lesquelles je me suis battue – qui disaient: «Je suis tellement heureux que tu fasses ce que tu fais.» Il y avait tellement de gens qui voulaient partir... Mais c'est une décision tellement difficile et personnelle. Certains employés sont la principale source de revenus de la famille. Pour d'autres, il y a cette crainte de ne pas savoir qui prendrait leur place. Certaines personnes disent avoir presque l'impression de se noyer. Pendant combien de temps vais-je réussir à retenir mon souffle et à tenir bon, parce que je veux pouvoir rassembler les morceaux lorsque tout cela sera fini?

Lorsque je leur parle de ma décision, c'est vraiment avec tristesse et une grande délicatesse pour ne pas donner l'impression de m'être sentie supérieure. Je savais simplement que mon travail et ma passion seraient mieux employés en adoptant une attitude de résistance. J'ai aussi conscience d'être très privilégiée. Puisque je sais que des gens qui sont toujours à l'intérieur luttent pour conserver leur intégrité et leur fierté dans leur travail, je crois que c'est vraiment important de les encourager et de leur faire comprendre qu'ils ne trahissent pas ce qui est juste et bon dans le monde.

Price: Je me suis retrouvé dans une position similaire. Lorsque je me préparais à annoncer ma démission, je n'étais pas vraiment préoccupé par la réaction qu'auraient les trolls sur Twitter ou les membres du gouvernement actuel. J'avais surtout peur que mes anciens collègues ne croient que je me pensais supérieur.

Alors ça m'a vraiment réconforté d'apprendre qu'ils me considéraient toujours comme un membre à part entière de l'équipe. Ils me voient toujours comme quelqu'un qui, de bien des façons, continue à défendre leurs intérêts.

McGowan: J'ai cette théorie amusante selon laquelle il suffit de regarder les profils de réseaux sociaux des gens pour savoir s'ils sont en recherche d'emploi. Lorsqu'ils ont un peu plus de culot que d'habitude, je me dis: «Oh, il a sûrement obtenu un second entretien.» En revanche, lorsque les gens sont plus nombreux à me demander de servir de référence, j'ai peur qu'un obstacle ne les pousse par-dessus bord. Généralement, il me faut un certain temps pour identifier cet obstacle.

Shaub: Pour moi, ça a été plus brutal. J'ai travaillé avec ces gens pendant quinze ans, et bien que je sois théoriquement autorisé à leur parler, j'ai peur qu'une photo de moi en train de déjeuner avec eux ne se retrouve dans le journal et que je sois accusé à tort de discuter du fond. Alors je suis resté à l'écart. C'est l'aspect humain: ils me manquent vraiment.

Cox: J'ai une question. Est-ce que des gens vous contactent depuis votre organisation et vous demandent de l'aide pour amplifier une cause ou une autre?

Price: Mes anciens collègues se trouvent dans une position délicate parce qu'ils sont au courant d'informations confidentielles auxquelles je n'ai plus accès. Bien sûr, ils ne m'ont pas divulgué d'informations secrètes mais ils ont abordé des questions plus générales, comme le moral des employés au sein de la communauté du renseignement, ce qui se passe au niveau du personnel du Conseil de la sécurité nationale, ainsi que le chaos qui continue de régner à la Maison-Blanche.

Ce qui me frappe, c'est ce climat de paranoïa. Personne ne me contactera en m'envoyant simplement un SMS ou en me téléphonant. Tout le monde commence une conversation en me demandant si j'utilise Signal, ou si je suis sur WhatsApp. Choisissez votre service chiffré. Ce qui est drôle c'est qu'ils me poseront cette question et le jour suivant je recevrai un message de leur part sur Signal du type: «Salut, comment ça va ? Je voulais juste prendre de tes nouvelles.»

Shaub: Ils discutent juste de choses personnelles?

Price: Exactement. Ils ne révèlent aucune information classée secrète ou confidentielle.

McGowan: Mais on a le sentiment que même le simple fait d'être vu avec quelqu'un qui est parti est effrayant.

Avez-vous au moins eu l'occasion d'échanger des blagues douteuses avant de partir?

McGowan: La semaine qui a suivi l'élection, j'ai écrit un e-mail à un ami de la branche des droits civiques – quelqu'un avec qui je m'étais déjà disputée – et je lui ai demandé s'il rafraîchissait ses connaissances sur le Korematsu (L'arrêt controversé rendu par la Cour suprême qui a autorisé le gouvernement américain à incarcérer des Japonais-américains dans des camps d'internement pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, ndlr). Et il m'a répondu: «Ce n'est pas drôle.» Et j'ai dit: «Je sais que ce n'est pas drôle!»

Walter Shaub, Edward Price, Sharon McGowan et Mike Cox.

Je me demande si tout cela aura un effet dissuasif sur les jeunes aspirant à une carrière dans la fonction publique.

McGowan: J'ai toujours chanté les louanges de la fonction publique en expliquant à quel point c'est puissant, surtout en ce qui me concerne. À chaque fois que quelqu'un parlait du gouvernement comme de l'Homme («The Man», expression désignant le système ou l'autorité en anglais, ndlr), je plaisantais toujours en disant qu'apparemment, l'Homme était une lesbienne d'un mètre soixante originaire du Queens. Alors si je peux être l'Homme, n'importe qui peut l'être.

Mais désormais, c'est bien plus difficile pour moi de convaincre les gens que le service fédéral est l'endroit où ils pourront ressentir le même sentiment d'épanouissement que j'ai éprouvé lorsque j'y étais. Savoir que le pouvoir du gouvernement fédéral est utilisé pour causer tellement de tort – pour déchirer des familles, pour cautionner la discrimination – ça me semble maladroit d'essayer de vendre le service fédéral à un membre de l'une des communautés qui sont victimes des abus. J'attends avec impatience le jour où tout cela appartiendra à l'histoire ancienne.

Shaub: Et bien, j'ai toujours peur de cet effet dissuasif. Je veux saisir cette opportunité pour encourager les jeunes à rejoindre la fonction publique. Et la fonction publique se présente sous de nombreuses formes. Il y a l'administration des états et les autorités locales, les associations à but non lucratif et bien sûr, le gouvernement fédéral, que je recommande toujours fortement. Les jeunes qui arrivent vont se retrouver aux niveaux inférieurs et seront isolés de la majorité des bouleversements. En même temps, ils se retrouvent avec des responsabilités importantes à un très jeune âge. Et ils peuvent faire une différence en essayant d'apporter des services de base à la nation.

La fonction publique est vraiment gratifiante. J'ai encore des prêts étudiants à rembourser alors heureusement que c'est gratifiant.

Accanto a un divanetto, a qualche metro dall'ingresso dell'Aula, c'è Dario Franceschini, attorniato da un pugno dei suoi. Dall'altra parte del largo corridoio depositario di intrecci e chiacchiericci di Montecitorio, Pier Luigi Bersani, mani in tasca, parla con Roberto Speranza. I due sorridono, l'atteggiamento è rilassato. Tutto nella norma. Non fosse per il fatto che il ministro della Cultura e i deputati a lui vicini stanno conversando fitto fitto con Nico Stumpo. Che oltre a essere uno dei deputati di Mdp più vicini a Bersani, è anche il cervellone che supervisiona le liste, gli incastri, soppesa i voti potenziali, analizza, indirizza candidature e truppe.

Qualche minuto dopo arriva sornione un alto dirigente di Articolo 1, sorride: ""Il Pd ci ha già offerto tre ministeri e quattro cammelli, scrivilo"". Si sorride, si scambiano due parole. Ma prima di andarsene a mezza bocca lascia cadere: ""La cosa dei ministeri non è del tutto una battuta"". Scene da presepe preelettorale. Riannodiamo il filo. Il Pd va male in Sicilia. Mdp malino, ma con il risultato scarno dei Dem se a livello nazionale si proiettasse una situazione simile, il loro pacchetto di voti risulterebbe determinante in molti collegi uninominali. Tradotto: poltrone in più, poltrone salvate e non perse. In tutta risposta dal giorno dopo Matteo Renzi ricomincia con la sua strategia d'attacco. Partire dalla palese sfida a un largo pezzo del suo partito sui vitalizi. E qui parte il panico.

""Quello che devi capire è che noi non è che abbiamo il terrore, abbiamo la certezza che così andiamo a sbattere"". Un deputato di una delle regioni rosse spiega che tra i suoi colleghi è iniziata a serpeggiare come mai prima la paura di non essere eletti: ""Più Renzi torna protagonista, più il consenso scende"". Si rincorrono i capannelli nei corridoi. Gli uomini di Franceschini rimangono molto prudenti, quelli di Orlando ponderano mosse più decise, stasera faranno un punto della situazione. ""La verità è che Dario la sua carriera politica l'ha fatta – spiega uno degli uomini vicini al ministro della Giustizia – Andrea no. Andrea se non dà un segnale, se si fa fagocitare, politicamente è finito"".

La questione è assai spinosa. Perché un conto è chiedere un cambio di passo, alzare il tiro per cercare di farlo abbassare a Renzi. Un altro è superare quella sottile linea rossa che porterebbe Renzi allo strappo finale. Quello che prevede che ""il segretario sono io e i posti li stabilisco io"".

""Se arriviamo a quel punto – spiega un onorevole orlandiano – si rompono tutte le cose"". E, attenzione, ""diventerebbe fisiologico andarsene"". Lo spettro di un'altra scissione all'orizzonte. La battaglia per la linea del partito. E, su tutto, il terrore per una poltrona sempre più labile sotto le terga. Un clima da fine impero, dove tutti sono contro tutti e tutti cercano tutti. Ad Agorà, su RaiTre, la renziana Simona Malpezzi gettava ramoscelli d'ulivo a Nicola Fratoianni: ""In fondo abbiamo gli stessi valori"". A due passi dal cortile di Montecitorio la bizzarra scena di una lunga e animata discussione tra Alfredo D'Attorre e Alessandro Di Battista. Quest'ultimo minimizza: ""Si parlava della situazione generale"". Appunto, vi cercano: ""Tutti ci cercano"". Lapidario. Non è un mistero che i bersaniani siano guardati con interesse dagli uomini di Grillo. Nel caso non si chiudesse un accordo a sinistra, dai loro voti in Parlamento potrebbe passare la concreta realizzazione di un governo a 5 stelle.

""Perché Renzi sta forzando la mano per non dare spazio di manovra a nessuno – spiega un deputato della minoranza interna del Pd – ma così la situazione diventa pericolosa"". Il dato di fatto è che senza il premio di maggioranza del Porcellum la quota di deputati Dem che faranno un altro giro di giostra fisiologicamente sarà minore. Figuriamoci se le percentuali raggiunte dal Pd saranno deludenti. Così il corpaccione del partito lancia battute trasversali agli scissionisti, li blandisce, quasi che una trattativa potesse essere fatta dai peones attorno a una ciotola di mandorle tostate alla buvette. Ma la situazione è disperata, e le reazioni estemporanee sono all'ordine del giorno. Perché, spiega un uomo vicino a Orlando ""se non li inglobi in una coalizione nel maggioritario al nord e al sud non hai speranze, ti rimane giusto qualcosa al centro"". E' proprio un deputato renziano che mette già le carte: ""Noi tra Camera e Senato siamo 400. E' fisiologico che la domanda di questi giorni sia come ritornare qui dentro"".

Molti onorevoli del Lazio e della Lombardia stanno valutando di spostarsi alla Pisana o al Pirellone. In primavera si rinnoveranno i consigli regionali, e per chi ha le preferenze potrebbe essere un accettabile piano B, perché, spiega un deputato laziale, ""qui siamo prigionieri di Renzi, che ha potere su tutte le liste e non si capisce cosa voglia fare, niente è più sicuro"".

Nel clima da fine legislatura, tutto d'un tratto, in parlamento si materializza l'ex ministro aennino Mario Landolfi. Poco più in là solca il Transatlantico con passo sicuro il già ministro dell'Udc Mario Baccini, signore delle preferenze a Roma e dintorni. Poi ecco Davide Barbato, l'eccentrico deputato anti-casta dell'Italia dei Valori, prima che tutto cambiasse, prima che il brand lo rilevasse la pattuglia 5 stelle.

Passano quasi inosservati tra i drappelli di deputati che si interrogano sul 2% nel collegio tal dei tali, che insistono che ""così ci suicidiamo, Matteo se non apre alla coalizione si va a frantumare, e noi con lui"", che chiosano laconici: ""Siamo incastrati, è un bordello"".

Speaking to reporters Wednesday in Hanoi, Vietnam, Trudeau said he's accepted assurances by Stephen Bronfman that he has followed all the rules.

In a statement this week after the release of the so-called ""Paradise Papers,"" Bronfman said he never funded nor used offshore trusts, and that all his Canadian trusts have paid all federal taxes on their income.

Trudeau's made his comments in response to a question asking why Bronfman, also a close friend of the prime minister, appeared to still be in his position as a key Liberal fundraiser.

The prime minister did not directly answer the question about Bronfman's role in the party, nor would he say his friend's name in his response.

'We are satisfied'

""In regards to the specific case you mentioned, we have received assurances that all rules were followed, indeed the same assurances made in the public statement released by the family, and we are satisfied with those assurances,"" Trudeau said during a news conference inside Vietnam's presidential palace.

""We have done much in regards to tax avoidance and tax evasion, including working with international partners.

""But we also recognize there is much more to do and you can rest assured that Canada Revenue Agency will take very seriously its responsibility to go after everyone and anyone involved in tax avoidance and tax evasion.""

Tax avoidance measures involving offshore trusts are legal, provided that the trust is genuinely managed offshore and that Canadian taxes are paid on any Canadian contributions. And there may be other legitimate reasons for setting up an offshore account, including if you're a contractor doing work in a particular country.

The Liberal Party of Canada's chief fundraiser, Stephen Bronfman, attends the party's caucus retreat in Georgetown, P.E.I. on Aug. 28, 2013.

Still, the questions around Bronfman gave political foes fresh ammunition to accuse Trudeau of leading an ethically-challenged government.

In his statement, Bronfman said he made a single loan to the trust on an arm's-length, fully commercial basis some 25 years ago that was repaid five months later, a transaction that was fully in compliance with Canadian law.

The name of former Liberal prime minister Jean Chretien also appeared in the 13.4 million leaked documents, in a register of investors in Madagascar Oil. It lists Chretien as having received 100,000 stock options.

In a brief statement of his own, Chretien said Madagascar Oil was a client of Heenan Blaikie, a now-defunct Canadian law firm. As a lawyer with the firm, Chretien said he did some work for Madagascar Oil, but all fees were billed by and paid to the law firm itself.

""I never received any share options and I never had a bank account outside Canada,"" Chretien said.

Negli ultimi cinque anni molte cose sono state fatte, ma l'agenda verde deve ora diventare l'architrave della visione strategica e del profilo identitario del Partito democratico, da realizzarsi attraverso azioni concrete al centro del prossimo programma elettorale.

Per questo mi sento di sottoscrivere le 10 proposte avanzate dalla Fondazione sviluppo sostenibile, nella consapevolezza che la loro realizzazione impone scelte politiche e di allocazione di risorse finanziarie conseguenti.

Tra i punti programmatici indicati mi soffermerei in particolare sulla necessità di fare della sfida climatica l'occasione per rinnovare il sistema energetico, rilanciando rinnovabili ed efficienza anche attraverso l'istituzione di un fondo nazionale per la transizione energetica, eventualmente alimentato anche da una carbon tax progressiva e da una graduale riallocazione dei sussidi dannosi per l'ambiente.

Fondamentale poi l'idea di puntare sull'economia circolare, superando in tal modo modelli di sviluppo basati sullo sperpero delle risorse e impegnandosi nella prevenzione sulla produzione dei rifiuti. Per perseguire questi obiettivi è necessario rafforzare la responsabilità estesa dei produttori. Ancora: bene l'attivazione di un piano nazionale per la rigenerazione urbana, supportato da strumenti economici e fiscali innovativi; i cambiamenti nella mobilità urbana, riducendo il numero di auto private attraverso una accessibilità diffusa ai mezzi condivisi e pubblici e anche ricorrendo a misure drastiche quali il divieto di immatricolazione di auto diesel e benzina al 2030.

E infine irrinunciabili l'approvazione della legge sullo stop al consumo di suolo e una riforma della fiscalità in chiave green, per accompagnare il mercato verso processi, prodotti e servizi a basse emissioni e ad alta efficienza nell'uso delle risorse, riallocando le agevolazioni dannose per l'ambiente.

Il dibattito seguito alle recenti elezioni siciliane ha reso evidente quanto la creazione di un campo ampio di centrosinistra sia la strada da percorrere subito per il Partito democratico. Sono convinta che sui temi della Green Economy e di un nuovo modello di sviluppo si possa trovare il terreno fertile di confronto con le altre forze di centrosinistra allargando la nostra capacità di dialogare al civismo e alle giovani generazioni.Il tempo dei tatticismi è finito e la strada verde è quella maestra.",La green economy sia architrave del programma Pd,http://www.huffingtonpost.it/silvia-velo/la-green-economy-sia-architrave-del-programma-pd_a_23269903/

Tatsächlich will Präsident Erdogan bis 2021 ein türkisches Auto auf den Markt bringen

""Die Deutschen sind in Panik"", glaubt die türkische Tageszeitung ""Günes"". Der Grund: Die Regierung von Präsident Recep Tayyip Erdogan plant, ein in der Türkei produziertes Auto Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen. Spätestens 2021 sollen fünf heimische Unternehmen im Verbund das Elektroauto auf den Markt bringen.

Die Erdogan-nahe Zeitung ""Günes"" zeigte in ihrer Sonntagsausgabe Angela Merkel auf der Titelseite. ""Schau, wie wir das machen"", lautete die große Überschrift in schwarzen und roten Lettern. Die deutschen Medien hätten eine ""Schmutzkampagne"" gestartet, aus Angst vor dem neuen Konkurrenten auf dem Automobilmarkt, so der Vorwurf der Zeitung.

Tatsächlich hatten mehrere deutsche Medien in der vergangenen Woche über Erdogans Auto-Projekt berichtet.

Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, Leiter des Center Automotive Research (CAR) der Universität Duisburg-Essen, sagte der ""Welt"", das türkische Projekt sei ""Harakiri"". Es sei schade um das Geld, mindestens eine halbe Milliarde Euro werde ""einfach verbrannt"".

Schlechte Chancen für das Erdo-Car

Das größte Problem an dem Projekt: Im vergangenen Jahr seien in der Türkei lediglich 760.000 Autos verkauft worden. Zum Vergleich: In Deutschland gab es im gleichen Jahr 3,4 Millionen Neuzulassungen. Der heimische Markt alleine bietet somit nur bescheidene Absatzmöglichkeiten.

Bislang gibt es wenige Details über das türkische Auto, dessen Prototyp im Jahr 2019 fertiggestellt werden soll. Offenbar könnte es auf dem Aufbau des Saab 9-3 basieren, den die türkische Regierung im Jahr 2015 von der schwedischen Holdinggesellschaft National Electric Vehicle Sweden erworben hat.

Ob das der deutschen Industrie tatsächlich Sorgen bereitet, bleibt fraglich. Denn keines der fünf türkischen Unternehmen des Konsortiums verfügt über Erfahrungen beim Autobau.

Tech Pack fue la primera colección de Nike que protagonizó Rose. Ahora regresa con Nocturne, una colección de calzado para mujeres.

En las plantas de los tenis están grabados los mantras de la actriz: Become your own hero"" (Conviértete en tu propio héroe) y ""With full force"" (Con toda la fuerza).

La colección presenta distintas variaciones de piel Port Wine, puntuada por acentos de goma color verde azulado y una entresuela neutra y ligera.

Disponibilidad en México: La colección está disponible desde el 27 de octubre en Nike.com y en las tiendas Taf, Lust Masaryk, Lust Roma, Soul, Alive, 99 problems y Barrio Warrior.

Entrevista con Ruby Rose

Entrevistador: ¿Cómo comparas el expresarte creativamente en movimiento y entrenar con la creatividad actoral?

Ruby Rose: Creo que lo físico ha estado presente en la mayor parte de mi trabajo, incluso Pitch Perfect, todo lo que he hecho ha requerido algún tipo de entrenamiento físico. Ha sido un proceso interno y te haces tan vulnerable y te rompes tanto como cuando se trata de actuar. Siempre ha sido parte del objetivo al que me dirijo; ser la más fuerte, o la mejor francotiradora, o la asesina más rápida, la peleadora más veloz, una buena cantante, etcétera.

Y eso es lo mágico de actuar. La sensación es divertida y gratificante porque consigues algo que han finalizado. Y después las cosas que son desafiantes, nuevas y emocionantes implican una lucha por la cual hay que trabajar más duro. Pero terminas con un sentimiento de realización.

E: ¿Qué te hace sentir el punto más alto de un buen entrenamiento?

RR: Siento que un buen entrenamiento es como la meditación. Te lleva a una zona en tu cabeza. Mis amigos suelen correr, y es el deporte que menos practico. Me encanta correr en intervalos y me encanta presionarme tanto como pueda cuando corro, y después hago pesas. Correr o caminar durante 3 horas no es necesariamente mi actividad favorita, al menos que sea en exteriores.

Pero lo que me encanta es que empiezas a pensar en tu cabeza, 'Oh, esto duele' o 'no soy capaz', o 'no soy tan capaz como pensé', o '¿Cuánto más? ¿Aún me falta otra hora? Hoy tuve que trabajar hasta tarde. ¿Comí? ¿Dejé la cafetera prendida?', y ese tipo de cosas. Después terminas en un estado feliz y meditativo en el que ya no estás pensando en nada. Estás pensando en tus músculos y en lo que estuviste haciendo en ese entrenamiento y en tu coordinación. Estás súper concentrado que es casi como la meditación.

E: ¿Cómo te mantienes motivada físicamente para ti misma y después para actuar? ¿Qué te motiva a seguir superándote?

RR: Creo que es más fácil mantenerte motivado cuando se trata del cine. Tengo un objetivo directo -de la misma manera que cuando boxeaba-. Sabía que se acercaba una competencia, tenía mucho más impulso, mucha más determinación, más energía. Me levantaba más temprano. Simplemente vivía y respiraba para eso.

E: ¿Tienes algún entrenamiento no tradicional que la gente no se imagine? Algo que hagas y consideres no tradicional.

RR: Estoy realmente involucrada con las artes marciales, el box y el Jiu Jitsu. Recientemente aprendí combate con cuchillo. Ese tipo de entrenamiento no es tan tradicional como las clases de aeróbic o de spinning.

Todos tienen algo que saca lo mejor de ellos. Ese tipo de entrenamiento siempre ha sido el más divertido para mí y saca lo mejor de mí. Me encanta nadar porque soy piscis, nací en el agua y soy australiana, así que puedo ir a la playa y surfear o ir a patinar, y son distintos entrenamientos, pero me encantan todos por igual.

Practiqué un poco de Pole Dance una vez porque un amigo mío me retó a hacerlo. Yo dije 'está bien, lo haré. No debe ser tan difícil'. Fue probablemente la cosa más complicada que he intentado en mi vida.

E: ¿Qué papel juegan los entrenadores en tu rutina y qué buscas particularmente en un entrenador?

RR: Creo que lo que busco en un entrenador no es tanto la motivación para durar cierto tiempo o hacer cierta cantidad de repeticiones. Realmente busco la parte educacional de las cosas. Tengo una mala espalda baja que se puede inflamar cuando boxeo y también mis pequeñas muñecas se inflaman con el box. Tengo a alguien que me ayuda a fortalecer mi espalda baja de la manera correcta. Usamos muchas cuerdas, bandas y el mismo peso corporal para hacer ejercicios.

E: ¿Cuáles son tus cinco siluetas favoritas de Nike?

RR: ¿Sabes cuáles son los primeros Nike que me compré? Los Nike Shox. No crecí con dinero como para comprarme un calzado cool para entrenar, pero después tuve un trabajo, fui a la tienda y compré los Nike Shox. Estaba obsesionada con ellos.

Y siempre me han gustado los Air Max y estaba obsesionada con la cápsula de aire. Soy fan del Air Force 1 y el nuevo SF Air Force 1. Antes tenía los antiguos Air Force 1 en un par de colores, pero creo que los compré en tiendas económicas. Sé que los compré ahí porque recuerdo haber pagado alrededor de 25 dólares. Sí, una ganga total.","Ruby Rose para Nike: ""un buen entrenamiento es como la meditación""",http://www.huffingtonpost.com.mx/2017/11/06/ruby-rose-para-nike-un-buen-entrenamiento-es-como-la-meditacion_a_23268361/

While lots of us like to think we would leave without a second thought, the reality of life and being invested in your partner - marriage, children, a shared home and future plans - means it isn’t always so black and white.

For most people in a relationship , finding out that your partner has cheated seems like the worst thing that could possibly happen. But often the hardest part isn’t the revelation itself, it is working out what to do next.

1. Don’t try to talk until you’ve calmed down.

In the immediate aftermath of your discovery, you are of course going to be angry. And while you shouldn’t hold back in sharing this anger with your partner, you should also be cautious about saying things in the heat of the moment that you cannot unsay, or you may live to regret when you’re not seeing red.

Sex and relationship expert Tracey Cox, tells HuffPost UK: “Delay the discussion until you’ve both calmed down. Talking while you’re furious accomplishes little more than saying hurtful things you may regret later. And work out exactly what you want to say beforehand.”

2. Give yourself some space.

When your trust in your partner is shattered, and everything you thought you had seems to have dissolved around you, it can be tempting to overcompensate by spending all your time together and not letting them out of your sight.

But in order to get some perspective on your relationship together, it is important to give yourself some space to think things through.

Sarah Ryan, a relationships expert and director of her own matchmaking agency, says: “If you really want to find a way to make your relationship work you’ll have to give yourself some space to work out what you truly want, what it is that you’re feeling and healing all the hurts that come with cheating - ensure to really practise the art of letting go to save yourself holding onto animosity.”

And Vasia Toxavidi, a psychotherapist and counsellor with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, agrees: “Some controlling may take place by the partner who has been cheated on due to loss of trust, but it is important for that person to focus and take care of themselves.”

3. Ask yourself if you are capable of total forgiveness.

During this time when you are giving yourself space, the most important question you should be asking yourself is whether you are capable of totally forgiving your partner - this is the only way this is going to work (holding a grudge doesn’t help anyone).

Cox says: “Some relationship crimes hurt us more than others because of our backgrounds and family history. Cheating is harder to forgive for someone who has a history of partners who’ve been unfaithful or whose parents had a painful split. Forgiveness is the first step, learning to trust again is the next.

“How will you know if they’ve done it again? Did you see the signs the last time? Has something significant changed to ensure they won’t do it again?”

And Ryan agrees: “Without fully forgiving your partner after they have been unfaithful then you run the risk of harbouring negative energy and feelings which will come out in the wash when resistance or minor conflicts naturally occur within a relationship.”

4. Start by working on a basic friendship.

Expecting your relationship to go back to how it was before is probably naive, so instead of jumping back into your old roles straight away, try having a basic friendship that focuses on trust and respect.

Ryan says: “You need to rediscover an understanding of each other as friends first and foremost before you can move forward romantically, at the end of the day thats how every relationship develops because you date and become romantically involved with your best friend.

“Really understanding when and how you may have stopped being friends can help you interpret when respect may have left your relationship.”",7 Tips If You’re Trying To Stay With Your Partner After They Cheated,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/staying-with-partner-after-they-cheated-how-to_uk_5a01cbd0e4b066c2c03a4c08

""Abbiamo 97mila impiegati, la maggior parte dei nostri competitor alla pari hanno circa la metà della nostra forza lavoro"", ha dichiarato Cryan.

A single mother will be £2,236 worse off under the government’s Universal Credit benefit than they would have been if Labour’s tax credit system had been left in place, research published on Monday has revealed. According to the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG), the government’s flagship benefits reform is a “colossal failure” that will leave a generation of children “scarred” by austerity. The analysis, conducted with the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), also calculated that one million more children are likely to be in poverty in 2020 as a result of cuts to the new benefit programme. According to the data, the freezes and cuts to Universal Credit work allowances will leave lone parents worse off by, on average, £710 a year, couples £250 a year. And a single parent already working full time on the national living wage would have to work an extra 41 days a year to make up for the losses suffered as a result of the cuts.

Theresa May is under pressure from backbench Tory MPs as well as the Labour Party to pause the roll-out of the system - or make significant changes to how Universal Credit operates. The new benefit system, the brainchild of Iain Duncan Smith, combines six of the main welfare benefits into a single payment. It is designed to both simplify the system and encourage people back into work. David Cameron promised in 2009 in his party conference speech that Duncan Smith was the “one person this party can rely on” to tackle child poverty. But Alison Garnham, the chief executive, of CPAG, said today that pledge “has been broken”.","Universal Credit Leaving Children 'Scarred' By Poverty, Warns Think-Tank",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/universal-credit-leaving-children-scarred-by-poverty-warns-think-tank_uk_59ff3f34e4b0baea26324bcf?9ok&utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage

On affirme souvent que ces jeunes narcissiques ont des attentes irréalistes, qu'ils considèrent que tout leur est dû. Peut-être avez-vous entendu dire que leur personnalité est difficile à gérer, ou qu'ils ne fournissent pas un effort aussi soutenu que leurs prédécesseurs.

En ce moment, la plupart des emplois au bas de l'échelle sont occupés par des milléniaux, et malgré ce que vous pouvez avoir lu à leur sujet, ils peuvent être d'excellents employés. Personnellement, j'ai dû recruter, former et congédier des équipes complètes au sein de grandes entreprises nationales, et je constate que le meilleur et le pire se retrouvent partout. Autrement dit, certains milléniaux sont incompétents, mais la plupart d'entre eux font du bon boulot.

En testant votre patience, les milléniaux vous encourageront à devenir un meilleur gestionnaire.

Étant né entre la Génération X et celle du Millénaire, je ne corresponds à aucun de ces groupes. Mais peu importe les noms trouvés pour désigner ma tranche d'âge, je me considère bien placé pour comprendre les deux générations qui m'entourent. Mes collègues de la Génération X sont souvent frustrés par le comportement de leurs jeunes employés, alors voici mon conseil : au lieu de considérer les milléniaux comme des gens narcissiques et suffisants, vous devez les considérer comme des gens motivés qui exigent ce qu'il y a de mieux. Vous devez ensuite tirer profit de ce trait de caractère. En testant votre patience, les milléniaux vous encourageront à devenir un meilleur gestionnaire. Il faut envisager cette situation comme un défi et savoir le relever.

Ne soyez pas un mauvais gestionnaire

Les mauvais patrons sont légion. Je ne veux pas dire par là qu'ils sont de mauvaises personnes, mais qu'ils ont eux-mêmes eu de mauvais supérieurs dont ils reproduisent les comportements désagréables. Leur attitude consiste à traiter leurs employés comme des outils, en leur confiant des tâches qui doivent être accomplies telles que prescrites. Un ordre est un ordre, alors ces jeunes ne devraient-ils pas faire exactement ce qu'on leur dit de faire?

Cette méthode basée sur la force brute vous permettra d'atteindre un certain nombre d'objectifs. En revanche, votre équipe n'atteindra jamais son plein potentiel. Son moral sera très bas et le roulement du personnel demeurera élevé.

Vos employés ne sont pas des robots. Vous en tirerez le meilleur s'ils ont une mission leur permettant d'acquérir un sentiment de réussite. Si la vie ne consistait qu'à donner des ordres, pourquoi les forces armées chercheraient-elles à remonter le moral des troupes? Pourquoi insisteraient-elles sur le sens du devoir? Même dans cette carrière où désobéir aux ordres vous mène en prison, les hauts gradés tentent de motiver leurs subalternes, car c'est la meilleure manière d'atteindre de bons résultats.

Faites de votre équipe une partie intégrante de la mission à accomplir. Vos employés ne tarderont pas à redoubler d'efforts. Essayez de comprendre ce qui les motive et accompagnez-les dans l'atteinte de leurs objectifs personnels. C'est ainsi que vous pourrez tirer profit de leur ambition et de leur créativité débordante. Et surtout, ne négligez pas l'importance d'une simple dégustation de pizza lorsqu'un jalon important est franchi.

La plus grande différence entre les employés de la Génération X et les milléniaux a trait à leurs attentes envers le marché du travail. L'employé de la Génération X se satisfait d'un chèque de paie régulier dans un monde où règne une concurrence féroce. Or, les Milléniaux rejettent cette notion de stabilité. Ils n'ont pas peur d'être sans emploi (ce qui est le cas pour un nombre record d'entre eux). À tort ou à raison, ils espèrent décrocher un emploi motivant et assorti de toutes sortes d'avantages sociaux. Voilà pourquoi les employeurs de la Génération X les considèrent comme des enfants gâtés.

Avoir de l'ambition est tout à fait légitime, alors il faut trouver un moyen de canaliser leur énergie.

Or, le comportement des milléniaux s'explique en partie par leur frustration de ne pas atteindre leur plein potentiel. Avoir de l'ambition est tout à fait légitime, alors il faut trouver un moyen de canaliser leur énergie. Par conséquent, établissez des objectifs nobles, placez la barre haute, et sachez récompenser vos jeunes recrues au moment opportun.

Il n'y a rien de mal à congédier les milléniaux

Au fait, y a-t-il des mauvaises équipes? Absolument. Vous devez parler à la personne qui a embauché ces incompétents. Et si vous êtes vous-même responsable du fiasco, apprenez à recruter, à gérer et à congédier le personnel adéquatement, sans quoi vous mériterez encore une fois la palme du pire gestionnaire. Cela dit, l'ambiance au sein d'une équipe peut être gâchée par une ou deux personnes spécifiques. S'il s'agit de milléniaux, vous avez toute l'autorité requise pour vous en départir.

Or, pourquoi tant de gestionnaires craignent-ils de congédier des milléniaux? Si je me fie aux témoignages que j'ai recueillis, le problème est toujours le même : l'employé a un talent incroyable, mais il se plaint souvent; il sape l'autorité de son supérieur et mine le moral de toute l'équipe. Que faire dans un pareil cas?

Le gestionnaire se retrouve dans une position difficile. Si l'employé talentueux fait l'objet de réprimandes ou de sanctions disciplinaires, il risque de démissionner. Mais qui le remplacera? Dans un tel cas, je pose la question qu'on m'a posée la première fois où j'ai été confronté à ce dilemme : qu'arrivera-t-il si cet employé reste en poste? En ce qui me concerne, je préfère un employé moins qualifié ayant une attitude positive à un fauteur de troubles bourré de talent. De toute manière, une superstar insatisfaite ne donne jamais son plein rendement.

N'essayez pas de retenir les milléniaux

N'embauchez jamais un travailleur en présumant qu'il restera longtemps en fonction. Si la qualité de votre équipe vous tient à cœur, vous regretterez votre décision. N'embauchez que les individus ayant un désir authentique de s'améliorer et de gravir les échelons, puis accompagnez-les sur le chemin de la réussite. La marée montante soulève tous les bateaux, et de tels individus propulseront votre équipe vers de nouveaux sommets.

Mes supérieurs les plus talentueux ont toujours fait preuve d'empathie et d'intérêt envers mon avenir. Ils ont fait de grands efforts pour m'aider à atteindre mes objectifs. En retour, je n'ai jamais hésité à foncer et à donner le meilleur de moi-même. Aujourd'hui, je traite mes propres employés avec les mêmes égards. J'en tire de grands bénéfices et ils le savent. Mais à titre de patron, ne suis-je pas la personne censée veiller à mes propres intérêts? Pour conclure, les milléniaux ont besoin d'être encadrés et orientés. Assumez ces responsabilités et vous serez surpris des résultats.

But in this post-Weinstein Hollywood, I’m finding the celebration of Depp increasingly more difficult to bear.","For the past year, I have struggled to stomach the presence of Johnny Depp.

This started with his split from Amber Heard. When they settled their divorce outside of court, many aspects of the couple’s parting remained private, but a number of others did not. The video of him, drinking and appearing to throw a bottle in his kitchen is on the internet, as is a photograph of a mirror, stained with the name of a man Depp thought his wife was having an affair with. Heard said that the words on it are written in paint and blood, which had leaked from Depp’s hand shortly after he accidentally chopped off a chunk of his finger off (Depp claimed he injured the finger during a filming). In a joint statement, the couple labelled their marriage “at times volatile, but always bound by love”. Heard then donated her entire £7million settlement to charity, giving half to an organisation that works to prevent domestic violence.

The months I spent covering this - writing news stories, a piece on the media’s portrayal of Heard and another on the settlement money - left me with a dislike for Depp, but one that I could put aside when necessary (mainly when I wanted to watch Sweeney Todd or Edward Scissorhands again).

I rolled my eyes when he was announced as the special guest for Glastonbury’s all-new Cinemageddon area and skipped ‘Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them’ when his role in it was revealed, but knew that others still held highly favourable opinions of him and respected their decisions.

Then on Thursday, I watched as fans clamoured for a glimpse of the star at the Murder On The Orient Express premiere, shouting his name and cheering him on. When Depp appeared on the big screen, the people inside the Royal Albert Hall whooped and clapped and suddenly, the indifference I’d just about managed to just muster up before was gone. Things are different now.

For the past month, the entertainment industry has played host to an unprecedented amount of sexual harassment and abuse allegations, beginning with those against Harvey Weinstein. It’s being described as a “watershed moment” for improving the treatment of women in the industry and time will hopefully confirm that this is the case.

But the revelations that have been made in the last month could also have a ripple effect that we did not initially expect. (It’s hard to know what to call it all, but I refuse to say “scandal” or “controversy” and hasten to label the accounts “incidents”)

For me, it appears that I can no longer find excuses to separate a man’s reported actions from his “art”. It’s too much of an ask when my average working day now includes hours of reading and writing about crimes powerful men in Hollywood have allegedly committed against women (and in some cases, other men).

Let me be clear: Depp and Weinstein are miles apart. The two are not linked and this is not a comparison of their alleged actions. While still unacceptable, incidents that result in your estranged wife requesting a temporary restraining order are not the same as the alleged harassment of over 50 women (Weinstein has denied all claims of nonconsensual sex). But as we deal with the fallout from the latter, I’m finding it harder and harder to look past the former.

Depp isn’t just ‘getting by’ in the industry. The quality of his movies may have flatlined but when it comes to earnings, he’s going from strength to strength. ‘Pirates Of The Caribbean’ continues to be one of Disney’s most financially successful franchises and Depp will also take the lead in the forthcoming ‘Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them’ films. He occasionally performs with his band, Hollywood Vampires, and fronts a Christian Dior fragrance campaign.

Only time will tell on this, but I wonder what would happen if an actor went through a similar split now, or in a few months time. Would we question them more? Perhaps the actor’s famous friends would hesitate before publicly defending him so fervently. Maybe the video would be remembered for longer and the woman’s words taken more seriously than Heard’s ever were.

The line in the sand has been drawn though, decreeing that Weinstein - who takes the role of a beached whale in this analogy - be left to wilt on the shore as Captain Jack Sparrow sails past untroubled. I’m not saying Depp should face the same consequences as the ones the producer is and, given that his divorce played out pre-Weinstein, it’s unlikely he’ll face anything other than continued adulation from legions of fans in the years to come.

Aussie parent Stevie wasn’t sure whether to share the incident on social media, as she was feared being criticised. However she decided to do so in the hope it will raise awareness of an often overlooked safety hazard for children.

Stevie was folding laundry less than two metres from her son, when she looked up to discover he had tangled himself in the blind cords, with one wrapped around his neck.

“I looked up from the washing pile and [saw] him caught in the cords. I immediately jump up as fast as I could and untangled him,” she explained in an Instagram post that has garnered an outpouring of online support.

But then, the most newsworthy thing about the Climate Science Special Report is that it was released at all, apparently without political interference.

Although the U.S. government is required by law (enacted by President George H.W. Bush in 1989) to report to the public about ""climate change and its physical impacts"" every four years, the current administration is openly hostile to climate science and scientists. According to White House sources quoted in the New York Times, President Donald Trump was ""barely aware of the report's existence.""

U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to world leaders at the 72nd United Nations (UN) General Assembly at UN headquarters in New York on Sept. 19, 2017 in New York City.

The report, released by 13 federal agencies under the direction of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, examines the available science. It was written by dozens of government and non-government scientists, reviewed by the independent National Academy of Sciences and approved by the National Economic Council.

It concludes that we are living in the warmest period in the history of modern civilization, with the last three years being the warmest on record; that we are seeing more ""record-breaking, climate-related weather extremes;"" and that all the evidence points to human activities, ""especially emissions of greenhouse gases,"" as the main cause. Climate change should be in the headlines every day until everyone takes it seriously, but the report's conclusions are not new.

""Thousands of studies conducted by researchers around the world have documented changes in surface, atmospheric and oceanic temperatures; melting glaciers; diminishing snow cover; shrinking sea ice; rising sea levels; ocean acidification; and increasing atmospheric water vapour,"" the reports says.

The government overseeing this report is filled with people who reject climate science.

It's hard to imagine anyone could read this report, or read about it, and not be convinced we have an urgent problem and that failing to put everything we can into resolving it puts our survival at risk!

And yet, the government overseeing this report is filled with people who reject climate science. The president himself has called climate science a ""hoax."" He's appointed climate science deniers to key positions, repealed and weakened environmental laws, had climate change references removed from the Environmental Protection Agency's website and barred EPA scientists from presenting climate change reports. Many delegates at the UN Climate Conference underway in Bonn, Germany, have condemned Trump's decision to pull the U.S. from the Paris Agreement.

The official White House statement on the report was a rehash of tired climate science–denial talking points. White House spokesperson Raj Shah said, ""The climate has changed and is always changing."" He then went on to cast doubt regarding the climate's sensitivity to greenhouse gas emissions.

Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), speaks during an interview in his office at the EPA headquarters in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 25, 2017.

EPA administrator Scott Pruitt has denied the well-known connection between carbon dioxide emissions and global warming, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry has argued the science isn't conclusive.

But the report also shows that, despite country's apparent descent into a post-truth, anti-science dystopia, the United States still maintains sanity in some of its major institutions. Organizations like NASA, NOAA, the EPA and the Department of Defense, along with numerous non-governmental scientific institutions, are continuing to examine the real trends and risks of a planet warming rapidly because of human activity.

It also shows we must do all we can to work toward solutions — economic, technological, philosophical and more — and to only support politicians who demonstrate the foresight, imagination and courage to take on this crisis with the force and intensity it merits.

That a government elected to serve the people would reject the findings of its own scientists and researchers... is an intergenerational crime.

One frustration of studying and communicating about climate issues is knowing that so many solutions exist and are being developed, but that widespread denial of the problem prevents us from moving beyond outdated technologies and economic systems.

That people who profit from those outdated technologies would do everything they can to sow doubt and confusion is not surprising. That a government elected to serve the people would reject the findings of its own scientists and researchers from around the world to the detriment of human health, the economy and the environment is an intergenerational crime.

Christopher Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, told the New York Times, ""This profoundly affects our ability to be leaders in developing new technologies and understanding how to build successful communities and businesses in the 21st century."" It also puts human survival at risk.

REUTERS/Philimon BulawayoFanciful financial systemBut it's the third strategy that the government has pursued that is really fuelling a fanciful financial system.
Zimbabwe's financial system is living on borrowed time and borrowed money.","Zimbabwe's financial system increasingly resembles a house of cards. Were one card to give way -- for instance, if South Africa's power utility, Eskom, were to have the temerity to suggest that Zimbabwe actually pays for the electricity that it's supplying the country -- the entire edifice would collapse.

To put it another way, the government is bust. It is again printing money to cover its spiralling costs, and inflation is rising. And given that there's an election looming in 2018, Zimbabwe's ruling party, ZANU-PF doesn't want to cut back. Far from it, it wants to carry on spending, as fast as it can.

The rot goes back to the early 2000s. ZANU-PF profligacy had been fuelled by a continuous cycle of simply printing more money, and resultant runaway inflation. Mega-inflation meant that ordinary people lost their pensions and whatever savings they had, as the Zimbabwe dollar lost its value and people resorted to barter or the use of other currencies. Ultimately, the government faced no choice but to accept reality. In 2008 it scrapped the Zimbabwean dollar in favour of a basket of other currencies, although within a short time, this in effect meant the reign of the US dollar.

Dollarisation allowed for the pursuit of more rational policies by the coalition Government of National Unity that followed the disputed 2008 election. However, its control of the electoral machinery ensured that ZANU-PF won a resounding victory in the 2013 election. Within a short space of time, it returned to its familiar policy mix of profligacy, corruption and populist economics.

Yet ZANU-PF faced major problems. Above all, dollarisation meant that the cost of Zimbabwe's exports on international markets was high. Worse, the dramatic collapse of agricultural production since the early 2000s (following the appropriation of white farms) alongside the decimation of the country's manufacturing industries meant that there was relatively little to export anyway. Tobacco production has recovered a little, but the quality is less than it used to be, so returns are relatively less.

Meanwhile, government insistence that mines should be 51 percent Zimbabwean-owned has done nothing to entice inward investment or boost exports. In short, the capacity of the economy to earn US dollars by selling goods externally has fallen dramatically, and the supply of money circulating within the country has dried up. Unemployment stands at around 90 percent.

Many Zimbabweans spend their bank balances on consumer goods as quickly as possible rather than attempting to ""save"".

President Robert Mugabe's latest response has been to replace finance minister Patrick Chinamasa, who had been warning of the structure's fragility in ever more urgent tones. The new finance minister is Ignatius Chombo, a party loyalist, who will not brook any talk of need for structural reform.

The bond notes

Faced with a looming crisis, the ZANU-PF government has resorted to three key strategies.

One has been the Zimbabwean Reserve Bank's issue of bond notes (of different denominations). Officially, they're designed to swell the amount of money in circulation within the country. The problem is that, apart from having no value outside the country, nobody trusts them, as they have been issued by a ZANU-PF government, and it was this government that presided over the hyperinflation.

ZANU-PF's announcement that it was issuing bond notes was met with a run on the banks, as depositors sought to withdraw dollars as fast as they could. Their assumption was that this was a government ploy to reintroduce the Zimbabwean dollar. The Reserve Bank responded by limiting the number of dollars individuals could withdraw.

People are reluctant to use the notes. But they're still sometimes forced to accept them because of the sheer shortage of ""real"" money. As a result, when they can, they rush off to the local bus station where they can sell them for dollars to currency traders -- albeit illegally.

The second strategy has been the rapid expansion of country's ability to manage electronic transactions. Its aim has been to expand the amount of money in circulation without using up ""real"" dollars.

Accordingly, government employees are now largely paid electronically. Similarly, government employees (and everyone else) now pay nearly all their bills within the country electronically. And Zimbabweans are rarely able to convert the notional sums of dollars they hold in the bank into real cash -- unless they make use of the currency traders in illegal transactions.

Meanwhile, with the rate of inflation continuing to rise combined with the widespread lack of faith in the banks, many Zimbabweans spend their bank balances on consumer goods as quickly as possible rather than attempting to ""save"". After all, if times get hard, you won't be able to get rid of your bond notes, but you may be able to sell your fridge.

Fanciful financial system

But it's the third strategy that the government has pursued that is really fuelling a fanciful financial system. Since 2013, government expenditure has steadily increased year by year, despite the country earning very little internationally. The ZANU-PF government may have hoped to fund this by its old trick of literally printing money, that is, by expanding the supply of bond notes.

But such was the negative popular sentiment that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe seems to have restricted their issue. Supposedly the issue of bond notes is backed by a USD$200 loan by the African Export-Import Bank, but no-one really knows how many have been issued because the central bank provides no information.

What the government has done instead is to fund its rising costs by issuing treasury bills (whereby it touts for loans on the capital market against promises of later redemption). No-one in their right mind would want to buy them, but Zimbabwe's banks today have little option. As inward investment into the country has dried up to a trickle, there is little else for them to spend their money on, and the interest rates that the government promises to pay are, at face value, attractively high.

The coalition government of national unity recorded budget surpluses for three of the four full years in which the opposition controlled the treasury. For its part, the ZANU-PF government recorded deficits of USD$186-million and USD$125-million in 2014 and 2015. Recently, the then finance minister Chinamasa projected a deficit of USD$1.41-billion for 2017. As of June 30, 2017, there was USD$2.5-billion worth of treasury bills on the issue.

In other words, the spending will continue. Zimbabwe's financial system is living on borrowed time and borrowed money. It will again end in financial ruin, as it did in 2008. But all ZANU-PF cares about is ensuring that it wins the next election and allowing its political elite to ""eat"".

The real estate agency — which, admittedly, has something to gain from predicting rising prices for upscale homes — noted that some of Canada’s housing markets have seen substantial booms in luxury home sales this year.

The realtor found sales of luxury homes are up 29 per cent this year in Montreal, and up 61 per cent in Toronto. Calgary and Vancouver posted 67- and 65-per-cent gains this year, the realtor said.

Sotheby’s expects foreign investors from China and the Middle East, as well as from Russia, India and the U.S., to fuel demand in Canada.

As if to prove the point, news broke last week that a Middle Eastern investor bought several units in a Vancouver condo building, including the penthouse, for a $40-million price tag thought to be the most expensive condo purchase in Canadian history.

En pleine polémique sur la rétrospective consacrée à Roman Polanski à la Cinémathèque Française, la présentatrice a été interrogée sur son positionnement. ""Ça me dérange profondément. Je comprends qu'on parle d'artiste, mais ça me dérange qu'on donne des coups de projecteurs à des gens qui sont toujours poursuivis par des enfants, en disant qu'elles ont été violées à l'âge de 13 ans. Ça me pose un vrai problème"", a expliqué Flavie Flament en référence aux femmes qui accusent le réalisateur d'agression sexuelle alors qu'elles étaient mineures au moment des faits.

Inutilisée depuis longtemps, elle vieillissait sur le bord d'une départementale. Qu'allait-elle bien pouvoir devenir? Allait-elle être démantelée, comme le prévoyait l'un des amendements de la Loi Macron?

C'était compter sans l'ingéniosité et la créativité de l'artiste plasticienne Évelyne Tosello, qui, après s'être installée dans cette commune du Calvados, a décidé de prendre en charge la reconversion pratique et esthétique de la cabine téléphonique qui est devenue une petite bibliothèque libre. Une ""cabliothèque"" en somme.

La ""cabliothèque"" a été installée en 2015, mais elle connaît une seconde jeunesse (et récolte les louanges des internautes) depuis qu'elle s'est retrouvée sur Twitter début novembre.

Au départ c'est une cabine téléphonique dans un village, de plus près c'est une bibliothèque, et à bien y penser c'est beaucoup plus encore. pic.twitter.com/TejskfB1mx 4 novembre 2017

Le principe est simple: n'importe qui peut venir se servir ou déposer un nouveau livre. Une fois lu, l'ouvrage doit être replacé dans la ""cabliothèque"", afin que les autres riverains puissent en profiter. Basée sur le civisme des lecteurs, l'initiative a été soutenue par la Mairie de la ville et par son maire, Monsieur Philippe Desforges.

L'idée a germé dans la tête de l'artiste pendant la fête de ce village de 230 âmes, en juillet 2015. Après avoir eu l'autorisation d'Orange (anciennement France Télécom), propriétaire des cabines téléphoniques dans l'hexagone, Évelyne Tosello s'est retroussée les manches, prête à donner à l'habitacle une nouvelle vie: ""J'ai décidé de m'impliquer dans la vie du village, afin de créer du lien humain et social. Mon fils a réalisé les calligraphies que l'on voit en haut de la ""cabliothèque"" et un menuisier du village s'est chargé de fabriquer les étagères. On ne voulait pas dissimuler la beauté de la cabine, juste la réhabiliter"", confie l'artiste au HuffPost. Trois mois de travaux plus tard, la cabine téléphonique était métamorphosée.

Deux années sont passées et des centaines de livres ont été empruntés. Même si Évelyne Tosello a eu de bons échos de la part des habitants, elle manque de retour. Les nombreux partages des photos de sa bibliothèque en ce mois de novembre lui permettront sans doute d'avoir plus de témoignages de lecteurs.

Environ 600 ouvrages sont proposés dans cette cabine et malgré quelques livres ""piqués"", Évelyne Tosello retient surtout le bon côté de cette expérience. La ""cabliothèque"" est devenu un lieu d'échange culturel et littéraire dans ce petit village: ""Ça a créé du lien social dans un village un peu vieillissant"".

L'initiative a inspiré d'autres communes françaises: dans le Morbihan, le Vaucluse, l'Oise ou le Vercors, des dizaines de cabines téléphoniques sont reconverties en bibliothèques. Mais celle de Boissey a été l'une des premières avec la ""cabliothèque"" de Conliège, dans le Jura, inaugurée un an plus tôt. Des pionniers!

Jamais à court d'idées, Évelyne Tosello ne compte pas raccrocher: deux autres cabines téléphoniques sont en attente de reconversion. ""J'aimerais qu'elles deviennent des petits musées. Mais je ne le ferai pas seule, il faut que les autres habitants de Boissey se motivent. Les Normands, il faut les secouer pour casser leur petit mode de vie"", lance-t-elle dans un éclat de rire.

Doch nicht nur Steueroasen sind ein Problem

Milliarden gehen dem Fiskus wegen Betrugsfällen in Deutschland verloren

Die Namen der Inseln klingen exotisch, ebenso wie die Tricks, die die weltweite Elite nutzt, um Steuern zu sparen: die Bermudas, die Isle of Man, die Virgin Islands, die Cayman Islands und so weiter.

All diese Steuerparadiese tauchen in Unterlagen auf, über die unter anderem die “Süddeutsche Zeitung” berichtet. Demnach haben Prominente, Politiker und Wohlhabende über Tricksereien hunderte Milliarden Euro am Fiskus vorbeigeschleust - meistens völlig legal.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Politiker und Unternehmer umgingen Millionen an Steuern: Diese Deutschen tauchen in den Paradise Papers auf



Allein Deutschland entgehen pro Jahr Steuereinnahmen von rund 17 Milliarden Euro durch Steueroasen, hat der französische Ökonom Gabriel Zucman berechnet.

Betrug vor unserer Haustür

Die Aufregung, die auf die Veröffentlichung der Paradise Papers folgt, ist deshalb völlig verständlich und richtig. Dennoch übersieht sie etwas Wichtiges: Der größte Steuerbetrug passiert täglich vor unserer Haustür.

Bis zu 40 Milliarden Euro gehen dem deutschen Fiskus jährlich durch Steuerbetrug in Deutschland durch die Lappen, schätzt die Deutsche Steuergewerkschaft, andere Experten gehen sogar von noch höheren Schäden aus.

Ihr Vorsitzender Thomas Eigenthaler, erklärt im Gespräch mit der HuffPost, dass allein Gastronomen jährlich rund 10 Milliarden Euro an Steuern hinterziehen.

Vor allem Kleinstunternehmen wie Kioske nutzten häufig noch Bargeldkassen, erklärt Eigenthaler. Dadurch seien die Einnahmen nicht nachvollziehbar - der Betrug ist ein Kinderspiel. Das betrifft auch Taxifahrer und Glückspielhallen. Überall wo Bargeld im Spiel sei, hätten Betrüger leichtes Spiel.

Softwarebetrug gibt es nicht nur bei den Autobauern

Aber auch moderne elektronische Registrierkassen können für den Steuerbetrug missbraucht werden. Dabei hilft eine Software, die den Wareneingang und -Ausgang so klein rechnet, dass der Gesamtumsatz des Restaurants sinkt. Folglich fällt auch der zu versteuernde Gewinn kleiner aus.

Die Kasse registriert dann zum Beispiel, dass der Gastronom weniger Schnitzel und Pommes eingekauft hat als in Wirklichkeit - auch die Verkäufe rechnet die Software entsprechend klein.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Liebe Eliten, wundert euch nicht, wenn die Menschen AfD wählen, es liegt auch an eurem Verhalten



Bisher ist der Gesetzgeber gegen diesen Betrug machtlos. Und auch ein weiterer Steuertrick von dem Eigenthaler berichtet, löst Kopfschütteln aus.

Händler aus China prellen den deutschen Staat

So nutzen in China registrierte Unternehmen den Versandhändler Amazon, um massenhaft Produkte in Deutschland zu verkaufen. Die Produkte lagern bei Amazon in Deutschland, werden aber ohne den Aufschlag von 19 Prozent Mehrwertsteuer verkauft.

90 Prozent der chinesischen Händler würden an der Steuer vorbeiverkaufen, schätzt Eigenthaler. Auch Ebay ist betroffen.

Der Schaden für das Finanzamt: eine Milliarde Euro. Das Problem ist den Behörden schon länger bekannt. Im Mai erklärte der hessische Finanzminister Thomas Schäfer gegenüber der ""Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung"": ""Online-Handel boomt. Mit ihm boomt aber leider auch Steuerbetrug vor allem ausländischer Unternehmen.""

Aber das ist noch nicht alles. So geben Privatpersonen ihren Arbeitsweg beim Finanzamt höher an als er tatsächlich ist. Bücher werden als Fachbücher deklariert, um sie steuerlich geltend zu machen und ein privates Weihnachtsessen wird als Geschäftsdinner deklariert.

All diese Betrügereien von Privatpersonen nennt Eigenthaler “Unehrlichkeiten im Tagesgeschäft” - sie seien im Gegensatz zum Betrug in der Gastronomie kein strukturelles Problem.

Dass diese strukturellen Probleme aber schnell gelöst werden, glaubt kaum ein Experte. Dafür fehlt den Finanzämter unter anderem schlicht das Personal - im Falle von Steuerausfällen bei Verkäufen bei Amazon und Ebay aber auch die passenden Gesetze.

A spokesperson for the LAPD confirmed to HuffPost that authorities are looking into the matter after a police report was filed on Tuesday.

While the LAPD refused to comment on the nature of the claim, multiple other outlets are reporting that the “Gossip Girl” star is being investigated for sexual assault.

“Suspect forced victim to have sexual intercourse inside his residence … three years ago,” a section of the report reads, according to Deadline, which was first to report the news of the investigation.

The outlet also notes that two witnesses have come forward in Cohen’s defense: former child actor Blaise Godbe Lipman and Cohen’s sister Katalina Colgate. Both claimed that the actress shared the story of her rape years ago.

“Very shortly after it happened, she told me that she was raped. She told me and my other sister. I was furious,” Colgate told the outlet.

“I do not know this woman. I have never forced myself in any manner, on any woman,” he wrote on social media Tuesday. “I certainly have never committed rape.”

On Monday, Cohen posted a detailed account of the incident on Facebook, recounting the night she woke up with Westwick on top of her after visiting his home with her boyfriend at the time, an unidentified producer.

“I fought him off as hard as I could but he grabbed my face in his hands, shaking me, telling me he wanted to fuck me,” she wrote on Facebook. “I was paralyzed, terrified. I couldn’t speak, I could no longer move. He held me down and raped me.”

Je me suis dit qu'il n'y avait aucun moyen que je puisse dire que Ed m'avait 'violée' et je ne voulais pas être 'cette fille'.
Les hommes comme Ed utilisent la célébrité et le pouvoir pour violer et intimider, et continuent à parcourir le monde en distribuant les accolades.","VIOL - Un de plus. En pleine affaire Weinstein, les noms d'agresseurs sexuels présumés ne cessent de tomber les uns après les autres. Le dernier en date est Ed Westwick, plus connu -et admiré- sous le nom de Chuck Bass héros charismatique de la série ""Gossip Girl"".

Lundi 6 novembre, l'actrice américaine, Kristina Cohen, 28 ans, a publié un long message sur son mur Facebook dans lequel elle raconte le viol dont elle assure avoir été victime. Aperçue dans les séries ""Greek"" ou ""Californication"", la jeune comédienne annonce dans son message avoir vécu ""un cauchemar"" il y a trois ans. Un cauchemar dont Ed Westwick serait responsable.

""Le mois qui vient de s'écouler a été extrêmement difficile. Comme tant de femmes, j'ai aussi une histoire d'agression sexuelle. La multiplication des histoires a été un déclencheur mais aussi épuisante émotionnellement. Je remuer tout ça dans ma tête, ne sachant pas si je devrais parler. Si je pouvais parler. Et si je le faisais, serai-je entendu?

J'ai été agressé sexuellement il y a trois ans. C'était une période sombre de ma vie. Ma mère était en train de mourir d'un cancer et je n'avais ni le soutien ni le temps nécessaire pour gérer les séquelles du viol. J'ai enterré ma douleur et ma culpabilité pour faire de la place à ce qui se passait. Ma mère est morte 3 mois plus tard.

Encore maintenant, je me laisse prendre par des sentiments de culpabilité. Cette inquiétude infondée qui suggère que d'une certaine façon je suis à blâmer. Je ne sais pas d'où viennent ces sentiments. Le conditionnement social qui fait que tout est toujours la faute de la femme? Que l'incapacité d'un homme à se tenir à l'écart de nos corps est en quelque sorte à cause de nous, pas de lui?

J'ai grandi considérablement au cours des trois années qui se sont écoulées depuis mon agression, m'y replonger est douloureux. Creuser et revivre cette nuit afin de partager avec précision les événements, m'a donné le sentiment d'une agression en continue. Mon estomac est noué, à cause de mon anxiété à rendre ça public. Même me réconcilier complètement avec moi-même a été un processus dur.

À l'époque je fréquentais brièvement un producteur qui était ami avec l'acteur Ed Westwick. C'est ce producteur qui m'a amené chez Ed où je l'ai rencontré pour la première fois. Je voulais partir quand Ed a suggéré ""on devrait tous baiser"". Le producteur n'a pas voulu partir sur le coup pour pas qu' Ed se sente honteux. Ed a insisté pour que nous restions pour le dîner. J'ai dit que j'étais fatiguée et que je voulais partir, essayant de sortir de ce qui était déjà une situation inconfortable. Ed m'a suggéré de faire une sieste dans la chambre d'amis. Le producteur nous a dit que nous ne resterions que 20 minutes de plus et que nous pourrions partir.

Alors je suis allée me ​​coucher dans la chambre d'amis où je me suis finalement endormi, j'ai été réveillé abruptement par Ed, sur moi, ses doigts dans mon corps. Je lui ai dit d'arrêter, mais il était fort. Je l'ai repoussé aussi fort que possible, mais il a saisi mon visage dans ses mains, m'a secoué, et m'a dit qu'il voulait me baiser. J'étais paralysée, terrifiée. Je ne pouvais pas parler, je ne pouvais plus bouger. Il m'a maintenue et m'a violée.

C'était un cauchemar et les jours suivants n'ont pas été meilleurs.

Le producteur m'a blâmé en me disant que j'étais consentante. Il m'a dit que je ne pouvais rien dire parce qu'Ed avait de l'influence et que si je parlais je pourrais oublier ma carrière d'actrice. Je me suis dit qu'il n'y avait aucun moyen que je puisse dire que Ed m'avait 'violée' et je ne voulais pas être 'cette fille'.

Das ist bei CSU und SPD nicht anders - und völlig normal.

Bei guten Ergebnissen glaubt man keine Analyse nötig zu haben, bei schlechten verzichtet man liebend gerne darauf. Warum auch in noch schwärenden Wunden herumstochern?

""Nicht das Erreichte zählt, uns reicht das Erzählte""

Auch wenn die CDU sich nicht ernsthaft mit Zahlen beschäftigt, ist sie nach Kräften bemüht, das wenig schmeichelhafte Ergebnis vom 24. September schönzureden. Die CDU ist (außerhalb Bayerns) bei den Zweitstimmen um 7,4 Punkte auf 26,8 Prozent abgesackt.

Sie hat trotz der Aufblähung des Bundestags 55 ihrer bisher 255 Mandate verloren. Sieger sehen so sicher nicht aus. Dennoch handelt die CDU-Spitze, allen voran die Parteivorsitzende und Kanzlerin, nach dem Motto ""Nicht das Erreichte zählt, uns reicht das Erzählte.""

Folglich verkündete Angela Merkel noch in der Wahlnacht, sie wisse nicht, was sie hätte anders machen können. Also alles paletti?

Die Selbstzufriedenheit der CDU - teils gespielt, teils ernst gemeint - steht auf den ersten Blick im Widerspruch zu der Tatsache, dass mit der AfD rechts von ihr eine neue Partei entstanden ist - nicht durch einen Putsch, sondern von 5,9 Millionen Menschen gewählt.

Doch auf den zweiten Blick wird deutlich, dass der CDU die Rechtsaußen-Partei sogar recht willkommen zu sein scheint. Im Konrad-Adenauer-Haus sieht mancher das ""machttechnisch"" oder zynisch: Eine starke AfD verhindert im Bund schon rechnerisch eine rot-rot-grüne Mehrheit. Folglich bleibt die CDU Kanzlerin-Partei. Was will man also mehr?

Die AfD - ein Ergebnis der eigenen Fehler

Selbst CDU-Generalsekretär Peter Tauber müsste es inzwischen gedämmert haben, dass seine Prognose von 2014, die AfD werde so schnell wieder verschwinden wie einst die Piraten, nicht gerade von großer Weisheit geprägt war.

Inzwischen vermitteln die führenden Köpfe der CDU jedoch den Eindruck, sich mit der Existenz der rechten Konkurrenz abgefunden zu haben. Motto: ""Wenn die da sind, dann sind sie halt da.""

Nebenbei: Sich mit der Existenz der AfD abzufinden, ist für Parteimanager recht bequem. Wenn man die neue Partei wie ein Naturereignis betrachtet und nicht auch als Ergebnis eigener Fehler, dann lebt es sich viel leichter.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Dann bleibt Jamaika ein Luftschloss"": FDP-Chef Lindner stellt Koalition mit den Grünen infrage

Alle Wahlanalysen der Meinungsforscher zeigen: Keine Partei hat so viele Stimmen an die AfD abgegeben wie die Union. Wenn aber vereinzelte CDU-Politiker laut darüber nachdenken, wie man diese enttäuschten Konservativen wieder zurückgewinnen könnte, stoßen sie auf Gleichgültigkeit oder Ablehnung. Stört unsere Jamaika-Kreise nicht, lautet implizit die Botschaft.

Der Merkel-Flügel der CDU behauptet unverdrossen, das Ergebnis habe nichts mit der Flüchtlingspolitik zu tun gehabt, nichts mit dem Kontrollverlust im Herbst 2015, nichts mit ""Köln"" und nichts mit der Angst vor als Flüchtlingen getarnten Gewalttätern.

Das passt nicht so recht zu der Wahlkampfaussage Merkels, ""2015 soll, kann und darf sich nicht wiederholen."" Das passt vor allem nicht zu den demoskopischen Befunden.

Für die Union geht es stetig bergab

In den im September 2015 veröffentlichten Ergebnissen der ""Sonntagsfrage"" von Allensbach kam die CDU/CSU auf 42 Prozent, um schon im Oktober - nach der Grenzöffnung - auf 38 Prozent zu fallen.

Von da an ging's, von einem Zwischenhoch im Sommer 2017 abgesehen, stetig bergab. Wer oder was, wenn nicht die Flüchtlingspolitik, soll diesen Einbruch in der Wählergunst eigentlich bewirkt haben?

Weil der Zusammenhang zwischen weit geöffneten Grenzen und immer schlechter werdenden CDU-Werten nicht zu übersehen ist, hat die Merkel-Fraktion in der CDU eine zweite Verteidigungslinie aufgemacht:

Die 32,9 Prozent für die CDU/CSU seien ein ""normales"" Ergebnis - auf einer Linie mit den 35,2 Prozent von 2005 und den 33,8 Prozent von 2009. Demgegenüber seien die 41,5 Prozent von 2013 ein ""Ausreißer"" gewesen, mithin keine seriöse Vergleichsgröße.

Nun ist es eigentlich kein Komplement für die Kanzlerin, wenn die Union ihre Ergebnisse auf und unter dem Niveau der 35,1 Prozent von Kohls Abwahl im Jahr 1998 für ""normal"" hält. Jedoch empfiehlt es sich, Ergebnisse einer Partei nicht isoliert zu betrachten.

Den Kohl'schen 35,1 Prozent von 1998 standen 52,7 Prozent des rot-rot-grünen Lagers gegenüber, Merkels 32,9 Prozent vom 24. September aber nur noch 38,6 Prozent für SPD/Grüne/Linke.

Die Chancen für ""Jamaika"" stehen 50:50

Fazit: Von den Wählern, die sich vor allem von der SPD abgewendet haben, können unter dem Strich keine bei der CDU gelandet sein.

Der Modernisierungskurs der Merkel-Tauber-CDU wurde immer damit begründet, die CDU könne links der Mitte mehr Wähler gewinnen als rechts von der Mitte verlieren. Aber das war reine Theorie oder bloßes Wunschdenken. In der Praxis sprechen die Stimmergebnisse eine andere Sprache.

Die Chancen für ""Jamaika"" stehen 50:50. Sollte es dazu kommen, wird die CDU diese Koalition als Ausdruck ihrer Modernität interpretieren.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: CSU-Mann Scheuer äußert sich zu Jamaika - und widerspricht sich in nur 3 Sätzen selbst

Es bedarf freilich einer sehr großen Portion Phantasie, sich bei ""Jamaika"" eine Flüchtlings- oder Familienpolitik vorzustellen, die nach Rechtsaußen abgewanderte CDU-Wähler wieder mit ""ihrer"" Union versöhnen könnte.

Aber darum geht es der CDU-Führung auch gar nicht. Sollen die ungeliebten und unbequemen ""Konservativen"" doch die AfD wählen. Solange die CDU die Kanzlerin stellt, ist dies aus der Perspektive des Adenauer-Hauses ein leicht zu verschmerzender Kollateralschaden.

Übrigens: Adenauer wurde 1949 mit 31,0 Prozent der Stimmen Kanzler. Es ist also noch Luft nach unten.

When onion prices were going through the roof in 2013, Congress leader and at that time Delhi chief minister, Sheila Dikshit, had lamented that she too was having bhindi without onions.

""After weeks I ate onions today with bhindi,"" said Dikshit in a ham-handed attempt to feel the pain of the aam aadmi. Onion prices had hit Rs 100 a kilo by then. BJP leader Vijay Jolly, unimpressed by Dikshit's onion tears, presented her with a basket of onions as a Diwali gift. ""The government has failed miserably on all fronts because of which people are suffering,"" he said.

On the anniversary of demonetisation, his senior colleague Arun Jaitley did not even have onion tears to offer.

He defended demonetisation as ""morally and ethically correct"". ""What is morally correct and ethically correct has to be politically correct,"" the Finance Minister said.

He dismissed stories of suffering saying the system had been flooded with new notes ""almost instantaneously and so pick-up of trade began thereafter."" That is a brazen rewriting of history. The government has consistently tried to pretend that the only people who suffered after the famous surgical strike of demonetisation were the rich and the corrupt who had wads of stash stuffed in their walls. That 99% of currency notes returned to the system proved that was not the case.

The government is being willfully blind if it chooses not to see them. You did not have to go far to see the suffering.

A survey across 21 states conducted between December 2016 and January 2017 by the NGO Act Now for Harmony and Democracy found 55.9% were afraid to keep money at home. And 55.4% did not believe that demonetisation could eradicate black money, the government's moral high claim. Only 20 percent thought that demonetisation would benefit the common man.

Statistics are dull and deadening. But stories of suffering from the poor and vulnerable were plentiful after demonetisation. The government is being willfully blind if it chooses not to see them. You did not have to go far to see the suffering. An article in Mint showed the ripple effect of that surgical strike.

Sunil Jadhav worked in a factory that made plastic sheets to stop water percolation from farm ponds. The water is used for rabi crops such as onions. This was the time when farmers having sold their kharif crops had cash on hand and invested in the farm ponds. But last year, stuck with scrapped notes, they had to postpone farm pond construction. Jadhav who earned Rs 250 a day was laid off. Hundreds of landless labourers who would have been hired to construct the ponds found no jobs. The onion crop suffered without enough farm ponds for irrigation. That meant labourers involved in harvesting and transporting the onions suffered as well. A small shopkeeper in that same village sells batteries to farmers. Farmers clamp those batteries on their forehead to work the fields at night in that season when they irrigate the farms. Last year they needed far less. His sales were down 60%.

Is this what the Prime Minister meant when he said ""there may be temporary hardships to be faced by honest citizens""?

Elderly people living alone at home struggled to meet basic expenses and pay their help. It's not like the government came forward to help them access new cash.

""The urban organised sector (India) fails to notice this ripple effect on the informal sector (Bharat)"" writes Milind Murugkar in Mint. ""The impact on the organized sector creates a visible effect. The suffering of Bharat is diffused, invisible, but hugely more painful.""

That Narendra Modi was able to persuade the poor that the rich were suffering even more is a different matter. That was not true but such is the power of oratory. It does not make it morally or ethically correct however.

Let us not forget that people died as a result of the stress of demonetization. ""We have been saying for a long time that over 100 people have died because of demonetization,"" said Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad. ""But the government refused to pay tribute to the deceased."" Others pointed out that in a country like India, 3,700 people can die in one month just from snakebite.

We can quibble about the exact dotted line between demonetisation and cause of death but deaths did happen. Saud ur-Rahman, a 48-year-old poster designer in Delhi had a massive heart attack after spending three days in long queues for cash. Razia, a construction worker in Delhi, with hungry children at home, set herself ablaze after failing to exchange currency notes for five days. A woman in Telengana committed suicide afraid she would lose the money the family had just made from selling agricultural land, money that was needed for her husband's treatment. A bank cashier committed suicide unable to take work pressure.

The Hindustan Times put out a famous picture of an 80-year-old man, retired from the Indian Army, weeping inside a bank in Gurgaon, after trying for four days to get some money.

Elderly people living alone at home struggled to meet basic expenses and pay their help. It's not like the government came forward to help them access new cash. Anne Bangera, 71 and arthritic told Firstpost that standing in queues was particularly painful. ""For the old and weak demonetization was very difficult as it left us helpless,"" she said.

At that same time, Karnataka mining baron and BJP MP Janardhana Reddy supposedly spent Rs 500 crore on his daughter's wedding. That shows an entirely different kind of moral compass.

Narendra Modi acknowledged the suffering of the common people but likened it to a mahayagna or a great sacrifice to purge black money thus giving the whole enterprise an almost hallowed feel. It certainly worked in the ruling party's favour in the elections in Uttar Pradesh. But that does make the implementation of demonetisation, whatever its aims, morally correct. Nor did the difficulties last only 50 days or so as the Prime Minister had promised.

It is true as Jaitley reminded us that the Congress of UPA-2 was riddled with corruption and scams. That makes it hypocritical for it to talk of ""loot"" now. But the sorry record of his own party on corruption does not mean Manmohan Singh is wrong when he says the biggest victims of the way demonetization and then GST were implemented are the poor and marginalized, farmers, traders, small and medium businesses. The mahayagna was conducted on their backs.

Of the Rs 15.44 lakh notes withdrawn from circulation, Rs 15.28 lakh crore were back in the system by June 30 this year. Black money had been washed white in the ""watershed moment in the history of the Indian economy.""

Had that old man in that bank in Gurgaon wept in vain? Did his tears matter at all?

Elle s'appelle Eleanor Oliphant, elle est dotée d'une intelligence supérieure à la moyenne mais elle a bien du mal avec les conventions sociales et toutes les petites choses du quotidien qui peuvent nous sembler évidentes... On la dit ""un peu spéciale"". Elle n'y prête pas plus attention qu'à ses collègues de bureau ou à son apparence physique.

Il est ainsi critiqué ce mercredi 8 novembre par de nombreux écologistes, qui y voient un renoncement par rapport à l'objectif fixé par la loi de transition énergétique et au programme d'Emmanuel Macron.

Le ministre de la Transition énergétique assure pourtant que le nucléaire est bien en voie de diminution en France. Simplement, affirme Nicolas Hulot, le maintien de l'échéance de 2025 est tout simplement impossible, à moins d'augmenter nos émissions de CO2.

Car il faut le rappeler, l'énergie de l'atome rejette très peu de gaz à effet de serre. Et en dehors des énergies renouvelables, les autres centrales sont plus polluantes, en termes de CO2. Bref, climat ou baisse du nucléaire, il faut choisir, selon le ministre.

Nicolas Hulot n'a pas tort, soulignent les spécialistes du secteur. Déjà, lors de la mise en place de la loi sous François Hollande, beaucoup doutaient de la possibilité d'une telle échéance. Et le problème, c'est que depuis, les choses n'ont pas vraiment évolué.

8 ans, c'est trop court

""Du retard a été pris sur le précédent quinquennat"", note Nicolas Goldberg, du cabinet Colombus Consulting, spécialiste des questions de politiques énergétiques. Pour lui, la date de 2025 est clairement intenable.

Même son de cloche du côté de Thibault Laconde, consultant et auteur du blog Energie & développement. ""8 ans, c'est une échelle de temps très courte pour le secteur de l'énergie, où il y a une forte inertie"", précise-t-il.

Non pas que ce soit impossible techniquement parlant: après tout, la part d'éolien et de solaire visée est similaire à celle de l'Allemagne actuellement. Sauf que cela demande de l'argent, mais aussi du temps.

Pour schématiser grossièrement, ""il faut quelque chose comme 1000 éoliennes pour remplacer la fermeture d'un réacteur nucléaire"", explique le consultant. Aujourd'hui, nous en installons 500 par an. Le rapport de RTE, qui gère le réseau d'électricité français, estime qu'il faudrait fermer 24 réacteurs d'ici 2025 pour coller aux objectifs.

""Il faut aussi voir le côté économique et industriel d'un tel changement. Avons-nous les moyens de faire cela si vite? L'Allemagne, quand elle a choisi d'abandonner le nucléaire, disposait d'une économie florissante et d'entreprises permettant de produire ces énergies renouvelables. En France, je les cherche encore"", affirme Thibault Laconde.

En dehors de la date, une diminution qui fait consensus

Du coup, si l'on veut coller à la date de 2025, selon le rapport RTE -sur lequel se base en partie Nicolas Hulot-, il faudrait utiliser des sources d'énergies polluantes, non renouvelables, en attendant que les éoliennes et autres panneaux solaires puissent prendre le relais.

Tout n'est pas noir pour autant. Nicolas Goldberg et Thibault Laconde soulignent ainsi que dans le rapport, il n'est jamais envisagé d'augmenter la part du nucléaire dans la production énergétique française.

En effet, les 5 scénarios mis au point évoquent tous une diminution du nombre de réacteurs en service. Le plus optimiste estime même que le passage sous les 50% pour le nucléaire pourrait avoir lieu dès 2030, quand un autre évoque 2035.

C'est déjà une grosse évolution par rapport à 2013, où le PDG d'EDF estimait qu'il ne faudra fermer aucun réacteur d'ici à 2025.

Une question de symbole

Mais alors pourquoi Nicolas Hulot est-il si vertement critiqué? Si l'on peut y voir une bataille idéologique, il y a aussi la question du symbole. Ainsi, l'ONG Negawatt estime que ""si l'inaction passée pèse de tout son poids sur l'échéance de 2025, le Bilan prévisionnel ne porte pas un message de renoncement"". Au contraire, ""que l'on retarde cette échéance ou non"", ""il ne faut plus différer l'action"".

C'est également le point de vue de Pascal Canfin, directeur de WWF France, interrogé sur France Inter. Si celui-ci ne se dit pas attaché à la date de 2025, qu'il juge ""inadaptée"", il estime surtout que Nicolas Hulot a fauté en n'indiquant pas de date de remplacement, par exemple 2030, pour suivre le scénario optimiste de RTE.

Pascal Canfin souhaite donc que le gouvernement clarifie rapidement sa position et mette en place un calendrier clair permettant de fixer de véritables objectifs pour la réduction de la part du nucléaire.

Nicolas Hulot a d'ores et déjà annoncé que le gouvernement allait travailler sur ""l'échéance de 2030 ou 2035"". Reste à savoir quel sera le résultat. Pascal Canfin affirme que le premier ministre et le ministre de l'Economie sont très favorables à l'industrie nucléaire et ""souhaitent, au fond, en lien avec une partie de l'appareil d'Etat, ne pas bouger"" sur le choix du nucléaire.

Pro et anti-nucléaire devraient dans tous les cas être fixés rapidement. C'est l'année prochaine que le gouvernement doit clarifier sa position, afin de mettre à jour la feuille de route (PPE) de la loi de Transition énergétique.

I am so pleased to announce ""Listen to America,"" a hugely ambitious, cross-country project we’re undertaking at HuffPost to understand what’s on the minds of Americans and what it means to be American in 2017. Consider this an invitation to our journey.

For journalists, listening is more important than ever. Why? First, trust in the news media is at an all-time low. We want to address that head-on, and build trust in the work we do, by visiting communities that are often ignored by national media. We’ll listen to what’s most important to them, and help tell those stories to the vast HuffPost audience.

Second, political divisions between us seem starker than ever. But at HuffPost, we believe there’s still so much that unites us as citizens. We aim to discover and highlight all that, and show what Americans have in common. As we visit 25 cities, we’ll use our bus — built out as a mobile video studio — to listen and collect hundreds if not thousands of voices, and we’ll share many of them along the way. We’ll also create ways for you to make your voice heard too, even if we aren’t coming to your hometown.

Third, as journalists, being good listeners, and getting out of our own way, are at the core of our practice. ""Listen to America"" is an opportunity to practice this skill over and over, and discover great stories out in the field, where they live.

We’re popping our own bubbles in more ways than one. Join us! The bus hits the road on Sept. 12 in St. Louis. Check our map to see if we’re coming to your town. Subscribe to our newsletter. And shoot us any tips or thoughts at listening@huffpost.com. We’re here.

Les grandes villes européennes telles que Londres, Paris, Berlin, Rome et Madrid ont toujours été à la pointe de l'innovation et du changement. En raison de leur taille, de la complexité de leur infrastructure, des réseaux de relations et connexions qui s'y développent, les nouvelles idées et technologies ont davantage d'impact.

À l'heure où l'Europe prend le chemin d'une révolution écologique fondée sur la technologie, ses citoyens sont en première ligne. En décidant d'opter pour un mode de vie plus durable, que ce soit par la conduite d'un véhicule électrique pour diminuer la pollution sonore ou par l'utilisation de l'énergie solaire pour alimenter nos maisons, nous en sommes les catalyseurs.

Mais quelle vision les individus, les gouvernements, les grandes entreprises et les start-ups spécialisées dans la technologie ont-ils de la ville de 2025?

Un nouveau départ

""Les gens verront leur santé s'améliorer grâce à la réduction des émissions d'oxyde d'azote"", estime Gareth Dunsmore, directeur des véhicules électriques (VE) chez Nissan Europe, au vu de la prééminence des VE dans nos villes. Du fait de la législation, ces réductions entraîneront la disparition progressive des véhicules diesel et essence en faveur des VE et autres moyens de transport urbain.

Paris a déjà banni les véhicules diesel d'un certain âge et assure que ceux-ci seront totalement interdits d'ici à 2030, tout comme les véhicules essence. Madrid, qui a prévu l'éradication des diesels à l'horizon 2025, a vu les ventes de VE exploser de 90% en 2016.

Rome encourage le recours aux VE et aux hybrides en autorisant uniquement la circulation de ces véhicules en ville le dimanche, tandis que Berlin a mis en place un système de vignettes vertes, jaunes et rouges selon le niveau d'émission des voitures (rouge étant le pire) avec restriction et pénalités correspondantes.

De son côté, Londres a décidé de convertir la totalité de son réseau de bus à l'électrique et de mettre en place des zones à ultra-faibles émissions (ULEZ).

Un usage intelligent de l'énergie

L'amélioration de la qualité de l'air dans nos villes n'est qu'un début : l'usage généralisé des VE, qui constituent la clé de voûte de ce que l'on appelle la technologie vehicle-to-grid (V2G), entraînera des transformations d'une toute autre ampleur.

En permettant à l'énergie issue de la batterie d'un VE d'être réinjectée dans le réseau, pour alimenter notre maison, notre lieu de travail et les installations municipales, par exemple, le V2G fait de notre voiture une centrale électrique mobile au sein d'un écosystème énergétique local.

Pour Gareth Dunsmore, la voiture sans chauffeur fait partie intégrante de cette transformation. ""La mobilité intelligente et la technologie ProPilot de Nissan vont permettre aux gens de se connecter automatiquement à leur environnement, leur offrant ainsi un accès privilégié aux parkings électrifiés et la capacité de partager leur énergie quand ils n'en ont pas besoin.""

Comme les voitures seront capables d'accéder elles-mêmes aux bornes de recharge et de retourner se garer, ce partage d'énergie pourra même se produire pendant notre sommeil. De plus, grâce aux algorithmes de pointe qui géreront la circulation des véhicules autonomes, il sera bien plus simple de se déplacer en ville.

Il est tout cas fort probable qu'il y aura moins de voitures en ville d'ici à 2025, dans la mesure où les gens utilisent des moyens de locomotion de plus en plus divers. ""Grâce aux systèmes de transport multimodaux, on pourra au choix posséder une voiture, la partager, utiliser le bus, le vélo ou le train, puis de nouveau sa voiture"", ajoute-t-il.

Une ville toujours plus intelligente

En plus de jouer un rôle prépondérant dans la ""ville intelligente"", le V2G sera le symbole d'un environnement caractérisé par une meilleure connectivité et une approche plus écologique des installations urbaines, à savoir les bâtiments et l'infrastructure.

Comme le souligne Francisco Carranza Sierra, directeur général du service énergie chez Nissan, ""chaque maison, chaque immeuble disposera de ses propres panneaux solaires et solutions de stockage d'énergie. Au lieu de n'être que des consommateurs passifs dans le modèle actuel, nos clients bénéficieront, dans cette nouvelle configuration, d'un plus grand pouvoir de décision"".

""La tendance à la numérisation et à la décentralisation va donner naissance à de nouveaux modèles commerciaux qui créeront une interaction bien plus importante entre les gens, les maisons, les voitures et leurs fournisseurs d'énergie-mobilité. Les villes seront alors capables de devenir entièrement durables et numériques.""

L'architecture urbaine a déjà pris le virage vert, comme on le voit avec le Bosco Verticale (forêt verticale) à Milan, un gratte-ciel dont la façade foisonne de vie organique, ses balcons accueillant 730 arbres, 11 000 plantes et 5 000 arbustes spécialement cultivés.

Ce concept d'immeuble vivant prend également forme ailleurs en Europe, comme ""l'école de musique mangeuse de smog"" à Cracovie (Pologne), dont le toit est constitué d'une mousse spécialement conçue pour absorber les polluants tels que l'oxyde d'azote et l'ozone.

De nouveaux bâtiments faits de béton contenant ce que l'on appelle un photocatalyseur pourraient aussi voir le jour. Sous l'effet du soleil, celui-ci neutralise les polluants atmosphériques dont il ne subsiste plus que les molécules d'eau et d'oxygène.

Le stockage d'énergie sera monnaie courante

Afin que des technologies telles que le V2G puissent être efficaces, le stockage d'énergie à la maison et au bureau va se généraliser d'ici à 2025, même dans des structures aussi grandes que des stades. L'ArenA d'Amsterdam (le stade de l'Ajax), qui utilise les batteries transformées de la Nissan LEAF, en est une illustration.

À terme, ces batteries remplaceront les générateurs diesel du stade et lui permettront d'alimenter le quartier. C'est exactement le genre d'interactions énergétiques dont parle Francisco Carranza Sierra, grâce auxquelles les villes seront totalement durables.

""Les composantes essentielles de ce processus sont la voiture, les panneaux solaires, le stockage d'énergie et le logiciel qui permettra la gestion efficace de tous ces éléments"", indique-t-il. ""En développant de tels services et technologies, Nissan propose des solutions de mobilité et d'énergie d'avenir abordables et durables à ses clients.""

La production énergétique pourrait aussi provenir de sources plus inattendues. Au Royaume-Uni, par exemple, la société Pavegen vise à transformer nos pas en énergie. En marchant sur des dalles spécialement conçues, les gens déclenchent un mouvement rotatif au sein d'un générateur intégré qui génère de l'électricité, stockée hors réseau.

Chaque dalle est également équipée d'une technologie qui transmet en temps réel les données sur les mouvements afin que l'on puisse analyser le trafic pédestre et tirer le meilleur parti des différents trajets, comme on le fait pour le trafic routier. Autre avantage: le fait de marcher sur les dalles et de fournir ainsi de l'énergie permet, par le biais d'une application, de gagner des ""unités numériques"" susceptibles de pondérer nos propres coûts énergétiques.

Pour une réflexion commune

C'est en combinant efforts personnels, politiques et commerciaux que la ville de 2025 prendra forme.

Pour Francisco Carranza Sierra, cela se résume à ""une production d'énergie solaire fiable et abordable, des solutions de stockage d'énergie dans les foyers et un logiciel de gestion d'énergie qui optimise tous les flux et permet leur intégration à l'économie solidaire"".

En d'autres termes, c'est encore une fois nous, les individus, qui serons les artisans du changement.

En faisant le choix d'un impact environnemental positif, si minime soit-il, nous serons rapidement rejoint par l'ensemble de la ville.

Electrify the World est une initiative de Nissan. Pionnier des véhicules 100% électriques, Nissan estime qu'il est nécessaire d'agir dès à présent afin d'assurer l'avenir des générations futures.

Die vergangenen vier Jahre konnten dem Präsidenten mehrere Vergehen nachgewiesen werden

Die Demokraten sind jedoch untereinander zu zerstritten, um die Wahl zu gewinnen

Ein Zukunftsszenario:

Von der Decke des Saals regnen rote Luftballons herab. ""Four more years!“, ruft das Publikum, darunter viele bereits ergraute Angehörige der unteren Mittelklasse.

Donald Trump steht noch hinter der Bühne und setzt einen Tweet ab: ""So sad for the crooked Dems, but America will be greater than ever before!“ Noch bevor er sein Smartphone im Jacket verschwinden lässt, hat er 20.000 Retweets.

► Dann schreitet Trump ans Podium, aus den Lautsprechern erklingt ""Hail to the Chief“, die traditionelle Präsidentenhymne in den USA.

Am Morgen dieses 4. November 2020, Stunden nach Schließung der Wahllokale, ist es gewiss: Donald Trump ist der alte und neue Präsident der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika. ""Greater than ever before“ war der wenig originelle, aber doch recht konsequent gewählte Wahlslogan.

Die ""New York Times"" und die ""Washington Post"" schwärzen in einer gemeinsamen Protestaktion ihre Titelseite. Jeder neu- und wiedergewählte US-Präsident hat bisher am Tag nach der Wahl eine Wahlsieger-Schlagzeile gehabt.

Diesen Triumph wollen ihm die liberalen Journalisten von der Ostküste nicht gönnen. Es soll ein Zeichen sein. Tatsächlich aber wirkt es wie eine Kapitulationserklärung.

Telefongespräch zwischen Trump und Putin veröffentlicht

Vier Jahre lang haben die besten investigativen Journalisten des Landes versucht, dem Immobilien-Milliardär schmutzige Tricks, zwielichtige Geschäfte und seine Nähe zur rechtsextremen ""Alt-Right-Bewegung“ nachzuweisen.

Sie haben Beweise dafür gefunden, dass Trumps Kampagne mit russischen Geldern mitfinanziert wurde, dass seine Wahlkampfhelfer im Jahr 2016 im direkten Kontakt mit dem Kreml standen.

Im Jahr 2019 hatte der russische Oppositionelle Alexej Nawalny in einer Netz-Doku sogar eine mit großer Wahrscheinlichkeit authentische Audioaufnahme eines Telefonats zwischen Trump und Wladimir Putin veröffentlicht, aus der einwandfrei klar wird, wie beide Politiker gemeinsam vereinbaren, die US-Wahl von 2016 zu manipulieren.

Für kurze Zeit sorgt die Doku für Wirbel in Washington. Selbst gemäßigte republikanische Senatoren fordern eine Amtsenthebung von Trump. Doch der öffentliche Druck fällt schnell in sich zusammen, als neue Berichte über Manipulationsvorwürfe bei den Vorwahlen der Demokraten bekannt werden.

""Hillary war auch nicht besser!“, ""Die da oben sind doch alle korrupt!“, ""Dann lieber einen, der erst gar nicht so tut, als ob er was Besseres sei!“, heißt es in den Kommentarspalten der Massenmedien.

Die Mauer nach Mexiko steht nur in Teilen

Die Kritik an den Eliten hat das System in den USA zerfressen. Die einfachen Bürger vertrauen den Politikern, den traditionellen Medien und den Entscheidungsträgern in der Wirtschaft nicht mehr.

Selbst Skandal-Enthüllungen haben keine Wirkung mehr, weil zu viele US-Bürger davon ausgehen, dass Skandale keine Ausnahme, sondern eher die Regel sind. Jeder habe doch Dreck am Stecken. Da könne man den einen nicht strafen, während man den anderen laufen lässt.

► Umgekehrt vertrauen jedoch auch die Eliten den einfachen Bürgern nicht mehr. Sie schotten sich noch weiter ab, als das bisher der Fall war. Geistig, räumlich und finanziell. Eine Steilvorlage für einen neuen elitenkritischen Wahlkampf.

Deshalb kommt Trump sogar mit seiner (aus Sicht der eigenen Anhänger) eher mäßigen Bilanz in der ersten Amtszeit davon. Die Mauer nach Mexiko steht bisher nur in Teilen, Nordkorea verfügt immer noch über Atomwaffen, die Einreisestopps für Muslime sind am Widerstand der Justiz und Bürgerrechtsbewegungen wie der ACLU gescheitert.

Die Zustimmungswerte für Trump sind auf einem gleichbleibend niedrigen Niveau. Das hat sich auch in einer gesunkenen Wahlbeteiligung am 3. November 2020 niedergeschlagen.

Krawalle im demokratischen Flügel

Doch so paradox das auch klingen mag: Sein Herausforderer Bernie Sanders hatte noch viel schlimmere Probleme. Während die immer stärker zu sozialistischen Positionen tendierende liberale Jugend ihm zujubelt, wandte sich das Partei-Establishment schnell von ihm ab – besonders, nachdem er dem Lobbysystem in Washington den Kampf angesagt hatte.

Andere warfen ihm vor, dass er mit seinen linken Programm das ideale Ziel für die rechte Wutbürger-Bewegung von Trump sei.

Dass Sanders' politische Ziele im herrschenden politischen Klima durchaus mehrheitsfähig gewesen wären, interessierte beim Nominierungsparteitag der Demokraten im August kaum noch jemanden.

Der Sozialist aus Vermont, der Amerika eigentlich wieder einen wollte, sah sich wüsten Beschimpfungen ausgesetzt. Es kam zu Krawallen vor der Veranstaltungshalle zwischen Bernie-Fans und Anhängern der Clinton-Familie, die sich über drei Tage hinzogen.

Rechte Medien nannten Sanders fortan nur noch den ""Vater des Mobs“ und schürten die Angst vor einer Machtübernahme durch gewalttätige Gruppen rund um Sanders.

Für Amerika war die Wiederwahl von Trump ein noch viel schwärzerer Tag als vier Jahre zuvor. Es hat sich gezeigt, dass das System nicht nur defekt, sondern auch dauerhaft nicht mehr in der Lage ist, eine echte Auseinandersetzung über politische Inhalte zu gewährleisten.

► Auch das ist ein Erbe der Trump-Ära: Wo Fakten nichts mehr wert sind, geht auch die Demokratie zugrunde.

CANBERRA -- The great citizenship drip feed is leaving a dripping constitutional mess around Canberra.

Hours after the Prime Minister stated on Monday he'd been told by the Liberal Party's federal director that all Liberal Party Members ""believe that they are in compliance with the Constitution"", another federal politician was revealed as urgently trying to confirm his citizenship status.

Can Liberal MP John Alexander's as-yet unresolved citizenship situation bring down the Turnbull Government? What about an election to wipe the slate clean?

.@MathiasCormann: I assume all MPs will be truthful about when declaring their citizenship to parliament. MORE: https://t.co/xN3F6MhykG pic.twitter.com/ScrX0ZJMrx November 6, 2017

And did the Prime Minister just bring in a quasi-audit fix to either sort this mess out or somehow bring down his own Government?

We have already had the deputy PM and five senators knocked out of our fragile, finely balanced parliament.

So this is where we are at. Or Not.

Time For An Election?

We are not there yet.

But serious questions are being asked about the Turnbull Government's hold on power should it lose Alexander and any more lower house MPs.

Even Turnbull concedes there could be ""consequences"".

""If the High Court concluded there are a number of members of the House of Representatives that were not eligible to sit in the Parliament, then there would be a series of by-elections. Depending on the result of the by-elections, that could have consequences for the Government,"" Turnbull told ABC radio on Tuesday.

Citizenship debacle could spark more by-elections, Turnbull admits https://t.co/xrioXfFoDP pic.twitter.com/aWL8UVdZmx — ABC News (@abcnews) November 6, 2017

The Government has 75 votes on the floor of the 150 seat lower house without Joyce. He is seat is vacant so there are 149 current members. Under this temporary scenario, the government has lost its absolute majority, but is not a minority government. Labor has 69 votes, so to pass a no-confidence motion against the Government it would need the support of all five crossbenchers.

Independent MP Cathy McGowan is not in that camp and has been offering to ""continue to supply confidence and support to the Government"".

Speaker Tony Smith has a casting vote in the event of a tie but indicated in May he is unlikely to use it to give the Government a majority.

But lose another lower house MP and reduce the Government to at least 74 members while the results of by-elections are waited on? That is a whole new hung parliament ball game.

The next federal election is currently due mid-2019, but if the federal parliament goes further down the rabbit hole, a snap election would become a live option for the Prime Minister to call to dispense with a series of by-elections and essentially reset the parliament.

No Audit, But PM Clears 2017

Didn't the PM fix this yesterday?

Turnbull and his Cabinet certainly shifted and acknowledged calls for greater transparency but his proposal, for which he is seeking the support of Labor, is no full independent audit and appears designed to give the Government a little breathing space.

Under the plan all federal politicians will be required to publicly detail their citizenship history within 21 days of the individual houses of Parliament approving the measure.

It is a demand to declare to the register of Members' Interests whether he or she was not, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, a citizen of any country other than Australia -- and failure to do so would be contempt of Parliament. But it is still a voluntary disclosure proposal.

It has to be noted that omissions or incorrect additions to the register are reasonably common and are usually only uncovered through diggings by the media.

Malcolm Turnbull concedes 'consequences' for government if citizenship claims more MPs https://t.co/KPYRbMKqYJ via @fergushunter #auspol — Federal Politics (@PoliticsFairfax) November 6, 2017

There is no mention of ""entitlement"" to citizenship in the proposed declaration, a key part of the High Court's citizenship ruling. And while parliamentarians are asked to detail the place and date of the birth of parents, there is no requirement to declare the place and date of the birth of grandparents.

The onus remains on the MP and Senator, and Turnbull is not about to create a ""huge audit office"".

""If you are going to be in a position where you say you do not trust anything any member of Parliament says in their disclosures, then ... you would literally be creating a huge audit office,"" Turnbull said on Tuesday.

""The system of voluntary disclosure with obviously very heavy penalties, political penalties and personal reputational penalties of people, you know, to conceal things or don't disclose things honestly, I think that works and I think it will work well here.""

The House sits for two more weeks in 2017 so the proposed 21-day time-frame, if passed, covers the rest of the year, the fragile period for the Government period without a Member for New England shoring up the working majority.

Labor's Penny Wong has described the proposal as a ""blatant attempt to skate through this difficult period to next year.""

But What About John Alexander?

We simply don't know yet but the Member for Bennelong is urgently checking his citizenship status.

Under the British Nationality Act 1948, people born to British citizens are automatically given citizenship of the UK by descent.

Alexander was born in 1951 to a British born father.

If he is a dual citizen it will trigger a by-election. He is not in a safe seat. He'd indicated he was going to retire at the next election.

""John Alexander has stated publicly and this is what he said to the party, that he believes he is not a dual citizen,"" Turnbull told RN Breakfast on Tuesday.

But that is where the PM's Alexander commentary ends.

""I am not going to start front running this process,"" he said. ""We have got respect the process that is set up in the electoral act and the constitution. People should make their declarations and then cases can be referred.

""If a member believes that are a dual citizen now and are ineligible to sit in the parliament then they should resign.""

But, then this.

""I take it as a given that every member of the house and the Senate, as of today, believes that they are eligible to sit in the house or the Senate,"" Turnbull stated.

Labor's Penny Wong says John Alexander must be referred to the High Court. — Karen Barlow (@KJBar) November 7, 2017

Alexander ""believes"" he is an Australian citizen but at this point there is no proof and it is yet to be proven.

""My father was born in the United Kingdom in 1907, before moving to Australia as a very young child. He became an Australian Citizen as soon as he could. I understand he renounced his British citizenship before I was born, because he was a proud Australian. I was born in 1951 as an Australian citizen."" John Alexander MP statement

Referendum?

Is the Constitution outdated? Does it need to be changed to reflect Australia's multicultural society?

Liberal MP Craig Laundy wants a referendum to allow MPs to be dual citizens as he is concerned that dual citizenship had been ""demonised"" and said he would rather people ""celebrated"" it.

""I just don't think it should be a reason you should be disqualified from standing for parliament,"" he told the ABC.

Leaving aside that referendums are notoriously difficult to successfully pass and there is a look here that abolishing Section 44 (i) may be politicians looking after their own jobs, the prime minister is pushing back on main argument of having dual citizens in parliament.

""I think it's questionable whether Australians would welcome dual citizens sitting in their Parliament,"" Turnbull said.

""Craig's raised that point. It's a fair point and, in many countries, dual citizenship – like the UK – is not a bar. But I think the more direct question is, should you be disqualified by a foreign citizenship of which you have no knowledge and which you have never accepted.""

He is sending all this to a committee, the joint standing on electoral matters, ""and we have to look at, um, a couple of things"".

There are possibly changes coming to prevent a situation where MPs inadvertently become foreign citizens of other countries.

But for now there's a constitutional mess on the floors of Parliament and how it's mopped up remains to be seen.","Australia Is Standing In A Constitutional Mess, And John Alexander Is The Latest Headache For Turnbull",http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/06/australia-is-standing-in-a-constitutional-mess-and-john-alexander-is-the-latest-headache-for-turnbull_a_23268773/

""Pregate per me e per la mia famiglia e per gli altri indagati che nulla c'entrano in questa storia"", aggiunge De Luca.

Cateno De Luca è finito in manette questa mattina, ad appena due giorni dalla sua elezione nelle fila dell'Udc con oltre 5 mila preferenze. Il suo nome rientra tra gli impresentabili che hanno aiutato Nello Musumeci a vincere la contesa elettorale siciliana.

De Luca è stato arrestato, in esecuzione di un provvedimento cautelare emesso dal Gip del Tribunale di Messina a conclusione di articolate e complesse indagini coordinate dalla Procura della Repubblica di Messina, dai militari del Nucleo di Polizia Tributaria della Guardia di Finanza di Messina e della Compagnia Carabinieri di Messina Sud. Il parlamentare è stato sottoposto alla misura cautelare degli arresti domiciliari. Con lui ai domiciliari anche Carmelo Satta. I due sono finiti agli arresti, ""in qualità di promotori di un'associazione per delinquere finalizzata alla realizzazione di una rilevante evasione fiscale di circa 1.750.000 euro"", come dice la Gdf. Nel dettaglio, attraverso le indagini è stato individuato ""un complesso reticolo societario facente capo alla Federazione Nazionale Autonoma Piccoli Imprenditori ed alla società Caf Fe.Na.Pi srl, riconducibile, direttamente o indirettamente, a De Luca e a Saitta, utilizzato, nel corso del tempo, per porre in essere un sofisticato sistema di fatturazioni fittizie finalizzate all'evasione delle imposte dirette ed indirette"", dicono gli inquirenti.

Chi è ""sCateno"" De Luca. Il feudo messinese, due arresti e la lotta contro la ""malarazza politica""

In sintesi, lo schema evasivo emerso prevedeva l'imputazione di costi inesistenti, da parte della Federazione Nazionale a vantaggio del Caf fenapi s.r.l., ""individuato quale principale centro degli interessi economici del sodalizio criminale. La frode si è sviluppata basandosi sul trasferimento di materia imponibile dal Caf alla Federazione Nazionale, in virtù del regime fiscale di favore applicato a quest'ultima, che ha determinato un notevole risparmio di imposta"". Al termine dell'attività investigativa è stato individuato un indebito risparmio di imposta pari a circa 1.750.000 (sia ai fini Iva che delle Imposte sui redditi delle società). Oltre alle due persone sottoposte agli arresti, sono state deferite a piede libero altri 8 associati. Contestualmente è stata disposta l'esecuzione del sequestro preventivo per equivalente fino all'ammontare dell'indebito risparmio di imposta, sia nei confronti degli arrestati che nei confronti della società Caf Fenapi s.r.l., nei cui confronti è stata applicata la normativa in materia di responsabilità amministrativa degli enti.

Cateno De Luca è accusato di associazione per delinquere finalizzata alla commissione di delitti in materia di imposte sui redditi e sul valore aggiunto. Inoltre, gli viene contestato, insieme con gli altri indagati, il reato associativo. Il neo deputato regionale Udc era già finito in manette nell'ambito dell'inchiesta per i lavori realizzati a Fiumedinisi (Messina). Di recente la Procura ha chiesto per lui la condanna a 5 anni di carcere. La sentenza è attesa prima di Natale. De Luca aveva chiesto alla Suprema Corte di trasferire a Reggio Calabria il processo che lo vede imputato. Ma per i giudici della Suprema Corte il ricorso non è trattabile. Quindi il processo resta a Messina.

La nota dell'Udc. ""L'Udc ha appreso dalla stampa la notizia dell'arresto di De Luca. L'Udc ha avuto la massima diligenza nella formazione delle liste elettorali a tutela del partito e dei cittadini-elettori. Abbiamo chiesto a tutti i candidati dell'Udc e dei movimenti ad esso associati tra cui anche Sicilia Vera il certificato del casellario giudiziario e quello dei carichi pendenti a tutela dei cittadini e della onorabilità del partito"" si legge in una nota diffusa dall'ufficio stampa nazionale del partito. ""Abbiamo fiducia nella magistratura che siamo certi porterà all'accertamento della verità e siamo convinti che De Luca sarà in grado di chiarire i fatti e di dimostrare la sua innocenza"".

Musumeci: ""Io prudente anche sulla Giunta"". ""Se nella fase di composizione delle liste qualcuno non ha seguito i miei reiterati inviti alla prudenza, tutte le scelte che dipenderanno da me, invece, saranno improntate a questo criterio, nel rispetto delle mie convinzioni e in coerenza con la mia storia personale, a cominciare dalla formazione della giunta"". Così il presidente della Regione siciliana Nello Musumeci, sull'arresto del deputato dell'Udc Cateno De Luca.

""I provvedimenti della magistratura, alla quale rinnovo fiducia e apprezzamento, si rispettano e non si commentano"" ha aggiunto Musumeci.

Este fue el caso del actor Francis Lorenzo, que compitió en la prueba de exteriores del último programa, ya que Silvia Abril no pudo participar por problemas de salud.

""Aunque ella es fuerte y luchadora, se ha puesto enferma y no está en condiciones de competir hoy"", contó Eva González nada más presentar la segunda prueba del programa. A continuación presentó al que sería el sustituto de la humorista, que tendría la responsabilidad de salvarla o mandarla a la prueba de eliminación con la actuación de su equipo. Un hecho inédito en las distintas ediciones de Masterchef.

En un principio, Lorenzo participaría con Anabel Alonso —ya nominada para la prueba de eliminación— y Edu Soto, pero el jurado decidió cambiar las formaciones y que Lorenzo se cambiase con Saúl Craviotto. De esta manera, el actor pasó al equipo de José Corbacho y Patricia Montero, y Craviotto compitió junto a Alonso y Soto.

El nuevo concursante, al ser gallego y la prueba de exteriores en la Ribiera Sacra (Orense), fue gratamente recibido por sus compañeros. Primero por parte de Anabel Alonso y después por Patricia Montero, ambas justificando su agrado porque ""sabe lo que se cuece en Galicia"". Por su parte, Lorenzo declaró antes de comenzar que estaba ""entre asustado y muy asustado"".

La nueva incorporación causó cierta confusión entre el público que, si se había perdido parte del concurso, no entendía dónde estaba Silvia Abril y por qué estaba Francis Lorenzo en el programa.

A pesar del buen cocinado del actor, este no pudo evitar que su equipo —y, por tanto, también Silvia Abril— acabara vistiendo el delantal negro de la eliminación. ""Me he sentido un poco asustado, ves la responsabilidad que tienen y que ellos se la están jugando. Estoy muy satisfecho"", confesó Lorenzo antes de recibir el veredicto del jurado.

La buena actitud del nuevo participante llevó a que desde el jurado le animasen a participar en la próxima edición del programa. ""Yo que tú me empezaría a plantear formar parte de la tercera edición. Tienes potencial de sobra"", le motivó Pepe Rodríguez. A pesar de esto, parecía que formar parte del reality no entraba inicialmente en sus planes: ""No me lo había pensado, pero visto la experiencia..."".

Sin embargo, esta no era la primera vez que el actor aparecía en el programa. El pasado 17 de octubre, Lorenzo se encontraba entre los famosos que degustaron los platos de los concursantes. Entonces, incluso se atrevió a decir que le faltaba ""un poquito de sal"" al plato en cuestión. ¿Se imaginaría unos programas después entre los fogones?

The announcement came at the 23rd Conference of the Parties in Bonn, Germany, the world’s biggest climate conference. The non-binding Paris accord, through which signatories pledge to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases over the coming decades, was brokered in 2015, when the annual conference was held in the French capital.

The deal was considered historic because it was the first climate agreement to include the U.S. ― the world’s biggest historic emitter, with by far the largest per-capita carbon footprint ― and China, which currently produces the most carbon pollution on a national level. The U.S. took a lead role in shaping the deal.

Only war-torn Syria and Nicaragua, which protested the agreement’s failure to impose strict demands on major polluters, refused to sign.

But President Donald Trump, who rejects scientists’ warnings about climate change, announced plans to withdraw from the pact in June, insisting developing nations received more benefits and the U.S. got none. In his announcement ― which, under the terms of the deal, fully can’t go into effect until November 2020 ― Trump seemed to conflate the accord with a trade deal, demonstrating what was widely described as a poor understanding of how the Paris agreement actually works.

“Like the playground bully that eventually loses all his friends, Donald Trump has isolated himself on the world stage,” Joe Ware, a spokesman for the charity Christian Aid, said in a statement. “When even Syria, with all its problems, can see the sense of a global climate agreement it really shows how ideologically wedded to climate denialism the US Republican Party has become.”","Syria Vows To Sign Paris Agreement, Leaving U.S. Alone In Climate Denial",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/07/syria-vows-to-sign-paris-agreement-leaving-u-s-alone-in-climate-denial_a_23270127/

Swift has yet to respond to the ACLU's letter, as well as HuffPost's request for comment.","Weary of simple pop music spats, Taylor Swift now has a new feuding partner: the ACLU.

The singer has landed in the watchdog organization's crosshairs after her lawyer sent an intimidating letter to the website PopFront regarding a recent article about Swift's popularity among white supremacists.

In a piece titled, ""Swiftly to the alt-right: Taylor subtly gets the lower case kkk in formation,"" writer Meghan Herning argues that Swift's new single ""Look What You Made Me Do"" serves as a ""subtle, quiet white support of a racial hierarchy"" by positioning the singer alongside the history of the eugenics movement and the rise of neo-Nazis.

William J. Briggs, a lawyer representing Swift, wrote in a letter to Herning that her PopFront article is a ""provably false and defamatory story"" that will result in a lawsuit if the website refuses to issue a retraction or take down the post.

""It appears to be a malicious attack against Ms. Swift that goes to great lengths to portray Ms. Swift as some sort of white supremacist figurehead, which is a baseless fiction masquerading as fact and completely misrepresents Ms. Swift,"" Briggs wrote.

The letter also defends Swift's political silence in the last presidential election as a personal choice, as she has ""no obligation to campaign for any particular political candidate or broadcast her political views.""

Herning shared the letter with the ACLU, which is now defending the blogger against any legal threats against her, calling Briggs' claims ""meritless."" In the eyes of the organization, the article is a ""mix of political speech and critical commentary"" that falls within the protections of the First Amendment.

""This is a completely unsupported attempt to suppress constitutionally protected speech,"" Michael Risher, an attorney for ACLU of Northern California, said in a press release.

""Intimidation tactics like these are unacceptable,"" Matt Cagle, another attorney with the organization, added. ""Not in her wildest dreams can Ms. Swift use copyright law to suppress this exposure of a threat to constitutionally protected speech.""

Swift has taken legal action against claims of this nature before. The singer has been heralded as a white supremacist hero in the dark corners of the internet by those who've described the pop star as an ""Aryan goddess.""

Dabei blenden sie deren Verbrechen aus

Auch Medien vermitteln teilweise ein falsches Bild der ""Oktoberrevolution""

Würde ein öffentlich-rechtlicher Sender in Deutschland die Machtergreifung von Mussolini und seinen Faschisten in Italien feiern? Den Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkriegs? Oder den Jahrestag eines Putsches in Südamerika?

Aus guten Gründen käme sicher kein Redakteur jemals auf so eine Idee.

Ganz anders, wenn es um den Kommunismus geht.

Der öffentlich-rechtliche, deutsch-französische Sender Arte kündigte auf seiner Facebook-Seite an, er werde die russische ""Oktoberrevolution"", die sich am 7. November zum 100. Mal jährt, mit zahlreichen Beiträgen ""feiern"".

Alles spricht dafür, dass es sich bei der Formulierung nur um den Missgriff eines einzelnen Mitarbeiters handelt – denn die Sendungen selbst, die Arte zur Oktoberrevolution sendete, waren kritisch und wurden dem tragischen Ereignis durchaus gerecht.

Sympathie für Lenins Putsch

Aber es ist kein Zufall, dass sich ein Journalist so vergaloppieren konnte. Und dass der Post mit dem ""feiern"" tagelang online blieb – und erst nach Berichten darüber in den sozialen Netzwerken kommentarlos von der Seite verschwand.

Der verbale Missgriff auf der Arte-Seite ist ein Symptom – und auch nur deshalb der Erwähnung wert: Bis hinein in weite Teile der politischen Elite in Deutschland herrscht heute noch eine, zuweilen klammheimliche, zuweilen offene Sympathie für Lenins Putsch, der zu den größten Tragödien des 21. Jahrhunderts gehört.

In Berlin, Hamburg und Bremen gab es Umzüge zur Feier der Revolution; mitsamt sowjetischem Panzer und Attrappen des Panzerkreuzers Aurora feierten Kommunisten ausgelassen die Machtübernahme durch Lenin und seine Komplizen. Was für ein Hohn für die Opfer von Stasi & Co., von denen immer noch viele gerade in Berlin leben.

Gräuel Stalins werden ignoriert

Dass der Kommunismus ein schrecklicher Irrweg der Geschichte war – darüber herrscht kein grundlegender, über alle politischen Lager gehenden Konsens, wie wir ihn beim Faschismus haben.

Gäbe es diesen Konsens, wären verbale Entgleisungen wie das ""feiern"" der Oktoberrevolution ein Tabu. Und so würden zumindest so schnell wieder von der Seite eines öffentlich-rechtlichen Senders verschwinden wie sie dort veröffentlicht wurden.

Viele haben die Lehre des großen Sozialdemokraten Kurt Schumacher vergessen, wonach die Kommunisten (unter Stalin) nichts anderes als ""rot lackierte Nazis"" seien. Vergessen ist auch, dass Stalin nach Kriegsende seine Gegner, darunter auch Sozialdemokraten, wieder in den alten, von ihm wieder eröffneten Konzentrationslagern der Nazis einsperren ließ.

Schumachers Urteil zeigt, wie zynisch die in Deutschland immer noch weit verbreitete Unsitte ist, die unglaublichen Verbrechen von Hitler und seinem Regime zu instrumentalisieren, um Stalin und Lenin zu relativieren und verharmlosen.

Falsche Berichte über die Revolution

Wer Diktatur und Massenmord durch den Vergleich mit Hitler schönredet, verhöhnt auf unerträgliche Weise die Opfer.

Der Terror der Kommunisten gegen ihre eigenen Völker, die Millionen Opfer – all das ist im Bewusstsein vieler Menschen in Deutschland (und anderswo) nicht (mehr) verankert. Die Ursache dafür liegt teilweise schon im Schulunterricht.

Selbst in den Medien sind die Wissenslücken zum Teil gewaltig: So schrieb eine große deutsche Tageszeitung dieser Tage, Lenin habe 1917 den Zaren gestürzt und die Monarchie in Russland beendet.

Genau das war aber schon im Februar 1917 geschehen, bei der Februar-Revolution, als Lenin noch im Ausland war. Die damals entstandene provisorische Regierung wollte Russland zu einer Demokratie machen.

Die ""Oktoberrevolution"" war ein klassischer Putsch

In den USA ist die Lage nicht besser. Ein Drittel der jungen Amerikaner glaubt laut einer Umfrage des Instituts YouGov von 2016, dass unter Stalin weniger Menschen getötet wurden als unter George W. Bush.

Die Verklärung der Ereignisse vom 7. November (nach dem damals in Russland gültigen Kalender war es der 25. Oktober) zeigt sich schon darin, wie wir sie nennen: Unter Revolution verstehen wir heutzutage zumeist eine radikale Veränderung der Verhältnisse, die von unten ausgeht, also von den Menschen.

Dass Lenin am 7. November 1917 die Minister der Provisorischen Regierung festnehmen ließ, war ein klassischer Putsch. Treffender wäre also der Begriff ""Oktober-Putsch"" statt ""Oktober-Revolution"".

Auch in der frühen Sowjetunion wurde das Wort ""Revolution"" nicht gebraucht. Erst Stalin führte es in den 1920er Jahren ein, wie der russische Philosoph Igor Tschubais betont.

Lenin lässt Gegner erschießen

Auch den legendären ""Sturm auf den Winterpalast"" in Sankt Petersburg hat es demzufolge nie gegeben – die Wachen ließen Lenins Handvoll Kämpfer kampflos und unspektakulär in das Gebäude.

Bei den freien Wahlen im November 1917 erhielten Lenins Bolschewiken nur rund 25 Prozent.

Als die frisch gewählte Verfassungsgebende Versammlung im Januar die Erlasse Lenins für illegal erklärte, ließ dieser sie einfach auflösen – und auf Demonstranten schießen, die für ihre gewählten Vertreter auf die Straße gingen. Lenins Schwergen töteten mehr als hundert Menschen.

Nicht mehr als ein Tropfen in dem Meer von Blut, dass die Bolschewiken später anrichteten.

Putin hält Lenin für einen Verräter

Selbst Wladimir Putin, sonst Sowjet-Nostalgiker, hält sich auffallend zurück, was Lenin und die Oktoberrevolution angeht.

Mehr noch: Der heutige russische Präsident warf Lenin vor, er habe eine Atombombe unter den russischen Staat gelegt.

""Putin setzt ganz offensichtlich große Stücke auf Stalin, aber nicht auf Lenin"", glaubt der Philosoph Tschubais: ""Lenin hält er zurecht für einen Verräter, der im Auftrag der damaligen deutschen Regierung handelte.""

Diese Version der Geschichte ist in Moskau derzeit weit verbreitet: Der große Revolutionsheld als eine Marionette der Obersten Heeresführung in Berlin, die mit seiner Hilfe den Kriegsgegner Russland schwächen wollte. Und tatsächlich war einer der ersten Erlasse Lenins, einen Tag nach seiner Machtergreifung, die Kapitulation Russlands, auf die Kaiser Wilhelm II. in Berlin gehofft hatte.

An den Folgen der ""Oktoberrevolution"" leidet Russland bis heute

Stalin dagegen ist in den Augen von Putin und der KGB-Männer aus seinem Umfeld der Retter ihres Vaterlands im Zweiten Weltkrieg. Wobei sie geflissentlich ausblenden, dass ihr Idol in diesem zwei Jahre lang auf der falschen Seite kämpfte und als Komplize Hitlers zahlreiche Länder überfiel und besetzte.

All das betrachten Putin und seine Gefährten ebenso wie den Terror als ""Kollateralschaden"" auf dem Weg zum Sieg.

Massenterror gegen die eigene Bevölkerung, bei dem jeder zu jeder Zeit willkürlich Opfer werden konnte, der GULAG, der Hunger-Terror gegen das eigene Volk, Abermillionen Toter – das sind nur die schlimmsten Folgen der „Oktoberrevolution“. Die Liste der Verbrechen und verheerenden Folgen des bolschewistischen Umsturzes ließe sich schier endlos fortsetzen.

Lenin setzte explizit das Recht außer Kraft, auch das Völkerrecht.

An den Folgen der ""Oktoberrevolution"" leidet Russland bis heute

An den Folgen leidet Russland bis heute. Selbst der Putin-Intimus Dmitrij Medwedew beklagte, im Land herrsche Rechtsnihilismus – freilich ohne auf dessen Wurzeln hinzuweisen.

Stalin beging Völkermord am eigenen Volk, schreibt der Philosoph Tschubais.

Man müsste wohl hinzufügen, dass er auch das Bewusstsein seines Volkes massiv beschädigte. Er pervertierte die Moral, normalisierte die Lüge, versuchte, die Geschichte auszuradieren. Und er pflanzte den Verfolgungswahn tief im Bewusstsein der politischen Elite ein.

All das tat er im Namen des ""Guten"".

Die Schrecken des Kommunismus werden in Moskau heute allenfalls beiläufig erwähnt. In Russland denken laut Umfragen heute 46 Prozent der Menschen positiv über Stalin. Als unentschuldbares Verbrechen betrachten seinen Terror gegen die eigenen Bürger nur noch 39 Prozent.

Putins Propaganda wirkt.

Warum gibt es in Deutschland eine solche Sympathie für den Kommunismus?

Umso erstaunlicher ist es aber, dass auch im Westen noch so viel Sympathie für das sowjetische System herrsct.

Die Begeisterung für Stalin bei westlichen Intellektuellen wie Jean-Paul Sartre oder Lion Feuchtwanger, die seine Verbrechen beschönigten und so zu Komplizen wurde, ist nie richtig aufgearbeitet worden.

Dies ist wohl einer der Gründe dafür, warum Verteidiger von Putin wie Altkanzler Gerhard Schröder oder die Ex-ARD-Korrespondentin Gabriele Krone-Schmalz heute noch auf relativ große Zustimmung bei Russlandfreunden in Deutschland stoßen.

Die Methoden, die Putins Helfer nutzen, erinnern an die von Stalins ausländischen Unterstützern: Kritik an dem Herrscher im Kreml wurde gleichgesetzt mit Kritik am Land. Der Hinweis auf Missstände wurde als ""antikommunistische Hetze"" (heute: ""Dämonisierung"") und ""überdrehte Medienkampagne"" hingestellt, mit denen der Westen von den eigenen Verbrechen ablenken wolle.

Wagenknecht hat sich nie von Stalins Verbrechen distanziert

Besonders unerklärlich sind die Sympathien für den Kommunismus in Deutschland, das unter der Teilung, der Berliner Mauer und der Unterdrückung durch Stalin und seine Schergen viel stärker litt als seine westlichen Nachbarn.

Mit der ""Linken"" ist heute die umbenannte SED so gut wie in der politischen Mitte Deutschlands angekommen. Stalins politische Ur-Enkel haben sich nie überzeugend von der DDR distanziert. Doch das scheint viele nicht zu stören in Deutschland.

Wie selbstverständlich beteiligt sich die ""Linke"" aktiv am ""Kampf gegen Rechts"" - so als drohe eine Gefahr für die Demokratie nur aus dieser Richtung.

Sahra Wagenknecht ist gern gesehener Gast in Talkshows und mitten in der Gesellschaft angekommen – eine Frau, die sich nie überzeugend von ihrer früheren Sympathie für den Massenmörder Stalin distanziert hat.

Für wie selbstverständlich wir inzwischen die weit verbreitete Sehschwäche auf dem linken Auge halten, zeigt die Reaktion auf die massive linke Gewalt beim G20-Gipfel in Hamburg diesen Sommer. Teile unserer Medien und Politik reagierten mit Feindseligkeiten gegen die Polizei und manchmal kaum verhohlenem Verständnis für die Gewalttäter.

Die Lehren der Geschichte

Wer Gewalt anwende, sei kein Linker, weil Linke ja gegen Gewalt seien – so ein damals weit verbreitetes Credo, das sich auch SPD-Vize Stegner zu eigen machte.

Im ""Spiegel"" war gar sinngemäß zu lesen, linker gewaltbereiter Extremismus sei nicht mit rechtem gewaltbereiten Extremismus zu vergleichen, weil ersterer ja guten Zwecken diene und letzterer nicht.

Wer so argumentiert, hat aus der Geschichte nichts gelernt. Und zeigt ein fast schon infantiles Schwarz-Weiß-Denken.

Gerade sollten wir uns wieder die Lehren der Geschichte bewusstmachen: Wo immer sich Machthaber, mit welcher Begründung auch immer, über das Gesetz stellen, wo immer staatliche Gewalt missbraucht wird, um Andersdenkende zu unterdrücken, müssen wir das nicht nur verurteilen – sondern alles in unserer Macht Stehende dagegen tun.

Wer auch immer Demokratie, Freiheit und Rechtsstaat in Frage stellt, verdient keine Sympathie, sondern unseren entschiedenen Widerstand. Ganz egal, aus welcher politischen Ecke er kommt. Und welche angeblich hehren Ziele er als Begründung nennt. Die Geschichte zeigt: Das Böse ist immer dann besonders gefährlich, wenn es im Gewand des Guten daherkommt.

Every time a film presents different versions of the same story, the film critics can't help but compare it to Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950). A couple of examples that come to mind are Rakhi Gulzar's Talvar (2015) and Sudhir Mishra's Inkaar (2013). In Abhay Chopra's Ittefaq, a remake of the 1969 film of the same name, we learn that a famous author is charged for committing two murders on the same night: his wife, and a lawyer whose house he accidentally breaks into while trying to escape.

Throughout the interrogation, the author maintains that he is innocent. However, his account of what actually happened that night completely differs from the account of the dead lawyer's wife. Now, all those who have compared Ittefaq with Rashomon are clearly missing the point. The fact of the matter is that in Rashomon, Kurosawa never makes an attempt to lead the viewer. He merely shows us the same event from four different points of view. Rashomon doesn't feed us with lies, only the different faces of truth. Ittefaq, on the other hands, keeps feeding us with lies. Alas, even the lies are not good enough to be deemed believable!

When a Rohit Shetty no-brainer like Golmaal Again (2017) tells you ""Iss Diwali Logic Nahin Sirf Magic"", you can perhaps afford to suspend logic but when a murder mystery expects you to forget logic then you just can't help but question the competency of the makers.

When a Rohit Shetty no-brainer like ""Golmaal Again"" (2017) tells you ""Iss Diwali Logic Nahin Sirf Magic"", you can perhaps afford to suspend logic but when a murder mystery expects you to forget logic then you just can't help but question the competency of the makers. Now, Ittefaq has been described as smart and gripping by some. While the film is certainly gripping for the most part, calling it smart would be a grave misjudgment. In Ittefaq's big reveal towards the end, the killer, minutes before boarding an international flight, confesses to the investigating officer during a telephonic conversation and offers a detailed account of the chain of events leading to the crime.

The officer is so thrilled to hear the killer's exhilarating account that he just doesn't seem interested in exercising the protocol needed to prevent the airplane from taking off. If that's not difficult enough to digest then just imagine how the police, during the course of investigation, can't figure out that the author's wife happened to be a client of the lawyer's. Isn't this connection the key to solving the two murders? How come an investigating officer who is smart enough to trace the hidden murder weapon is unable to figure out this basic fact? The film very conveniently tries to mislead us for nearly two hours, only to set us up for one lofty final twist in the vein of The Usual Suspects, merely adding insult to injury.

""When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.""

Whenever one speaks of crime and investigation a reference to Sir Authur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes is inevitable. ""When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth,"" says the super-sleuth in the short story titled ""The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier"" (1926). Ittefaq fails to pay any heed to this basic science of deduction . The end result is an average whodunit that seems to have little regard for the viewer's intelligence. Another time tested tool to assess suspense thrillers is to watch them a second or a third time. While films like ""Murder on the Orient Express"" (2017), "" Gone Girl "" (2014), ""Teesri Manzil"" (1966), ""Manorama Six Feet Under"" (2007) and "" Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! "" (2015) would hold up well on subsequent viewings, an average film like Ittefaq will most likely struggle to hold the viewer's attention during a second or a third viewing. In comparison to the remake, the original, directed by Yash Chopra, is more than capable of holding the viewer's attention on subsequent viewings, even after all these years.

Usually it's the movie's plot and performances that can make it worthy of subsequent viewings. The editing, direction, cinematography and background score can of course immen sely add to the overall experience. Take the case of Shekhar Kapoor and Karan Razdan-directed detective television series ""Tehkikaat"" which used to air on Doordarshan during the mid-90s. While the performances were a wee bit melodramatic and the plots often lacked the brilliance of a Sherlock Holmes or a Byomkesh Bakshi, the chilling background score and the camerawork added a different layer of mystery.

It's a bit perplexing to think why the makers, especially given its co-produced by Dharma Productions, Red Chillies Entertainment, and B.R. Studios, didn't focus on at least getting a strong background score in place? With the exception of Akshaye Khanna, Ittefaq is also quite average on the acting front. While Sonakshi Sinha has her moments in the movie, Sidharth Malhotra looks a bit flat. But he alone can't be blamed for it, for an average part requires an above-average actor. Given his limitations as a performer, Sidharth seems to have tried his best but unfortunately on this occasion his best just doesn't turn out to be good enough. Ittefaq offers promise to begin with but ultimately it fails to leave any lasting impact. The film can serve as a decent way to spend your free time when you have nothing better to indulge in and that too only as long as you can do away with any logical thinking.

Due anni dopo sarebbe arrivata la condanna definitiva con la conseguente perdita dello scranno a Palazzo Madama. Pallettoni che avrebbero abbattuto una mandria di bisonti ma non lui, che non più 36 ore fa esultava per la vittoria di Musumeci in Sicilia, per il rinnovato peso politico e il futuro roseo per la coalizione di centrodestra che si accinge a guidare per la settima volta consecutiva alle elezioni politiche.

Le ultime che vinse furono quelle del 2008 contro Veltroni, all'epoca rampantissimo sindaco di Roma e segretario del neocostituito Partito democratico. Da qualche settimana Walter, che non è più parlamentare dal 2013, è tornato sotto i riflettori: applauditissimo durante l'intervento per i 10 anni del Pd, così come alla prima teatrale di ""Ciao"", pièce teatrale tratta dal suo omonimo romanzo narrante il dolore per il mancato rapporto con il padre, il grande Vittorio, scomparso quando egli aveva un anno, Walter è tornato in tv per presentare un nuovo libro e inizia a essere invocato come guida per i democrat in alternativa a Renzi.

Uno scenario al momento lontano ma non fantascientifico, che vedrebbe confrontarsi nuovamente Berlusconi e Veltroni, con le lancette dell'orologio riportate indietro di 10 anni esatti; in politica un'era geologica, in cui infatti è capitato di tutto. Si stava meglio quando si stava peggio? Forse sì, perché il nuovismo non sempre è sinonimo di qualità, anzi!

Nel 2008 il quadro politico era più semplice. Contestualmente al Pd, che accorpava le due grandi famiglie eredi del comunismo e del cattolicesimo di sinistra, era nato il Popolo della Libertà che invece assemblava i moderati con i post missini. Due grandi partiti, due poli e un sistema che guardava, finalmente, al mondo anglosassone. Sarebbe bastato adeguare alla fotografia uscita dalle urne, che punirono ali estreme e frammenti riottosi di movimentucoli, una legge elettorale decente e magari, perché no? Anche investire finalmente sul presidenzialismo, per aumentare stabilità e governabilità.

Certo non era prevedibile una crescita così repentina di un terzo polo come quello del Movimento 5 stelle, ma la XVI Legislatura resta un'occasione persa, anche perché il Pdl, che ottenne la più grande maggioranza della storia repubblicana, invece fu il primo a sfarinare a causa delle ambizioni del suo cofondatore Gianfranco Fini. La strada intrapresa 10 anni fa dei due grandi partiti, uno progressista, l'altro moderato, era giusta e quel solco andava difeso con maggior vigoria, dagli stessi protagonisti che l'avevano ispirato. Il resto è stato tutta una scissione, praticamente ovunque. Senza più un'adesione ideologica i parlamentari hanno indossato più casacche di Vieri e Ibrahimovic messi insieme, il dibattito interno ai partiti è sempre sfociato in divorzi, che hanno alimentato altri partiti/movimenti facendo tornare il quadro un variegato patchwork con una governabilità sempre più miraggio.

En Nueva Jersey, feudo de Chris Christie, uno de los principales asesores de Trump en su campaña hacia la presidencia del país, el candidato demócrata, Philip Murphy, ha arrebatado la gobernación a los republicanos.

Christie es gobernador desde 2010, pero esta vez no se ha presentado porque no podía optar a un tercer mandato, así que Murphy se ha batido con la hasta ahora vicegobernadora del estado, Kim Guadagno. Con el 71% escrutado, Murphy ha obtenido el 55,6% de los votos, mientras que Guadagno ha logrado el 42,5%.

En Virgina, los demócratas han mantenido la gobernación gracias a la victoria de su candidato, Ralph Northam, frente al republicano, Ed Gillespie.

Con el escrutinio casi completo (99%), Northam ha obtenido un 53,6% de los votos por un 45,2% de Gillespie, que se había alejado de Trump para mostrar un perfil moderado en un estado en el que los demócratas se han ido fortaleciendo en las últimas décadas.

Pese a ese distanciamiento, Gillespie ha protagonizado una campaña marcada por el rechazo a la inmigración ilegal.

A través de Twitter, Trump, que está en Corea del Sur, ha reaccionado a la derrota de Gillespie: ""Ed Gillespie trabajó duro pero no me abrazó a mí ni lo que yo defiendo"". Pese a las derrota en Virginia y Nueva Jersey, Trump ha asegurado que los republicanos ""seguirán ganando, incluso más que antes"".

MONTREAL — The concept of ""western alienation"" is real and dangerous, and people in the region feel as though their aspirations aren't in line with those in the rest of Canada, Rona Ambrose said Tuesday.

""We have a population in Alberta feeling as though their goals aren't part of the federation's goals — it's dangerous,"" the former interim Tory leader told an audience in Montreal as they celebrated the opening of a new school of public policy at McGill University.

She said one incident that recently provoked sentiments of alienation in Western Canada was the rejoicing of politicians in Quebec — notably outgoing Montreal mayor Denis Coderre — to news that TransCanada was abandoning its Energy East pipeline project.

She added the ill-fated plan to ship Alberta crude through Quebec to a port in New Brunswick for refining and sale overseas represented ""hope"" for Albertans, who have been suffering economically since the price of oil fell several years ago.

Former interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose speaks during question period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Dec. 6, 2016.

Ambrose cited opposition inside neighbouring British Columbia to the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline expansion as another factor leading western Canadians to question their place in the country.

""Over a short time frame, (opposition to energy projects) has become a political issue on the ground,"" said Ambrose, who spent 13 years representing citizens in Alberta at the federal level and served as interim Conservative leader.

""It's getting easy to stir up feelings of alienation — it's not good for the federation.""

She said the idea that western Canadians, especially Albertans, are increasingly feeling out of place inside the vision of Canada put forward by the current federal government ""is very real.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been criticized for lacking enthusiasm for getting Canada's oil and gas resources to market.

The Conservatives blame Trudeau's government for the failure of Energy East while Ottawa says the company's decision to cancel the project was due to business considerations.

PM has westerners wondering if Canada values them: Wall

Hard feelings in Western Canada toward Ottawa were summed up recently by Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall:

""(Trudeau's) actions and his government's actions may well have some westerners wondering if this country really values Western Canada, the resources we have, and the things we do to contribute to the national economy and to quality of life for all,"" he said.

Ambrose was among several prominent Canadians on hand to celebrate the opening of a school of public policy made possible by a $10-million donation by the Max Bell Foundation.

Former prime minister Paul Martin as well as Michael Sabia, president and CEO of the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, were among those who spoke at the event.

Ambrose retired from politics last summer and is now a Global Fellow for the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, which is based in Washington, D.C.

Dans un article publié ce mercredi 8 novembre, dans La Presse+, Katia Gagnon et Stéphanie Vallet, qui sont à l'origine de l'affaire Éric Salvail, révèlent les confidences d'une vingtaine de comédiens et techniciens ayant travaillé avec le réalisateur.

On lui reproche notamment d'humilier ses collègues de travail, de placer les actrices dans des positions inconfortables durant les auditions, de faire des blagues de mauvais goût et de boire sur les plateaux de tournage.

«J'ai vu le premier assistant de Sylvain Archambault lui remplir sa tasse à café en carton avec de l'alcool. On était en pleine scène et je voyais bien que notre réalisateur avait bu», confie l'auteure Danielle Trottier.

Archambault aurait aussi l'habitude de tourner des scènes malaisantes qui ne font pas partie des scénarios qu'il doit porter à l'écran. Une comédienne déclare d'ailleurs qu'il prend plaisir à «humilier ses comédiens».

«J'étais terrorisée, nu-seins, et il me hurlait dessus. J'étais comme prise en otage. Il ne te demande pas si tu es à l'aise. Il te crie : ""Déniaise!"". (...) Il a souvent laissé tourner la caméra pour me faire dire toutes sortes de niaiseries, parfois à connotation sexuelle. Il m'a demandé de cracher au visage de mon partenaire de scène, de le frapper à coups de poing», confie-t-elle.

Habituée de collaborer avec le réalisateur, la productrice Fabienne Larouche a assuré qu'elle ne travaillait plus avec lui. «Une employée a aussi quitté quatre jours avant la fin du tournage pour des raisons similaires. Un conflit d'horaire avec la série Mensonges a terminé notre relation d'affaires avec Sylvain Archambault, de telle sorte que nous n'avons pas eu à clarifier avec lui les allégations le concernant.»

Pour sa part, Sylvain Archambault confirme qu'il peut être «un peu grivois» sur les plateaux. «On n'est pas dans un bureau d'avocats. C'est plus libéral. C'est plus ouvert», avance-t-il. Il nie cependant catégoriquement avoir tourné des scènes superflues de nature sexuelle et d'avoir tenu des propos déplacés.

칼 사전트는 지난 주에 (그의 표현을 빌면) ‘충격적이며 고통스러운’ 혐의가 일어 장관직에서 사임했다.

그의 사체는 노스 웨일스의 코나스 퀘이에 있는 자택에서 11월 7일 오전 11시 30분(현지 시각)에 발견되었다. 노스 웨일스 경찰은 ‘그의 죽음에 의혹을 갖고 있지 않다’고 밝혔다. 사전트는 자살한 것으로 보인다.

웨일스 의회는 존중의 표시로 모든 활동을 중단했다.

제레미 코빈 노동당 당수는 그의 죽음이 “끔찍하며 아주 충격적인 소식”이라고 말했다. 카윈 존스 웨일스 총리는 그의 죽음은 당과 국가에 “큰 손실”이라 말했다.

사전트는 지난 주에 당에서 해임되었으며, 그에 대한 혐의가 수사되는 가운데 웨일스 의회에서도 추방되었다.

Toute cette histoire a commencé par un joli mensonge. On vous a sûrement raconté quand vous étiez petit que vous étiez le fabuleux résultat du mélange de vos parents. Du type « ton ADN c'est un peu plus de 50 % des gènes de maman (l'ovule) et un peu moins de 50 % des gènes de papa (le sperme) ». Faux ! C'est beaucoup plus compliqué que cela, car en plus de l'ADN de la famille, il y a beaucoup de matériels génétiques qui viennent d'ailleurs.

C'est une petite erreur de penser que notre corps et notre esprit nous appartiennent vraiment. En fait, vous êtes une fusion de nombreux organismes humains et non-humains qui sont constamment en train de lutter pour prendre le contrôle. Une vraie guerre dont les effets sont perceptibles sur nous et dans nos comportements.

En effet, les microbes dans votre intestin peuvent produire des molécules qui vont influencer votre appétit. Ils sont donc capables d'influer directement sur votre esprit. Ils font en sorte que vous ayez envie de leur nourriture préférée. Et c'est très souvent cinq portions de gras, sucre et sel par jour. D'ailleurs, la prochaine fois qu'une envie subite de chips vous arrive vers 22h, dites simplement à vos parents : je n'y peux rien, mes bactéries ont pris le contrôle !

Notre connaissance de ce « superorganisme » humain en est encore à ses balbutiements. Cependant, on sait depuis longtemps que nos corps sont vraiment une fusion de nombreux organismes différents. Les sciences de la microbiologie ont montré par une succession d'études que le corps humain était un écosystème fait de « microbiotes », qui hébergent toutes sortes d'animaux : virus, bactéries, parasites, champignons, acariens, etc., sans lesquels nous ne pourrions tout simplement pas vivre. Il y a dans notre propre corps 10 fois plus de cellules qui ne contiennent pas notre ADN que de cellules qui le présentent. Ces micro-vies changent et s'échangent du matériel génétique dans des interactions avec l'environnement qu'est notre corps. Des parties de gènes se baladent donc assez facilement dans l'organisme.

Les chercheurs ont aussi montré que l'ADN était constitué de gènes qui ne sont pas humains.

Les chercheurs ont aussi montré que l'ADN était constitué de gènes qui ne sont pas humains. À titre d'exemple, pour le moment, les experts pensent que 1/10 du patrimoine génétique global humain est composé d'ADN de virus. Ce phénomène est dû au fonctionnement même des virus : ils entrent dans les cellules et manipulent le matériel génétique de leur hôte pour le reprogrammer, afin de créer des clones. Clones qui vont à leur tour pirater d'autres cellules, etc. Ainsi, l'ADN est la matière première qui permet ce mélange qui se fait sur le long terme.

Et comme les virus possèdent plusieurs hôtes animaux (zoonoses), ce n'est pas que de l'ADN de virus qui finit dans notre système. Ainsi, les virus sont les principaux vecteurs de transmission d'ADN entre espèces, surtout entre humains, cochons, vaches, chats et bien sûr chiens. C'est avec ce dernier animal qu'il y a le plus d'échange, car il s'agit du premier à avoir été domestiqué.

FREDERICTON — Governor General Julie Payette, who faced criticism for a speech last week that some said mocked people of faith, praised Canada's tolerance and freedom of religion Tuesday.

She told the New Brunswick legislature that Canada is in a fortunate position to be able to make a difference, because the country is rich in values.

""Our values are tolerance and determination, and freedom of religion, freedom to act, opportunities, equality of opportunities amongst everyone and for all,"" she said.

The comments come a week after she criticized people who believe in creationism and horoscopes, and those who don't believe in climate change.

Payette's speech Tuesday followed the regular daily prayer used to open the New Brunswick legislature.

She did not directly address controversy over her earlier remarks, but the former astronaut spoke Tuesday about seeing Canada from space without borders, and talked of the need to work together.

""It is one planet and we all have a duty to protect it. We have to work together. We have to use our power to work together and make decisions and changes that are needed to preserve our world,"" she said.

In last Wednesday's speech at the Canadian Science Policy Convention in Ottawa, Payette urged her friends and former colleagues to take responsibility to shut down the misinformation about everything from health and medicine to climate change and even horoscopes that has flourished with the explosion of digital media.

Conservative strategist: speech was 'mean-spirited'

""Can you believe that still today in learned society, in houses of government, unfortunately, we're still debating and still questioning whether humans have a role in the Earth warming up or whether even the Earth is warming up, period?"" she said.

""And we are still debating and still questioning whether life was a divine intervention or whether it was coming out of a natural process, let alone, oh my goodness, a random process.""

She generated giggles and even some guffaws from the audience when she said too many people still believe ""taking a sugar pill will cure cancer if you will it good enough and that your future and every single one of the people here's personalities can be determined by looking at planets coming in front of invented constellations.""

I think that saying that some people's opinions weren't as important as others is not what has made Canada the nation it is today. Blaine Higgs, N.B. Progressive Conservative leader

Conservative political strategist Alise Mills said Payette went way over the line with her speech, which Mills characterized as not only political but ""mean-spirited.""

She said Payette wasn't just promoting science, she was mocking people with religious beliefs, and specifically, evangelical Christians who don't believe in evolutionary science.

But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau didn't seem to have any issue with what Payette said, saying his government and Canadians understand the value of science.

Blaine Higgs, New Brunswick's Progressive Conservative leader, said he thought Payette's comment's last week were ""inappropriate.""

""I think that saying that some people's opinions weren't as important as others is not what has made Canada the nation it is today,"" Higgs said, adding Payette was new to the job and he didn't think she'd make similar comments in the future.

Payette met Tuesday with Lt.-Gov. Jocelyne Roy Vienneau and Premier Brian Gallant before addressing the legislative assembly.

Payette's visit also included a tour of the Institute of Biomedical Engineering's prosthetics labs at the University of New Brunswick, and a visit to 5th Canadian Division Support Base Gagetown.

Payette toured the base wearing a Canadian Forces combat uniform, the first time she has had the opportunity to don the uniform and visit a military base since becoming Governor General.

She rode in a LAV 6 armoured vehicle before taking a short flight in a Griffin helicopter.

""I must say I was so very impressed by the professionalism, by the dedication, but also by the sense of community that I felt throughout the visit. This is a gem,"" Payette said of her trip to the sprawling training base.

She made the comment at a reception hosted by Gallant at the Beaverbrook Art Gallery.

Conserver la vitesse de Twitter

""Notre but était de rendre (l'allongement) possible tout en s'assurant que l'on conservait la vitesse et la brièveté qui font de Twitter, Twitter"", a expliqué le réseau social, qui avait lancé récemment un test auprès de certains utilisateurs.

Jugeant les essais concluants, ""nous lançons le changement dans toutes les langues"" en caractères latins, pour lesquelles la limite de 140 caractères posait problème aux utilisateurs, contrairement au japonais, coréen ou chinois, langues plus compactes, a poursuivi Twitter.

Lorsque les utilisateurs ont plus de place, ils tweetent ""plus facilement et plus souvent"", a justifié le groupe, qui n'a jamais dégagé de bénéfices.

Paradoxalement, le groupe se réjouit du fait que les utilisateurs test ont néanmoins continué à publier majoritairement des messages en moins de 140 caractères, préservant ainsi ""la brièveté"" de Twitter, qui le distingue, par exemple, de Facebook.

Twitter s'attend donc à ce que la nouvelle limite soit finalement peu utilisée.

Dogme

Le groupe californien estime que la limite à 140 caractères fait perdre du temps à l'utilisateur, qui doit modifier ou couper son message, au risque de se décourager et de ne pas twitter du tout.

Comme lors de l'annonce du test en septembre, la généralisation des 280 caractères a suscité une avalanche de réactions sur le réseau, beaucoup d'utilisateurs s'amusant à tester la nouvelle longueur tandis que d'autres, une nouvelle fois, en profitaient pour railler Donald Trump.

""J'abandonnerai volontiers mes 140 caractères supplémentaires si Twitter désactive le compte de Trump"", a ainsi noté DaShanne Stokes, héraut des droits civiques aux Etats-Unis, estimant que la décision de Twitter donnait au président ""une arme plus puissante pour faire du mal à plus de gens"".

Jennifer Grygiel, enseignante en communication à l'Université de Syracuse (est), voyait en revanche d'un bon oeil l'allongement des messages.

Cela ""va fondamentalement modifier les communications, une fois de plus"", a-t-elle estimé, interrogée par l'AFP.

""Cela va ralentir la vitesse à laquelle les utilisateurs consomment l'information et va permettre plus de clarté. Pas une mauvaise chose au moment où des leaders mondiaux profèrent des menaces militaires via le réseau"", poursuit l'universitaire, dans une allusion à Donald Trump.

Très actif sur Twitter, où il poste des messages plusieurs fois par jour, le président républicain utilise la plateforme pour des annonces majeures de politique intérieure et internationale, mais aussi pour critiquer des alliés, railler des adversaires et menacer la Corée du Nord.

La semaine dernière, Twitter avait annoncé ""des mesures"", sans préciser en quoi elles consistaient, après que l'un de ses employés eut suspendu, l'espace de quelques minutes, le compte de Donald Trump.

Contraint de se renouveler en raisons de ses difficultés financières --il a encore perdu une vingtaine de millions de dollars au troisième trimestre et le nombre d'utilisateurs actifs stagne autour de 330 millions--, Twitter marchait sur des oeufs concernant l'allongement des tweets.

Début 2016, l'hypothèse de l'abandon du dogme des 140 caractères avait provoqué une levée de boucliers de certains utilisateurs, craignant que le service perde son âme.

Les analystes interrogés par l'AFP estiment que l'allongement ne sera pas le coup de baguette magique qui aidera fondamentalement Twitter, qui n'arrive pas à tirer des bénéfices financiers de sa fréquentation, malgré sa notoriété.

L'annonce a d'ailleurs laissé de marbre les investisseurs, le titre reculant de 0,31% à 19,57 dollars dans les échanges électroniques suivant la clôture de Wall Street vers 02h30 GMT.

Gracias a novelas como Marimar, María Mercedes o Rosa Salvaje, Sliara se enamoró del idioma, la cultura y de México. Al final, como ella menciona para el HuffPost México, nuestro país y Grecia aman el drama, ¿por qué será?

Conforme pasaron los años y su español mejoró, Natalia se propuso viajar a México para conocer cada rincón del país que tanto ama y, por supuesto, Televisa San Ángel, donde las telenovelas se graban y el talento pasea por cada rincón.

En 2016, Natalia y su esposo alemán, viajaron por primera vez a México. Se concentraron en conocer los estados de Puebla, Morelos, Guerrero y CDMX. Como muchos turistas, al joven matrimonio no le dio tiempo de conocer todo, como Televisa San Ángel. Por lo mismo, se pusieron como meta regresar un año después y, por fin, cumplir el sueño de Natalia.

Viajando por un sueño

Este año, la pareja regresó a México para visitar Mérida, Playa del Carmen y otras ciudades cercanas de la península sur para luego emprender la travesía hacia los pasillos que hicieron famosos a sus ídolos mexicanos.

Durante una fiesta a la que acudió el matrimonio a principios de noviembre en la Condesa, Natalia se dedicó a preguntarle a sus amigos cómo podía entrar a Televisa San Ángel. Todos le dijeron que era imposible, pues sin una invitación o memo, era una pérdida de tiempo intentarlo. Pero ella no se rindió.

Un día antes de regresar a Alemania (país donde residen), Sliara tomó sus cosas y se fue directo a Televisa San Ángel.

""Prefiero intentarlo y no quedarme con las ganas"", dijo.

Con su esposo junto a ella y una cámara con la que retrató cada detalle de la fachada de San Ángel, Natalia nos relató que fue a la entrada principal (ubicada en la lateral de Periférico Sur) y le contó su historia al policía.

""No me dejó entrar, claro, pero quedó tan impresionado con lo que le dije que le habló a un encargado de relaciones públicas y publicidad, a quien también le narré mi historia... Sin más ¡me dejó entrar! Y no solo eso, nos dio un pase especial para poder recorrer todas las instalaciones"", dijo Natalia muy emocionada.

Es así como pudo ver, en vivo, cómo graban un programa; tomarse fotos con la comediante Lorena de la Garza y expresar su gran amor por México.

""¡Estoy feliz! Pude cumplir mi sueño"", añadió Natalia.

In the competitive game of investigative journalism, scoops and sources are highly valued commodities and Pauw was a relentless breaker of sensational stories.

So when he dropped his explosive book ""The President's Keepers"", we knew we were going to be rocked. And we were. The entire country was and as his co-founder at the Vrye Weekblad exclaims on the cover, this is indeed dynamite.

Pauw's book sucks you in and spits you out, leaving you overwrought and assaulted. When I closed the back cover and put it down having devoured every page, I felt deeply frantic and bewildered, as if I had been struck a blow to the solar plexus. It reads like a thriller and much of this is attributed to by Pauw's writing style. In his own parlance, it has a lot of ""spin on the ball"". He knows how to sex up a story and the narrative is thick with descriptive anecdote and his own cynical commentary.

You feel as though you are sitting at the bar with this veteran hack, over brandy and Cokes. It is his descriptions of how the Zuma presidency is 'oozing Gupta puss from virtually every state orifice' and how JZ has ""unleashed a pack of Rottweilers"" that paints the picture for the reader of the reality of the country. This is not a book you have to slog through like running across a desert with a sandbag over your head.

#JacquesPauwBook Got me a copy this morning and I am beyond shook. This is Movie material. Thriller for that matter. pic.twitter.com/s1pCTiSHbl — Adv Arthur Maisela (@ArthurMaisela) October 30, 2017

Having said that, though, it is dense and brimming with facts. It is not always an easy read as the cast of characters is full and diverse, the relationships are complex and the details intricate. This is not a book you should be keeping for the beach in Umhlanga over December. It's far too depressing and draining. Many of the events Pauw writes about I have personally covered during my career, from the Jiba/Mrwebi/Breytenbach debacle at the NPA, the Mdluli/Killer/KGB mess at Crime Intelligence, the Sars rogue unit saga and the dirty world of Liffman, Agliotti and Mazzotti.

What he has managed to do is add an extra layer to each of these through tapping his extensive network of sources. He provides the answers to the questions of ""Why"" or ""What for"" that we raise in our frontline reporting. He pulls together the disparate pieces of the bigger puzzle into a masterful landscape of the state of the nation and the shadow it has cast behind it.

President Jacob Zuma and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma sing and dance during the African National Congress (ANC) 5th national policy conference at the Nasrec Expo Centre on July 05, 2017 in Johannesburg, South Africa.

In every single chapter, there is a new revelation, a potential headline story. In fact, there are so many that I was surprised that the Sunday Times chose to feature the same NDZ Mazzotti story two weeks in a row when the book is jammed full of exposes. By some standards, Pauw has been reckless and subversive. He has published information that other journalists had but were too cautious to print. He has bucked the accepted norm of offering a right of reply, arguing that it was not necessary to do so because of public interest.

This does not sit well with me but as premier media lawyer Dario Milo explains, ""Provided that you're sure that your sources are reliable, that you're publishing the substantial truth and what you're saying is in the public interest, it actually doesn't matter."" When I spoke to underworld fixer Glenn Agliotti and Carnilinx boss Adriano Mazzotti last week, they were both pretty pissed that they weren't given the opportunity to state their case by Pauw.

For the sake of journalism and for Pauw, I hope that every word of it is true because we have given him our trust and the consequences of a book that has become a phenomenon such as this one are far-reaching and game changing.

Their view was that he had been too hasty to publish and had used their names to sensationalise the story. Evidently, he's also pissed off the SSA and SARS by dropping this bombshell, exposing their secrets. But perhaps the time has come to change the rules of the game and when Pauw and other journalists are up against the full might of the state machinery, then you have to use what's in your arsenal to get the truth out. As history has shown us, there is a very real risk that he would have been interdicted and the book would not have seen the light of day if he had offered all and sundry the opportunity to respond.

However, it is Pauw's heavy reliance on unnamed sources that will no doubt draw the harshest criticism. ""The President's Keepers"" is bolstered throughout by information and quotes from anonymous individuals. What this does is shine a light into the belly of the beast.

He has a remarkable ability to get spooks and spies to spill their guts. After all, he is the guy that exposed Vlakplaas and got Dirk Coetzee to come clean. He has been into the heart of the whore and now he is taking us back again with him.

Anonymous sourcing is a necessary evil in journalism. It is because of whistle-blowers who speak their conscience that we are able to expose to the public what is in their interest. Courageous individuals like Watergate whistle-blower Mark Felt have contributed to the greatest scoops in history. Journalist Bob Woodward explains that ""using these unnamed sources if done properly, carefully and fairly, provides more accountability in government"". That is precisely what Pauw has sought to achieve, is accountability in government.

It may just be the key that opens the Pandora's box of state secrets. However, for the sake of the country, I wish none of it were true. It is too frightening to be reality.

This means by implication that we invest a great deal of trust in the journalist. If he is not naming the source of the information, we have to trust him that he is telling us the truth. That trust is directly proportional to reputation and Pauw's reputation in this game is legendary. If I had to pick a journalist to go into war for the rest of us in the fourth estate, he would likely be it.

It is problematic that there are inaccuracies in the book that I (and others) have picked up. But these are minor and relatively inconsequential to the broader message of the publication. When you are writing a manuscript that is so full of facts and names and dates, it is incredibly difficult to verify every single one. But when you know you will be facing a massive backlash and a potential legal fight, it is a must.

My worry is that these mistakes will be jumped on and used against him to discredit the bulk of the book when the essence of it is true. As a Crime Intelligence officer told me this week, ""Too much of it is true"". For the sake of journalism and for Pauw, I hope that every word of it is true because we have given him our trust and the consequences of a book that has become a phenomenon such as this one are far-reaching and game-changing. It may just be the key that opens the Pandora's box of state secrets. However, for the sake of the country, I wish none of it were true.

Es hätte ein ""Die Höhle der Löwen""-Rekorddeal werden sollen. Alle fünf Löwen wollten in die App ""Too Good to Go"" investieren, die Usern stark reduziertes Essen von Gastronomen bietet, die es sonst entsorgt hätten.

Eine Millionen hätten die fünf jungen Dänen für fast 10 Prozent ihrer Unternehmensanteile bekommen sollen. ""Ein Stück Löwen-Geschichte"", wie Investor Carsten Maschmeyer über den Deal sagte.

Doch als die Vox-Kameras aus waren, platzte das Geschäft doch noch. Der Grund: Die dänischen Unternehmer überlegten es sich offenbar anders. Nicht nur traten mehrere der fünf Gründer, die in der Fernsehshow zu sehen waren, plötzlich aus dem operativen Geschäft zurück, auch die Zusammenarbeit mit den Investoren wurde eingestellt.

Wie ""Focus Online"" berichtet, hätten die Gründer eine Mail an die Maschmeyer-Group geschickt. Darin die Bitte, mit Maschmeyer und ohne die vier anderen Löwen weiterzumachen.

Was kann ""Too Good to Go""? Die App zeigt den Usern an, wo sie Gerichte zu einem reduzierten Preis bekommen und zu welchem Zeitpunkt sie diese abholen können. Dann können sie per Klick zuschlagen. ""60- bis 70-Prozent reduziert"", wie die Gründer erklären.

E-Mails zeigen den neuen Plan des Unternehmens

Das Unternehmen ""würde es vorziehen, genügend Anteile zurückzuhalten, um richtig gute Investoren in den USA und Großbritannien anzuziehen"". Man sei besorgt, dass ""fünf Investoren zu viel Unruhe in das Tagesgeschäft bringen könnten"".

Maschmeyer sagte ""Focus Online"", ein Deal komme nur in Frage, wenn alle weiter im Boot seien. Doch die ""Too Good to Go""-Gründer hatten offenbar andere Pläne. ""Wir glauben, dass der größte Mehrwert von einem der Investoren, nämlich Carsten Maschmeyer, kommt. Der gemeinsame Mehrwert der anderen Löwen ist relativ gering"", soll es in der Mail weiter geheißen haben.

Löwe Frank Thelen bestätigte der Nachrichtenseite, dass er daraufhin ausstieg. Der Deal platzte.

In einer weiteren Mail sollen die Gründer Maschmeyer mitgeteilt haben, keine weiteren finanziellen Mittel zu benötigen. Zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt werde man aber womöglich wieder auf den Investor zukommen.

Ravi Bhalla, who is running for mayor of Hoboken, posted a photo of the flyer on Facebook. It has a picture of Bhalla, a Sikh who wears the traditional turban, with the words “Don’t let TERRORISM take over our Town!” directly above him.

The flyer also warns of a “potential conflict of interest” regarding the city’s water supplier, which is a client of the law firm where Bhalla is a partner. That issue, however, has no connection with terrorism and the explanation of the conflict appears in much smaller print.

“Of course, this is troubling, but I want to be clear: We won’t let hate win in Hoboken,” Bhalla wrote on Facebook. “I want people to know that Hoboken is a welcoming community where my wife and I are proud to raise our two young children.”

Sikhs have repeatedly been the victims of hate crimes and harassment by people who mistake them for Muslims. A 2015 study conducted by the National Sikhs Campaign found that 20 to 28 percent of Americans misidentify Sikh men as Middle Eastern or Muslim. A large part of that is due to the turbans that Sikh men wear as part of their faith.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) tweeted in defense of Bhalla to denounce the flyers. Booker served as mayor of nearby Newark from 2006 to 2013, before running for Congress.

“My friend @RaviBhalla is running for Hoboken mayor,” Booker wrote. “This vile hateful flyer was put out. I condemn it! We all must condemn bigotry & hate!”

This isn’t the first racist incident during New Jersey’s local elections this year. Xenophobic mailers circulated earlier in the week over a school board election in Edison. They featured two Asian-American candidates with the word “deport” stamped on their pictures. The anonymous flyers also claimed, “The Chinese and Indians are taking over our town!”

The flyer falsely tying Bhalla to terrorism showed up just days before voters go to the polls on Tuesday. Language on the flyer claims it was paid for by a rival mayoral candidate, Michael DeFusco, who denies any association with the item.

“I condemn this piece of racist garbage in the strongest possible terms,” he said in a statement. “Political stunts like this are everything that’s wrong with politics today.”

Il y a moins d'une semaine, la troupe de Bruce Boudreau a vaincu Price et le Canadien 6-3 au Minnesota.
C'est une équipe qui travaille fort, avec une attitude de cols bleus et des joueurs qui ont été laissés de côté et qui ont beaucoup à prouver.
C'est une équipe difficile à battre et à affronter.»Max Pacioretty, sur l'ardeur au travail des Golden Knights de Vegas:«C'est une équipe tellement résistante.
Je me concentre davantage à bloquer des tirs et à aider l'équipe en zone défensive.»","Les joueurs du Canadien de Montréal savaient qu'ils allaient affronter une équipe tenace mardi soir au Centre Bell. Malgré cela, ils ont failli se faire jouer un vilain tour à leur retour devant leurs partisans.

Jordie Benn a inscrit son premier but de la saison et ajouté une mention d'aide, tout ça au premier vingt, et il a aidé le Tricolore à vaincre les Golden Knights de Vegas, de peine et de misère, par le score de 3-2.

Brendan Gallagher (7e), au premier vingt, et Max Pacioretty (6e), tôt en deuxième période, ont réussi les autres buts du Canadien, qui a obtenu 28 tirs contre le Longueillois Maxime Lagacé, qui disputait un deuxième match en autant de soirs et un troisième en quatre jours.

Benn a ajouté une mention d'aide sur le filet de Gallagher et il a connu un cinquième match de deux points en carrière, et un premier depuis le 13 décembre 2016, contre les Ducks d'Anaheim, alors qu'il portait encore l'uniforme des Stars de Dallas.

Les hommes de Claude Julien ont signé un troisième triomphe de suite pour la première fois de la saison, sans que Carey Price ne contribue à un seul d'entre eux. Il s'agissait aussi d'un sixième gain à leurs huit dernières sorties.

Cette victoire a toutefois été entachée par la perte de l'attaquant Jonathan Drouin, victime d'une blessure au haut du corps qui lui a fait rater toute la troisième période et qui n'a pas fait l'objet de mise à jour après le match.

Pierre-Édouard Bellemare, tard au premier vingt, et Erik Haula, avec 1:37 à jouer au temps réglementaire, ont marqué les buts des visiteurs contre Charlie Lindgren, qui a fait face à 31 rondelles.

Jonathan Marchessault et David Perron ont obtenu des mentions d'aide sur le but de Haula.

Après ce but, les Golden Knights sont venus bien près d'égaler le score, mais Lindgren a fermé la porte, entre autres contre James Neal grâce à un superbe arrêt de la jambière gauche, avec environ 30 secondes à écouler.

«Ce fut un geste de réaction, le genre où tu ne penses pas et où te ne fais que sortir la jambière. Heureusement, j'ai été en mesure de faire l'arrêt», a décrit Lindgren.

Baisse d'intensité

À son premier d'une séquence de six matchs à domicile au cours des deux prochaines semaines, le Tricolore a offert une performance inégale contre une formation qui avait subi un revers en tirs de barrage 24 heures plus tôt face aux Maple Leafs de Toronto, et qui en était à une sixième rencontre à l'étranger depuis le 30 octobre.

Le Canadien a largement dominé la première période lors de laquelle il a marqué deux fois et limité la troupe de Gerard Gallant à seulement deux tirs. La formation montréalaise n'a toutefois pas réussi à maintenir cette cadence.

Reconnus pour leur ténacité et leur ardeur au travail, les Golden Knights ont offert une résistance beaucoup plus vaillante à compter de la deuxième période et ont eu droit à plusieurs bonnes chances de marquer. Toutefois, Lindgren, qui n'avait pas tellement bien paru sur le but de Bellemare, s'est montré à la hauteur de la tâche.

Ce fut notamment le cas pendant une punition mineure à Shea Weber tard pendant la période médiane, lors de laquelle il a dû se signaler contre William Karlsson, sur un tir d'une trentaine de pieds.

«C'était un match totalement différent ce soir, a fait remarquer Lindgren en faisant allusion au match de dimanche, à Chicago, lors duquel il avait dû repousser 38 tirs. Pour un gardien, c'est plus facile quand vous recevez plus de tirs. Vous entrez dans le match immédiatement. Dans une rencontre comme ce soir, c'est une bataille mentale pour ne pas perdre sa concentration. Le côté mental est l'un des aspects de mon jeu que je veux améliorer. J'ai réussi à demeurer alerte ce soir.»

Du coup, Lindgren a inscrit une cinquième victoire en autant de matchs en carrière dans la LNH. Wayne Thomas, en janvier 1973, est le dernier cerbère du Canadien à avoir réalisé pareil exploit. C'est par ailleurs la première fois qu'il gagne un match à Montréal.

Le Canadien sera de retour au Centre Bell jeudi soir alors qu'il accueillera le Wild du Minnesota. Il y a moins d'une semaine, la troupe de Bruce Boudreau a vaincu Price et le Canadien 6-3 au Minnesota.

Après le match, le Canadien a annoncé le rappel de Byron Froese du Rocket de Laval tandis que Michael McCarron a été cédé au club-école de l'équipe dans la Ligue américaine.

Échos de vestiaire

Claude Julien, sur la performance globale de ses joueurs:

«Je pense qu'en première moitié du match, on a été très bon. Comme à Toronto lundi, les Golden Knights n'ont pas abandonné et ils ont été meilleurs que nous en deuxième moitié. Il faut leur donner crédit. C'est une équipe qui travaille fort, avec une attitude de cols bleus et des joueurs qui ont été laissés de côté et qui ont beaucoup à prouver. C'est une équipe difficile à battre et à affronter.»

Max Pacioretty, sur l'ardeur au travail des Golden Knights de Vegas:

«C'est une équipe tellement résistante. Ses joueurs se battent pour leur survie à chaque présence, lors de chaque période. Nous savions, même lorsque nous avions l'avance, que nous allions devoir jouer avec vigueur pour la protéger.»

Jordie Benn, sur son premier but de la saison:

«C'est toujours plaisant. Ça n'arrive pas souvent que la rondelle entre dans le but pour moi. En fait, c'est un choc quand ça se produit. Je ne me préoccupe pas trop de mon total de points. Je me concentre davantage à bloquer des tirs et à aider l'équipe en zone défensive.»","Le Canadien poursuit sur sa lancée, aidé par...

Die ""Paradise Papers"" zeigen erneut, wie viele Reiche sich der gesellschaftlichen Verantwortung entziehen

Gleichzeitig wird im politischen Diskurs lieber nach unten getreten

Das größte Problem sind aber nicht die ""sozial Abgehängten"", sondern die realitätsferne Elite

Der Publizist Jakob Augstein hat nicht immer Recht mit dem, was er in seiner Kolumne bei ""Spiegel Online"" veröffentlicht. Doch in seinem Text zu den Enthüllungen um die ""Paradise Papers"" hat er mit wenigen Sätzen ins Schwarze getroffen: ""Das System ist zutiefst krank. Es ist unmoralisch und unanständig“, schreibt er. ""Unser Planet ist ein Paradies für Arschlöcher.“

Das nunmehr öffentliche System von Briefkastenfirmen, mit denen Reiche ab einer bestimmten Anlagesumme sich das Steuerzahlen sparen können, ist ein erschreckendes Beispiel für den Unwillen der Privilegierten, Solidarität mit den wirtschaftlich Schwächeren zu zeigen.

Diese Steuersparmodelle sind meist völlig legal. Das macht sie aber noch lange nicht legitim, im Gegenteil. Die Verstrickung vieler deutscher Firmen und Privatpersonen zeigt, dass der alte rheinische Kapitalismus, der diesem Land Jahrzehnte lang sozialen Ausgleich und einen vergleichsweise hohen Lebensstandard für möglichst viele Menschen beschert hat, mittlerweile mausetot ist.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Politiker und Unternehmer umgingen Millionen an Steuern: Diese Deutschen tauchen in den Paradise Papers auf

Kein Interesse, Schlupflöcher zu schließen

Und das ist vor allem eine Mentalitätsfrage. Es gibt in Deutschland Menschen, die solche Schlupflöcher für die Reichen und Superreichen offen stehen lassen. Sie sitzen derzeit auch bei den Sondierungsgesprächen für eine mögliche Jamaika-Koalition mit am Tisch.

Und es gibt solche Menschen, die ohne den Anflug eines schlechten Gewissens diese Lücken nutzen. Ist ja alles erlaubt. Was sich jene, die sich sonst gerne zur ""Leistungselite"" dieses Landes zählen, dabei gerne unterschätzen: Macht geht auch mit Verantwortung einher.

Und genau das unterscheidet die Reichen auch von den Küchentischtricksern in den Reihenhäusern der urbanen Stadtrandlagen, die einen Zusammenstoß mit einem nachtblinden Fuchs gerne mal zum Wildunfall aufmotzen, um dann bei der Auto-Versicherung abzukassieren. Unehrlichkeit gibt es auch bei den Ärmeren. Aber sie hat längst nicht so große Folgen.

Wir haben ein moralisches Führungsproblem in diesem Land. Und es strahlt von oben nach unten aus. Mit Folgen für die politische Landschaft in der Bundesrepublik.

Auch die Populisten hetzen gegen die Armen

Es gibt eine Frage, die im Zusammenhang mit dem Siegeszug des Populismus bisher viel zu wenig diskutiert wurde: Warum eigentlich treten so viele Menschen gegen die vermeintlich Schwächeren in der Gesellschaft aus?

Der Erfolg der AfD wäre undenkbar ohne dieses Phänomen. Die Partei will das Arbeitslosengeld II für jene erhöhen, die mindestens zehn Jahre beschäftigt waren.

Außerdem plant sie, die Steuern für die Mittelschicht zu senken und die Erbschafts- sowie die Gewerbesteuer abzuschaffen. Davon profitieren vor allem jene, die einer geregelten Arbeit nachgehen und über ein vererbbares Vermögen verfügen.

Die nationalistisch denkenden Teile der Mittelschicht dürften sich von der Arbeits- und Sozialpolitik der AfD ganz gut vertreten fühlen. Und klar ist auch, auf wessen Kosten das geht: Es gibt weniger Geld für Asylleistungen, weniger Geld für Zuwanderer. Überhaupt: weniger Geld für alle, die nicht in die politischen Kategorien des AfD-Gesellschaftsbildes passen.

Das ist kein rein deutsches Phänomen. In Tschechien hat kürzlich ein Multimilliardär mit seiner Partei die Parlamentswahlen gewonnen, dessen Wahlkampf gespickt war mit Spitzen gegen Arbeitslose und Sozialhilfeempfänger.

Feindbilder passend für jede soziale Schicht

In Österreich hat die FPÖ ihren Wahlkampf mit dem Slogan ""neue Fairness"" bestritten. Auf Plakaten war ein österreichischer Rennradler zu sehen, der vorne auf dem Tandem sitzt, und eine dickbäuchige Karikatur eines faulen und obendrein auch linken Sozialhilfeempfängers auf dem Hintersattel mitziehen muss.

Die Motive gleichen sich in den Ländern Europas. Und die Populisten haben für fast jede Gesellschaftsschicht ein vermeintlich überalimentiertes Feindbild parat: Für die Wohlhabenden sind das die ""links-grün versifften Gutmenschen"", die mit Steuergeldern ihr angeblich zweifelhaftes Wirken finanziert bekommen.

Für die weniger Wohlhabenden sind es die Ausländer, deren Existenz nach Meinung des Stammtisches ""auf Kosten von Obdachlosen, Alten, Kranken und Armen"" finanziert wird.

Und wer selbst ohne Job ist, darf sich bei den Rechtspopulisten immerhin noch daran ergötzen, dass es ja noch jene Arbeitslosen gibt, die selbst verschuldet und durch eigene Faulheit in diese Situation geraten sind. Das sind im Zweifelsfall immer die anderen.

Auch die Linken treten nach unten

Übrigens ist dieses Phänomen des Nach-unten-Austretens auch aus einem ganz anderen Kontext sehr aktuell: Linke erheben sich selbst gerne über die AfD-Wähler, indem sie diese als ""dumme Nazi-Prolls"" diffamieren.

Die Stigmatisierung von Rechten als ""ungebildet"" oder ""sozial minderwertig"" ist nicht nur gefährlich, sondern lenkt den Blick von jenen gesellschaftlichen Bruchlinien ab, die in Deutschland den sozialen Frieden gefährden – und dadurch mitverantwortlich sind für den Aufstieg der rechten Parteien.

Die Scheren zwischen Arm und Reich, Stadt und Land, Rentnern und Pensionären, Akademikern und Handwerkern sind derart offensichtlich geworden, dass die so gewachsenen Unterschiede das Gerechtigkeitsgefühl vieler Menschen verletzen. Und – da sind wir wieder bei den ""Paradise Papers"": Auch dafür ist derzeit kaum jemand bereit, die Verantwortung zu übernehmen. Das moralische Führungsproblem.

Die Regierenden verstehen das Problem noch immer nicht

Wenn ein Akademikerkind eine dreimal höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit auf ein Studium hat und eine zehnmal höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit auf eine erfolgreich abgeschlossene Promotion als ein Arbeiterkind, dann wirkt das entmutigend auf jene, die eigentlich eine ""Aufsteigerbiografie"" leben könnten.

Wenn die Pensionen für Staatsdiener zwanzig Prozentpunkte höher liegen als die Renten für Arbeitnehmer, dann wird dadurch der Verdruss auf das System befeuert.

Und wenn die CSU beim Breitbandausbau ganz auf die Kraft des freien Marktes vertraute, der aber aus Profitgründen gar nicht daran dachte, die abgelegeneren Regionen Deutschlands mit schnellem Internet zu versorgen, dann wächst auf dem Land der Verdruss gegen die ""Eliten"" in den Städten.

Was wir in Deutschland bräuchten, wäre ein Masterplan, wie die gespaltene Gesellschaft wieder näher zusammengeführt werden kann. Das betrifft politische Maßnahmen, muss aber auch auf unser gesellschaftliches Leitbild abzielen.

Populisten und Radikale hatten in der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik stets dann die schlechtesten Chancen, wenn Wohlstand in Deutschland gerecht geteilt wurde.

Dem gegenüber steht derzeit der Trend, dass sich Reiche in Deutschland in ihre eigene Welt zurückziehen. Privatschulen haben immer mehr Zulauf, ebenso wie kommerziell betriebene Universitäten. Wer sich eine private Altersvorsorge leisten kann, muss sich nicht mehr allein auf die gesetzliche Rente verlassen.

Und wer genug Geld gesammelt hat, dass er im Stehen schlafen müsste, wenn er es unter das Kopfkissen legen würde, der kann sich auch die legale Ausweichbewegung in die so genannten ""Steuer-Oasen"" leisten.

Das Deprimierende ist, dass die Politik immer noch nicht erkannt hat, wie viel gesellschaftlicher Schaden dadurch entsteht.

Wer ständig nach einer Obergrenze für Flüchtlinge kräht, aber nicht einmal ansatzweise willens ist, die Reichen in diesem Land zu gesellschaftlicher Verantwortung zu zwingen, der beweist damit eigentlich nur, dass er die Probleme der Bundesrepublik Deutschland nicht verstanden hat.

Von Januar bis Dezember räkelt sich eine andere Traumfrau auf der Motorhaube, als hätte sie nicht verstanden, wie sie anders in den Innenraum des Autos gelangen soll. Frauen werden seit der Erfindung des Rades des völligen Unverständnisses für die Männerträume auf vier Reifen verdächtigt. Wohl kaum ein anderes Klischee hat es in der Popkultur derart weit gebracht und wird so häufig in Büchern, Filmen und augenrollenden Gesprächen thematisiert. Dass Frauen durchaus etwas mit Autos anfangen können und was an den größten Mythen dran ist, zeigt unser Vorurteilscheck in Zusammenarbeit mit der Allianz.

Mythos 1: Tücke der Parklücke – Frauen können nicht einparken

Es ist der Klassiker der Klischees: Frauen können ohne lastergroße Lücken und unendliche Weiten zum mehrzügigen Rangieren einfach nicht einparken. Der Mythos mangelnder weiblicher Parkkünste hält sich hartnäckig, dabei erheben sich aus Studien protestierende Gegenstimmen. So zeigten beispielsweise Untersuchungen der Ruhr-Universität Bochum, dass vor allem das negative Selbstbild der Fahrerinnen zu schlechten Parkergebnissen führe. Andere Studien beschäftigten sich mit dem sozialpsychologischen Phänomen der „Bedrohung durch Stereotypen“. Die Tatsache, dass Frauen sich am Steuer ständig mit dem Vorurteil vermeintlicher Parkunfähigkeit konfrontiert sehen, verunsichert und schafft Misstrauen gegenüber den eigenen Fahrkünsten. Ein britischer Parkplatz-Betreiber will sogar herausgefunden haben, dass sich Männer einfach schneller mit ihrer Parkleistung zufriedengeben. Frauen hingegen strebten nach Perfektion und bräuchten dementsprechend länger. Die Mutter aller Mythen fußt somit auf vorurteilsbedingtem Mangel an Selbstbewusstsein bei Frauen und der unbescheidenen männlichen Begeisterung über die eigenen Parkfertigkeiten. Als Gegenmittel empfehlen wie den Damen an dieser Stelle, nie müde zu werden, süffisant grinsende Fahrer auf ihr schief geparktes Auto hinzuweisen.

Mythos 2: Spaß am Gas – Frauen kennen keine Fahrfreude

Während der Gedanke an Pferdestärken männliches Blut zur Wallung bringt, können Frauen darüber nun wirklich nicht jubilieren. Bei diesem Vorurteil scheint die Zeit irgendwann in den 1950er Jahren stehengeblieben zu sein. Das Klischee, der unmotivierte Fahrer vor dem eigenen Auto müsse ein Opa mit Hut oder eine Frau sein, kann relativ leicht ausgehebelt werden. Eine Umfrage des Autobauers Ford ergab Anfang des Jahres beispielsweise, dass Männer und Frauen bei der Fahrt eines schnittigen Sportwagens den gleichen Fahrspaß empfinden. Die Emanzipation ist längst am Gas-Pedal angekommen und so genießen auch Fahrerinnen den Sprint über die Straße. Zwar sind die Männer in Flensburg punktemäßig stärker vertreten, allerdings ist das häufigste Vergehen unter weiblichen Punktesünderinnen die zu schnelle Fahrt. Doch wehe dem, der da jetzt den Finger hebt und auf ein erhöhtes Unfallpotenzial verweist. Die Verkehrsunfallszahlen des Statistischen Bundeamtes beweisen regelmäßig, dass Frauen weniger unfallanfällig sind als Männer. Eine gute Kfz-Versicherung ist hingegen geschlechtsunabhängig der Garant für Fahrspaß mit sicherem Gefühl. Die Allianz bietet dazu individuellen Schutz für jeden Fahrer – und jede Fahrerin.

Mythos 3: Porsche statt Püppchen – Mädchen spielen nicht mit Autos

Wie viel neidisches Gebrüll mag es unter Weihnachtsbäumen schon gegeben haben, wie viele tränennasse Puppenkleidchen angesichts von vier Kubikmetern Lego und den Rennstrecken großer Brüder. Doch da lässt sich leider nichts machen, denn Barbie und Co. sind die idealen Spielsachen für Mädchen. Dass dieser Mythos eher von klassischen Rollenbildern als kindlichen Neigungen am Leben gehalten wird, zeigen verschiedene Erhebungen. Dem Bundesverband des Spielwareneinzelhandels zufolge gibt es immer mehr Mädchen, die lieber mit Autos spielen. Studien zufolge fördere der Rollentausch von Miniatur-Schönheitssalon und Rennbahn die kognitive und emotionale Entwicklung. Gewisse Vorlieben lassen sich natürlich nicht absprechen, doch freuen sich auch die meisten Prinzessinnen über Rennautos. Ein Experiment der französischen Supermarktkette Les Magasins U kommt zu einem ganz ähnlichen Ergebnis. Kaum waren Jungs und Mädchen mit der vollen Bandbreite von Auto bis Zauber-Barbie allein, griffen kleine Superhelden zu Puppen, Mädchen nach Bohrmaschinen und Bentleys.

Mythos 4: Wo bin ich? Frauen haben keinen Orientierungssinn

Wenn es einen Zusammenhang gibt, über den sich Wissenschaftler nicht einigen können, dann ist es der zwischen Geschlecht und Orientierungssinn. Den Wissenschaftlern der Norwegian University of Science and Technology zufolge sind Männer dank des Testosterons und der Orientierung an Himmelsrichtungen im Orientierungsvorteil. Frauen orientierten sich eher an festen Wegpunkten. Zwei Wissenschaftlerinnen der University of Edinburgh zufolge bietet dieser Umstand jedoch auch Vorteile. Zwar hätten Frauen ein schlechteres Gedächtnis für räumliche Anordnungen, doch gewährt die Navigation nach optischen Fixpunkten in mancher Umgebung bessere Auskunft. Dass sich Männer und Frauen unterschiedlich orientieren, setzt sich übrigens auch bei Ahnungslosigkeit fort. Eine Studie des Instituts Fly Research belegte die männliche Unbelehrbarkeit. Demnach nimmt jeder Vierte eine halbstündige Irrfahrt mit ungeahntem Ausgang in Kauf, bevor er nach dem Weg fragt.

Mythos 5: Fluchen und Funkeln – Männer donnern, Frauen dekorieren

Müssten Eigenschaften wie das Anschreien anderer Autofahrer oder Faustschwenken vor dem Abbiegen einem Geschlecht zugeordnet werden – die meisten würden auf die Männerwelt tippen. Doch eine Studie der Scout24-Gruppe wies nicht nur die Deutschen als Fluch-Europameister aus, sondern krönte zudem die Frauen zum fluchenden Geschlecht, das deinem Ärger lautstark Luft macht. Da wir schon einmal beim Thema Luft sind, ein dekoratives Vorurteil ist nicht ganz von der Hand zu weisen. Ob Duftbäume mit Käsekuchen-Aroma, Kinderschühchen und Einhörner, die es zur 50 Liter Tankfüllung gratis dazu gab: Frauen stehen im Verdacht, ihren Rückspiegel als eine Art Hort für jegliches Sammelsurium zu nutzen. Das Resultat: Beim Fahren schwankt und funkelt allerhand am Rückspiegel und irritiert weit über die Grenzen des eigenen Autos hinaus. Beim Blick in manches Auto fällt es schwer, diesen Mythos auszuhebeln.

Alles andere als mythisch: Gut versichert mit der Allianz

Frauen beweisen Freude am Fahren, parken fluchend doch perfekt ein und beschäftigen sich durchaus mit ihren Autos. Doch für jeden Fahrer und jede Fahrerin gilt: Nur mit einer guten Kfz-Versicherung fährt es sich auf Nummer sicher. Die Kfz-Versicherung der Allianz ist als zuverlässiger Partner immer mit am Steuer. Trotz günstiger Tarife setzt der Versicherer vor allem auf ein umfangreiches Service- und Leistungsangebot.

Dans ""Tout nous sépare"" de Thierry Klifa, en salles le 8 novembre, Nekfeu et Catherine Deneuve forment un sacré duo. Dans un monde où tout les oppose, les deux personnages se retrouvent ""forcés"" de coopérer.

Dans ce thriller aux allures de film noir, Nekfeu incarne Ben, un jeune homme sans histoire vivant dans une cité du Sud de la France. Chômeur, il vit de petits trafics avec ses deux amis d'enfance Rodolphe, incarné par Nicolas Duvauchelle, et Karim, joué par Sébastien Houbani.

Pour Ken Samaras, le cinéma est un nouveau monde. Habitué à la scène et aux tournages de clips, Nekfeu raconte au HuffPost cette nouvelle étape dans sa carrière.

Le HuffPost: Pour votre premier rôle au cinéma, vous intégrez un casting de stars, quel effet cela vous fait?

Nekfeu: C'est incroyable, j'en suis très fier, et puis ça fait plaisir à ma famille! Au début du tournage, je ressentais une énorme pression mais ça s'est vite arrangé.

Il y a quelques années, vous imaginiez-vous donner la réplique à Catherine Deneuve au cinéma?

Non pas du tout! Avant de rencontrer Thierry Klifa je n'avais même pas l'envie de faire du cinéma. Je ne me sentais pas légitime en tant qu'acteur. Par ailleurs je trouve ce métier très impudique, ce qui ne m'a jamais vraiment plu. Mais comme j'aime bien les défis, que le casting et l'histoire du film me plaisaient, je me suis dit que je ne pouvais pas refuser.

Vous recevez régulièrement des propositions pour le cinéma sans pour autant en faire votre priorité, qu'est ce qui a fait que ce film soit devenu une priorité pour vous?

Jusqu'à maintenant, les scénarios que je recevais véhiculaient des valeurs que je ne cautionnais pas ou étaient des comédies commerciales qui ne me parlaient pas, avec le rôle cliché du rappeur. Donc évidemment, je ne faisais pas du cinéma ma priorité. Et quand Thierry Khlifa est venu me chercher, je lui ai dit qu'il se trompait de personne, que je ne voulais pas faire de cinéma et que je préférais me focaliser sur ma musique... Il m'a répondu que je devrais essayer, au moins lire le scénario, voir le casting, etc. Et puis j'ai relativisé, je me suis rendu compte de la chance que j'avais et je me suis dit ""si tu ne faisais pas de rap tu l'aurais fait direct."" Donc j'ai lu l'histoire et je me suis dit que ça pouvait coller, je me suis tout de suite vu dans le personnage de Ben.

N'aviez-vous pas peur d'être confiné au stéréotype du rappeur/acteur que l'on peut voir dans les comédies populaires?

Non parce que je ne joue pas le rôle d'un rappeur! J'incarne un mec banal, vivant dans un quartier populaire comme il y en a des milliers en France. À vrai-dire, cela me rappelle comment j'ai grandi. Nos personnages sont plus proches de ceux qui ne sont pas vraiment faits pour le banditisme. C'est quand on se retrouve face à des vrais voyous qui viennent récupérer leur dû que l'on se rend compte qu'on n'est pas des vrais méchants. Dans le scénario, le fait que l'on soit une équipe de trois, et non une énorme bande, facilite le côté sincère, on n'est pas dans le paraître ni dans le surjoué.

Que pensez-vous de la place qu'occupe actuellement le rap dans le cinéma français?

Je suis super content qu'il y ait de plus en plus de rappeurs qui se lancent. Et j'aimerais bien que, de plus en plus, il y ait des réalisateurs comme Thierry Klifa qui proposent aux rappeurs des rôles qui ne soient pas des mauvaises incarnations d'eux-mêmes, des braqueurs, des dealers... Maintenant il y a des réalisateurs qui ont la quarantaine, ont grandi avec NTM, et ne posent aucun cliché sur le rôle qu'un rappeur devrait avoir au cinéma. Ca évolue avec les nouvelles générations.

Aux États-Unis il y a toujours eu cette communication entre le rap et le cinéma. En France, je trouve qu'il y a cette espèce de racisme sociétal qui fait que -sauf quand on a besoin d'un rappeur pour les comédies populaires- on ne fait pas appel à nous alors que notre musique est la plus écoutée en France.

Pensez-vous à faire une pause dans la chanson pour vous consacrer à une carrière dans le cinéma ?

C'est plutôt l'inverse! Avec ""Tout nous sépare"", j'ai fait une pause pour mieux reprendre le rap. Plus sérieusement, je continuerai à rapper parce que c'est ce que je fais depuis le début. En revanche, depuis quelques années, j'essaye vraiment d'apporter un aspect cinématographique à mes clips. Je pense même que désormais, tous mes investissements iront dans la production de clips.

Mais le cinéma m'a plu et je serai bientôt à l'écran dans un second film que nous avons déjà tourné qui s'intitule ""L'échappée"", il est réalisé par Mathias Pardo.

Votre personnage passe par de nombreuses émotions durant le film, comment avez-vous géré cela ?

Sur scène, je suis sincère, je n'en ai rien à foutre, je ne ressens même plus la pression, je peux me permettre de bafouiller ou de ne pas rapper quelques secondes. Au cinéma c'est tout le contraire. Les émotions sont forcées alors il faut faire semblant. Mais j'ai remarqué qu'il était facile de faire semblant face à des acteurs tels que Catherine Deneuve, Nicolas Duvauchelle ou Diane Kruger. Lorsque l'on devait jouer un dialogue par exemple, ils étaient tellement naturels que j'avais l'impression de mener une véritable discussion, j'oubliais complètement la caméra.

Pour les scènes un peu plus violentes, j'ai eu beaucoup de mal à jouer la douleur, alors on a trouvé une solution. Lorsque je me fais frapper, les autres me frappent pour de vrai, ils ne retiennent pas leurs coups. Cela m'a vraiment facilité la tâche puisque j'avais vraiment mal! (rires)

Sur les affiches promotionnelles du film, vous apparaissez sous le nom de Nekfeu alors que dans le générique de fin, il est écrit Ken Samaras. Pourquoi ?

Le fait qu'il soit écrit ""Nekfeu"" sur les affiches du film est un choix purement promotionnel. Mon nom de rappeur est quand même plus connu que mon nom civil! En revanche, dans le générique du film, j'ai demandé à ce que mon vrai nom -Ken Samaras- soit écrit pour que ma famille puisse être fière de moi. Imaginez-vous! (rires) Je vais pouvoir montrer le film à ma grand-mère et à toute ma famille restée en Grèce. Je suis très fier de ça.

Maintenant, qu'en est-il du fameux gag ô combien décrié, qui a fait bondir Alice Paquet? Dès les premières secondes de sa prestation, Guy Nantel se présente comme un gourou et entame une très longue tirade sur la religion et ses dérapes, parle de Jésus (qui «n'a jamais baissé les bras, particulièrement à la fin»), de Dieu qui n'a pas le temps de s'occuper de chacun de nous, écorche les Juifs, les Islamistes. Il fait crier «Alleluia» à la foule.

Nantel est-il réellement un gourou à la tête d'une secte? Évidemment, on sait que non. Sa dégaine gueularde fait partie de sa mise en scène, et il tire sur tout ce qui bouge. À plusieurs occasions pendant Nos droits et libertés, on se dira d'ailleurs que Nantel frappe trop fort partout pour que ses réflexions soient réellement sincères. Pareil individu aurait probablement bien du mal à vivre en société sans se dégoter une claque sur la gueule quelque part. Oui, l'artiste est suffisant, voire arrogant parfois, mais irait-il aussi loin dans ses analyses dans la «vraie vie», lui qui s'exprime sur des tribunes publiques pratiquement tous les jours? On ne peut jurer de rien, mais on en doute.

Nos droits et libertés, de Guy Nantel Nos droits et libertés, de Guy Nantel

Il le mentionne à plusieurs reprises dans son long monologue-fleuve, sans entracte, par des paroles claires ou sous-jacentes : son discours est celui d'un personnage. À prendre avec un grain de sel. Il confirme presque d'entrée de jeu que «ça va être «malaisant» pendant 90 minutes».

Et un spectacle d'humour doit être pris pour ce qu'il est. C'est-à-dire... un spectacle d'humour. De fait, sans comparer Guy Nantel à ces géants, on aurait probablement plaint Yvon Deschamps, Rock et Belles Oreilles, les Cyniques ou même les Bleu Poudre de faire carrière à l'époque enflammée des réseaux sociaux.

L'homme aux vox-pop pense-t-il véritablement ce qu'il affirme quand il remet en question la culture du viol et le consentement sexuel («Lâchez-moi avec la culture du viol!»)? Se moque-t-il de ses semblables masculins qui la tournent en dérision, ou fait-il sciemment de même?

Il est objectivement très difficile d'en juger. Il faudra se fier à la bonne foi du principal intéressé pour tirer une conclusion.

Les commentaires l'accusant de banaliser ce fléau sont-ils justifiés, ou sont-ils l'œuvre de personnes qui, à prime abord, n'aiment pas l'humoriste? Il appartiendra aux sensibilités de chacun et chacune de déterminer du bon goût de la boutade, aux gens concernés d'intenter des poursuites si bon leur chante.

Dans cet amas de coups assénés à gauche, à droite et au centre, l'auteure de ces lignes a perçu une volonté de choquer, de brasser la cage, mais pas une incitation à une quelconque violence. Nantel prend visiblement plaisir à jouer sur la mince ligne qui sépare l'acceptable du non-acceptable dans Nos droits et libertés. Si des esprits obtus souhaitent s'approprier l'indélicatesse de Nantel pour continuer de perpétrer la culture du viol, ils l'auraient probablement fait de toute façon. Son texte recèle d'ailleurs une longue portion dédiée aux opinions acariâtres du peuple, désormais exprimées n'importe comment dans les cieux souvent peu reluisants des réseaux sociaux.

Oui, le numéro sur Alice Paquet apporte des nuances dans la version de la jeune femme dans l'affaire l'opposant au député Gerry Sklavounos. Les noms ne sont pas dits explicitement, mais sous-entendus en caractère suffisamment gras («Souvlaki» au lieu de «Sklavounos») pour qu'on comprenne rapidement. Nantel ne «victimise» pas la victime et ne diabolise pas l'agresseur, et vice-versa. Cet éclairage différent ne plaira pas à tous et toutes. C'est peut-être là le bât qui blesse. Nantel n'est pas concerné par cette histoire et son œil, qu'il soit celui d'un personnage ou pas, en est un extérieur, qui n'a pas souffert du récit impliquant les deux personnes en cause. Qui est-il pour juger, se demandent déjà plusieurs. D'autres trouveront là matière à réflexion et à débat (sain, espérons-le). Chose certaine, les diverses nuances de gris sont très, très fréquentes dans les diatribes de Guy Nantel, et il faudra s'en souvenir en se rendant voir Nos droits et libertés.

Support indéfectible

Mardi, l'assumé polémiste savait que la fameuse moquerie était attendue de pied ferme. Celle-ci a finalement été entendue, environ, au quart de sa présentation. «On arrive au bout que vous attendez, là!», a-t-il balancé pour faire patienter son auditoire, peu avant. En entamant la dite réplique, il a été secoué d'un fou rire.

Et c'est lorsqu'il a lancé l'une de ses phrases les plus pince-sans-rire de son heure quarante de stand up («Quel gars ici n'a jamais déposé son pénis sur le bureau d'un collègue pour faire avancer un dossier?», en référence à Éric Salvail) qu'on a compris à quel point Nantel pouvait jouer avec les «degrés» dans son humour. Et que dire de sa pointe au docteur Mailloux? «Ça fait 40 ans qu'il est psychopathe, il doit connaître ça, ces affaires-là...»

Or, Guy Nantel a été accueilli en héros lors de son entrée en piste et il a pu compter tout au long de la soirée sur le support indéfectible de son parterre, qui riait et l'encourageait de bon cœur. Il a d'ailleurs chaleureusement remercié l'assistance à la fin... et fait plusieurs fois allusion à la semaine très difficile qu'il vient de passer.

«On a mis un gros budget de promo, cette année, on a mis le paquet. Pas de jeu de mots avec paquet...», s'est-il même permis en ouverture, se sachant épaulé.

Pour le reste, comme on le mentionnait plus haut, Nos droits et libertés est une mitraille qui fait feu à tous égards Qui n'échappe pas à quelques gags éculés («Comme disent les Chinois, c'est une situation wing-wing»), et d'autres bien envoyés («J'en ai eu des milliers dans ma carrière (de courriels haineux), dont une centaine de ma femme»). De La poule aux œufs d'or aux gens de la Beauce, du ministre Laurent Lessard et sa bourde sur l'autoroute 13 l'hiver dernier, jusqu'à son énumération des 37 mots québécois possibles pour décrire un être non-intelligent (incluant «couillon», «Couillard» et «député»), Nantel n'en rate pas une. Le tout s'avère bien ficelé, livré avec justesse – pour peu qu'on joue le jeu du «deuxième degré» - et, oui, souvent drôle. Et on passe à un autre appel...?

* Der Name der Autorin wurde geändert, um ihren Job nicht zu gefährden und sie vor Drohungen und Beleidigung zu schützen.","Als Mutter ist man versucht, in den sozialen Netzwerken sogenannten Mami-Gruppen beizutreten um sich ausheulen zu können, wenn das Kleine mal wieder bockt.

Ist man aber von Beruf Erzieherin, rate ich dringend davon ab.

Das Video oben zeigt, wie grausam unsere Gesellschaft sein kann.

So findet man nämlich dort Posts, in denen eine Mutter von ihrem erschütterten Vertrauen zu der Erzieherin ihres Sohnes berichtet, weil diese ihn im KiGa beim Essen für 2 Minuten vor die Tür gesetzt hat, da er sich dort angefangen hatte zu prügeln.

Das Kind wäre jetzt emotional total am Boden... Musste das Zimmer verlassen, bis die Erzieherin nach kam, um die Situation mit dem Kind in Ruhe zu klären. Sie fühle sich überhaupt nicht mehr wohl jetzt dort.

Muss man hier schon etwas schmunzeln, so liest man am besten nicht weiter, was andere Mütter darunter schreiben:

""Das ist verletzte Aufsichtspflicht! Dafür kannst du sie kündigen lassen!""

""Melde das dem Träger.""

""Erkundige dich beim Rechtsanwalt.""

""Vielleicht kann man den KiGa deshalb schließen lassen, frag mal bei Jugendamt nach.""

Ungelogen.

Alltag im Kindergarten

Ich habe mir also ein Herz gefasst und versucht zu erklären, wie eine Essenssituation im KiGa abläuft:

20 Kinder sitzen um einen Tisch und warten darauf, dass du jedem von Ihnen das Essen austeilst. Nebenbei rufen die ersten schon wieder nach was zu trinken, weil ihr Glas schon ausgetrunken ist. Ein kleineres Kind braucht Hilfe dabei, sein Fleisch zu schneiden.

Ein weiteres jammert darüber, dass ihm das Essen nicht schmeckt. Der Nebenmann schmeißt das Glas um, die Pfütze muss aufgewischt werden. Wieder leere Trinkgläser. Zwei Kinder streiten, weil einer eine Nudel vom Teller des anderen geklaut hat und die zwei daneben bewerfen sich giggelnd mit ihrem Essen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Wir Erzieher stehen jeden Tag kurz vor dem Burnout

So... Ist es da nicht vielleicht gar nicht soooooo unverständlich, dass das Kind kurz draußen warten soll, bis alle versorgt sind, damit die Erzieherin dann in Ruhe mit ihm sprechen kann um die Situation zu klären? Vor allem, wenn die Gruppentüre ein Glasfenster hat, um sehen zu können, was draußen vor sich geht?

Ich habe für diese Darstellung viele ""Likes"" bekommen, hauptsächlich von anderen Erzieherinnen. Von den anderen wurde meine Sicht der Dinge ignoriert. Ganz klar, sonst kann man sich ja nicht weiter aufregen.

Keine Ahnung von den Aufgaben der Erzieher

Nun könnte man meinen, dieses Phänomen tritt nur im Internet auf. Aber nein.

Zurück in der Arbeitswelt, kann ich nur noch Kopfschütteln. Und es wird mit jedem Jahr nur schlimmer... KiGa-Bashing, das neue Hobby vieler Eltern. Eine ganz neue Art des Mobbing ist geboren.

Als Erzieher ist es heutzutage kaum mehr möglich, sich auf die Bedürfnisse der Kinder zu konzentrieren, da einige Eltern ihre eigenen Bedürfnisse beim Personal an erster Stelle sehen.

Es ist nicht mehr möglich, überhaupt irgendetwas richtig zu machen, deshalb verbringt man gefühlte Stunden damit, sich morgens oder mittags vor Eltern im Flur zu rechtfertigen, warum dieses oder jenes so passiert ist.

So kommt zum Beispiel eine Mutter mit der Beschwerde, man habe ihr am Vortag nicht gesagt, dass ihr Kind im Flur beim Anziehen Streit angefangen habe. Sie möchte so etwas aber bitte dringend immer sofort mitgeteilt bekommen, denn schließlich möchte sie dann mit ihrem Kind darüber reden können, dass man so etwas nicht tut.

Ok... das ist jetzt zum Beispiel eine der Aufgaben, die ein Erzieher eigentlich hat: Hilfe bei der Konfliktlösung. Vielleicht habe das aber auch bloß ich falsch verstanden.

Jedenfalls wird bei dieser Beschwerde und gleichzeitigen Bitte anscheinend übersehen, dass wir nicht nur ein Kind betreuen. Und bei einer Gruppe von 20 Kindern würde es ziemlich viel Zeit in Anspruch nehmen, jeder Mutter beim Abholen einen Bericht darüber zu erstatten, wann ihr Kind sich gestritten hat. Denn sind wir mal ehrlich: Kinder streiten ständig!

Auch kommt es manchmal vor, dass ein Kind dabei ausholt, und dem andern Kind ""eine scheppert"". Natürlich greifen wir Erzieher dann ein (selten schaffen wir das, bevor es ""klatsch"" gemacht hat, wir sind Menschen, keine Fantasyfiguren mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit), erklären, dass man dem andern nicht weh tun darf und zeigen alternative Handlungsmöglichkeiten auf.

Wir überprüfen, ob sich der andere weh getan hat, reichen Kühlbeutel und Kügelchen.

Beim Abholen werden Eltern von ""Täter"" und ""Opfer"" informiert, damit sie Bescheid wissen, falls Ihre Kinder daheim davon erzählen. Passt, oder? Nein, passt nicht.

Drohungen und Beleidigungen gegen das Personal

Greift ein Kind noch zwei mal öfter darauf zurück, sich körperlich zu wehren oder zu äußern, gibt es schon nach kürzester Zeit die lautstarke Forderung von Eltern, dieses Kind dem Jugendamt zu melden.

Es wird von einer Gefahrenlage im Kindergarten gesprochen. Ja, es wird sogar der Kindergarten gewechselt. Weil das ja sonst nirgends vorkommt oder toleriert wird! Nur hier ist das so.

Dass es sich hierbei um Kinder handelt, die zwei Minuten nach ihrem Streit wieder miteinander spielen und keiner dabei verletzt wurde, vergessen die Eltern hierbei leider komplett.

Natürlich gibt es auch Kinder, die tatsächlich Bedürfnisse haben, die ihr derzeitiger Kindergarten nicht erfüllen kann. Je nachdem worum es dabei geht, und vor allem, wenn so viel ""körperliches Verhalten"" im Spiel ist, kann man den Eltern dann also höflich ans Herz legen, dass heilpädagogisch geschultes Personal ihrem Kind besser dabei helfen kann, seine Konflikte zu bewältigen.

Dabei lässt man dann ganz bewusst weg, dass ihr Kind nicht aufgrund von Hochbegabung ""unterfordert"" ist, wie von den Eltern geschildert, sondern das Problem wo anders liegt.

Wenn's so einfach denn wäre... Nein.

""Was für ein unfähiges Personal kommt jetzt nicht mit meinem Kind zurecht? Dieser Kindergarten ist das Allerletzte! Andere müssen vor euch gewarnt werden!""

Wenn man dann als privater Kindergarten auch noch das Recht hat, den Betreuungsvertrag zu kündigen, weil man mit den Eltern zusammen im Gespräch nicht weiter kommt und sich angemessene Hilfe für das Kind wünscht (und andere Eltern berechtigterweise schon mit dem Jugendamt drohen) erreicht der Frust dieser Eltern ganz neue Dimensionen.

Drohungen, den Kindergarten bei der Familienministerin zu melden. Beim Landesjugendamt über das unfähige Personal informieren wollen.

Ja, solche Drohungen gehören mittlerweile zum Alltag eines Erziehers.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Die Eltern werden dir die Hölle heiß machen"" - das habe ich in 40 Jahren als Erzieherin gelernt

Erzieher sollen sich aber ganz selbstverständlich beißen lassen, wenn man versucht, das Kind zu beruhigen. Immerhin sind wir ja selber schuld, unfähig wie wir sind.

Organisierte Elternbanden

Man könnte jetzt sagen: Ok, vielleicht ist das ein Problem der privaten Einrichtungen. Aber nein! Die Kollegin aus dem Regelkindergarten erzählt, dass sie einen Papa im Garten neulich fragte, warum er mit seinem Handy Fotos der dort zum Spielen vorhandenen Fahrräder macht.

Sie wurde dann darüber aufgeklärt, dass sein Kind sich an einem Fahrrad in den Finger geschnitten hat. Drei Tage später kam ein Brief vom Rechtsanwalt der gegen den Kindergarten klagt, weil bei einem Fahrrad am Lenker der Gummigriff fehlte und sich das Kind dort verletzt habe.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Liebe Eltern: Hört auf, eure Kinder zu verweichlichten Menschen zu erziehen

Oder aber organisierte Elternbanden, die sich beim Bürgermeister beschweren, weil der Kindergarten sich pädagogisch begründet weigert, das Vorschulprogramm nach den Vorstellungen einzelner Eltern für alle zu erweitern.

Wenn ich also morgens aufstehe und mich für die Arbeit fertig mache denke ich mir nicht: Oh ja, heute backe ich Kuchen mit den Kids! Sondern: Mal sehen, was mich heute wieder davon abhält, Kuchen mit den Kids zu backen.

Die traurige Wahrheit ist: Die ganze Zeit, die wir damit verbringen, uns mit solchen Dingen herumzuschlagen, verbringen wir eben nicht bei den Kindern.

Aber liebe Eltern, was glaubt ihr denn, wem ihr hier eure Kinder anvertraut? Sind wir auf das viele Geld aus, dass man als Erzieher verdient? Bekommt man einen Erzieherabschluss durchs Beantworten von Multiple-Choice-Fragen im Internet?

Wir wollen für eure Kinder da sein

Erzieher sind Menschen, die es sich zum Beruf gemacht haben, für eure Kinder da zu sein. Wir wollen sie umsorgen, ihnen etwas beibringen und ihnen einen geborgenen Raum für ihre Entwicklung schaffen.

Die ganze Negativität, die tagtäglich über das ""Nichts-recht-machen-können"" in unseren Gruppenalltag eindringt, verstört Kinder und Personal.

Wir opfern unsere Freizeit, um Spielzeug für Eure Kinder zu basteln, um Feste vorzubereiten und um uns Beschäftigungen mit Lerneffekt auszudenken.

Die geopferte Freizeit wird aber mit jedem mal Drama etwas weniger. Denn ganz ehrlich: Wer hat schon Lust, sich unbezahlt Gedanken über die Arbeit zu machen, wenn man als Dank dafür schlecht gemacht wird und sich beleidigen lassen muss?

Liebe besagte Eltern, seht ihr nicht, dass ihr höchstpersönlich dafür sorgt, dass die Qualität schlechter und die Geduld weniger wird, die wir gerne für eure Kinder übrig hätten?

Jedem, der sich in diesen Beispielen mit ähnlichem Verhalten wiedererkennt, möchte ich sagen:

Ihr seid die Tyrannen, die ihren Anteil am Personalnotstand der Kindergärten haben.

Wer möchte schon freiwillig unter solchen Umständen arbeiten?!

Es gibt sie noch, die ""normalen"" Eltern

Abschließend möchte ich aber dringend betonen: Es gibt sie natürlich noch, die ""normalen"" Eltern!

Die Eltern, die wissen, dass ich morgens nicht aufstehe, um mir zu überlegen, wie ich sie ärgern kann oder ihr Kind negativ in seiner Entwicklung beeinflussen kann.

Die Eltern, die wissen, dass ich morgens aufstehe, weil ich ihre Kinder liebe, und nur das Beste für die mir anvertrauten kleinen Menschen will.

Die Eltern, die ""Danke"" sagen.

Die Eltern, die mir nicht sofort böse Absicht unterstellen, wenn tatsächlich mal ein Fehler passiert.

Die Eltern, die zu vernünftigen Gesprächen bereit sind, wenn es ein Problem gibt.

Bitte, liebe ""normale"" Eltern! Ihr müsst endlich lauter sein als die Dauer-Motzer und Drama-Verursacher! Damit wir weiterhin wissen, warum wir morgens aufstehen und nicht irgendwann resignieren.

While some commenters thought their hand-holding was sweet, Jezebel pointed out that it somewhat looked like Donald was wrapping his hand around Melania’s closed fist:

A post shared by First Lady Melania Trump (@flotus) on Nov 4, 2017 at 10:39am PDT

Elaine Swann, a lifestyle and etiquette expert who has been featured in the New York Times and appeared on the “Today Show,” said it did not appear that the two were holding hands.

“The reason [I think this] is because you can clearly see Melania’s fingers and you don’t see any separation in her fingers ― like his [fingers] in between hers. It looks like what he did is clasped his hand over hers,” she said.

“It does appear odd to me in this particular incident because they’re visiting this memorial here that is very moving in terms of the gravity of the lives that were lost during the Pearl Harbor attack,” Swann explained. “Normally, when you are connected to your mate, your spouse, your partner, you’d expect to see more of a connection between the two, because when you think about lives lost and then you have your life partner next to you, it does make you want to clasp that person a little tighter, hold them a little closer. For whatever reason, I don’t see that in this particular photo here.”

She added, “It looks to me more like these are two people standing and posing for a photo opportunity. They’re obviously very cognizant of the fact that they’re being photographed.”

But according to Jacqueline Whitmore, an international etiquette expert and founder of the Protocol School of Palm Beach, the two are just simply holding hands.

“On first glance, the president and first lady are holding hands. It’s not the traditional way, but they are still connecting by touching fingers,” she told HuffPost.

But as Swann pointed out, people scrutinize the Trumps’ awkward body language because they’ve seen so much awkwardness before.

“We’ve seen this a lot with this couple,” Swann said. “This is not anything new. We’ve seen instances where they just don’t seem that connected and I think this is just another example of their lack of affection — there’s not a lot of affection in this relationship.”

In April, President Trump was criticized for walking extremely far ahead of his wife while deplaning Air Force One, especially compared to how past presidential couples deplaned together:

And just one month later, two videos of Melania swatting or snubbing the president’s attempts to hold her hand went viral:

By October, the two were holding hands, albeit a little awkwardly:

It simply appears that these two switch up their hand-holding techniques depending on the day:

At the request of the Prime Minister, Patel is now flying back to the UK from a trip to Uganda.
Almost exactly 16 months after being first promoted to the Cabinet (on May’s second day in office), Patel’s political career seems to be in a terminal nose-dive.

But the PM nevertheless senses the urgency of needing to sack her International Development Secretary after the latest proof that she ‘went rogue’ with her very own foreign policy.

At the request of the Prime Minister, Patel is now flying back to the UK from a trip to Uganda. While she’s up the air, her career isn’t – she looks finished. No.10 would not be telling us that May has summoned her minister for her second dressing down in three days, only to then let her off with a slap on the wrist. Almost exactly 16 months after being first promoted to the Cabinet (on May’s second day in office), Patel’s political career seems to be in a terminal nose-dive.

The reason for the sacking is yet another example of Patel failing to be straight with the PM over her links to Israeli officials and lobbyists. Last night it emerged she’d not told No.10 about plans to fund the Israeli Defence Force in the Golan Heights. This morning, it seems two meetings in September were not disclosed, and on top of that her trip colleague Lord Polak now seems to have links to lobbyists (as the Times points out, another breach of the ministerial code). There have long been concerns about Patel’s links to Indian PM Narendra Modi too. I’m told the PM wants to personally talk to Patel to hear an explanation of her Israeli links, but the outcome looks clear. Lying to the Guardian about your trip is bad enough. Trying to con the PM is another entirely.

Given we are so close to the Budget, a wide reshuffle looks unlikely and we may get another limited set of changes similar to Fallon’s demise last week. Will Sir Alan Duncan (ex-DfID, now FCO) get the nod? Will Alastair Burt (as expert on the Middle East complexities as any minister in government) get the promotion many thinks he deserves? Patel was well-liked by many Tory MPs, and was a Brexiteer. Will her replacement have to be a Brexiteer too? May can’t bodge this one like she did Gavin Williamson’s promotion last week.

The Sun has a devastating quote from an ally of the PM: “Priti wants to be leader, she’s made that very clear to all of us. Unfortunately for her, she’s too stupid and her actions here have proved that.” But Patel’s own allies suspect the Foreign Office has been briefing against her. However, few subscribe to the conspiracy theory of Nadhim Zahawi on Newsnight last night: “Some of this stuff is being drummed up because both Priti and the Foreign Secretary are big beasts in the Brexit campaign and some Labour Remoaners and others who think if we take out some of these beasts and derail the government then maybe we can actually do a U-turn on Brexit.”

May is acting now, despite her earlier prevarication, because she really has no choice. Some of her ministers want her to use this to really stamp her authority on the Government and fire both Boris and Patel at the same time and start a full scale reshuffle. For now, May just be relieved to have enough authority to sack anyone. There are huge questions as to why the PM hadn’t already referred Patel for ministerial code breaches, and further questions as to the effectiveness of Cabinet office ethics chief Sue Gray and the entire investigations process. But for now, the PM has at least to steady the ship of state. Again.","The Waugh Zone Wednesday November 8, 2017",http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/the-waugh-zone-wednesday-november-8-2017_uk_5a02cafce4b06ff32c946e65?ars&utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage

Je dis sur ce plateau que je me fous complètement de ce qu'on dit de moi"", s'était défendue la sulfureuse jeune femme, en mars 2016.

Alors faisons un peu d'histoire

Dans leur ouvrage ""Le Goulag"", (Editions bouquins 1120 pages) dont Libération rend compte le 18 octobre 2017, les historiens Luba Jurgenson et Nicolas Werth sont précis. ""Combien étaient-ils (au goulag) ? 20 millions de femmes dont on a peu parlé, d'enfants dont-on n'a pas parlé et d'hommes dont on a parlé mais pas assez sont passés par les camps de l'Administration principale des camps, la Glavnoïé oupravlénié laguéreï, dont l'acronyme restera : le ""Goulag"". Combien sont morts ? Probablement 4 millions, entre 1929 et 1954, estime Werth, sans prendre en compte les ""libérés"" de la dernière minute, celle qui précédait la mort, et les détenus abattus par un gardien irascible pour une réflexion, un geste maladroit ou pour rire.""

Nous avons tous en tête ce que veut dire le mot ""goulag"" : cette cohorte ininterrompue de suppliciés, de damnés, ces condamnés, les forçats et déportés qui subissaient le joug d'un système totalitaire et meurtrier, qui avait pour nom le communisme et son avatar monstrueux, le stalinisme. Les condamnés à crever dans la neige et le froid. Des centaines de milliers d'exécutions sommaires, la famine organisée tout le temps, toujours, les millions de détenus, les peuples entiers déportés (comme les Tatars de Crimée), des millions de morts, c'est cela le goulag. C'est cela le goulag et rien d'autre, ce ne furent pas des camps de vacances ou le Club Med. Ce cauchemar du goulag, qui avait été révélé au monde par Alexandre Soljenitsyne dans son fameux ""Archipel du goulag"", publié en décembre 1973.

Polémique

Dernièrement, la députée La France insoumise Danièle Obono a pris la défense de la porte-parole du Parti des indigènes de la République (PIR), Houria Bouteldja, sa ""camarade"", dit-elle : ""Je respecte la militante antiraciste. C'est dans le mouvement antiraciste que je l'ai connue, c'est dans ces luttes-là que l'on s'est battues"", a-t-elle déclaré au micro de Radio J. Contradictoirement et probablement sous la charge médiatique, la charge et les moqueries diverses dans les réseaux sociaux, notamment dans les réseaux sociaux, la députée déclare ensuite : ""Je ne suis pas et n'ai jamais été membre du PIR [Parti des indigènes de la République, ndlr]. Je suis en profond désaccord avec leurs thèses."" C'est ce qu'écrit ce lundi 6 novembre, sur sa page Facebook, la députée France insoumise Danièle Obono. ""Mon seul programme est celui de La France Insoumise, l'Avenir en commun. J'en ai coordonné les livrets thématiques. Je souscris à l'ensemble du programme sans exclusive. C'est celui sur lequel j'ai été élue députée de la 17e circonscription de Paris"", écrit-elle. Il était temps, Madame la députée, que vous tentiez de clarifier votre pensée.

Quant à la photographie présentant la porte-parole du PIR à côté d'une pancarte ""Les sionistes au goulag"", Danièle Obono juge qu'il s'agissait d'une ""photo de très mauvais goût"", qui n'était ""pas acceptable"", rapporte BFMTV, en date du 5 novembre 2017.

Pas acceptable cette photographie?

Voilà pour le moins, un euphémisme. On en rirait, si c'était drôle. Tant cette photographie est brutale, tant on peut penser que ce serait chouette, que ce serait tendance, fun et « antiraciste » d'envoyer les sionistes (les Juifs?) au goulag, donc à la mort. Je dis bien, à la mort.

Par ailleurs, interrogée sur le fait de savoir si les propos d'Houria Bouteldja - qui affirmait en mars 2015 que ""Les juifs sont les boucliers, les tirailleurs de la politique impérialiste française et de sa politique islamophobe"" - étaient des propos racistes ou antiracistes, la députée de Paris a répondu: ""Je ne sais pas"". Terrifiant. Est-ce là l'antiracisme tendance ? Sont-ce là des valeurs ? Que de ne pas vouloir voir ou de ne pas comprendre que le pseudo antiracisme à la mode anti blancs, antijuifs, anti homosexuels ne relèvent en aucun cas des valeurs de l'antiracisme et des valeurs de la République?

The announcement came at the 23rd Conference of the Parties in Bonn, Germany, the world's biggest climate conference. The non-binding Paris accord, through which signatories pledge to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases over the coming decades, was brokered in 2015, when the annual conference was held in the French capital.

The deal was considered historic because it was the first climate agreement to include the U.S. ― the world's biggest historic emitter, with by far the largest per-capita carbon footprint ― and China, which currently produces the most carbon pollution on a national level. The U.S. took a lead role in shaping the deal.

Only war-torn Syria and Nicaragua, which protested the agreement's failure to impose strict demands on major polluters, refused to sign.

But President Donald Trump, who rejects scientists' warnings about climate change, announced plans to withdraw from the pact in June, insisting developing nations received more benefits and the U.S. got none. In his announcement ― which, under the terms of the deal, fully can't go into effect until November 2020 ― Trump seemed to conflate the accord with a trade deal, demonstrating what was widely described as a poor understanding of how the Paris agreement actually works.

PREVIOUSLY:

Actress Kristina Cohen said in a lengthy Facebook post shared Monday that “Gossip Girl” star Ed Westwick raped her three years ago.

Cohen, 27, said that she met Westwick, 30, through her boyfriend at the time, a producer who goes unnamed in the post. The incident occurred when the couple went over to actor’s house one night, she wrote.

Cohen was taken aback when Westwick allegedly suggested “we should all fuck,” but her boyfriend convinced her to stay for dinner to avoid making their host uncomfortable. At Westwick’s suggestion, Cohen said she then retired to the guest room for a nap while her boyfriend tried to smooth things over.

“So I went and laid down in the guest room where I eventually fell asleep, I was woken up abruptly by Ed on top of me, his fingers entering my body. I told him to stop, but he was strong,” Cohen wrote. “I fought him off as hard as I could but he grabbed my face in his hands, shaking me, telling me he wanted to fuck me. I was paralyzed, terrified. I couldn’t speak, I could no longer move. He held me down and raped me.”

“It was a nightmare, and the days following weren’t any better,” she added.

A representative for Westwick did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment.

David Krieger/Bauer-Griffin via Getty Images Ed Westwick and Leighton Meester film scenes for ""Gossip Girl"" in 2012.

Cohen said that her boyfriend blamed her for the assault and cautioned against speaking out against Westwick for the sake of her career.

Over the years, she has appeared in a handful of minor roles in projects including “Californication” and “The Middle,” as well as the web series “Ladies Like Us.” Westwick rose to fame on the hit CW soap playing bad boy Chuck Bass, a character with his own history of sexual assault. He now stars on the BBC Two series “White Gold.”

Cohen said the wave of sexual assault allegations leveled against powerful men in Hollywood pushed her to come forward with her story now. She hopes to change the public perception of men like Westwick and encourage other victims of sexual assault never to blame themselves.

“I’m sickened to see men like Ed respected in such a public way. Interviewed by prestigious platforms such as the Oxford Union Society at Oxford University, where he was honored as one of their ‘People who Shape our World,’” Cohen wrote. “How does this end?

Le tribunal constitutionnel allemand a donné à la chambre des députés jusqu'à ""fin 2018"" pour voter la légalisation d'un ""troisième sexe"" sur les registres de naissance, à côté des mentions ""masculin"" et ""féminin"", selon la décision de la juridiction consultée par l'AFP.

La juridiction basée à Karlsruhe invite les députés à introduire dans les documents concernés une mention telle que ""inter"", ""divers"" ou tout autre ""désignation positive du sexe"".

Pour que les personnes intersexes soient enregistrées ""positivement""

Comme le souligne le Süddeutsche Zeitung, cette demande de la cour constitutionnelle allemande est faite pour que les personnes intersexes puissent enregistrer leur identité de genre ""positivement"".

L'intersexualité désigne une personne étant née avec des organes génitaux ou des chromosomes qui ne correspondent pas à la traditionnelle binarité homme/femme. Souvent, les organes génitaux sont difficiles à identifier et les médecins décident d'orienter la personne vers un genre ou un autre.

Jusqu'à présent, il était possible en Allemagne depuis mai 2013 de ne pas renseigner le champ relatif au sexe en le laissant vide, les intéressés pouvant ensuite, au cours de leur vie, soit faire le choix d'un sexe masculin ou féminin, soit garder la mention du sexe non renseignée.

Mais la Cour fédérale de justice, une instance inférieure, avait refusé en août 2016 d'aller plus loin et de reconnaître l'existence juridique d'un troisième sexe, jugeant que ce ne serait ""pas légal"". Elle avait rejeté une demande d'une personne intersexuelle, née en 1989 et enregistrée avec le sexe féminin. Cette personne, comme le raconte Die Welt, s'appelle Vanja de Leipzig, et ne se considère ni comme un homme ni comme une femme.

Soutenue par une association de soutien au troisième sexe, cette personne s'est alors tournée vers la plus haute juridiction, la Cour constitutionnelle. La personne plaignante a présenté aux juges suprêmes des analyses chromosomiques mettant en évidence qu'il n'était ni un homme ni une femme.

En France, une demande semblable rejetée

En France, Gaëtan Schmitt, 66 ans, a demandé l'inscription sur son état-civil de la mention ""sexe neutre"". Dans un arrêt rendu en mai 2017, la Cour de cassation a rejeté cette demande. Cette personne est née selon les termes de son médecin, avec un ""vagin rudimentaire"", un ""micropénis"", mais pas de testicules.

À sa naissance, Gaëtan Schmitt a été reconnu comme un petit garçon, il a pris conscience de son intersexualité à l'âge de 12 ans. Après la publication de l'arrêt de la Cour de cassation, les deux avocats de ce Français ont décidé de porter un recours devant la Cour européenne des droits de l'homme.

Selon des estimations du Conseil d'éthique, 80.000 personnes intersexuées vivent aujourd'hui en Allemagne.

Si les députés valident bien la demande des juges constitutionnels, cela ferait de l'Allemagne le premier pays en Europe à reconnaître officiellement un troisième genre. En mai, la France avait rejeté la mention ""sexe neutre"", écartant la demande d'une personne née sans pénis ni vagin.

The picture, snapped by a White House photographer traveling with the president as he left his golf course in Sterling, Va., went viral almost immediately. News outlets picked up the story when it appeared in a White House pool report. Late-night talk show hosts told jokes about the encounter and people on social media began hailing the unidentified woman as a “she-ro,” using the hashtag #Her2020.

The woman’s name is Juli Briskman. Her employer, government contractor Akima LLC, wasn’t so happy about the photo. They fired her over it.

In a Saturday interview with HuffPost, Briskman, a 50-year-old mother of two, said she was stunned that someone had taken a picture of her giving Trump the middle finger.

As the photo circulated online, Briskman decided to tell Akima’s HR department what was happening when she went to work on Monday. By Tuesday, her bosses called her into a meeting and said she had violated the company’s social media policy by using the photo as her profile picture on Twitter and Facebook.

“They said, ‘We’re separating from you,‘” said Briskman. “Basically, you cannot have ‘lewd’ or ‘obscene’ things in your social media. So they were calling flipping him off ‘obscene.’”

Briskman, who worked in marketing and communications at Akima for just over six months, said she emphasized to the executives that she wasn’t on the job when the incident happened and that her social media pages don’t mention her employer. They told her that because Akima was a government contractor, the photo could hurt their business, she said.

Virginia is an employment-at-will state, meaning employers can fire people anytime and for any reason. But Briskman said what’s been particularly infuriating is that a male colleague kept his job after recently posting lewd comments on his Facebook page that featured Akima LLC as his cover photo. She said this colleague was reprimanded for calling someone “a fucking Libtard asshole” on Facebook, but was allowed to delete the post and keep his job.

“How is that any less ‘obscene’ than me flipping off the president?” she asked. “How is that fair?”

Akima did not respond to requests for comment via email and phone.

Juli Briskman Someone posted this graphic on Juli Briskman's Facebook page after she flipped off the president's motorcade. Briskman was amused.

Asked what she was thinking when she saw Trump’s motorcade roll up next to her, Briskman said it was a gut reaction to flip him off.

“He was passing by and my blood just started to boil,” she said. “I’m thinking, DACA recipients are getting kicked out. He pulled ads for open enrollment in Obamacare. Only one-third of Puerto Rico has power. I’m thinking, he’s at the damn golf course again.”

“I flipped off the motorcade a number of times,” she added.

Briskman, a Democrat, said she plans to look for a new job with an advocacy group that she believes in, like Planned Parenthood or PETA.

Despite getting fired, she said she has no regrets about the attention her public show of displeasure with Trump received. In fact, she said she’s happy to be an image of protest that resonates with many Americans.

“In some ways, I’m doing better than ever,” she said. “I’m angry about where our country is right now. I am appalled. This was an opportunity for me to say something.”

CANBERRA -- Clarity and clear air are in short supply in Canberra.

As the prime minister and opposition leader meet on Wednesday in an attempt to get an bipartisan deal on the rules and time-frame for citizenship declarations, the whole citizenship debacle has managed to get even messier.

The cases of Labor MPs Justine Keay and Susan Lamb are again under review in the light of the strict reading of the High Court's decision in the citizenship seven case, while the case of Liberal MP John Alexander remains unresolved and he has indicated he may not have to comply until late December.

And Turnbull Government minister Josh Frydenberg is still checking out his own personal circumstances.

But there appears to be some room emerging to sort it all out.

After hearing that MPs were being warned that federal parliament may have to sit for an extra week in 2017, HuffPost Australia understands the option to recall parliament just days before Christmas is now being seriously canvassed by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

It could be a day, or a week, of pure citizenship resolution if needed and fits in with the PM's current plan to get all federal politicians to publicly declare their citizenship history within 21 days of the individual houses of Parliament passing a resolution on the matter.

It is likely the day or days would be used to send referrals for citizenship determination to the High Court.

Recalling Parliament for one day likely to cost $2 million. That's before High Court. Precedent: taxpayers pick up tab for MPs @SkyNewsAust https://t.co/JNioGEOLER — Samantha Maiden (@samanthamaiden) November 8, 2017

Will the PM's declaration plan remain at 21 days for disclosure? Not if Labor leader Bill Shorten has anything to do with it. Labor also wants details of the birth and citizenship of grandparents added to the details of parents in the declaration.

The opposition has stated it is willing to work with the PM on an alternative to a much called for audit, but Labor's senate leader Penny Wong sees the proposed time-frame as a ""blatant attempt to skate through this difficult period to next year"".

While described by both Turnbull and Shorten as ""constructive,"" there's been no agreement between the prime minister and opposition leader after a two hour meeting in Melbourne on Wednesday.

PM Turnbull describes Labor MP's Justine Keay's situation as ""a real issue"". #Citizenship Karen Barlow (@KJBar) November 8, 2017

Shorten is proposing a December 1 deadline.

""This crisis, unfortunately, needs to be dealt with immediately,"" he told reporters.

""The High Court set a higher test of us. Labor is not going to support watering down the High Court decisions to help a few MPs scrape back into parliament.""

Turnbull realises the need for urgency, but has not given ground on the time-fram.

""We await some further thoughts from the Leader of the Opposition but I do think it is important to get on with it,"" Turnbull told reporters after the meeting.

""We are certainly agreed on the need for disclosure and of the kind that I've set out in the resolution and we're also agreed that the matter must be dealt with before the end of the year. By that, I mean that the disclosures should be made before the end of the year and the house and the Senate should have the opportunity, having considered those disclosures, whether any members or senators should be referred to the High Court.""

The opposition may have its own problems.

Labor colleagues, including Shorten, have on Wednesday pronounced confidence in the citizenship status of MPs Keay and Lamb but previous statements showing the Labor MPs relying on ""reasonable steps"" to renounce foreign citizenship which were shown in the October verdicts as not being enough.

The Guardian has reviewed Keay's pronouncement on social media in August to find she admitted her renunciation of British citizenship was not effective until after the 2016 election but insisted she and Lamb are relying on ""reasonable steps"" to renounce foreign citizenship.

In particular, Keay posted she had applied to renounce British citizenship in May 2016 and had therefore ""taken all reasonable steps,"" thus satisfying the ""test set out by the High Court in the landmark case Sykes vs Cleary"".

The nomination date for the election was 9 June 2016, but Keay admits the official date of renunciation was 11 July 2016.

Considering the black letter reading of Section 44 (i) of the Constitution, which knocked out the deputy prime minister and four senators (plus Stephen Parry, although his case has not gone to the High Court), the High Court appears to have lifted the bar.

Turnbull described Keay's situation on Wednesday as a ""real issue"" that's ""going to involve some considerable legal debate.""

""I think the High Court's been very clear on the matter in the recent decision,"" he said. ""It is a very tough, very literal decision that's been taken. We have to comply with it.""

Love it or leave it 🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺 https://t.co/swSAmc33CX — Alice Workman (@workmanalice) November 8, 2017

But Shorten said he is not about to take legal advice from the prime minister.

""He got it so wrong with his own ministers, his own Deputy Prime Minister and now the President of the Senate, a Liberal appointee,"" he said. ""I am confident Labor has pretty exhaustive vetting procedures and I'm confident steps have been taken, yes.""

Lamb states she renounced British citizenship in May 2016, but has refused to answer questions about when her renunciation was confirmed.

Meanwhile Alexander is digging in while attempting to clarify his citizenship status with the British Home Office.

Alexander indicated to Seven News on Tuesday he may not let us all know what his citizenship status is until late December. Essentially he is keen to wait for the 21 days, proposed by the PM, after the House passes a resolution on declarations.

The annual Global Gender Gap Report from the World Economic Forum, published Thursday, makes for more bleak reading to accompany the sexual abuse and harassment scandals plaguing numerous industries and governments.

The survey of 144 countries finds that as a whole, gender equality has worsened globally for the first time since WEF first produced its index in 2006. While income levels are rising, women are not sharing equally in the benefits, even in the most affluent countries.

“There seems to be a slowdown in momentum when it comes to proactive measures being taken to address gender gaps, particularly in the workplace,” said Vesselina Stefanova Ratcheva, an economist at WEF.

The index measures how opportunities and participation differ for men and women across four key areas: health, education, economy and politics. The most challenging gaps are in economy and politics, according to the report.

The U.S. saw its ranking drop from 45th last year to 49th this year, mostly due to a lack of women in U.S. politics. Men hold nearly 81 percent of the seats in Congress and make up the majority of mayors and governors.

The top 10 countries for gender equality are predominantly European, with four northern European nations in the top five. Iceland is in the top position for the ninth year in a row, followed by Norway and Finland.

But it’s not just European countries that scored highly; the top 10 also included Rwanda and Nicaragua. These economies are “putting in place more gender-equal opportunities regardless of their level of economic development,” said Stefanova Ratcheva.

None of the big powerhouse economies of the G-20 made it into the top 10, “showing that economic power is not necessarily a recipe for better equality between the sexes,” according to WEF.

However, gender equality does appear to promote better economic performance, according to numerous studies. A McKinsey Global Institute analysis estimated that more equality between the sexes would boost the global economy by $28 trillion. For the U.S. in particular, the WEF index cites a study that economic parity could add $1.7 trillion to the country’s GDP.

Despair shouldn’t be the main takeaway from the index, WEF insisted. “It is important to note that while the global picture is bleak in 2017, there have been some clear signs of progress in the past decade,” said Stefanova Ratcheva.

The gender gap in education could be closed within the next 13 years, says WEF. And there are some standout countries that have made rapid improvements ― including Canada, which climbed 19 places for women’s progress in politics and wages.

“What is needed is new energy and commitment at the leader level ― in business as well as political leadership ― to put these into effect,” said Stefanova Ratcheva.

Yes, you read that correctly -- an advent calendar that has ousted chocolate and brought in the gin.

The people at Gintonica created the calendar which includes 24 different types of Australian craft gin ready to try each day of December. The various gins come from five different Australian states and represent 21 distillers. The bottles are 50 millilitres in size.

The calendar also includes serving suggestions and tasting notes from the distillers and a few gin cocktail recipes.

The Advent Season Traditionally, advent is the season before Christmas during which Christians prepare for the coming of Christ. The name 'Advent' itself comes from the Latin word 'adventus' which means 'arrival'. The season includes the four Sundays before Christmas and is observed using a wreath with four candles -- one candle for each week in the season. Each Sunday, a new candle is lit as Christmas approaches. Of course, the Advent season is celebrated by many people, religious or not. Advent calendars are often the highlight of this time for children, as they can eat a little chocolate each day. All over the world, Christmas markets pop-up in town squares and main streets, decorations appear and trees go up. In the warmer weather, many Aussies choose to check out the light displays in their local areas, or to travel a little further afield and visit some of the more extravagant houses. For most of us, Advent is a time to catch up with family and friends and attend Christmas parties among the mad dash from store to store to get that Christmas shopping done.

The Australian Gin Advent Calendar is available for purchase via the Gintonica website, however they can only be shipped to locations within Australia. Orders will be shipped before December 1, so you won't need to play catch up once the final month of 2017 ticks around.

Doch in ihrer Amtszeit hat Deutschland kaum Fortschritte beim Klimaschutz gemacht

Das zeigt sich vor allem bei der Kohleenergie

Angela Merkels wohl größtes Versagen lässt sich auf die Tonne genau messen.

Als die ehemalige Bundesumweltministerin 2005 ins Kanzleramt einzog, stieß Deutschland 992 Millionen Tonnen klimaschädliches Kohlendioxid (CO2) aus. 2015 waren es 902 Millionen Tonnen. Der Ausstoß müsste aber viel schneller sinken, wenn Deutschland sein offizielles Klimaziel von 751 Millionen Tonnen im Jahr 2020 noch schaffen will, kritisieren Experten.

Die Zahlen zeigen: Die Bilanz, die Angela Merkel als Klimakanzlerin vorzuweisen hat, ist rabenschwarz.

Und das obwohl Deutschland weltweit als eine Art Öko-Primus angesehen wird. Die Wahrheit, das zeigt sich zum Start der 23. Weltklimakonferenz in Bonn, sieht anders aus.

“Trump ist wenigstens ehrlich”

Wegen ihrer gescheiterten Klimapolitik vergleicht “Die Zeit” Merkel gar mit Donald Trump. “Merkel betreibt eine klimafeindliche Politik”, urteilt die Wochenzeitung.

Aber im Gegensatz zur Kanzlerin sei der US-Präsident wenigstens ehrlich und zeige offen, dass ihm das Klima egal ist.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Deutschland hat ein schmutziges Geheimnis"": TV-Sender CNN macht Merkel schwere Vorwürfe

Gründe für Deutschlands Versagen beim Klimaschutz gibt es viele: Die schleppende Verkehrswende, das gedrosselte Tempo beim Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien, die Stagnation beim Umbau der Wärmeversorgung.

Aber das Scheitern der Kanzlerin wird nirgendwo deutlicher als im Bereich der Kohleenergie.

Zum Hintergrund:

► In Deutschland stehen die schmutzigsten Kohlemeiler Europas.

► Fast die Hälfte des klimaschädlichen CO2-Ausstoßes in Deutschland geht auf das Konto des Energiesektors.

► Im Energiesektor verursachen Kohlekraftwerke wiederum den Großteil der Klimagase.

► Deutschland fördert mehr der besonders schmutzigen Braunkohle als jede andere Land der Welt (China und Indien fördern vor allem Steinkohle).

Angela Merkel kennt all diese Zahlen. Und als Physikerin weiß sie zu gut, was Kohlekraftwerke mit dem Klima anrichten. Aber ebenso wie schmutzige Dieselautos stellt die Kanzlerin die Kohle unter Artenschutz.

Die Frage ist: Warum? Die wahrscheinlichste Antwort lautet: Weil sich daraus bisher politisch kein Kapital schlagen lässt.

Kohleausstieg wird in einer Jamaika-Koalition kaum zu machen sein

Im Jahr 2010 blockierte Merkel ein frühzeitiges Ende der Subventionen für deutsche Kohlekraftwerke, die die EU durchsetzen wollte.

2013 hieß es im Koalitionsvertrag noch, dass die Kohleverbrennung “auf absehbare Zeit unverzichtbar” sei. Dann versuchte Merkel sich an einer Kohlewende - die sie aber nie durchzog.

Im Frühjahr 2015 hatte die Kanzlerin noch Zustimmung für einen langsamen Kohleausstieg in Deutschland signalisiert - organisieren wollte ihn ihr damaliger Wirtschaftsminister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD).

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Klimaschutz: Wer nicht mitmacht, den bestraft das Leben

Doch nachdem sich die Ministerpräsidenten von Sachsen, Brandenburg und Sachsen-Anhalt und ranghohe Parteimitglieder gegen den Plan aussprachen, beerdigte Merkel die Idee.

Zwar hatte die Kanzlerin auch im Wahlkampf vorsichtige Zustimmung zu einem Ausstieg aus der Braunkohle signalisiert. Im Sommerinterview hatte sie erklärt, man könne einen Braunkohleausstieg “ins Auge fassen”, wenn es Pläne für die Zukunft der Beschäftigten in der Kohleindustrie gebe.

Doch für einen Kohleausstieg kämpfen nun die Grünen in den Jamaika-Verhandlungen allein. Von einer Unterstützung der Kanzlerin für ihre Pläne ist bisher nichts an die Öffentlichkeit gedrungen. An der Frage des Klimaschutzes drohen nun sogar die Verhandlungen für eine Jamaika-Koalition zu scheitern.

Dabei drängt die Zeit. Denn je länger die schmutzigen Kohlekraftwerke am Netz sind, desto schwieriger wird es für Deutschland, seine Klimaziele zu erreichen.

Sogar China verabschiedet sich von der Kohle

Und während Deutschland noch zögert, gehen andere Länder voran.

Unter anderem haben Norwegen und Großbritannien den vollständigen Kohleausstieg beschlossen. Selbst Kohlegroßverbraucher wie Indien und China haben zuletzt die Kraftwerksöfen gedrosselt.

China schickt sich an, bei der Kohlepolitik sogar zum Vorbild zu werden: 1,3 Millionen Jobs sollen in dem Sektor in den kommenden Jahren laut der Regierung wegfallen. Neue Arbeitsplätze sollen dafür im Bereich der erneuerbaren Energien entstehen. Schon jetzt arbeiten rund 2,5 Millionen Menschen in der chinesischen Solarindustrie.

In Deutschland gehen Arbeitsplätze bei den Erneuerbaren verloren

In Deutschland verläuft die Entwicklung genau umgekehrt. 2015 waren rund 330.000 Menschen direkt oder indirekt durch den Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien beschäftigt. Die Zahl sank aber zuletzt deutlich.

Im Vergleich dazu sind die Beschäftigtenzahlen in der Kohleindustrie gering. Je nachdem auf welche Statistik man blickt, beschäftigt die Braunkohleindustrie in Deutschland direkt und indirekt zwischen 20.000 und 50.000 Menschen. Im Bereich der Steinkohle sind in Deutschland gerade einmal noch rund 7500 Menschen beschäftigt.

Sicher ist: Die Kohleenergie muss früher oder später ohnehin aus dem Energiemix verschwinden. Warum dann nicht mit dem Ausstieg jetzt schon beginnen und Angestellte langsam umschulen und in anderen Bereich unterbringen?

Deutsche sind mehrheitlich für Kohleausstieg

Merkels Zögern beim Kohleausstieg ist inzwischen sogar zu einem Hemmnis für die Energiewende an sich geworden, einst ein Vorzeigeprojekt Deutschlands: Es macht die Energiewende komplizierter und teurer als nötig.

Denn Kohlekraftwerke und vergleichsweise saubere Energielieferanten vertragen sich schlecht. Vereinfacht gesagt: Kohlekraftwerke produzieren kontinuierlich Strom. Das klingt erst einmal gut. Aber damit blockiert die Kohle die Netze für Wind- und Solarstrom, denn Kohlekraftwerke können die Produktion nur langsam drosseln.

Geeigneter um im Verbund mit Wind und Sonne Strom zu liefern sind dynamische Gaskraftwerke.

Die Folge: Solange viele Kohlekraftwerke am Netz sind, muss der Umbau des Energiesystems zu einer sauberen Versorgung gedrosselt werden. Deutschland verspielt damit die Chance wenigstens nach 2020 seine Klimaziele zu erreichen.

Und noch ein weiteres Argument der Kohlebefürworter zählt nicht: Der Preis. Inzwischen ist Strom aus Windrädern ähnlich günstig wie Strom aus Kohlekraftwerken. In den kommenden Jahren wird Windstrom sogar billiger als schmutziger Kohlestrom.

Ein Plan für den Ausstieg aus der Kohle ist also aus mehreren Gründen längst überfällig. Das findet auch eine Mehrheit der Deutschen. Nach einer Emnid-Umfrage für die “Bild am Sonntag” sind 59 Prozent der Deutschen dafür, dass die nächste Bundesregierung den Kohleausstieg beschließt, und 31 Prozent dagegen.

Eigentlich ist Angela Merkel bekannt dafür ihre Entscheidungen stark an Umfragen zu orientieren. Beim Kohleausstieg ist davon allerdings noch nichts zu merken.

Da una parte un pontefice anziano che non festeggia, semmai ripudia il matrimonio centenario tra Chiesa e democrazie cristiane. Dall'altra il prototipo di un principe azzurro che invece le corteggia, le conquista e fa sue in una sera d'autunno. Aitante e andante, ma non troppo. Adagio e rassicurante quanto basta per non sembrare banalmente, brutalmente populista. Distanziandosi dal magiaro Victor Orbán e al tempo stesso avvicinandosi a lui, a occupare l'altro lato del trattino che compone, anzi ricompone l'Austria – Ungheria, nel centenario della sua dissoluzione. Operando una mutazione genetica e spostando a destra in modo soft, ineffabile ma ineluttabile, Dna e centri gravitazionali del cattolicesimo sociale. Snaturandolo dolcemente ma irreversibilmente, a ritmo di valzer appunto. Attirando le pubbliche opinioni alla stregua di vergini evangeliche, frementi ed incuranti che alle lampade manchi l'olio, al bivio della notte che incombe sul continente, tra ritorno del Novecento e alba della globalità.

Ci sono date che saldano pezzi di storia e storie a pezzi.

Da un lato le nuove Dc, viso d'angelo e mano energica, nel format modaiolo e fascinante dell'asburgico Kurz o liturgico e penitenziale della polacca Beata Szydło, che aggiornano e agitano vessilli e allori, sull'onda montante dei sondaggi a favore. Dall'altro la barca di Pietro che in una mattina di giugno ammaina e archivia di converso lo scudo crociato. Pronunziando il verbo inaudito e buttando a fiume letteralmente, mediante parole che pesano come macigni, non solo i partiti, ma le ""istituzioni cattoliche"" tout azimut, ""banche, cooperative, circoli, sindacati, scuole"", passate in rassegna e bollate di ""attivismo separatista"" dal Pontefice: ""... senza volerlo, si costruiscono barriere che rischiano di diventare insormontabili all'emergere della domanda di fede. Si tende ad affermare ciò che divide rispetto a quello che unisce. È un metodo che non facilita l'evangelizzazione, chiude porte e genera diffidenza"".

Così, sulla sponda dell'Oglio, dal guado padano di Don Mazzolari, al culmine di un viaggio apparentemente italiano, ma in realtà internazionale, Bergoglio ha tratto il dado e mollato gli ormeggi del potere temporale, con i suoi approdi sicuri, per inoltrarsi nel mare aperto della globalizzazione: un oceano che ai Vicari di Cristo non offre porti e punti di riferimento, ma promette in cambio un lasciapassare per la Cina, sogno proibito di ogni Papa, dove si giocano i destini del XXI secolo. A condizione però di spogliarsi e sciogliersi a mo' di lievito, senza pretese identitarie. E attendere fiduciosi che il Signore faccia il resto.

Se non fosse tuttavia che a difesa dell'identità e dei suoi confini stavano nella ricorrenza di Lepanto un milione di rosari, schierati dal Baltico alla Vistola e per nulla intenzionati a levare l'ancora. Un muro spirituale o diga d'anime che emerge e si erge tra due cristianesimi, opposti e inconciliabili.

E se il Pontefice, determinato nel suo strappo, tira dritto e non mostra misericordia nei riguardi delle democrazie cristiane, queste ultime non la praticano, a loro volta, nei confronti dei ""profughi"" di ogni genere, dai migranti a Puigdemont, ignorando l'insegnamento del Papa e mettendo a dura prova l'impianto e gli ammortizzatori dell'edificio comunitario.

Seppure in contesti assai diversi, dall'astro in declino di Mariano Rajoy a quello nascente di Sebastian Kurz, l'assenza di ""misericordia"" è il dato che accomuna i governi austriaco e ispanico, un dì riconducibili sotto un unico scettro, e marca un ulteriore slittamento a destra dei popolari europei, estraniandoli viepiù dal sentire di Bergoglio, vistosamente orientato in altra direzione.

Una deriva che non risparmia nemmeno la corazzata Cdu di Angela Merkel, ammiraglia della flotta, con la sua stazza elettorale, dopo i siluri euroscettici e lo squarcio nello scafo delle legislative di settembre, con la perdita dell'8 per cento dei consensi.

Sicché, adesso più che mai, l'Europa costituisce il rompicapo di Francesco. Il puzzle che in luogo di completarsi si disgrega, nell'orizzonte degli anni che avanzano. Lo spazio che si prende la rivincita sul tempo e smentisce, rovesciandolo, l'intero assunto della sua geopolitica. E lo fa in modo beffardo, nella staffetta tra il 2017 e il 2018: saltando bruscamente dal cinquantesimo dei Trattati di Roma, celebrato in sordina e già derubricato nella memoria, direttamente al centenario della fine della Grande Guerra, sonoramente amplificato al contrario e autenticato dalla storia, in un big bang di nostalgie e geografie.

Se il primo non è riuscito a scaldare i cuori, l'altro gela sin d'ora i pensieri, mentre a Ovest tramontano le nazioni - Spagna oggi, Gran Bretagna domani - e ad Est rinascono gli imperi, russo e austro-ungarico, nelle sembianze del Gruppo di Visegrad, allargato e arroccato a Vienna.

È questo l'incubo del Papa perito chimico, di fronte alla miscela esplosiva di referendum e ultimatum, pronunciamenti e commissariamenti, ordinanze e latitanze.

Motivo che in cerca di una improbabile quanto improrogabile risurrezione lo ha indotto dal 27 al 29 ottobre a riunire a Roma, per tre giorni canonici, tra un Venerdì a Domenica, ecclesiastici e laici, accademici e politici dei ventotto paesi Ue. Tracciando nel suo intervento un excursus di alto profilo, da San Benedetto ai nostri giorni, ma omettendo di scendere al suolo dei problemi che scottano, sul tema scivoloso e impellente della Catalogna. Finendo per consegnare alle cronache, suo malgrado, l'immagine silente della Sede Apostolica, toccata e contagiata dalla sindrome immobilista di Bruxelles.

Il Papa del resto parlava di fronte a un'assemblea di separati in casa, pastori di una Chiesa divisa e percorsa, essa stessa, da una frattura.

In forma di geometria unificante, Bergoglio ha provato a esibire un classico e costruire l'incontro sull'asse Germania - Inghilterra, affidandosi a un presule britannico e a un cardinale teutonico. Un mix delle due vocazioni centripeta e centrifuga, conflittuali e sempre attuali del continente. Il ministro degli esteri vaticano Paul Richard Gallagher, nativo di Liverpool e conterraneo dei Beatles, con trascorsi a Strasburgo e un pedigree anti-Brexit. E l'arcivescovo di Monaco di Baviera Reinhard Marx, figlio di un sindacalista e presidente del Comece, l'organismo che raccorda le conferenze episcopali dell'Unione. Socialdemocrazia e pop, verrebbe da dire, con i loro sapori d'annata e linguaggi elaborati, nell'era del rap e degli odierni guru, barbari e digitali, che semplificano i messaggi e cavalcano leggiadri l'umore degli elettori, a colpi di slogan e giaculatorie.

Poiché la scossa questa volta non viene dalla Manica, bensì dalle rive del Danubio: linea di faglia tra i due cristianesimi, egalitario e identitario. Frontiera di una Brexit profonda, interiore, tra l'Est e l'Ovest dell'Europa. Una trincea dell'anima che appare in prospettiva più deleteria, incisiva e seria del muro di Berlino: e al cui cospetto le diatribe fra Londra e Bruxelles vengono declassate a beghe da cortile.

Ne consegue uno scisma strisciante di tipo culturale, non dottrinale. Politico non dogmatico. Nessuna eresia, quindi, ma piuttosto una epidemia che ha ormai raggiunto il Brennero e all'indomani del voto austro-tedesco rende la ""penisola"" ultima spiaggia del Pontefice argentino, per non rimanere ""isolato"".

Cornice paradossale in cui l'Italia eternamente democristiana, nelle diverse, variegate metamorfosi, berlusconiane o bertinottiane, renziane o pentastellate del suo imprinting, diventa il retroterra strategico del Papa postdemocristiano. Presidio e zona franca di un pontificato proteso con successo verso il Sud e l'Oriente, ma sempre più distante in compenso dal Nord e l'Occidente.

Una ""addizionale vaticana"" che la classe dirigente di per sé non appare in grado di sostenere, sulla carta, forse neppure di comprendere, ma che la storia inesorabile mette in conto, caricando le elezioni di primavera di una valenza geopolitica che le sprovincializza e le universalizza, tra proiezioni e profezie, alleanze divine e coalizioni terrene, successori di Pietro e convitati di pietra.","Il divorzio tra Papa Francesco e le democrazie cristiane d’Europa, da Rajoy a Kurz",http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/11/08/il-divorzio-tra-papa-francesco-e-le-democrazie-cristiane-d-europa-da-rajoy-a-kurz_a_23270475/

So, even if you got a flu shot last year, it won't be effective against the flu strains circulating this year.
It's important to note, though, that it takes two weeks for the flu shot to work.","Written by Sybil Millar, Communications Advisor for the Ross Tilley Burn Centre, Critical Care and Infectious Diseases programs at Sunnybrook.

Don't let the warm weather this fall fool you — flu season is arriving right on time. In fact, it arrived a bit earlier than usual this year.

""While flu season can happen anytime between October and April, it seemed to start earlier in Ontario this year,"" says Dr. Andy Simor, head, department of microbiology and infectious diseases consultant at Sunnybrook.

With that in mind, here are five things you should know about the 2017-2018 flu season :

1. Australia was hit hard by the flu this year

Each year, experts look to Australia's flu season (which occurs during their winter, between May and October) to get an idea of what our flu season might be like. While the influenza (flu) vaccine match was good this year in Australia, the country saw a much higher number of cases than usual, resulting in an increased number of hospitalizations and deaths.

""If the experience of southern hemisphere is predictive, we're in for a more difficult flu season than usual,"" says Dr. Simor.

2. There's more than one flu strain circulating

There are usually several strains of the flu circulating each year. As a result, the flu vaccine is trivalent, which means the shot protects against three different strains. This year, those three strains are influenza A (H1N1), H3N2 (the prevalent strain that was seen in Australia) and B.

The World Health Organization (WHO) determines which strains to include in the flu vaccine every year. With input from experts around the world, the WHO tries to predict which virus will be the most dominant. As a result, the flu shot protects against different strains every year. So, even if you got a flu shot last year, it won't be effective against the flu strains circulating this year.

3. Getting the flu shot is safe and effective

The flu vaccine is safe and effective, particularly in preventing serious complications that may occur from the flu (such as pneumonia, which can become deadly for some people).

""The flu can cause severe illness, especially in the very young and the elderly. The most effective thing we can do to protect ourselves and others against the flu is to get the vaccine,"" says Dr. Simor.

4. You can't get sick from the flu vaccine

""The flu vaccine is made entirely of killed virus and cannot cause you to get sick,"" says Dr. Simor. Studies have found that symptoms occur just as often in people who get a placebo shot versus the real thing. However, you can definitely still get a sore arm!

It's important to note, though, that it takes two weeks for the flu shot to work. ""If you get sick in those first two weeks, it's because you had already been infected or you weren't yet fully protected,"" says Dr. Simor.

5. Clean your hands to prevent the flu from spreading

While the flu vaccine is safe and effective, it's not perfect, and it doesn't provide a 100 per cent guarantee that you'll avoid getting sick.

This is why it's so important to take steps to prevent the spread of the flu, like cleaning your hands often. If you do get sick, don't go to work and try to stay away from crowded places so you don't pass the flu virus on to someone else.

""If you get the flu, you'll feel sick for five to seven days, and you're contagious for the first four days. It's important to limit your contact with other people during that time,"" says Dr. Simor.

Devin Kelley, 26, killed 26 people and wounded 20 more when he stormed into First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs with a semi-automatic Ruger AR-556, emptying 15 magazines that held upward of 30 rounds each, investigators said Tuesday.

Authorities have yet to determine a motive behind the massacre, but said they knew Kelley had been fighting with his current wife's family.

""He had expressed anger toward his mother-in-law,"" Freeman Martin, the regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said on Monday. His mother-in-law sometimes attended the Sutherland Springs church, and one of the people he killed was his wife's grandmother.

Kelley was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and stepson while serving at Holloman Air Force base in New Mexico. He also pointed a loaded gun at his then-wife, officials said. He was sentenced that November to 12 months' confinement and given the duty title of ""prisoner,"" according to the New York Times.

Five months before his sentencing, Kelley escaped from Peak Behavioral Health Services in the state, where he had been placed for a ""mental disorder,"" according to an El Paso police report first obtained by Click 2 Houston.

During the June 2012 incident, a ″[witness] advised officers that [Kelley] suffered from mental disorders and had plans to run from [the facility],"" the report says. He had been labeled a ""danger to himself"" and had ""already been caught sneaking firearms onto Holloman Air Force base,"" the report continues. It also says Kelley made death threats to military officials.

Kelley was found at a bus terminal, where he was released into the custody of Sunland Park Police. The Sunland Park police told local station WFAA that they did not have an arrest report or booking photo for Kelly at the time of his apprehension.

(Research has shown that people who live with mental health issues are more likely to be a victim of a violent crime than to commit one.)

The new revelation adds to the warning signs Kelley displayed before purchasing a firearm to carry out his deadly assault. Under the Lautenberg amendment, individuals who are convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor are prohibited from owning or buying guns. But it appears the Air Force never entered Kelley's domestic violence offense into the federal database that gun sellers use to check the criminal history of potential buyers.

Academy Sports + Outdoors confirmed to HuffPost that Kelley purchased two firearms from the store after being approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

Vor einem Jahr wurde Donald Trump zum US-Präsidenten gewählt

Der Religionswissenschaftler Reza Aslan hat nun eine ebenso ungewöhnliche wie überzeugende Erklärung: Trump handelte wie eine Sektenführer

US-Präsident Donald Trump. Am 7. November 2016 hielten das die meisten Experten und US-Bürger für ausgeschlossen. Einen Tag später wurden sie eines Besseren belehrt.

Trumps Beliebtheitswerte sind seitdem auf ein historisch niedriges Niveau abgestürzt, seine Politik wirkt nicht selten chaotisch, er selbst scheint oft politisch umherzuirren. Zudem steht der Vorwurf der Lüge jeden Tag aufs Neue im Raum und auch die Russland-Affäre hängt wie ein Damoklesschwert über Trumps Präsidentschaft.

Doch egal was Trump sagt, tweetet oder tut. Die Anhänger des Republikaners scheinen in einer anderen Welt zu leben. Was andere als Makel sehen, sehen sie beim 74-Jährigen als Stärke. Er ist der Deal-Maker, seine Unberechenbarkeit gilt als sein größtes Ass. Trump sitzt bei seinen Fans ganz fest auf seinem Thron.

Der bekannte iranisch-amerikanische Religionswissenschaftler Reza Aslan hat für diese paradoxe Sicht eine ungewöhnliche wie überzeugende Erklärung: Trump ist der Guru, seine Anhänger Teil einer Sekte, die ihm schon zum Wahlsieg verhalf.

Wahlkampf wie ein Massengottesdienst

In einem Artikel für die ""Los Angeles Times"" begründet Aslan seine Behauptung:

""Während des Wahlkampfes und danach in persönlichen Auftritten nutzte Trump die Art von emotionaler Intensität zu seinen Anhängern, die eher typisch für einen religiösen Massengottesdienst, als für eine politische Versammlung ist.""

So habe es bei Trump ebenso ""ritualisierte Gesänge"" gegeben. Dazu zählt der US-Forscher die fortwährenden gegen die demokratische Rivalin Hillary Clinton gerichteten Sprechchöre ""Lock her up!"" (""Sperrt sie weg!"").

Ausgewachsener Trump-Kult

Angesichts der wenig schmeichelhaften Bilanz und etlicher nicht eingelöster Wahlversprechen ein Jahr nach der Wahl ist für Aslan klar: ""Der Eifer einiger seiner Anhänger scheint immer mehr einem ausgewachsenen Kult zu ähneln.""

Wohlgemerkt: Aslan verwendet das Wort mit einer negativen Konnotation, bei der eine engstirnige soziale Gruppe sich einem ""charismatischen Führer"" in extremster Weise hingibt.

Denn Trump-Anhänger weisen einige gemeinsame Merkmale mit religiösen Hardlinern auf:

► Die Gruppe bildet sich um eine Person, der ein prophetischer und fast göttlicher Status zugeschrieben wird. ""Trump war spektakulär erfolgreich seine Unterstützer dazu zu bewegen, seinen Liebkosungen und nicht ihren eigenen Augen zu glauben"", schreibt Aslan.

Auch einige führende christliche Unterstützer wiesen Trump besondere Fähigkeiten zu. So soll er im direkten Kontakt mit Gott stehen.

► Des Weiteren nähren sich die Kompetenzen eines Sektenführers davon, dass er sich als einzig wahre Informationsquelle geriert. Aslan bemerkt mit Blick auf Trump: Konkurrierende Ideen und Fakten werden nicht nur als falsch dargestellt, ""sie sind dämonisch"".

Der US-Präsident attackiert in regelmäßigen Abständen unliebsame und kritische Medienhäuser, bezichtigt sie der Verbreitung von ""Fake News"".

With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 11. Oktober 2017

Journalisten sind für Trump ""Lügner"" und ""kranke Leute"", die ""uns unsere Geschichte und unser Erbe wegnehmen wollen"".

Eine gemeinsame Umfrage der US-HuffPost und des Umfrageinstitutes YouGov-Umfrage zeigte, dass auch Trumps Anhänger ähnlich denken: 60 Prozent bezeichneten die Medien als ""Feind"".

Nur Trump könne das Land retten

► Zugleich scheint den Trump-Anhängern egal, welche Beschuldigungen ihn treffen. Anders als beim Missbrauchsskandal um Hollywood-Produzent Harvey Weinstein, halten mehr als die Hälfte der Unterstützer des US-Präsidenten ähnliche Vorwürfe gegen Trump für ""nicht glaubhaft"".

""Einer der Wege, wie ein Sektenführer seine unbestrittene Autorität behält, ist, eine Belagerungsmentalität unter seinen Anhängern zu schaffen und sich als Gegenpol zu präsentieren"", erklärt Aslan.

Denn glaubt man Trump, dann sei die USA ein dahinsichendes Land, in dem Islamisten und Migranten das Gewaltmonopol des Staates längst übernommen hätten. Jeder Gewaltakt, wie jüngst in New York, scheint das Weltbild zu bestätigen. Rassistische Ausfälle wie in Charlottesville werden dagegen umgedeutet.

Mantraartig wiederholte Trump deshalb schon während des Wahlkampfes: ""Ich alleine kann es reparieren.""

""Ich könnte jemanden erschießen - und würde keine Wähler verlieren""

Aslan zeichnet in seinem Beitrag ein düsteres Bild. ""Kultmitglieder neigen dazu zu glauben, dass sie an einer kosmischen Leistung teilnehmen, dass sie an einem Kampf zwischen Gut und Böse teilnehmen.""

Egal was passiert, es scheint, dass eine fast zwei jahre alte Prophezeiung Trumps Wirklichkeit geworden ist. Der jetzige US-Präsident erklärte im Januar 2016:

""Ich könnte mitten auf der 5th Avenue (im Zentrum Manhattans) stehen und jemanden erschießen - und würde trotzdem keine Wähler verlieren.""

Das Problem: Wenn der ""gute"" Trump nicht gewinnt und das Lügen- und Phantasiegebilde des Sektenführes tatsächlich zusammenbrechen droht, könnten die Anhänger gewalttätig werden.

So erklärte Trump-Berater Roger Stone im August: Jeder Versuch, den Präsidenten aus dem Amt zu entfernen, würde in ""diesem Land in einen Gewaltkrampf, einen Aufstand, enden, wie Sie ihn noch nie gesehen haben"".

Y paciencia demostró cuando se topó con Kiko. Sólo hay que ver en el vídeo del programa [minuto 01.45] la intensidad con la que se presentó. ""¿Pero de dónde venís, vos?"", le preguntó, antes de entregarle una rosa. ""Mónica, for you, one flor, one rosita"", siguió.

Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson is warning homeowners if they fail to declare their property status by Feb. 2, they will face the city's empty homes tax plus a $250 fine.

The tax is one per cent of a home's assessed value.

It affects any property that is not a principal residence and is not occupied for six months a year.

Robertson says property owners can expect to receive instructions in the mail starting this week on how to make their declarations.

Watch: Vancouver house prices are unaffordable for the middle class

He says there is a $10,000 fine for false declarations and the city is in the process of setting up an enforcement system that will include hiring staff in the new year.

The tax is the first of its kind in Canada and is aimed at freeing up as many as 20,000 units for rent as the city's vacancy rate hovers near zero.

Robertson says the city must do everything it can to ease the housing crunch, and it's also proceeding with a plan to open 600 new units of temporary modular housing for the homeless.

Grund dafür ist, dass die Grünen von ihren Forderungen abrücken

Andere Parteien zeigen derlei Kompromissbereitschaft bisher nicht

""50 zu 50"", sagt FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer.

""80 zu 20"", meint Grünen-Politiker Robert Habeck.

Allein an den Antworten, für wie wahrscheinlich die sondierenden Politiker ein Zustandekommen der Jamaika-Koalition halten, lässt sich erkennen, wer derzeit der konstruktive Motor der Koalitions-Vorverhandlungen ist.

Die Grünen, oft als Spielverderber, als piefige Verbots-Partei gescholten, werden dieser Tage zu Möglichmachern. Dazu hat die Partei zu Beginn der zweiten Sondierungswoche zwei wichtige rote Linien aus dem Wahlkampf aufgegeben. Und das ausgerechnet beim Grünen-Kernthema Klimaschutz.

So besteht Parteichef Cem Özdemir nicht mehr auf einem Ende des Verbrennungsmotors bis 2030. Vorsitzende Simone Peter hat derweil die Koalitionsbedingung in Sachen Kohlekraft aufgeweicht. ""Für uns kommt es nicht darauf an, ob das letzte Kohle-Kraftwerk 2030 oder 2032 vom Netz geht. Da sind wir pragmatisch"", sagte Peter der ""Rheinischen Post"".

Das grüne Schreckgespenst, das nach Bekanntwerden des Wahlergebnisses wohl besonders in den Albträumen einiger CSU-Politiker regelmäßige Cameo-Auftritte hatte, hat damit ausgespukt. An seine Stelle trat ein Fortschrittsgeist, der auf Dialog und Kompromiss setzt. Auf all das, was FDP und CSU bisweilen vermissen lassen.

CSU-Mann Dobrindt grätscht dazwischen, wo es nur geht

Denn das Gegenstück zu den gerade so konstruktiv auftretenden Grünen stellt gerade die Partei aus Bayern dar. Statt sich über die in Reichweite scheinende Übereinkunft in der Klimapolitik zu freuen, hatte CSU-Politiker Alexander Dobrindt am Dienstag nichts Besseres zu tun, als das grüne Zugeständnis mit einer beispiellosen Dreistigkeit ins Lächerliche zu ziehen.

""Wenn man Schwachsinnstermine abräumt, dann ist das ja noch kein Kompromiss"", sagte Dobrindt der ""Süddeutschen Zeitung"" und bekräftigte so einmal mehr den Eindruck, dass die Jamaika-Partei mit den wenigsten Sitzen unter den (möglicherweise bald) Regierenden gleichzeitig die Partei mit dem größten Ego ist.

Dobrindt machte so nur noch deutlicher, dass es – wenn überhaupt – vor allem die anderen sein werden, die Jamaika möglich machen. Das gilt zumal für Kanzlerin Angela Merkel, die bisweilen vor allem als Moderatorin auftritt und sich vorsichtig optimistisch gibt. Die als ""Pizza-Connection 2.0"" bekanntgewordene Gruppe von Grünen und CDU-Politikern um Omid Nouripour und Jens Spahn, die seit Jahren mit einem Bündnis liebäugeln.

Und nun vielleicht sogar FDP-Chef Christian Lindner.

Der reagierte positiv auf die Grünen-Signale und kündigte Abstriche bei Forderungen für eine große Steuerreform an. Ihn habe weniger die Ankündigung zum Verzicht auf das strikte Ausstiegsdatum beim Verbrennungsmotor überrascht, da hier bei den Grünen keine Einigkeit bestanden habe.

Mit großer Aufmerksamkeit habe er aber registriert, dass sich die Grünen beim Kohleausstieg bewegt hätten.

Vielleicht haben sie damit sogar weitere Verschiebungen in Gang gesetzt. Nun wären eigentlich auch mal die anderen dran.

Für die FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer stehen die Chancen auf eine Einigung weiterhin bei 50 zu 50, sagt sie im HuffPost-Interview

Außerdem sieht sie trotz der Kompromissbereitschaft der Grünen große Differenzen

Nach dem Start der zweiten Sondierungsrunde geht es bei Jamaika ums Eingemachte. Nicht nur beim Klimaschutz gibt es weiter Konfliktpotenzial - auch die Flüchtlingspolitik ist ein zentraler Streitpunkt.

Für die FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer stehen die Chancen auf eine Einigung deswegen weiter bei 50 zu 50. In einem Interview mit der HuffPost sagte sie zum Beginn der Gespräche:

""Am Ende ist für uns klar: Wir werden uns nicht selbst verleugnen. Wenn wir die Wahl haben zwischen Glaubwürdigkeitsverlust oder Neuwahlen, entscheiden wir uns für Neuwahlen. Aber das ist nicht unser Ziel.""

Die Grünen gingen am Morgen einen ersten großen Schritt auf die potentiellen Partner zu. Sowohl beim Verbrennungsmotor als auch beim Kohleausstieg zeigten sie Kompromissbereitschaft.

""Wir haben die heutigen Aussagen des Grünen-Chefs in diese Richtung als Signal der Einigungsbereitschaft aufgenommen"", sagte Beer. Dennoch sieht die FDP-Generalsekretärin noch große Differenzen. ""Wir wollen einen Klimaschutz, der funktioniert. Da sind wir grüner als die Grünen"", sagte sie.

""Wir müssen uns eingestehen, dass unsere jetzige Klimaschutzpolitik nicht funktioniert hat. Sie ist die teuerste der Welt, aber wir haben keine einzige Tonne CO2 eingespart. Das ist doch völlig widersinnig.""

Auch bei der Flüchtlingspolitik rief sie den Verhandlungspartner zur Kompromissbereitschaft auf.

""Ich setze darauf, dass auch Cem Özdemir irgendwann für logische Argumente zugänglich wird und in seinem Wahlkreis merkt, dass auch dort nicht alle Flüchtlinge aufgenommen werden können"", sagte Beer.

Das Interview lest ihr hier:

Frau Beer, nehmen wir an, Sie erhalten ein Freiticket für einen Jamaika-Urlaub und können einen Unterhändler aus der Union oder von den Grünen mitnehmen. Wer wäre das?



Von den Verhandlungspartnern kann ich mir auf der Insel sicher eine nette Zeit mit CSU-Generalsekretär Andreas Scheuer machen. Aber eigentlich müsste ich natürlich meine bessere Hälfte mitnehmen.

Heute gehen die Jamaika-Verhandlungen in die zweite Runde, doch es hakt gewaltig. Wird das noch etwas mit der Koalition?

Ich sehe die Chancen nach wie vor bei 50 zu 50, dass Jamaika gelingt. In den kommenden Tagen wird es darum gehen, die Gräben aus dem Weg zu räumen und eine gemeinsame Vision zu entwickeln, die jeder unterschreiben kann.

Das klingt jetzt sehr freundlich. FDP-Chef Lindner redet schon über Neuwahlen und eine mögliche Oppositionsrolle. Wo soll das hinführen?



Am Ende haben wir keine Angst vor Neuwahlen, das wollte er deutlich machen. Uns geht es um eine neue Politik, die deutlich werden muss. Aber wir arbeiten auch nicht auf Neuwahlen hin.



Können Sie uns das versprechen?



Ja.



Woher dann das Gerede über Neuwahlen?



Am Ende ist für uns klar: Wir werden uns nicht selbst verleugnen. Wenn wir die Wahl haben zwischen Glaubwürdigkeitsverlust oder Neuwahlen, entscheiden wir uns für Neuwahlen. Aber das ist nicht unser Ziel.



Haben Sie einen kleinen Westerwelle-Komplex – nicht noch einmal aus dem Bundestag ausscheiden?



Ich neige nicht zu Komplexen, egal, mit welchem Namen Sie das verbinden. Ich neige dazu, feste Prinzipien zu haben. Am Ende muss unsere liberale Handschrift klar erkennbar sein. Wir stehen nicht als Stützrad für eine Schwarz-Rote Politik, wie sie die vergangenen vier Jahre gemacht wurde.



Die Grünen sind ja auch noch mit dabei.



Ja, aber man hat ja schon den Eindruck, dass Schwarz-Grün bereits Vorgefühle entwickelt hat.



Woran machen Sie das fest?



Wenn ich mir den ein oder anderen Gesprächsverlauf anschaue. Aber ich möchte nicht zu viele Internas aus den Sondierungsgesprächen verraten. Generell ist uns natürlich klar, dass wir nicht alle unsere Forderung durchsetzen können. Doch unsere liberale Handschrift muss erkennbar sein.



Große Differenzen gibt es mit den Grünen beim Thema Klimaschutz. Wie wollen Sie hier einen Kompromiss erreichen?



Wir sind uns mit den Grünen völlig einig, dass wir die Klimaschutzziele 2050 erreichen müssen. Allerdings müssen wir das physikalisch hinbekommen.



Grünen-Politiker Robert Habeck sagte, alle Parteien müssen sich “am Riemen reißen”. Das klingt nicht so, als wäre man sich völlig einig.



Wir sind uns bei den Zielen einig. Beim Weg dorthin hingegen bisher nicht. Wir müssen uns eingestehen, dass unsere jetzige Klimaschutzpolitik nicht funktioniert hat. Sie ist die teuerste der Welt, aber wir haben keine einzige Tonne CO2 eingespart. Das ist doch völlig widersinnig. Wir wollen einen Klimaschutz, der funktioniert. Da sind wir grüner als die Grünen.



Was ist die Alternative?



Wir können unsere ehrgeizigen Ziele nur mit Technologien erreichen, die sich noch nicht durchgesetzt haben. Das müssen wir in unserer Klimapolitik dringend miteinbeziehen.



Geben Sie uns ein Beispiel.



Etwa bei der Mobilität. Wenn wir den Verbrennungsmotor abschaffen, bevor wir das Reichweitenproblem der E-Autos gelöst haben, machen wir realitätsferne Politik an den Menschen vorbei.

Wir haben die heutigen Aussagen des Grünen-Chefs in diese Richtung als Signal der Einigungsbereitschaft aufgenommen, wie Christian Lindner ja auch deutlich gemacht hat. Klare, erreichbare Ziele und Technologieoffenheit zu ihrer Erreichung statt auf Verbote zu setzen, das muss die Devise sein. Und so ist es auch mit der Kohlekraft.



Warum?



Wir haben jetzt schon Probleme mit der Versorgungssicherheit. Bei manchen Unternehmen flackert das Stromnetz und gefährdet damit die Produktion, weil der Strommix aus den Erneuerbaren in Stoßzeiten nicht ausreicht. Wenn wir die Kohle jetzt parallel zur Kernenergie aus dem Stromnetz rausnehmen, müssen wir mit flächendeckenden Blackouts rechnen. Das kann niemand wollen.



Was ist mit Erdgas? Das ist effizienter und nicht ganz so schmutzig wie Kohle.



Fakt ist doch: Bislang haben uns die Grünen nicht vorrechnen können, wie sie einen Kohleausstieg ausgleichen wollen. Da bliebe uns nur übrig, Kohle- und Kernenergie aus Frankreich und Polen zuzukaufen. Ob die Grünen so wirklich das Klima retten, bezweifle ich.



Reden wir über den Umgang zwischen den Jamaika-Parteien. FDP-Chef Lindner hat den Grünen etwa vorgeworfen, ein “Konjunkturprogramm für die AfD” zu betreiben. CSU-General Scheuer nennt die Grünen “schizophren”. Woher kommt die schlechte Laune?



Wir schauen schlicht auf die Realitäten. Beispiel Flüchtlingspolitik, worauf sich das Zitat von Christian Lindner ja bezog. Natürlich ist ein Familiennachzug, wie ihn die Grünen wollen, in gewissen Bereichen sinnvoll - etwa, wenn derjenige seine Familie hier in Deutschland ernähren kann, weil er einen Job und eine Wohnung hat.

Aber das funktioniert nur, wenn wir diejenigen abschieben, die kein Bleiberecht haben. Sonst werden uns die Bürger zurecht auf die Barrikaden gehen. Denn wir können nicht jeden aufnehmen.



Wie wollen Sie die Grünen davon überzeugen?



Es gibt auch bei den Grünen Politiker wie Herrn Palmer, die davon bereits überzeugt sind. Sie wissen, dass es vor Ort Schwierigkeiten gibt, einen unbegrenzten Zuzug von Flüchtlingen zu schultern. Es fehlen Wohnungen, Klassenräume, Lehrkräfte und Kita-Plätze.



Herr Palmer aber spricht nicht für seine Partei. Wie wollen Sie etwa Parteichef Özdemir überzeugen?



Ich setze darauf, dass auch Cem Özdemir irgendwann für logische Argumente zugänglich wird und in seinem Wahlkreis merkt, dass auch dort nicht alle Flüchtlinge aufgenommen werden können.



Schauen wir auf CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer. Es wirkt so, als liefe gegen ihn ein innerparteilicher Putsch. Glauben Sie, dass er noch lange am Verhandlungstisch von Jamaika sitzen wird?



Das muss die CSU entscheiden.



Lohnt es sich, Kompromisse mit jemandem zu machen, der womöglich schon bald nicht mehr für seine Partei spricht?



Am Ende des Tages machen wir Kompromisse mit der CSU, nicht mit Horst Seehofer.

Beobachter sehen die Jamaika-Verhandlungen durch die Personaldiskussion in der CSU grundsätzlich in Gefahr. Teilen Sie diese Sorge?



Unsere Verhandlungen könnten schneller voranschreiten, wenn die CSU so geschlossen wäre wie die FDP. Aber Streit gibt es auch bei den Grünen, die sich untereinander nicht immer einig sind.

The 70-year-old cyberspy agency is now trying to emerge from the shadows, but a newly released survey suggests it is still little known to Canadians.

On an unaided basis, just three per cent of respondents correctly named ""CSE"" or the ""Communications Security Establishment"" as the government agency responsible for intercepting and analyzing foreign communications and helping protect the government's computer networks, the survey report says.

Communications Security Establishment (CSE) Chief Greta Bossenmaier takes part in a news conference in Ottawa, June 16, 2017.

About one in five people thought the Canadian Security Intelligence Service performed those duties. In reality, CSIS's main role is investigating threats — such as terrorism and espionage — to Canadian security.

When the Communications Security Establishment, or CSE, was mentioned by name, nearly two in five (37 per cent) said either yes (26 per cent) or maybe (11 per cent) when asked if they had heard of it before, the report says.

Ekos Research Associates conducted 10-minute telephone questionnaires about the CSE with 1,205 Canadian adults in May. The results are considered accurate to within plus or minus 2.8 percentage points, with a 95-per-cent level of confidence.

Thrust into headlines due to Edward Snowden

The $83,000 Ekos survey was commissioned to help the CSE better understand the public's awareness and attitudes towards the agency and shape communications strategies, as well as to explore views about career opportunities to guide recruitment of new employees.

The Ottawa-based CSE uses highly advanced technology to intercept, sort and analyze foreign communications for nuggets of intelligence interest to the federal government. It is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance that also includes the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.

The secretive CSE has been thrust into the headlines in recent years due to leaks by Edward Snowden, the former spy contractor who worked for the National Security Agency, the CSE's American counterpart.

It has also tried to be more open about its activities — at least to a point — through increased use of social media and participation in public events.

People just don't pay attention because we're relatively safe. Stephanie Carvin, Carleton University

But it seems none of that has made the CSE a household name.

Academia, the media, the government and spy agencies themselves could play a bigger role in informing the public about the security world, said Stephanie Carvin, an assistant professor of international relations at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs.

""It's clear that Canadians aren't educating themselves on these institutions,"" Carvin said.

""We have this reputation for being the peaceable kingdom. People just don't pay attention because we're relatively safe.""

Civil liberties group suing CSE

When provided a brief description of CSE's dual interception and protection role, over four in five respondents to the Ekos survey said they considered the agency to be important, including just over half who said the CSE was very important.

The British Columbia Civil Liberties Association is suing the CSE, claiming it breaches the constitutional rights of Canadians by intercepting their private communications. The agency insists it respects privacy and abides by Canadian laws.

Nearly three in four respondents said they either completely (14 per cent) or somewhat trusted (59 per cent) the CSE to act ethically and legally in fulfilling its mandate.

At the same time, 43 per cent said they were concerned about information that government intelligence agencies may be collecting about them.

C'est en tout cas l'option choisie par l'ancienne Miss France Elodie Gossuin et la chanteuse Joy Esther. Dans une vidéo publiée ce lundi 6 novembre sur leurs comptes Instagram respectifs, les deux candidates de l'émission Danse avec les Stars, saison 8, mettent les choses au clair.

Un spot plutôt amusant au cours duquel on peut les voir s'échanger des coups de manière totalement simulée dans une piscine remplie de blocs en mousse. Chacune a d'ailleurs accompagné la vidéo d'un commentaire adressé au magazine Public.

""Rien que de l'amour. Spéciale dédicace @publicfr"" pour Elodie Gossuin et ""#balancetonarticledemerde"" pour Joy Esther, comme vous pouvez le voir ci-dessous.

Un article du magazine Public qui passe mal

Cette publication a un objectif précis: faire taire les rumeurs concernant une ""quelconque rivalité entre les deux candidates."" Dans un article publié le 3 novembre dernier, le magazine Public se faisait l'écho de l'existence d'une concurrence féroce entre elles. Un conflit qui aurait généré une violente dispute dans les coulisses du plateau, à en croire l'article.

Selon un témoignage d'un membre de la production du show télévisé relayé dans le média, ""Elo et Joy ne peuvent pas s'encadrer."" ""On a assisté à un énorme clash. La chorégraphie assez technique qu'a eue Elodie sur le dernier direct était, à la base, destinée à Joy. Quand Elodie l'a appris, elle a pété une durite et a exigé de changer de loge"", déclarait également cette source au magazine.

Un énorme 😁 pour @Elodiegossuin tout au long de la prestation ce qui a conquis nos 4 juges ! https://t.co/0Pxzmr3y5v — Danse Avec Les Stars (@DALS_TF1) 4 novembre 2017

La vidéo publiée sur les réseaux sociaux lundi permet d'éteindre un début de polémique. Sur cette dernière, Elodie Gossuin et Joy Esther lâchent d'ailleurs ironiquement ""tu gagnes plus d'argent que moi"" ou encore ""tu m'as volé mes robes et mon danseur"". La compétition peut donc reprendre sainement et dans la bonne humeur.

A ce titre, les deux candidates sont encore en lice dans l'aventure. Après trois semaines de challenge, Vincent Cerutti, Hapsatou Sy et Arielle Dombasle sont les concurrents éliminés.

Amid shouts of “resign!” and “shame!”, the Foreign Secretary also came under heavy attack from Tory MPs such as Anna Soubry after he refused to apologise properly for his remarks about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Johnson admitted “I could have been clearer” when he claimed last week that Zaghhari-Ratcliffe had been training journalists in Iran - a line which was seized on by the Tehran authorities as proof that she was ‘spreading propaganda’ against the regime. But he sparked anger after he refused repeated requests to apologise for his comments. Eventually, he said he was ‘sorry’- but only ‘if’ his words had been taken out of context. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s employer the Thomson-Reuters foundation had insisted the Foreign Secretary should correct his remarks, amid claims that Iranian judges want to double her possible sentence for alleged spying from five years to 10 years. She was arrested last year after a family holiday to see relatives. Her three-year-old daughter has been placed with grandparents while her mother has been locked in jail, often in solitary confinement. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry laid into Johnson, declaring Theresa May didn’t have the “strength or authority” to sack him, but he should do the decent thing and resign.

PA Wire/PA Images Boris Johnson at the Foreign Affairs Committee last week.

Thornberry said that he should say sorry for “the distress and anguish that his foolish words have caused” to Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family. “How many more times does this need to happen? How many more times does the Foreign Secretary have to insult our international partners, damage our diplomatic relations, and now imperil the interests of British nationals abroad? “What will it take before the Prime Minister will say ‘Enough is Enough’? “But if the truth is that she can’t, because she doesn’t have the strength or authority to sack him, how about the Foreign Secretary himself showing a bit of personal responsibility, and admitting that a job like this, where your words hold gravity and your actions have consequences, is simply not the job for him.”

Empics Entertainment Yvette Cooper.

Cooper was just as withering, declaring “the lives and the safety of British citizens across the globe depends on having a Foreign Secretary who does not bluster and is not too careless or too lazy to consider his words”. “The Foreign Secretary cannot be trusted to do this job. And he should resign.” Johnson said that Zaghhari-Ratcliffe’s husband Richard had sent him a note welcoming his clarification. The Foreign Secretary said that he also intended to take a trip to Iran personally to try to secure her release. And he hit back at Thornberry, insisting that the Iranian foreign minister had assured him his remarks had had no bearing on the sentencing process. “She deflects blame and accountability for those holding that mother in jail - and that is the Iranian regime,” Johnson said. Eventually, after his 40-minute grilling, Johnson expressed his regrets for his words, although only with a caveat that they had been misinterpreted. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, whose Oxford constituency includes family members of the jailed mother, said: “The fact is the family have been worried sick, by his irresponsible comments. “On a human level is the Foreign Secretary at all sorry for the rollercoaster of emotions he has caused Nazanin and her family this week and could he at least apologise to them today?”

Johnson replied: “Of course I’m sorry if any words of mine have been so taken out of context and so misconstrued as to cause any kind of anxiety for the family of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, of course I am..” But he faced a fresh backlash for qualifying his apology with the word ‘if’.

Grund dafür ist, dass die Grünen von ihren Forderungen abrücken

Andere Parteien zeigen derlei Kompromissbereitschaft bisher nicht

""50 zu 50"", sagt FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer.

""80 zu 20"", meint Grünen-Politiker Robert Habeck.

Allein an den Antworten, für wie wahrscheinlich die sondierenden Politiker ein Zustandekommen der Jamaika-Koalition halten, lässt sich erkennen, wer derzeit der konstruktive Motor der Koalitions-Vorverhandlungen ist.

Die Grünen, oft als Spielverderber, als piefige Verbots-Partei gescholten, werden dieser Tage zu Möglichmachern. Dazu hat die Partei zu Beginn der zweiten Sondierungswoche zwei wichtige rote Linien aus dem Wahlkampf aufgegeben. Und das ausgerechnet beim Grünen-Kernthema Klimaschutz.

So besteht Parteichef Cem Özdemir nicht mehr auf einem Ende des Verbrennungsmotors bis 2030. Vorsitzende Simone Peter hat derweil die Koalitionsbedingung in Sachen Kohlekraft aufgeweicht. ""Für uns kommt es nicht darauf an, ob das letzte Kohle-Kraftwerk 2030 oder 2032 vom Netz geht. Da sind wir pragmatisch"", sagte Peter der ""Rheinischen Post"".

Das grüne Schreckgespenst, das nach Bekanntwerden des Wahlergebnisses wohl besonders in den Albträumen einiger CSU-Politiker regelmäßige Cameo-Auftritte hatte, hat damit ausgespukt. An seine Stelle trat ein Fortschrittsgeist, der auf Dialog und Kompromiss setzt. Auf all das, was FDP und CSU bisweilen vermissen lassen.

CSU-Mann Dobrindt grätscht dazwischen, wo es nur geht

Denn das Gegenstück zu den gerade so konstruktiv auftretenden Grünen stellt gerade die Partei aus Bayern dar. Statt sich über die in Reichweite scheinende Übereinkunft in der Klimapolitik zu freuen, hatte CSU-Politiker Alexander Dobrindt am Dienstag nichts Besseres zu tun, als das grüne Zugeständnis mit einer beispiellosen Dreistigkeit ins Lächerliche zu ziehen.

""Wenn man Schwachsinnstermine abräumt, dann ist das ja noch kein Kompromiss"", sagte Dobrindt der ""Süddeutschen Zeitung"" und bekräftigte so einmal mehr den Eindruck, dass die Jamaika-Partei mit den wenigsten Sitzen unter den (möglicherweise bald) Regierenden gleichzeitig die Partei mit dem größten Ego ist.

Dobrindt machte so nur noch deutlicher, dass es – wenn überhaupt – vor allem die anderen sein werden, die Jamaika möglich machen. Das gilt zumal für Kanzlerin Angela Merkel, die bisweilen vor allem als Moderatorin auftritt und sich vorsichtig optimistisch gibt. Die als ""Pizza-Connection 2.0"" bekanntgewordene Gruppe von Grünen und CDU-Politikern um Omid Nouripour und Jens Spahn, die seit Jahren mit einem Bündnis liebäugeln.

Und nun vielleicht sogar FDP-Chef Christian Lindner.

Der reagierte positiv auf die Grünen-Signale und kündigte Abstriche bei Forderungen für eine große Steuerreform an. Ihn habe weniger die Ankündigung zum Verzicht auf das strikte Ausstiegsdatum beim Verbrennungsmotor überrascht, da hier bei den Grünen keine Einigkeit bestanden habe.

Mit großer Aufmerksamkeit habe er aber registriert, dass sich die Grünen beim Kohleausstieg bewegt hätten.

Vielleicht haben sie damit sogar weitere Verschiebungen in Gang gesetzt. Nun wären eigentlich auch mal die anderen dran.

By then there were already more than half a million new arrivals, joining some 300,000 refugees already in the country. I flew into Bangladesh straight from Jordan where I'd been working at Zaatari refugee camp for Syrians.

In southern Bangladesh the people are welcoming but the environment is not. It is hot and humid, with uneven terrain and jungle. Conditions are rough. Refugees are given bamboos sticks and plastic sheets as they arrive to construct temporary shelters for their families, but it's hardly adequate shelter for the long-term and we will need to establish more durable shelter solutions quickly.

The first day I was on site I met a brave pregnant woman who had crossed the border with her three young children, having lost her husband to the conflict in Myanmar. Despite everything, she was fiercely independent and determined to set up her shelter on her own. She refused any external help and built her bamboo-framed structure with only the assistance of her seven-year-old son. She is proud of her achievement but equally concerned with the inadequacy of her new home; the plastic sheeting leaks rainwater to the interior and there is no thermal insulation whatsoever. Being heavily pregnant does not make it easier for her to cope in such uncomfortable conditions.

These people do not complain, and they do not sit on their laurels. They are active, strong and independent with amazing skills in construction.

Overcrowding is an immense challenge. UNHCR's two existing refugee camps were swamped within days of the influx. Bangladesh is one of the world's most densely populated countries already, with 163 million people living in an area smaller than Victoria, so finding land to accommodate huge numbers of refugees isn't straightforward -- especially with thousands more arriving daily. In the world's fastest-growing refugee crisis we are constantly playing catch up.

The Bangladeshi Government has allocated a 'mega' site of approximately 2,800 acres for the extension of Kutupalong refugee camp -- one of the existing UNHCR camps. However, a high percentage of this land is unusable because it is either prone to flooding, is already cultivated with rice paddies, or the slope is far too steep to build on without risk of landslides. Therefore, this site alone won't be sufficient, and we need to keep working with the government to find new land to accommodate everyone.

The throngs of young children that follow us around each day are a reminder of what we're working for. There are so many children who simply wish to be able to live a normal life, go to school every day and not fear for their safety.

I met a boy called Than who is 11 years old and wants to be a pilot when he grows up. Than is worried that he is falling behind in his studies and this may jeopardise his future. I desperately hope that with somewhere safe and secure to live, Than will be able to return to school and achieve his dreams.

Since I arrived, I've been onsite most days in a small team of technical staff, developing a transit centre for new arrivals. We need to work out where tents can go to maximise the use of space, where toilets and showers can be situated for ease of reach, as well as making sure there will still be access for delivery vehicles with supplies, or ambulances in emergencies.

The transit centre site, despite being government land, was actually being leased to a Bangladeshi family who were using it as a rubber plantation when the refugees began arriving. It took time and negotiation before we could proceed with using the land for the transit centre. We had to promise the leaser that we would only cut down two trees, which greatly restricted our ability to erect the two required portable warehouses, the 120 family tents and 25 bamboo structures. With some onsite modifications to the plan, we were able build all necessary facilities.

What has overwhelmed me in Bangladesh so far is the incredible resilience I have witnessed among the Rohingya communities. The speed at which they are rebuilding their homes is extraordinary -- vast tracks of land within the expansion zone are being developed with every passing day. These people do not complain, and they do not sit on their laurels. They are active, strong and independent with amazing skills in construction.

It is the Rohyinga refugees who are paving out the new footpaths in the expansion zones and who are building the bamboo bridges across water bodies. It is inspirational and heart-warming to witness.

Sen. Lillian Eva Dyck said a government amendment to the Indian Act will restore full legal status to First Nations women.
Once passed, the government amendment would ensure Indigenous women finally get the same ability to transmit their registered Indian status to family members, Dyck said.
The previous Senate amendment would have focused on issues beyond merely the sex-based inequities, creating ambiguities and potential legal problems, Harder said.","OTTAWA — The federal government has decided to change course on its proposed legislation to end sex-based discrimination in the Indian Act.

The government's point man in the Senate, Sen. Peter Harder, told the upper chamber Tuesday that the government is offering to make a change that would restore full legal status to First Nations women and their descendants born prior to 1985 — a measure that moved Indigenous Sen. Lillian Dyck to tears.

""Colleagues, if we pass today's motion, something wonderful will happen,"" Dyck told the chamber, her voice cracking. ""Something that First Nations women have been waiting for for nearly 150 years.""

Sen. Lillian Eva Dyck said a government amendment to the Indian Act will restore full legal status to First Nations women.

The Indian Act, which dates back to 1876, remains the primary law defining the relationship between the federal government and First Nations across the country. Its original definitions focused primarily on men, denying women many of the same privileges and powers as their male counterparts when it came to their Indian status.

Numerous amendments over the years have chipped away at those imbalances, but critics say the document as it currently stands continues to treat women unfairly, particularly when it comes to their Indian status and their ability to pass that status along to their descendants.

Once passed, the government amendment would ensure Indigenous women finally get the same ability to transmit their registered Indian status to family members, Dyck said.

""Your language, your culture, your connection to your family, your connection to your community.""

Dyck recently joined forces with Sen. Sandra Lovelace-Nicholas and other advocates as part of an awareness campaign to urge the Liberal government to change the bill.

Part of the outreach, supported by the Canadian Feminist Alliance for International Action, included the distribution of a letter last week to women's organizations, academics and human rights groups to drum up support for the ""full and final removal"" of sex discrimination in the Indian Act.

First Nations women can breath sigh of relief: senator

The government and officials have now found an acceptable solution to a standoff between the Senate and the House of Commons, said Dyck, who urged her fellow senators to pass Harder's proposal by the end of the week.

""Let's move it and urge the members in the (House of Commons) to concur,"" she said.

First Nations women can breathe a sign of relief, Dyck added. ""I know I will.""

In June, the Senate unanimously passed a change to the bill designed to ensure Indigenous women and their descendants enjoy the same Indian status under the law as their male counterparts.

The House of Commons, however, did not originally accept the Senate's proposal, with the government saying it needed more time to examine the potential impacts.

The previous Senate amendment would have focused on issues beyond merely the sex-based inequities, creating ambiguities and potential legal problems, Harder said.

Bill was in response to Quebec court decision

The government's original bill would only have addressed discrimination in Indian Act registration since 1951, when a more modern registry was created. The amendment would, among other things, also address inequities created between 1869 and 1951, said the office of Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett.

The Liberal government's bill was in response to a Quebec Superior Court decision that ruled certain sections of the Indian Act related to registration status violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The case was brought by Stephane Descheneaux of the Abenaki community of Odanak, about 40 kilometres northwest of Drummondville, Que.

Descheneaux was unable to pass on his Indian status to his three daughters because he got it through his Indigenous grandmother, who lost her status when she married a non-Indigenous man.

“The conclusion is that it was the art therapy that facilitated their improvement,” Blomdah said.","After 10 art therapy sessions, the patients who suffered from severe or moderately severe depression had shown more improvement than the patients in the control group, the researchers concluded.

Activities within the therapy sessions included instructions such as: “create a picture of how you are feeling on this particular day.”

Meanwhile a control group of 36 people with depression and symptoms of the same level did not take part in art therapy.

During the research, conducted by Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg , 43 patients with “severe” or “moderately severe” depression underwent an art therapy course.

Art therapy has a “clear effect” on severe depression, helping some people to get back to work after time off, new research suggests.

According to the researchers the majority of the participants were so affected by their depression that they were unable to work at the start of the study.

The individual art therapy took place in psychiatry or primary care and was conducted by a specially trained therapist.

Each session began with a short briefing and a relaxation exercise. After that participants created artwork with crayons and water colours.

“The materials were simple, allowing people to doodle and feel free to express themselves the way they wanted to, and then they would talk about the picture and its significance,” Christina Blomdahl, PhD at the institute of health and care sciences and licensed occupational therapist and art therapist, explained.

After 10 hour-long treatment sessions the patients had improved on an average of almost five steps on a rating scale used for depression.

Blomdah said this represents a large leap that entails a “considerable” change to everyday life, and sometimes it may also mean that a patient is able to return to work.

Anxiety, sleep, ability to take initiative and emotional involvement are some of the factors that are assessed. In the control group that had not undergone art therapy there was no definite change.

“The conclusion is that it was the art therapy that facilitated their improvement,” Blomdah said.

“Painting pictures based on themes and discussing the pictures with the therapist promotes self-reflection and brain stimulation that takes place outside of the conscious mind.”

Although Blomdahl’s study was based on adults, Mary­-Rose Brady, director of operations at the British Association of Art Therapists, previously told HuffPost UK art therapy can be particulalry useful for children struggling with mental ill health.

“We know that children who can’t understand or name their feelings are more likely to ‘act them out’, so art therapy can provide relief to a child whose only previous option was to dissolve into tears or have an angry outburst in response to overwhelming feelings,” she said.

“Art materials enable children to externalise troubling or confusing emotions, giving them form and enabling them to make links between thoughts, feelings and behaviours, perhaps for the first time.”

Debbie Thwaites, founder of art therapy charity Shine Again, explained how this works.

“One young boy I saw just wanted to paint poo,” she said.

“He wasn’t able to say ‘this person is making me feel like poo’, but he was able to get all the brown and black colours out, make a big mess and say ‘that’s what I feel like’.”

Based on the recent findings, Blomdahl hopes that art therapy will be used more extensively in healthcare.

“Based on evidence requirements it has been more or less scrapped by psychiatry, but this is one of the largest studies that has been conducted in this area,” she said.

“It is a step that may lead to more people being trained in it and the method being used again.”","Art Therapy Has 'Clear Effect' On Severe Depression, Research Finds",http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/07/art-therapy-has-clear-effect-on-severe-depression-research-finds_a_23269098/

Scan Pyramids/ Reuters The VR tour allows visitors to tour parts of the pyramids not usually open to the public

The pyramid, built in around 2,500 BC and one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, was a monumental tomb soaring to a height of 479 feet. Until the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889, the Great Pyramid stood as the tallest manmade structure for more than 4,000 years. While there are passage ways into it and chambers in various parts, much of the internal structure had remained a mystery until a team from France’s HIP Institute used an imaging method based on cosmic rays to gain a view inside. So-called muon particles, which originate from interactions with rays from space and atoms in Earth’s upper atmosphere, are able to penetrate hundreds of metres through stone before being absorbed. That allows for mapping inside stone structures.

“Muon tomography has really improved a lot due to its use on the pyramid and we think that muography will have other applications in other fields,” said Tayoubi. “But we also wanted to innovate and imagine devices to allow the wider public to understand what this pyramid is, understand it from within.” When looking through their 3D goggles, visitors can see the enormous stones of the pyramid as if they were real, and walk virtually along its corridors, chambers and hidden spaces.

NEW DELHI -- India may announce measures next week to help traders and small businesses who say a new nationwide goods and services tax (GST) has increased their tax and administrative burden.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said if there is consensus at the next GST council meeting due over November 9 to November 10, the government would take the necessary steps to help traders and strengthen the country's economy.

A panel of ministers last month recommended reducing tax rates for small businesses and traders and raising the minimum revenue threshold for companies that need to pay tax, local media reported.

The launch in July of the long-awaited GST, which transformed India's 29 states into a single customs union, has left thousands of small and medium-sized firms at the bottom of the supply chain short of working capital.

Modi is facing criticism for the disruption to the economy caused by the roll-out of GST and the shock removal of higher-value bills from circulation last year. As a result of these issues India's economy is expected to grow at its slowest pace in four years this fiscal year, a Reuters poll found.

Modi's comments came days after India jumped about 30 places to 100th on the World Bank's ""Ease of Doing Business"" rankings, reflecting reforms in accessing credit, power supply and the protection of minority investors.

Modi said he expected India's ranking to improve next year when the GST and other reforms were considered.

""There are many other reforms that have already happened but need gestation and stabilization time before they are taken into account by the World Bank,"" Modi said.

He added that there were other reforms on which India and the World Bank would need to find common ground.

Brianna Wu, 40, R unning for Congress in Massachusetts, District 8Getty/HuffPostCan you describe the moment you decided to run for office?","Laura Moser never had any desire to run for office. Her husband worked in politics, and she considered herself to be a highly “involved volunteer,” but beyond that maintained some space from the political sphere.

And then the 2016 presidential election happened.

Moser, 40, was overwhelmed by the election of President Donald J. Trump, and the ensuing pain she saw in her own community on Facebook. The outpouring of grief and mass desire to do something that she saw on social media led Moser to found Daily Action in December 2016, a service that texts daily action items ― like calling your representatives to talk about gun control or forwarding a reminder to voters in Virginia to get to to the polls ― to users’ phones. By early May 2017, she had officially announced she would be running for Congress.

Moser’s story isn’t unique. Across the nation, women from all over the political spectrum decided to run for elected office in the wake of the 2016 presidential race. Within a month of the election, non-partisan organization She Should Run had heard from 4,500 women interested in running for elected office. By February, that number rose to 13,000. Emily’s List, a PAC focusing on electing pro-choice Democratic women to office, saw a similar spike in interest.

Some of the women who decided to run for office found inspiration in Hillary Clinton’s candidacy. Others were simply sick and tired of seeing a legislative body they felt did not represent their identities or interests. Regardless of motivation, the numbers tell a clear story: Women are stepping up and saying they deserve a seat ― or three or four or five seats ― at the table.

Below, presented a year since election day, are eight of those women and their stories:

Describe the moment you decided to run for office.

People [would say], “Oh you’re such a good activist, you’re such a good organizer, you should run for something.” And I was like, “That’s crazy. Why would I ever do that?” But then I was in Houston for a Planned Parenthood luncheon and it was the biggest Planned Parenthood luncheon in the history of Planned Parenthood… That was the first time I really thought, maybe I should run. The room was filled with hundreds of pissed off women ― many of whom are traditionally Republicans, and were just tired of having these sleazy dudes take away our rights. And I just felt this swelling sense of collective indignation and belonging with this group, but I also was like, god, I know all these women. I haven’t lived here [in Texas] for a while, but these are still my people, these were the people I grew up with. These are the people I learned to be politically engaged with. And it took me another two and a half months to go from there to actually deciding to pack up my life and move across the country. But that was definitely the Oprah “aha” moment.

You’re part of a wave of women stepping up to run for office. Why do you think it’s important that more women run?

Every single person I know, me included, has been assaulted and harassed by a man in power many times in our lives. That is the world that we live in. And [I’m] OK. [I’ve] overcome these hurdles. But the Access Hollywood tape was an absolutely radicalizing moment for me. I was like, this guy’s running for President? And he’s the worst man we’ve all met before? And then he won. I thought the election was over then. But then he actually won, being that person. And so I think the value of women and people of color being at the table and in the conversation is that we’re...bringing new voices to the table.

If we had women in all positions in power, the world would become more adaptable to women and mothers, and families. Because I just think a lot of men are used to the women doing it for them. And guess what? We’ve done a really good job… [White men have] had their chance. They’ve done some good things over the years, but I’m done.

Can you describe the moment you decided to run for office?

I was standing at the Javits Center on election night, 30 feet [from] where we were hoping Hillary Clinton would accept the presidency. I was there with all of the people that worked the election for Hillary, as things started going wrong. It was one of the worst nights of my entire life. I was thrown into a loop for a week or two and realized that I wasn’t willing to sit it out for the next four years. It was time to stand up and bring my own values to politics.

What have you learned since you decided to run?

I’m going to be really honest with you. What I’ve learned here in Massachusetts is that the institutions of power are very ready to put a camera in your face when you’re a woman in danger like I was during GamerGate. But when you’re talking about taking power for yourself, when you’re talking about upsetting the status quo, when you’re talking specifically about replacing a man, even a Democratic man [incumbent Stephen Lynch], what I’ve learned is that the system starts shutting its doors very, very quickly.

A lot of this first year has honestly been realizing that the Democratic Party is not necessarily the friend of women that want to run and push the party toward a stronger position on women’s rights.

What sparked your interest in running for office?

Like so many people, I woke up on Nov. 9 in disbelief. I went to sleep early the night before, trusting that the American people would never elect someone so intolerant or incompetent. I woke up, heard the news, and knew I had to run. I knew that there must be a response to Trump and the regressive, elitist Republican agenda.

What’s one of the most important things you’ve learned while running?

Put your head down and get it done. From the moment I started running, people told me, “No, you can’t do this.” They told me that I could not be a mother, an attorney, a wife and a candidate. But I’ve been told “No” my whole life. When I was in high school, I watched as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg announced the Supreme Court’s decision that Virginia Military Institute ― one of the top all-male military colleges in the country ― had to accept women. My male classmates jeered, and I decided I had to go. I enrolled as one of the first women of color to attend VMI. When people told me I couldn’t win this election, I put my head down, ignored the naysayers, and got to work. We knocked on more doors, called more voters, and put in the time to win. There will be people who tell you that you shouldn’t run or that you will never win. Tell them, “Watch me!”

Can you describe the moment you decided to run for office?

I made the official decision to run for office when Ed Royce voted to repeal and replace the ACA. I just couldn’t stand by while our representative voted to take away health care coverage from my patients and their families.

We really need to see a change in our community, and we need someone who understands what our community is going through. As a refugee who came to this country as a child, I know the inhumanity of the Trump administration’s policies that will restrict new immigrants, and we need a leader who will fight tooth and nail against those policies. As a woman that has defeated breast cancer twice, I know how important it is to be an outspoken advocate for women’s health issues, so that all women have access to reproductive health care and breast cancer screenings.

Can you describe how you felt on election night last year?

I felt like I had been punched in the stomach. The next morning, I didn’t want to get up. But I did, like all women do. One of the first patients I saw was a child with a brain tumor. His mom is a nail shop worker and she was finally able to get health care coverage because of the ACA. That meant that she would have coverage for her son as their family dealt with such a terrible tragedy. As we sat in the exam room that next morning, we hugged each other and we cried. We were all so scared. But after the crying, we knew that we needed to fight.

Why did you decide to run for office?

In many ways where I found myself in 2016 was very similar to where I found myself in 2008, which was coming out of a big election, asking myself what I can do for people, particularly my home community... In 2016, I asked myself that same question coming out of the election, what is going on in Michigan? What is this representation bringing to my hometown? I was working in a Department of Defense-funded advanced manufacturing research lab spending a bunch of time with technology, advanced technology, and looking at technology adoption for the small and midsize manufacturing community... Everyone wants to talk about 21st century job training and skills. Well, I’ve created workforce development programs. I’ve worked at the intersection of industry and government and academia and nonprofit for outcomes. I really saw the confluence of all of those things. Plus the willingness and eagerness to serve and respond to something like I did eight years prior, which is stepping up and putting up my hand to make a difference for people.

I felt the urgency of the time and this groundswell that was taking place in Michigan. So many people, my mom being one of them, who just said, “Hey, I was on the floor coming out of this election, but you looking and stepping up in this way, that was giving me hope.” I was plugging into Democratic Club organizations that were seeing two to three times more participation. I was going into union halls and I was tapping into that groundswell. Not as a candidate, but as somebody who was looking to step up as a voice. My candidacy in many respects began as part of that groundswell and really ballooned into something tremendous.

If you’re elected, what change do you hope to see as a result?

This is about a new generation of leaders and leadership. We’re all too familiar with the linkage between congress and the word “dysfunction.” They seem to go hand in hand. That’s just something we got to stop right now. We need a return to common sense and we need a return to real leadership. In part that is about the collaborative nature and role of this office, as well as the willingness to use the office to make a difference for people. Make a difference for people in terms of solving large challenges that communities have been saddled with. That could be as it pertains to health outcomes, as it pertains to education, and certainly as it pertains to our economy. I really believe in the moral authority of the office to do good.

Why did you decide to run for office?

Before Trump, I would have been the kind of person who thought about these problems and didn’t think I was the person to run. When I was assistant district attorney, my job was prosecuting bullies and abusers in people’s families. I saw that trait early on with Trump and I was horrified. So many moms and women recognize him as a bully. That an infectious, horrible influence on our kids is being amplified in such a position made me think that the voice of a normal mom needs to be amplified, too. We should be as vocal as we seek to be, as he did. There’s no point to sit back and watch this unfold anymore, we have to all do it ourselves. If we leave it to the system it’s going to shake out in a way that’s not good for our kids.

You lost your election earlier this fall. Would you run again?

The Democratic party in each county has to choose a person to run. I have to decide if I’m going to run again in the primary next year. I’ll certainly be exploring other ways to get involved. My big question is: How do you take all this enthusiasm ― within a city like New York, it’s like a fiefdom ― and make real change? To me, it’s about informing people about the real paths to influence local leaders.

Jess Phoenix, 35, Running for Congress in California, District 25

Courtesy of Jess Phoenix

What sparked your interest in running for office?

I am running for Congress because I think some of the biggest threats that we have coming down the pipeline are completely being ignored by our current representation in government. For example, climate change is going to impact our national security, our jobs, our health, and even our food security. I believe we need a scientific approach to solving problems like this because they’re big picture problems that affect everyone. We need leaders who know how to look at a ton of evidence and data to draw conclusions and outline a plan of action. That is something that my work as a scientist has prepared me pretty uniquely to do.

The moment that I decided to run, I had just given a lecture at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles. A friend with two young boys approached me, and expressed that he was very concerned about the future world his kids would inherit. I realized that science is missing from government, and if not me, who would be the scientist to run and change our future?

Can you describe how you felt on election night last year?

Election night 2016 was surreal for me. I was working the polls here in L.A. County, and my fellow poll workers and I started out the day in fantastic spirits. As early evening began, we started to see news updates come through on our phones. Throughout the day, turnout had seemed low to us, but we figured that people would come after work. Every report of Trump’s electoral victories felt like a lie. Our jokes disappeared, and we all started focusing inward, looking at our phones and grimacing. From 7pm until the polls closed at 8pm, we didn’t have a single voter come in. That was the biggest clue that something was seriously, seriously wrong with our democracy. My husband Carlos had been canvassing for Hillary in Arizona, and instead of staying there for a victory party he decided to drive back home in the middle of the night. I waited up for him, and we talked until the early hours of the next morning about how impossible and unreal the results seemed.

What sparked your interest in running for office?

The idea to run began as just a fleeting thought, but the more I saw how desperately people around the country were fighting for unity, the more that idea grew. I definitively knew I wanted to run when I casually mentioned to my mother, a physician who was one of the only women in her medical school in India over 50 years ago, “I think I would make a great candidate. I could run.” And my mother answered, “You would be incredible. And you absolutely should run.” Knowing how much I value my mother’s earned wisdom, and considering what the example of my running might do for my own daughter’s ability to dream big, I decided to go for it.

What's the most surprising thing you've found in running?

I am pleasantly surprised that so many people are willing to give me their time as I start my campaign. They want to be a part of something tangible, something that is concretely, measurably, creating change. I am surprised that as much as I am thanking people for their support, they are thanking me back... For the opportunity to work towards something together.

Vor einem Jahr wurde Donald Trump zum US-Präsidenten gewählt

Der Religionswissenschaftler Reza Aslan hat nun eine ebenso ungewöhnliche wie überzeugende Erklärung: Trump handelte wie eine Sektenführer

US-Präsident Donald Trump. Am 7. November 2016 hielten das die meisten Experten und US-Bürger für ausgeschlossen. Einen Tag später wurden sie eines Besseren belehrt.

Trumps Beliebtheitswerte sind seitdem auf ein historisch niedriges Niveau abgestürzt, seine Politik wirkt nicht selten chaotisch, er selbst scheint oft politisch umherzuirren. Zudem steht der Vorwurf der Lüge jeden Tag aufs Neue im Raum und auch die Russland-Affäre hängt wie ein Damoklesschwert über Trumps Präsidentschaft.

Doch egal was Trump sagt, tweetet oder tut. Die Anhänger des Republikaners scheinen in einer anderen Welt zu leben. Was andere als Makel sehen, sehen sie beim 74-Jährigen als Stärke. Er ist der Deal-Maker, seine Unberechenbarkeit gilt als sein größtes Ass. Trump sitzt bei seinen Fans ganz fest auf seinem Thron.

Der bekannte iranisch-amerikanische Religionswissenschaftler Reza Aslan hat für diese paradoxe Sicht eine ungewöhnliche wie überzeugende Erklärung: Trump ist der Guru, seine Anhänger Teil einer Sekte, die ihm schon zum Wahlsieg verhalf.

Wahlkampf wie ein Massengottesdienst

In einem Artikel für die ""Los Angeles Times"" begründet Aslan seine Behauptung:

""Während des Wahlkampfes und danach in persönlichen Auftritten nutzte Trump die Art von emotionaler Intensität zu seinen Anhängern, die eher typisch für einen religiösen Massengottesdienst, als für eine politische Versammlung ist.""

So habe es bei Trump ebenso ""ritualisierte Gesänge"" gegeben. Dazu zählt der US-Forscher die fortwährenden gegen die demokratische Rivalin Hillary Clinton gerichteten Sprechchöre ""Lock her up!"" (""Sperrt sie weg!"").

Ausgewachsener Trump-Kult

Angesichts der wenig schmeichelhaften Bilanz und etlicher nicht eingelöster Wahlversprechen ein Jahr nach der Wahl ist für Aslan klar: ""Der Eifer einiger seiner Anhänger scheint immer mehr einem ausgewachsenen Kult zu ähneln.""

Wohlgemerkt: Aslan verwendet das Wort mit einer negativen Konnotation, bei der eine engstirnige soziale Gruppe sich einem ""charismatischen Führer"" in extremster Weise hingibt.

Denn Trump-Anhänger weisen einige gemeinsame Merkmale mit religiösen Hardlinern auf:

► Die Gruppe bildet sich um eine Person, der ein prophetischer und fast göttlicher Status zugeschrieben wird. ""Trump war spektakulär erfolgreich seine Unterstützer dazu zu bewegen, seinen Liebkosungen und nicht ihren eigenen Augen zu glauben"", schreibt Aslan.

Auch einige führende christliche Unterstützer wiesen Trump besondere Fähigkeiten zu. So soll er im direkten Kontakt mit Gott stehen.

► Des Weiteren nähren sich die Kompetenzen eines Sektenführers davon, dass er sich als einzig wahre Informationsquelle geriert. Aslan bemerkt mit Blick auf Trump: Konkurrierende Ideen und Fakten werden nicht nur als falsch dargestellt, ""sie sind dämonisch"".

Der US-Präsident attackiert in regelmäßigen Abständen unliebsame und kritische Medienhäuser, bezichtigt sie der Verbreitung von ""Fake News"".

With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 11. Oktober 2017

Journalisten sind für Trump ""Lügner"" und ""kranke Leute"", die ""uns unsere Geschichte und unser Erbe wegnehmen wollen"".

Eine gemeinsame Umfrage der US-HuffPost und des Umfrageinstitutes YouGov-Umfrage zeigte, dass auch Trumps Anhänger ähnlich denken: 60 Prozent bezeichneten die Medien als ""Feind"".

Nur Trump könne das Land retten

► Zugleich scheint den Trump-Anhängern egal, welche Beschuldigungen ihn treffen. Anders als beim Missbrauchsskandal um Hollywood-Produzent Harvey Weinstein, halten mehr als die Hälfte der Unterstützer des US-Präsidenten ähnliche Vorwürfe gegen Trump für ""nicht glaubhaft"".

""Einer der Wege, wie ein Sektenführer seine unbestrittene Autorität behält, ist, eine Belagerungsmentalität unter seinen Anhängern zu schaffen und sich als Gegenpol zu präsentieren"", erklärt Aslan.

Denn glaubt man Trump, dann sei die USA ein dahinsichendes Land, in dem Islamisten und Migranten das Gewaltmonopol des Staates längst übernommen hätten. Jeder Gewaltakt, wie jüngst in New York, scheint das Weltbild zu bestätigen. Rassistische Ausfälle wie in Charlottesville werden dagegen umgedeutet.

Mantraartig wiederholte Trump deshalb schon während des Wahlkampfes: ""Ich alleine kann es reparieren.""

""Ich könnte jemanden erschießen - und würde keine Wähler verlieren""

Aslan zeichnet in seinem Beitrag ein düsteres Bild. ""Kultmitglieder neigen dazu zu glauben, dass sie an einer kosmischen Leistung teilnehmen, dass sie an einem Kampf zwischen Gut und Böse teilnehmen.""

Egal was passiert, es scheint, dass eine fast zwei jahre alte Prophezeiung Trumps Wirklichkeit geworden ist. Der jetzige US-Präsident erklärte im Januar 2016:

""Ich könnte mitten auf der 5th Avenue (im Zentrum Manhattans) stehen und jemanden erschießen - und würde trotzdem keine Wähler verlieren.""

Das Problem: Wenn der ""gute"" Trump nicht gewinnt und das Lügen- und Phantasiegebilde des Sektenführes tatsächlich zusammenbrechen droht, könnten die Anhänger gewalttätig werden.

So erklärte Trump-Berater Roger Stone im August: Jeder Versuch, den Präsidenten aus dem Amt zu entfernen, würde in ""diesem Land in einen Gewaltkrampf, einen Aufstand, enden, wie Sie ihn noch nie gesehen haben"".

It might be your favourite comfort food when you're sick, but it's not going to become India's national dish.

Following multiple reports that announced the Indian government's intention to designate khichdi as the country's national dish, the union food minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal said it was all ""fictitious"".

Enough Khichdi cooked up on a fictitious 'National Dish'. It has only been put for a record entry in #WorldFoodIndia. — Harsimrat Kaur Badal (@HarsimratBadal_) November 1, 2017

She had earlier been quoted as saying, ""Khichdi is considered nutritious, healthiest food in India and it is is eaten by poor and rich alike, irrespective of their class. It symbolises India's great culture of unity in diversity. So it has been selected as the brand of Indian food.""

Badal had been speaking at an event before the World Food India conference, where celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor is expected to cook 800 kilograms of khichdi in an attempt to set a world record. However, news reports soon appeared suggesting that this was part of a decision to make khichdi a national dish.

Instead, it will be reportedly promoted as a ""Brand India Food"" globally.

Ma forse esiste anche una contraddizione all'interno della stessa legge per la distinzione tra incandidabilità ed ineleggibilità"".

Per Bindi ""è evidente che chi è candidabile ma non eleggibile comunque droga il risultato delle elezioni, perché il consenso raccolto, anche nel caso in cui la persona di fatto ineleggibile non venisse eletta, interviene ad alterare il risultato"". ""Questo - ha aggiunto - sono tutti aspetti sui quali la nostra Commissione interviene da tempo e ha già da tempo segnalato. Il legislatore deve intervenire"".

Beppe Grillo interviene nella vicenda con un post su Facebook dove scrive: ""Non sono passate manco 48 ore e... Taaac: primo arrestato negli eletti di Musumeci!"".

Sull'arresto di De Luca parla anche il candidato dei 5 Stelle in Sicilia, Giancarlo Cancelleri. ""Cateno De Luca dell'Udc è il primo impresentabile arrestato di Nello Musumeci. Lo hanno eletto all'assemblea siciliana neppure 48 ore fa: un record storico"", scrive su Facebook.

Sur les terrains comme en dehors. Mais ce mercredi 8 novembre, ceux qui s'intéressent à ce personnage hors norme auront accès à un nouveau pan de ses pensées.

Éric Cantona publie ""Mon carnet"". Passionné par la peinture et la photographie depuis son plus jeune âge, celui qui est également acteur et producteur s'est récemment mis à écrire. Cantona dessine et annote ses idées dans de petits carnets en moleskine. Les éditions Flammarion les ont édités.

Son moleskine contient quelques bons mots, mais il parle aussi d'amour, de mort, de l'absurdité de notre société. Et si jamais vous trouvez ça trop sérieux par moment, quelques dessins de ""bites"" viendront vous rappeler que... c'est du Canto.

Pas qu'on prévoyait y rencontrer beaucoup d'artistes ; en fait, Nantel écorche tellement de collègues humoriste dans son nouveau one man show – Guillaume Wagner, Sugar Sammy, Louis-José Houde et Mike Ward y goûtent tous, et pas avec tendresse – que ce n'était pas le glamour qui attirait les caméras au rendez-vous mondain. D'ailleurs, la colonie artistique ne s'était pas déplacée en si grand nombre pour applaudir son confrère. Manque d'intérêt, de solidarité ou pur hasard? Passons.

Non, c'est plutôt la cohue anticipée qui générait la curiosité. Le Journal de Québec l'écrivait mardi matin, Nantel aurait reçu des menaces de mort extrêmement sérieuses après sa première dans la Vieille Capitale, la semaine dernière.

Son allusion à Alice Paquet dans un de ses numéros lui a valu un déferlement de critiques négatives et d'insultes, majoritairement de la part de gens qui n'ont pas encore vu Nos droits et libertés. Un homme a été arrêté par le Service de police de la Ville de Québec après avoir proféré des menaces à l'endroit de Nantel ; on aurait même retrouvé des armes dans la résidence de l'individu en question.

Mardi matin, Éric Young, président de Groupe Entourage, qui produit Nos droits et libertés, annonçait dans les pages du Journal de Montréal que la sécurité serait accrue à la Place des Arts pour encadrer la rentrée montréalaise de son poulain. On craignait la venue de manifestants et on tenait à garantir la sécurité des invités en cette soirée importante. Un communiqué a également été envoyé aux médias pour indiquer la volonté de Guy Nantel de se tenir debout devant le tumulte et de n'occulter aucune ligne de son spectacle.

Anti-émeute

Tout un déploiement policier s'étalait effectivement dans le grand hall du Théâtre Maisonneuve, quelques pas devant la Place DesChamps. Plusieurs agents de sécurité, en veste noire ou jaune, ont patrouillé au fur et à mesure que les gens entraient dans la salle. De grandes affiches avertissant d'un contrôle de sécurité et d'une possibilité de fouille se dressaient non loin de la billetterie.

À l'extérieur, la présence d'une trentaine de représentants de l'escouade anti-émeute en a ébahi plus d'un ; était-ce vraiment pour Guy Nantel que toutes ces forces de l'ordre avaient été mises à contribution? Le journaliste Raphaël Gendron-Martin, du Journal de Montréal, qui rendait compte de la situation en temps réel sur Twitter a finalement révélé que l'anti-émeute était sur place pour une autre manifestation, qui se tenait à quelques mètres de là, et non pour l'événement Nantel. Une coïncidence étonnante, quand même.

Or, tout ce tapage aura au final donné lieu à un tapis rouge un peu plus désordonné que d'habitude, mais à aucun débordement. Aucune anecdote répréhensible n'a été observée, aucune pancarte et aucun groupe extrémiste ne sont passés pour troubler la quiétude d'avant-représentation. Le producteur, Éric Young, se trouvait apparemment à l'intérieur du Théâtre Maisonneuve plusieurs minutes avant la levée du rideau et n'a pu répondre aux questions des journalistes, alors que se jouait un segment majeur de son grand rassemblement, un escalier plus bas.

Aujourd'hui, on est en droit de se poser la question : on ne doute pas de la véracité des propos graves adressés à Guy Nantel, mais sa garde rapprochée a-t-elle profité de la récente dérape publique pour orchestrer une opération marketing? A-t-on exagéré une mise en scène de sécurité pour mousser le bruit autour de la première montréalaise de Nos droits et libertés?

Déjà, toute l'attention accordée à la blague sur Alice Paquet biaisait notre écoute et dévalorisait d'emblée le reste du matériel de Nantel. Mardi, une fois le spectacle commencé, les journalistes avaient davantage la tête à éplucher les réseaux sociaux pour effectuer le suivi des mesures de sécurité qu'à écouter le contenu du comique sur scène.

Scusate questa chiarezza ma sono un po' incazzato"".

Inoltre il presidente, ignora o fa finta di non sapere, che l'Accordo di Programma del 2005, unico strumento a garanzia del futuro di Cornigliano, è stato firmato anche da Confindustria. Le sue scellerate affermazioni screditano la stessa firma di Confindustria sull'Accordo, al quale a questo punto, non si sa che peso dare"".

A Genova, intanto, prosegue la protesta degli operai. I lavoratori hanno deciso di marciare fin sotto la sede della Regione Liguria dove incontreranno il presidente Giovanni Toti, che questo pomeriggio insieme al sindaco di Genova Marco Bucci e al presidente dell'autorita portuale Paolo Signorini incontreranno a Roma il ministro dello Sviluppo Economico Carlo Calenda.

Anche Calenda è contrario all'occupazione dello stabilimento dell'Ilva di Genova. ""In quale altro Paese al mondo un investitore che vuole investire in tutto 5 miliardi e 300 milioni di euro sull'acciaio viene accolto in questo modo?"", afferma il ministro a un convegno promosso da Confindustria. Calenda punta il dito contro l'occupazione, il ricorso presentato dal sindaco di Taranto e dal presidente della Puglia ""contro il piano ambientale che risolve i problemi dell'ambiente di Taranto"", simbolo di ""un populismo istituzionale e talvolta sindacale"". Poi, domanda: questo accade perchè in Italia ""permane una forte cultura antindustriale, su cui penso vada aperto un confronto serio?"".","""Sono un po' inc..., sull'Ilva i sindacati dovrebbero avere il senso del limite"".

Le rappeur le plus écouté de l'année 2016, qui a accepté de comparaître dans le cadre d'une procédure de plaider-coupable, a reconnu sa culpabilité. Le tribunal a ensuite homologué, en audience publique, la peine de 5000 euros d'amende et six mois de suspension du permis de conduire.

L'artiste de 27 ans, Julien Marie de son vrai nom, ""versera sans difficulté"" le montant de l'amende, a souligné son avocat Damien Benedetti, en tendant au président l'avis d'imposition de Jul, ce ""contribuable fort généreux avec la ville de Marseille"", a-t-il souligné. Quant à la peine de suspension du permis de conduire, ""elle ne posera pas de difficulté"", son label ayant mis un chauffeur à sa disposition.

8 points de permis en moins

Barbe de plusieurs jours, en noir des baskets à la doudoune, Jul a assuré au tribunal qu'il ne récidiverait pas après ce délit routier. Son casier judiciaire portait jusqu'ici trace d'une condamnation à 4 mois de prison avec sursis en 2011 pour un vol aggravé.

Outre la sanction pénale, sa virée sur l'autoroute A50 a déjà valu à Jul la perte de 8 points de permis sur 12, le mettant à la merci d'une annulation s'il grille un feu rouge, par exemple, l'a sermonné le président.

Fin octobre, la ""mauvaise journée"" de Jul, titre d'une chanson de son nouvel album dévoilée juste après les faits, s'était achevée par son interpellation alors qu'il roulait à ""plus de 160 kilomètres heure"", faisant des appels de phare aux voitures roulant devant lui, parmi lesquelles une voiture de policiers de la Bac, qui l'ont intercepté.

Un mot d'excuse sur Facebook

Après sa sortie de garde à vue, il s'était dit ""désolé"" sur Facebook, dans un texte truffé de fautes d'orthographe.

Son passager avait été interpellé avec une arme de poing de 9 mm de calibre, et une petite quantité de résine de cannabis.

En mai, Jul avait été auditionné dans le cadre d'une enquête préliminaire pour propos injurieux et atteinte à la vie privée, après avoir cité nommément un fonctionnaire de police dans une de ses chansons.

Der Politikwissenschaftler Hamed Abdel-Samad warnt eindringlich vor dem politischen Islam

Dieser würde die Integration von muslimischen Migranten in Deutschland massiv behindern

Auch die katholische und evangelische Kirche trügen daran eine Mitschuld

Der ägyptisch-deutsche Politikwissenschaftler Hamed Abdel-Samad hat vor dem politischen Islam in Deutschland gewarnt. Insbesondere kritisierte er den größten Moscheeverein in Deutschland, die von der Türkei dominierte Ditib.

Auf einer Veranstaltung der “Passauer Neuen Presse” sagte er am Montagabend, Ditib stehe für einen Islam, mit dem muslimische Migranten in Deutschland nicht erfolgreich mit einbezogen werden könnten. Das Ziel dieses politischen Islam sei “niemals die Integration der Muslime“.

Auch wenn sich islamische Organisationen in Deutschland oft als offizielle Repräsentanten der hierzulande lebenden Muslime darstellen würden, habe das nichts mit der Realität zu tun.

Abdel-Samad begründet das damit, dass nur ein kleiner Teil der fünf Millionen Muslime in Deutschland Mitglieder solcher Verbände sind. Für eine gelungene Integration sei es viel wichtiger auf die einzelnen Individuen einzugehen, als auf politische Gruppierungen.

Oft geäußerte Kritik

Wenn Abdel-Samad so etwas sagt, erzeugt das immer Aufmerksamkeit in Deutschland. Der Politologe ist für seine harte Haltung ebenso bekannt wie umstritten.

Neues hat sein Beitrag am Montagabend in der Diskussion denn auch nicht gebracht. Dass die türkische Regierung über Ditib Einfluss in Deutschland zu nehmen versucht, ist bekannt. Der Glaubensverband steht hierzulande schon länger in der Kritik. Unter anderem werden Imamen von Ditib Spionage für die türkische Regierung vorgeworfen.

Gleichwohl hält Abdel-Samad damit eine Diskussion am Laufen, die tatsächlich geführt werden muss. Zuletzt hatte etwa der CDU-Politiker Jens Spahn in harschen Worten angemahnt, die Zusammenarbeit mit den Islamverbänden zu überprüfen.

Dabei geht es darum, wie der Islam in Deutschland in der Gesellschaft vertreten werden soll, wer für Muslime sprechen kann und darf.

Denn klar ist: Muslime sind traditionell weniger hierarchisch organisiert als etwa die Christen.

""Die Kirche macht sich mitschuldig""

Abdel-Samad nahm am Montag auch die Kirchen in die Pflicht. Auch sie setzen seiner Ansicht nach zu stark auf Verbände wie die Ditib.

Er warf Heinrich Bedford-Strohm, dem Landesbischof der evangelischen Kirche in Bayern, Fehler im Umgang mit der Ditib vor.

So habe seine Kirche zur Gedenkfeier nach dem Terroranschlag auf dem Breitscheidplatz in Berlin 2016 einen Imam eingeladen, der zu diesem Zeitpunkt vom Verfassungsschutz beobachtet wurde.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Der Islam ist kein Problem, das man lösen muss""

“Indem man solche Leute hoffähig macht, macht man sich als Kirche mitschuldig”, so Abdel-Samad. Die Kirche würde keinerlei Konsequenzen im Umgang mit Ditib folgen lassen, und das obwohl man um ihre problematische Rolle wisse.

Bedford-Strohm argumentierte, man wisse um die Kritik - aber deswegen werde man den Dialog nicht abreißen lassen. Denn er sei unabdingbar.

Doch Abdel-Samad wehrt sich gegen solche Kompromisse. Nur mehr Ehrlichkeit mit dem Islam und mit seinen Vertretern in Deutschland könne zu einer besseren Integration führen.

Here are 11 things you'll do when you've lived away from Australia for too long:1.
You hesitate before pulling out onto the road because you can't remember if the right side is right or left.
You'll find yourself triple checking which way the traffic goes and scaring the wits out of your passengers.
No matter how long you've been away, nothing feels as good as the sand between your toes on an Australian beach.","""That big hole in the ozone layer has the ability to roast you tomato red within minutes.""

After living in Europe for 18 months I was ready to come back to the big old sunburnt country I call home. As a patriotic Aussie, I would proudly tell people my heritage, only to be bombarded with proclamations about how lucky I was and funny things they love about Australians.

What I hadn't counted on was losing my Aussieness as I adopted the characteristics of the people around me, and it wasn't until I landed back on Australian soil that I realised how much I'd changed.

Here are 11 things you'll do when you've lived away from Australia for too long:

1. You hesitate before pulling out onto the road because you can't remember if the right side is right or left.

After mastering driving on the wrong (or I guess I should say right) side of the road and entering roundabouts completely backwards, getting back to the left on Australian roads can be a shock to the system. You'll find yourself triple checking which way the traffic goes and scaring the wits out of your passengers.

2. You nearly choke at the price of food in cafésand restaurants.

After buying coffee for as little as €2 every day, coming home to Oz and paying up to $4.50 hurts your over-caffeinated soul. Paying $15 for brunch absolutely crushes you when you used to be able to get your smashed-avo fix for €8.

3. Likewise with alcohol.

Gone are the days of the €12 bottles of Jägermeister. Thanks to the Aussie alcohol tax, your drinking habits are about to become a whole lot more expensive.

4. You're super cautious walking in the bush.

Despite growing up in the country where snakes and lizards were a part of life, after being away for months in a place where the worst thing you could find is a spider, it can be a little daunting to get back to the great outdoors. After talking up how dangerous Aussie wildlife is to your new European pals, you start to believe the bulls**t you have been feeding them and are overly cautious of what's out there.

In Europe this is a stick.

5. You find the buzzing noise of flies literally the most annoying sound you've ever heard.

Imagine a summer without needing a fly swat on hand at all times. European countries lack the droning soundtrack of flies and mosquitoes that our wonderful country Down Under has during the warmer months. The serenity of a fly-free country such as the Netherlands seems like a distant, and quiet, memory.

6. You start picking up local catchphrases.

Even if you turn on the ocker Aussie accent when needed, you will find yourself parroting what your European friends say. ""Yeah"" becomes ""Ja"" and a ""bogan"" can also be known as a ""f***in' knacker"". This does work in reverse and you will find yourself becoming a professor of the Australian language to your European pals. I've never been more proud than when my workmates started answering questions with ""yeah nah yeah"".

7. You're appalled at the severely limited free WiFi in cafes.

What is this? You want me to talk to my dining companion? And this NBN rubbish, it moves at a glacial pace compared to the super-fast Internet in the Northern Hemisphere.

8. You go out in the sun for more than 10 minutes and wonder how you got so damn sunburnt.

If there is one thing you don't miss about Australia, it's that big hole in the ozone layer that has the ability to roast you tomato red within minutes. In saying that, you're grateful for the huge range of quality fake tan that is available in Aussie shops -- the European version still leaves you looking like a tandoori chicken.

9. You wince walking outside barefoot.

After being cushioned in winter boots for so long, protected from the frigid Euro winter, your baby-bum-soft feet can't deal with the blistering-hot sand or asphalt. Even wearing shoes inside doesn't feel like total sacrilege anymore.

10. You're offended when the security guard asks for your ID at the pub.

You haven't even looked at your ID for months, beer is like water for Europeans and if you look a smidge over 16 you'll be grand for a pint.

11. You're gobsmacked by the sunset.

While the polluted haze of the Northern Hemisphere made for mysterious and gloomy sunsets, the colourful, clear skies of Australia turn on a show nothing short of spectacular. While European countries have beautiful, old architecture, there is nothing better than Australian nature -- it truly is the most picturesque country in the world.

No matter how long you've been away, nothing feels as good as the sand between your toes on an Australian beach. It may take a while to accustom yourself back to your Aussie self, but once you do you realise that the words of Peter Allen are immortal and why you still call Australia home.",Signs You’ve Lived Away From Australia Too Long,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/jess-buchan/signs-you-ve-lived-away-from-australia-too-long_a_23267646/

The men -- refugees and asylum seekers -- have been barricaded inside the centre for a week and say they are safer inside the shut-down centre than in new, but unsecured, accomodation closer to the Manus capital of Lorengau.

Lawyers for the refugees are expected to appeal the decision as early as Wednesday.

Some of the men have made appeals to world leaders, with more than 280 refugees reportedly signing a letter pleading to U.S. President Donald Trump, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacind Ardern and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for their help.

""I think... is that there are some activists in Australia, including the Greens senator Nick McKim, who are basically encouraging these people not to move,"" he told the ABC on Tuesday.

""It is not incumbent on PNG to deliver services and this remains the responsibility of the service providers but at the new locations where the residents have to move to.""

Amnesty international has warned that over the past 10 days refugees reported three medical emergencies.

""In one case, a refugee who has epilepsy, had a fit and was unconscious for several hours,"" Amnesty said.

""Refugees called to guards to provide medical assistance but there was no response. In another incident, a refugee self-harmed and, while physically stable, he remained in a fragile mental state, supported only by his friends.""

Human Rights Watch's Elaine Pearson said the Australian government was acting irresponsibly.

""Moving hundreds of men to a town where refugees have been beaten, stabbed and robbed is incredibly irresponsible,"" she said in a statement.

In der Chenery Street in San Francisco steht ein Haus, das auf den ersten Blick wie ein gewöhnliches Reihenhaus aussieht. Doch dieser Eindruck täuscht - hinter der Fassade des Hauses versteckt sich mehr. Das Haupthaus erstreckt sich auf drei Gebäudeeinheiten, die an die Straße angrenzen.

Wenn man es betritt, könnte man meinen, in einer Villa aus einem James Bond-Film zu sein.

Das Haupthaus sieht nämlich aus wie ein eindrucksvoller Palast – mit Glasdach und einem Swimmingpool im Speisesaal. Im Hauptgebäude sind Buntglasfenster der ehemaligen Kirche Little Sisters of the Poor verbaut.

Das Haus wurde im Jahr 1987 erbaut

Das Glasdach der Villa lässt sich zudem zur Seite fahren, damit die Sonnenstrahlen auch ungefiltert in das Innere des Hauses fallen können. Im Hauptgebäude befinden sich fünf Schlafzimmer und genauso viele Bäder. Im Obergeschoss der Villa hat man einen atemberaubenden Blick auf die Skyline von San Francisco.

Die Villa wurde im Jahr 1987 für den Werbefachmann Robert Pritikin gebaut. Derzeit steht das Anwesen zum Verkauf. Wer es haben möchte, muss aber tief in die Tasche greifen: Das Anwesen kostet elf Millionen Dollar, also umgerechnet knapp zehn Millionen Euro.

If not enough calcium is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, calcium will be taken from the bones.
""Good sources of calcium include dairy foods like milk, yoghurt and cheese, calcium-fortified foods such as soy products, and to a lesser degree some leafy green vegetables, nuts, seeds and fish,"" Spendlove said.
One cup of calcium-fortified breakfast cereal (40g) contains up to 200mg of calcium -- ½ cup of calcium-fortified orange juice (100ml) contains up to 80mg of calcium; two slices of bread (30g) provides 200mg of calcium.
""It is much better to get calcium from foods (which also provide other nutrients) than from calcium supplements,"" Spendlove said.","When we think of calcium, what springs to mind are teeth, bones and cows milk. While calcium is certainly related to these things, the mineral is required for many more processes in our bodies and is found in an array of healthy foods.

To find out everything about calcium, including why we need it and where we can find it, HuffPost Australia spoke to two health experts.

What is calcium and why do we need it?

""Calcium is a mineral and facilitates a number of functions in the body, including bone and tooth formation, muscle contraction and nerve transmission,"" nutritionist Zoe Bingley-Pullin told HuffPost Australia. ""It also regulates heart rhythm and plays a role in electrolyte balance.""

Calcium plays a role in:

strengthening bones and teeth

regulating muscle functioning (such as contraction and relaxation)

regulating heart functioning and blood clotting

regulating the transmission of nervous system messages and enzyme functions.

Interestingly, calcium is the most abundant mineral in the human body and is stored in our teeth and bones.

How much calcium do we need per day?

""The amount of calcium we require does change as we age,"" accredited practising dietitian and performance dietitian Jessica Spendlove told HuffPost Australia.

""Calcium requirements are at their highest for men and women during adolescence when we are developing peak bone mass, and then also later in life when bone mass is naturally declining.

""For women, this is at the onset of menopause (typically in their 50s) and for men this is once they hit their 70s.""

What happens when we're calcium deficient?

""Calcium deficiency may cause or be associated with a number of health conditions such as heart palpitations, tooth decay, poor bone mineral density and osteoporosis, muscular cramps, depression and stunted growth,"" Bingley-Pullin said.

Osteoporosis is quite common in western cultures and often results in bone fractures, Spendlove explained.

""When the body notices there is not enough calcium circulating in the blood, it will use hormones to reduce the amount excreted out by the kidneys in the urine. If not enough calcium is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, calcium will be taken from the bones.

""If your dietary intake of calcium is constantly low, your body will eventually remove so much calcium from the skeleton that your bones will become weak and brittle.""

Osteoporosis is one of the major causes of morbidity amongst older Australians and New Zealanders, particularly postmenopausal women.

""Calcium intake throughout life is a major factor affecting the incidence of osteoporosis -- however, other factors, notably adequate vitamin D status and exercise, also play a role,"" Spendlove said.

What foods are high in calcium?

Calcium is found in many foods, including animal and plant-based products.

""Good sources of calcium include dairy foods like milk, yoghurt and cheese, calcium-fortified foods such as soy products, and to a lesser degree some leafy green vegetables, nuts, seeds and fish,"" Spendlove said.

Good dietary sources of calcium and recommended doses:

Dairy products including milk, yoghurt, cheese and buttermilk -- 300mg equates to roughly 250ml of milk, 200g tub of yoghurt, 250ml of calcium-fortified soy or plant milk, or 40g of cheddar cheese

-- 300mg equates to roughly 250ml of milk, 200g tub of yoghurt, 250ml of calcium-fortified soy or plant milk, or 40g of cheddar cheese Leafy green vegetables including broccoli, collards (cabbage family), bok choy, Chinese cabbage and spinach -- 100mg equates to roughly one cup of cooked spinach, although not all of this may be absorbed (due to the high concentration of oxalate, a compound in spinach that reduces calcium absorption); 45mg equates to roughly one cup of cooked broccoli, but the absorption from broccoli is much higher at around 50–60 per cent.

Kale, broccoli and cabbage can provide good doses of calcium.

Other notable sources of calcium include:

Soy and tofu

Fish -- sardines and salmon (with bones); half a cup of canned salmon contains 402mg of calcium

Nuts and seeds -- brazil nuts, almonds and sesame seed paste (tahini). Fifteen almonds contain about 40mg of calcium.

Calcium-fortified foods -- including breakfast cereals, fruit juices and bread. One cup of calcium-fortified breakfast cereal (40g) contains up to 200mg of calcium -- ½ cup of calcium-fortified orange juice (100ml) contains up to 80mg of calcium; two slices of bread (30g) provides 200mg of calcium.

Are calcium supplements beneficial?

Before considering a calcium supplement, it's important to check in with a GP to assess your calcium and vitamin D levels by way of bone mineral density scans, blood tests, food diary and/or symptoms.

""It's important to assess vitamin D status as well because vitamin D helps to regulate the absorption of calcium,"" Bingley-Pullin said.

""It is much better to get calcium from foods (which also provide other nutrients) than from calcium supplements,"" Spendlove said.

""If you have difficulty eating enough foods rich in calcium, you might need to consider a calcium supplement, especially if you are at risk of developing osteoporosis. It's a good idea to discuss this with your doctor or other registered healthcare professional.

""If you do take calcium supplements, make sure you don't take more than the amount recommended on the bottle. Too much calcium may cause gastrointestinal upsets, such as bloating and constipation.""",These Are The Best Sources Of Calcium,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/06/these-are-the-best-sources-of-calcium_a_23267568/

칼 사전트는 지난 주에 (그의 표현을 빌면) ‘충격적이며 고통스러운’ 혐의가 일어 장관직에서 사임했다.

그의 사체는 노스 웨일스의 코나스 퀘이에 있는 자택에서 11월 7일 오전 11시 30분(현지 시각)에 발견되었다. 노스 웨일스 경찰은 ‘그의 죽음에 의혹을 갖고 있지 않다’고 밝혔다. 사전트는 자살한 것으로 보인다.

웨일스 의회는 존중의 표시로 모든 활동을 중단했다.

제레미 코빈 노동당 당수는 그의 죽음이 “끔찍하며 아주 충격적인 소식”이라고 말했다. 카윈 존스 웨일스 총리는 그의 죽음은 당과 국가에 “큰 손실”이라 말했다.

사전트는 지난 주에 당에서 해임되었으며, 그에 대한 혐의가 수사되는 가운데 웨일스 의회에서도 추방되었다.

사전트에 대한 혐의가 제기되자 노동당은 11월 3일에 해임 조치를 내렸다.

사전트의 가족은 11월 7일에 성명을 발표하여 “칼은 아주 사랑받는 남편, 아버지, 친구였다. 그는 우리 가족의 일부일 뿐 아니라, 우리를 하나로 묶어주는 존재였다. 그는 우리 가족의 중심이었다. 우리는 그를 무척 사랑했다.”고 밝혔다.

“그는 굉장히 친절하고 우리를 아끼는 남편, 아버지, 아들, 친구였다. 우리는 할 말을 잃을 정도로 큰 충격을 받았으며, 그를 알고 사랑했던 모든 사람들이 우리와 함께 비통해 함을 알고 있다.”

사전트는 2003년에 웨일스 의회에 들어왔다. 2009년부터 장관 및 차관직을 거쳤고, 2016년 5월에 지역사회·아동부 장관이 되었다.

지난 주에 해임된 뒤 사전트는 개인적 절차를 거쳐 명예를 회복하고 싶다고 말했다.

그는 “오늘 총리를 만나서 내 개인 행동에 대한 혐의 이야기를 들었다. 내겐 끔찍하며 충격적인 소식이었다. 나는 혐의에 대한 자세한 내용은 아직 듣지 못했다.”고 하며, “혐의의 성격상” 자신이 내각에서 “물러나는 것”이 적절하겠다고 총리와 합의했다고 말했다.

또한 “나는 명예를 회복한 뒤 정부로 돌아올 날을 고대한다.”고 했다.

코빈은 “끔찍하며 아주 충격적인 소식이다. 칼의 가족, 친구, 동료들에게 깊은 공감을 보낸다.”고 말했다.

카윈 존스 웨일스 총리는 “칼은 친구이자 동료였으며, 그의 죽음에 나는 충격을 받았고 몹시 슬프다. 그는 웨일스 대중의 삶에 큰 기여를 했으며 자신이 장관이자 지역 의원으로서 대표하고 있는 사람들을 위해 지칠 줄 모르고 싸웠다. 우리 정당과 의회에 있어 큰 손실이 될 것이다. 이 힘든 때, 그의 가족들에게 진심어린 위로를 보낸다.”고 말했다.

Grünen-Chef Özdemir gab eine vormals ausgerufene Koalitionsbedingung auf

Die Grünen bestehen nicht mehr auf dem Ende des Verbrennungsmotors bis 2030

Es war ein kleiner Kreis, den Kanzlerin Angela Merkel am Montagabend zu sich ins Kanzleramt geladen hatte. Der CSU-Vorsitzende Horst Seehofer, das Grünen-Spitzenduo Katrin Göring-Eckardt und Cem Özdemir sowie FDP-Chef Christian Lindner und FDP-Vize Wolfgang Kubicki kamen zusammen, um die Schwerpunkte der weiteren Sondierunsgespräche festzulegen.

""Am Donnerstag, dem 16. November, wollen wir fertig sein mit allem. Und da steht noch viel Arbeit an"", erklärte Merkel bei Facebook am Tag des Chef-Treffens.

► Bei einem zentralen Thema könnte ein Großteil der Arbeit derweil bereits getan sein. Denn in der Frage um die Zukunft der Automobilindustrie gibt es Annäherungen.

""Mir ist klar, dass wir das nicht durchsetzen können""

Die Grünen kommen den Jamaika-Unterhändlern von Union und FDP im Tauziehen um die Klimapolitik in einen wichtigen Punkt entgegen. Sie beharren nicht länger darauf, bei einer Koalitionsvereinbarung das Ende des Verbrennungsmotors im Jahr 2030 festzuschreiben.

""Mir ist klar, dass wir alleine nicht das Enddatum 2030 für die Zulassung von fossilen Verbrennungsmotoren durchsetzen werden können"", sagte Parteichef Cem Özdemir der ""Stuttgarter Zeitung"". Statt des konkreten Datums für den Ausstieg verlangt die Umweltpartei nur noch ""ein klares Bekenntnis, dass wir alles dafür tun, um die Fahrzeuge der Zukunft - vernetzt, automatisiert und emissionsfrei - zu bekommen"".

Noch im August hatte Özdemir das Aus des Verbrenners zur Koalitionsbedingung ausgerufen.

► Probleme sieht Özdemir indes weiter beim Thema Asyl: ""Für eine bessere Integration müssen wir die Familienzusammenführung wieder ermöglichen"", sagte der Grünen-Chef in der ""Stuttgarter Zeitung"".

Hofreiter weiß, dass Kompromisse nötig sind

Der schleswig-holsteinische Ministerpräsident Daniel Günther (CDU) deutete beim Thema Familiennachzug zuletzt Kompromissbereitschaft an. Dagegen machte CSU-Vize Christian Schmidt in der ""Passauer Neuen Presse"" klar, dass seine Partei in dieser Frage nicht gesprächsbereit sei.

► Özdemirs Parteikollege Anton Hofreiter hatte am Montag nach einer Fraktionssitzung ebenfalls angedeutet, zu Zugeständnissen auf mehreren Gebieten bereit zu sein.

Den Grünen sei bewusst, dass die FDP ein Ergebnis beim Thema Steuererleichterungen brauche. Die Union brauche etwas ""in Richtung Planbarkeit, Steuerbarkeit und Ordnung der Flüchtlingsfrage"".

Die Grünen erwarteten nun auch Kompromisse in Richtung Humanität, legale Fluchtwege, bei der sozialen Gerechtigkeit – und beim Klima.

Dass es ausgerechnet beim grünen Herz-Thema nicht die Brechstange sein muss, wie Özdemir jetzt andeutete, macht Hoffnung, dass es mit der Koalition tatsächlich klappt. Vielleicht sogar noch in diesem Jahr.

Pinterest CLOSE ″There was a bride and a groom, women met men at the altar, men wore a suit, women wore a dress… We don’t identify as fitting into that idea, the world is full of people that identify as shades of grey rather than black or white.”

Dancing With Her Tara Baker (L) and Arlia Hassel, who co-founded 'Dancing With Her'.

So they decided to launch a long-overdue alternative. “Two-bride weddings aren’t featured in wedding magazines all that often, and we know that finding inspiration we could picture ourselves in was something that was important to us,” Tara said. “We also get the opportunity to share practical advice that is appropriate to LGBTQ+ weddings, like how to get yourself down the aisle, the legalities surrounding same-sex marriage and how to navigate the tradition of changing your last name.”

Beatrice Glenister One of the real-life weddings featured in the magazine.

The launch of the magazine is incredibly timely, with the country holding a same-sex marriage referendum. The results of which will be revealed on 15 November. Currently same-sex couples can register their relationship as a civil union but this does not carry the same legal status as a marriage. Tara explains that many couples they’ve worked with choose to travel overseas and marry abroad, although these marriages are not currently recognised when couples return to Australian soil. For newly-engaged Tara and Arlia, who plan to marry in next year, the referendum result is incredibly personal. “We hope that when we wed in a small ceremony in August 2018, the Australian government will recognise our union as a legal marriage. If not, we haven’t considered registering our relationship with our state,” Tania explained. The couple have their sights set on a wedding in the Gold Coast Hinterland. “It’ll be an intimate, romantic affair with 20 of our closest friends and family. Nothing over the top, simple and romantic is what we will be going for on the day.”

Sarah Kennedy One of the real-life weddings featured in the magazine.

Tara and Arlia have been involved in the ‘yes’ campaign, and are hopeful for the results. “We have our fingers (and toes) crossed that it will come in a resounding yes. In my heart, I feel that will be the way it goes… I have hope that the Australian population will vote in favour of equal love and human rights.” Tara describes the lead up to the referendum as an “emotional rollercoaster”, but that they have never felt closer to the LGBTQ community. “We can’t wait for a day where it isn’t assumed that our partner is of the opposite sex, or feel judged when we declare that the one we love is the same-sex.”

Jessie Dains One of the real-life weddings featured in the magazine.

‘Dancing With Her’ began as an Instagram account and blog in 2016, before launching as a downloadable digital magazine in February 2017. A print magazine was a “natural progression” but also inspired by the couple’s own engagement and first-hand experience at the lack of appropriate resource. The magazine will be a quarterly publication that can be pre-ordered and delivered internationally. Volume Two is already in early stages of production. When asked why a publication such as this hadn’t been published sooner, Tara replied: “Honestly, we have no idea! Some countries have had legal marriages between same-sex couples for nearly 15 years. “We initially knew the Australian community needed a publication like this but was quick to realise women across the world who felt the same way.”

„Bauer sucht Frau“ ist Wahlwerbung für die AfD.","""Bauer sucht Frau"" ist zu einer Peep-Show für die Bessergestellten geworden

Denn in der RTl-Sendung werden Menschen aus der Provinz bloßgestellt - mit fatalen Folgen

Katastrophen fangen oft ganz harmlos an. So auch die neue Folge von „Bauer sucht Frau“, jener scheinbar putzigen und doch so giftigen Reality-Soap auf RTL.

Kameraschwenk über die thüringische Provinz. Hintergrundmusik: 70er-Jahre-Geträller. Rosi sitzt am Frühstückstisch eines Bauernhofs vor zwei drögen Scheiben Brot. Der Hausherr hat ein Milchtrauma aus der Jugend und kann keinen Käse riechen. Dafür hat er sie mit einem Pfund Butter überrascht.

Doch die Dame stellt ihn auf die Probe und drapiert den eigens mitgebrachten Edamer auf den Tisch.

Weibliche Stimme aus dem Off: „Auch Rosi erbringt einen Liebesbeweis, sie versteckt den Käse unter Marmelade.“ Der Bauer muss vor die Tür. „Nur die frische Landluft kann dem 66-Jährigen jetzt helfen. Rosi bleibt ratlos zurück. Muss sie sich vom Käse verabschieden, wenn sie bei Günter bleiben möchte?“, sagt die Sprecherin.

Nahaufnahme. Hintergrundmusik: italienisches Liebesgeschnulze.

Offenbarungseid der Sonderlichkeiten

Die ersten Minuten, die ersten Lacher. Das Muster bei „Bauer sucht Frau“ ist ewig gleich: Die ganze Sendung ist ein Spott auf die Mittelmäßigkeit der Provinz. Auf die Sorgen der Menschen. Auf deren Ausdrucksweise, Marotten und Schrullen. Das ist infam, und auch gefährlich.

Am größten ist die Freude bei dem Produzenten, wenn die ganzen, normalerweise aus verständlichen Gründen unbeleuchteten Peinlichkeiten des Kennenlernens mit der Lupe seziert werden.

Dann hält die Kamera drauf, als ginge es darum, den Mord an John F. Kennedy aufzuklären. Und ab und zu grinst Moderatorin Inka Bause in die Kamera.

Die kleinen und großen Fehlkommunikationen, die Missverständnisse. Das Offenbaren der eigenen Sonderlichkeiten, in der Hoffnung, der andere möge sie annehmen. Die Schwierigkeiten, sich ins Leben des anderen einzufühlen. All das ist hier ein großer Witz fürs Millionenpublikum.

Peep-Show für die Bessergestellten

So wird das Landleben zur Peep-Show für die Bessergestellten und für jene, die es werden wollen. Da können sich Lasse und Laura aus Prenzlauer Berg genauso wie Jupp und Jutta aus Krefeld in dem wohligen Gefühl ins Fernsehkissen drücken, dass sie in der besseren von zwei möglichen Welten an diesem Abend leben.

Nageldesignerin Christa darf die vollgeschissenen Kälber-Iglus abkärchern. In glänzenden Turnschühchen. Haha.

Der „waschechte Westerwälder“ Uwe trennt sich beim erzwungenen Küchenputzen schweren Herzens von einem, nach eigener Aussage, „jahrzehntealten“ Topflappen. Igitt, hihi.

Eine grantig schauende Bauernmama isst ein Gericht, das ihr die Schwiegertochter in spe zubereitet hat. Hintergrundmusik: „Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod“. Und, oh Wunder: Die ältere Dame ist eigentlich eine ganz liebe Person, bedankt sich, freut sich, macht ein paar ziemlich trockene, gute Witze. Hintergrundmusik: „Here Comes the Sun“. Hoho.

Die ganze Niedertracht der RTL-Fernsehmacher

Überhaupt: Am nervtötendsten ist der Soundtrack.

Mit schmalzigen Liebesliedern, die sich selbst der heißgelaufendste Kuchelrock-Ultra nicht in einer Öffentlichkeit zu spielen trauen würde, die größer ist als die eigene, demente Hauskatze; schunkeltauglichen Unterhaltungsschlagern aus der Wirtschaftswunderzeit mit dem Cool-Faktor von Schnarchpflastern; und amerikanischen Große-Welt-Songs, die einen ironischen Kontrast zu den Misthaufen der deutschen Provinz herstellen.

Hier wird die ganze Niedertracht der Fernsehmacher von RTL offensichtlich. Was für Eltern muss man haben, um anderen Menschen so eine spöttische Inszenierung anzutun?

Als Zuschauer kann solche Fernsehsendungen wegkonsumieren wie eine Tafel Milchschokolade, dafür sind sie ja gemacht.

Doch am Ende bleiben die Kalorien auf der Seele: Ist es wirklich richtig, dabei zuzusehen, wie ganz normale, bisweilen ziemlich liebenswert wirkende Menschen zum Belächelt- und Belachtwerden preisgegeben werden? Sollten wir wirklich dabei zuschauen, wie die deutsche Provinz als Hort der Unzulänglichkeiten dargestellt wird?

Eine bösartige Sendung

Nein, verdammt. „Bauer sucht Frau“ ist eine bösartige Sendung. Sie sorgt dafür, dass ganze Gesellschaftsschichten in Deutschland gegeneinander ausgespielt werden, nur damit RTL und der Bertelsmann-Konzern ihre Gewinnmarge steigern können.

Wenn wir über die Bruchlinien in unserer Gesellschaft sprechen, die derzeit zu immensen politischen Verwerfungen in Deutschland führen, dann fängt die Diagnose an einem beliebigen Abend bei Sendern wie RTL an. Wir haben verlernt, uns gegenseitig zu respektieren. Und das hat auch mit dem öffentlichen Bild zu tun, das von Milieus und Regionen medial produziert wird.

„Bauer sucht Frau“ ist Wahlwerbung für die AfD. Hier wird der Graben ausgeschaufelt, der Menschen in Deutschland trennt, und hinter dem jene Barrikaden errichtet werden, an denen derzeit gekämpft wird. Man kann RTL dafür nicht oft genug kritisieren.

Nach rund einer Woche mit massiven Vorwürfen gegen die Berliner Polizeiakademie hat die Spitze der Hauptstadt-Polizei die Anschuldigungen zurückgewiesen.

In einer von der Opposition beantragten Sondersitzung des Innenausschusses im Abgeordnetenhaus sagte Polizeipräsident Klaus Kandt am Mittwoch, eine Unterwanderung seiner Behörde durch kriminelle Clans sei ausgeschlossen.

Innensenator Andreas Geisel (SPD) bekannte sich ausdrücklich zu Polizisten mit Migrationshintergrund und ihrer Integrität. Er wehre sich dagegen, dass fremdenfeindliche Ressentiments geschürt würden. ""Das werde ich nicht dulden"", sagte der SPD-Politiker. Er stelle sich dagegen, dass Stimmung gegen Migranten in der Polizei gemacht werde.

Nach schweren Vorwürfen zu Missständen an der Berliner Polizeiakademie hatte die Opposition aus FDP, CDU und AfD die Sitzung durchgesetzt.

Seit Tagen tauchen immer neue Vorwürfe zu Verwerfungen an der Ausbildungsstätte für den mittleren Dienst der Hauptstadt-Polizei auf. Demnach sollen dort Polizeischüler mit Migrationshintergrund durch Hass, Lernverweigerung und Gewalt in einer Klasse aufgefallen sein. Die Vorwürfe landeten über Umwege oder anonym bei der Polizeispitze.

Sowohl Geisel als auch Kandt und Vize-Polizeipräsidentin Margarete Koppers zeigten sich entsetzt über die Diskussion und verwahrten sich gegen anonyme Anschuldigungen. «Niemand, der sich hier beschwert, kann etwas belegen», sagte der Polizeipräsident. Die Polizeiführung soll in vier Wochen dem Parlamentsausschuss einen detaillierten Bericht vorlegen.

Chef der Deutschen Polizeigewerkschaft sieht ""deutliche"" Hinweise

Nach Darstellung der Deutschen Polizeigewerkschaft versuchen arabische Großfamilien in Berlin gezielt, Angehörige in den öffentlichen Dienst einzuschleusen. Es gebe ""deutliche Hinweise"" auf einen solchen strategischen Ansatz, sagte der Landesvorsitzende der Gewerkschaft, Bodo Pfalzgraf, am Mittwoch im ZDF-""Morgenmagazin"".

Dazu versuchten sie, ""bestimmte Familienangehörige von Straftaten frei zu halten"", um sie dann im öffentlichen Dienst unterbringen zu können.

Die Polizei hatte eingeräumt, dass es auch Bewerber gibt, bei denen Respekt, Disziplin und Rücksichtnahme nicht ausreichten. Manche beherrschten die deutsche Sprache ungenügend. Es gebe Nachhilfekurse. Einige Polizeianwärter seien zuvor straffällig geworden. An der Schule werden nach Behördenangaben rund 1200 junge Menschen für den mittleren Polizeidienst ausgebildet, 45 Prozent von ihnen haben einen Migrationshintergrund.

Laut Vizepräsidentin Koppers wurden in diesem Jahr 33 Disziplinarverfahren an der Ausbildungsstätte eingeleitet, etwa wegen Täuschung in Prüfungen, Beleidigung, Körperverletzung oder Fernbleiben vom Dienst. Drei Fälle seien abgeschlossen.

""Divine Divane Visioni"": un libro così, sul cinema, non l'avete mai letto. Perché si tratta, come recita il sottotitolo, di una ""Guida non convenzionale al cinema"", edita da Odoya. Filippo Casaccia, l'autore, ha scelto lo pseudonimo di Dziga Cacace: Dziga in onore di Vertov, regista sovietico innovatore, Cacace in omaggio al suo soprannome risalente ai tempi del liceo.

L'effetto dell'accostamento (un nome ricercato, l'altro popolare, quasi a rimarcare lo spirito a metà tra serio e faceto) è ben colto nella prefazione di Gervasini. È lo scrittore stesso, genovese trapiantato a Milano dove lavora come autore televisivo (già per Masterchef e, a oggi, per Le Iene), a spiegarci la genesi della sua attività di critico letterario molto, molto atipico:

""Quello che avete tra le mani è la raccolta dei miei sciagurati pareri su tutto quanto ho visto – al cinema e a casa – tra il 1995 e il 2001. Era tutto nato un po' per gioco, raccontandomi che fosse una cosa utile per la tesi di architettura che stavo progettando assieme alla fraterna amica Hilda. Una certa grafomania e il continuo interscambio con i frequentatori del cineclub dove passavo la maggior parte delle mie serate – il Lumiere di Genova – avevano alimentato la scrittura di questo diario firmato Dziga Cacace che distribuivo, tipo fanzine, tra gli amici: allora avevo meno di trent'anni, ero un capellone munito di Vespa, fumavo, pesavo 80 chili e ancora non avevo capito cosa avrei fatto da grande"".

Questo libro, i cui contenuti sono stati in parte pubblicati sulla webzine Carmilla, potrebbe essere un compagno divertente per i cinefili, ma non solo. È una mappa per chi volesse seguire un percorso filmico speciale, un'educazione sentimentale al grande schermo, il commentario di uno spettatore attento che, nel corso degli anni, ha affinato i gusti e le aspettative e non pretende di essere esaustivo, piuttosto sincero: ""Ho scritto sempre quello che pensavo, senza pretendere di aver ragione: guardiamo tutti i film in modo diverso e il mio è un punto di vista, probabilmente anche sbagliato"".

Sbagliato non lo sappiamo: certo la passione di Cacace per il film è atavica, le sue parole vengono spesso argomentate con attenzione e denotano una grande esperienza, ma anche uno sguardo acuto e una conoscenza che spazia dal mainstream al cinema d'essai. Da ""Cyclo"" al ""Tagliaerbe"", da ""Smoke"" a ""Proposta indecente"", da ""Ombre Rosse"" a ""Io ballo da sola"", fino ai film d'animazione per bambini e così via: la cineteca virtuale, frutto di ore trascorse al Lumière, a casa o altrove con moglie o amici (perché Casaccia ci informa sulle modalità della visione e, spesso, sulla propria predisposizione nei confronti del regista o del cast) è sfaccettata e svincolata da confini di tempo o spazio.

Da Almodóvar a von Trier, da Bertolucci a Tim Burton, da Kitano a Wenders, dalla Campion alla Bigelow, da Coppola a Tinto Brass: i film sono innumerevoli e le pellicole si dispiegano nella loro essenza con rapide pennellate e con giudizi assennati, di cuore, sinceri ma non superficiali, talvolta dissacranti, perfino iconoclasti, taglienti e beffardi anche quando esprimono contrarietà.

Lo stile di Cacace è brioso e sagace, si muove tra intelligenza, leggerezza e ironia e ha il talento di ossequiare tuttavia la profondità di cui ogni arte necessita, riuscendo a strappare un sorriso perfino quando la stroncatura è quasi totale, come nel caso di ""Seven"" che sembra ""il fratello scemo de Il silenzio degli innocenti"" o di ""Scream3"", demolito come irritante e «recitato a livello di spettacolo parrocchiale del basso Piemonte». Ma anche nel bene non si perde di vista il lato esuberante della critica: Cacace adora ""Io e Annie"" di Woody Allen, conferma ""Shrek"" come la più grande fiaba mai raccontata, ma svela che i suoi sceneggiatori ""pigliano per il culo Perrault, Andersen, La Fontaine, Fedro e compagnia bella, sino all'ultimo grande narratore/divulgatore mondiale, quel Disney con le sue versioni edulcorate (tolta la versione nazi di Biancaneve)"".

La competenza dell'autore si evince anche dal suo ricorrere, talvolta, a espressioni tecniche o analisi da professionista inserite con naturalezza nel commento, come nel caso di Eyes Wide Shut: «Steadycam scioltissima, composizione frontale e simmetrica, luci blu e arancio a sottolineare le emozioni dei protagonisti, scenografie perfette, musiche perfette». In altre occasioni, lo spettatore-critico pare preso dallo sconcerto, ma lo ammette candidamente, e comunque instaura sempre con il lettore un filo diretto, tanto che lui gli accorda la propria fiducia e si divora questa guida eterodossa tra stupore, assensi e sorrisi.

Prima di concludere, aggiungo che troverete molte chicche, tra cui una preziosa intervista a Claudio G. Fava, la sopra citata prefazione di Mauro Gervasini, una postfazione di Giorgio Gherarducci (della Gialappa's Band), oltre all'Indice dei film e a un ricchissimo corredo iconografico. Tra le parti più belle annovero anche i resoconti autobiografici, sempre in puro Dziga-style.

Non potrete non volere bene a questo critico fuori dall'ordinario, soprattutto quando vi delizierà con alcuni episodi inediti e spassosissimi (il volo fantozziano a Salerno con il pilota in crisi di personalità mi ha fatto piegare in due dal ridere). Tutto questo, però, mai discinto da una visione lucida e accorata di ciò che accade attorno. E così, poco prima di spanciarci per un folle volo che causerà a Cacace seri danni alle orecchie, ci verrà il magone per quello che, in pochissime righe, lui accenna sui fatti di Genova:

""Il terzo weekend di luglio siamo a Salerno, mentre a Genova avviene un legale massacro al G8 e noi siamo attanagliati dall'angoscia. Mentre giriamo arrivano notizie frammentarie e incontrollate e veniamo continuamente interrotti da telefonate di amici che non sanno dove scappare, picchiati e impauriti. Senso d'impotenza e vergogna per quello che sto facendo mentre accade l'inimmaginabile. La mia generazione in tre giorni è annientata, annichilita, umiliata"".

Alors qu'une enquête vient d'être ouverte au sujet de menaces de mort reçues par la rédaction à la suite de la publication d'une caricature sans équivoque sur Tariq Ramadan, le numéro suivant, en date du 8 novembre fait déjà couler beaucoup d'encre.

Cette fois, l'hebdomadaire satirique se paye un autre titre de presse, Mediapart, toujours à propos des accusations de viol qui pèsent sur Tariq Ramadan. Sur le dessin de Une signé Coco, on voit ainsi Edwy Plenel, le président et fondateur du site d'information, refusant d'entendre, de voir ou de s'exprimer sur le sujet. Une manière de dire que la publication aurait couvert les agissements présumés de l'auteur.

Une caricature qui a provoqué un tollé au sein de la rédaction de Médiapart, poussant même la Société des journalistes à publier un billet de réaction, sobrement intitulé ""À propos de la une de Charlie Hebdo"". D'emblée, le texte revient sur les menaces de mort qui ont été adressées à leurs confrères: ""Ces menaces et ces messages de haine à l'encontre de n'importe quel journal sont inacceptables."" Et d'ajouter que ""la liberté de la presse et la liberté d'expression par les caricatures ne sont pas négociables. C'est le cœur de notre démocratie.""

C'est quelques lignes plus tard que la SDJ répond à la nouvelle Une de Charlie Hebdo. Derrière cette Une, ""il y a une accusation contre Mediapart et, plus personnellement, contre son directeur de publication, Edwy Plenel : celle d'avoir couvert des viols."" Avant de préciser que le site web a enquêté en avril 2016 sur le désormais ex-enseignant d'Oxford.

""Lors de ce travail au long cours, la rédaction n'a jamais eu connaissance de la moindre accusation de harcèlement, d'agression sexuelle, ni de viol"", continue le billet, qui ajoute que Mediapart enquête désormais sur les accusations portées à l'encontre de Tariq Ramadan. Et de conclure: ""La lutte contre les violences sexistes, machistes et sexuelles vaut mieux que les règlements de comptes entre journaux séparés par des désaccords éditoriaux.""

On Tuesday, heir to the throne Prince Charles was identified as the latest high profile person to have allegedly invested millions of pounds in offshore funds and companies. Lewis Hamilton and the Queen have also been named in the mass leak. Here’s a breakdown of the latest stars to have been identified: Madonna:

EMPICS Entertainment Madonna allegedly bought shares in a Bermuda-incorporated company.

The American singer and actress is allegedly listed as having bought 2,000 shares in SafeGard Medical Ltd, a Bermuda-incorporated company in 1998. The company, which produced medical equipment, dissolved in 2013. Nicole Kidman:

Axelle/Bauer-Griffin via Getty Images Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban allegedly registered their joint US-based limited liability company as a foreign entity in the Bahamas in March 2015

The Oscar-winning actress and her husband, Keith Urban, allegedly registered their joint US-based limited liability company as a foreign entity in the Bahamas in March 2015. The Guardian reports that the documents show their aim was to secure “ownership of interests in real property” in the tax haven using a portion of their wealth. Setting up a US-based limited liability company and registering it in the Bahamas meant they would pay a tax rate of 23.8%, compared to potentially 39.6%. A spokesperson for the pair reportedly said the registering of the US company in the Bahamas was solely to comply with local laws and “to hold Bahamian property and protect their family’s privacy. The company is taxed under US law and no special tax advantages accrue to them or the company. They are taxed as if they owned the property directly.” Justin Timberlake:

Doug Peters/EMPICS Entertainment Justin Timberlake set up a company to purchase real estate in the Bahamas

Singer and actor Justin Timberlake set up a company in August 2015 with the purpose to “engage in the purchase of real estate” in the Bahamas, according to reports. Four months after setting it up, Timberlake moved to register the entity as a foreign company in the Bahamas. The Guardian reports that documents show that a month before the holding was set up, a separate entity called Nexus Luxury Collection Ltd was incorporated in the Bahamas as an “international business company”. According to Nexus Luxury Collection website, Timberlake is is backed by Timberlake, Tiger Woods and financier Joe Lewis. Harvey Weinstein:

Harvey Weinstein, who is facing a raft of allegations of sexual harassment, reportedly invested in a now-defunct Bermuda-based medical venture capital firm more than a decade ago. In November 2001, Weinstein allegedly took out 2,000 shares in Scientia Health Group Ltd. Scientia has since gone out of business, but it is not known whether Weinstein sold his stake before this happened. Shakira:

Ruben Sprich / Reuters Shakira allegedly holds a substantial portion of her earnings offshore.

Colombian singer, Shakira, allegedly features in the Paradise Papers and is listed as a resident of the Bahamas, despite living in Barcelona. It is also believed that she is the sole shareholder of Tournesol Ltd, a Malta company with €3 million in share capital. The smallest member state in the EU, Malta has faced accusations that it operates as a tax haven. The Paradise Papers leak allegedly reveal that in 2009 Shakira’s “musical assets, intellectual property rights and trademarks” were moved to Tournesol. A lawyer representing the singer told the consortium of journalists working on the Paradise Papers that Tournesol Ltd “fulfils all legal requirements. All of the corresponding information relative to this entity is public and transparent.” Responding to the accusation that Shakira’s listed residence is in the Bahamas, her lawyer said that as an international artist Shakira had lived in a variety of places “throughout her professional career and, in every case, has fully met the laws of all the jurisdictions where she has resided”.

""You drive in, we come to you; we hand you a ballot paper [and] mark you off the roll, you put it in these portable ballot boxes and then they get added to the count,"" he said.

Drive-through polling booths have not been trialled in Queensland before, but Mr Tiernan said community reaction to the idea so far had been good.

""So far we’ve done very little promotion, but there's a lot of excitement, we’re getting a lot of calls at the call centre about it, and a lot of the elderly groups are quite interested in it.""

The commission has also produced a Queensland voting guide in the 27 most commonly spoken languages in the state, Mr Tiernan said, including information on how optional preferential voting worked for recent migrants.

""It’s just a one page voting in Queensland, a little introduction on what should I do at the polling booth - we've translated that into 26 languages.""

Mr Tiernan told ABC Radio Brisbane other initiatives to assist voters on November 25 included an e-assist kiosk at Coorparoo for people who were blind or had low vision.

“That's basically a pre-record, and people with low vision listen to all the candidates and they choose in their particular order.""

Telephone voting would be enabled for those who could not get to a booth.

There were 3.17 million Queenslanders on the electoral roll, a number Mr Tiernan said was boosted by the same-sex marriage survey and a rush from when the election was called and before the roll closed on Friday.

“Just in a six-day period, 4700 people added themselves to the electoral roll, and over 16,500 updated their details, which is wonderful,” he said.

For those worried about polling day clashing with day three of the first Ashes test, Mr Tiernan said it was best to vote early, as queues at polling booths at the Gabba were expected to be long.

“If you are going to the cricket that day ... vote on the way,” he said.

“If you do decide to vote during the cricket and if there is a queue, you're going to miss cricket.

“You've got two weeks of pre-poll, so vote then ... plenty of opportunities to not get into trouble on Ashes day.”",Would you like a democracy sausage with that?

Vor seiner Hochzeit dachte er, er wisse schon alles über Sex

Erst nach und nach hat er gelernt, was guten Sex wirklich ausmacht

Ich bin 41 Jahre alt und schon seit fast zwei Jahrzehnten mit der gleichen, wunderschönen Frau verheiratet. Über die Jahre hinweg musste ich mich mit einigen Mythen und Irrtümern über Sex auseinandersetzen.

Die meisten dieser falschen Vorstellungen hatte ich schon, bevor ich verheiratet war und es hat Jahre gedauert, bis sie sich aufgelöst haben. Wenn ich zehn Tipps für guten Sex an mein unverheiratetes Ich schicken könnte, wären das diese:

1. Sex läuft nicht wie im Fernsehen oder in Filmen ab

Das meiste, was du über Sex weißt, kommt aus der Werbung, aus dem Fernsehen oder aus Filmen.

Anders ausgedrückt: Sex sieht aus wie spontanes, makelloses Liebemachen, voller Romantik - Marvin Gaye läuft und Kerzen sind auf dem Fensterbrett drapiert.

Sexuelle Intimität funktioniert in einer Ehe definitiv NICHT so. Im seltensten Fall läuft Marvin Gaye.

Aber sei nicht enttäuscht: Sex in der Ehe ist anders als im Film, aber es ist auch viel besser.

2. Eine Randnotiz zur Häufigkeit - bereite dich darauf vor

Im Moment denkst du noch, dass man in einer Ehe ständig Sex haben wird, so gut wie jede Sekunde am Tag und tausendmal in der Woche - denn, warum denn auch nicht!?

Lebe diesen Traum, so lange du kannst und reite dein getreues Einhorn in den Süßigkeiten-bedeckten Sonnenuntergang, wo du dann deinen wilden Ewok streicheln kannst und über die Brücke nach Terabithia gehst.

Glaub an deinen Traum. So lange du kannst. Das ist alles.

Sexuelle Intimität ist etwas, in dem du immer besser werden wirst. Es braucht Kommunikation, Übung und Zeit.

Im Moment denkst du, dein Sex-IQ ist auf dem Level eines Genies, aber du würdest in einer Sex-Abschlussprüfung komplett versagen mit dem, was du weißt.

4. Sex ist nicht nur ""bekommen"", sondern auch ""geben""

Es ist tatsächlich schön, dem anderen etwas zu geben. Sei nicht die ganze Zeit über ein ""Nehmer"".

Sexuelle Intimität ist wunderbar, um Verzicht und Anstrengung zu vereinen. Wenn du das jetzt in deinen Kopf bekommst, wird das ""bekommen"" nur noch besser.

Im ""geben"" liegt eine unfassbare Schönheit und viele Geheimnisse. Sei großzügig.

5. Männer und Frauen denken nicht auf die gleiche Art über Sex

Für dich ist Sex körperliche Anziehung und es ist sehr visuell und augenblicklich.

Vielleicht ist es besser, wenn du dich jetzt erst mal setzt: Frauen empfinden Sex als Teil einer Beziehung, als Sicherheit und als Anzeichen, wie sehr sie geliebt und verlangt werden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Sex-Experten raten: Diese 9 Dinge solltet ihr mit eurem Partner viel öfter machen

Für dich ist Sex wie ein Lichtschalter ohne Dimmer. Du bist sowas von bereit, jederzeit (außer du schläfst... aber das muss dann schon eine Todesschlaf sein).

Für sie ist Sex wie ein Schmorbraten, der viel Zeit braucht, um zu köcheln.

Das wird euch beide sehr frustrieren. Aber das ist ok. Das bringt euch näher zusammen, auf einer viel tieferen Ebene.

6. Sex macht dein Leben nicht vollkommen

Momentan legst du wahnsinnig viel Wert auf Sex. Lass uns ehrlich sein: Du denkst ständig daran.

Du sollst wissen, sexuelle Intimität ist fantastisch und sehr befriedigend und unglaublich auf die schönsten Art und Weisen - aber es darf kein Götzenbild sein. Es ist ein Geschenk, das man in der Ehe genießen sollte.

7. Sex kann Spaß machen, lustig und verspielt sein

Es gibt so viele Blickwinkel, was sexuelle Intimität betrifft und die meisten davon sind dir jetzt noch nicht bewusst. Du denkst zu eindimensional über Sex.

Sexuelle Intimität ist auch Verletzlichkeit und Authentizität und wenn du jemanden wirklich liebst, hast du nichts zu verstecken - und ich meine wirklich nichts.

Du kannst dein ehrlichstes Ich sein.

8. Sie zu verführen ist wie eine legale Sexdroge für ihre Seele

Ich habe es vorhin schon angedeutet, aber das ist wahrscheinlich das beste Geheimnis, dass ich dir mit auf den Weg geben kann: Verführe sie.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Diese Paare haben mit dem Sex bis zur Hochzeit gewartet - jetzt verraten sie, ob es sich gelohnt hat

Zeig ihr, dass du sie nicht nur körperlich willst. Verführe ihren Geist. Verführe ihr Herz. Verführe sie auf jede mögliche Weise.

Denk daran, sie denkt nicht so an Sex, wie du es tust - du bist Haut und Haar und sie ist Herz und Seele.

9. Es ist geheimnisvoller als du denkst

Und noch mal: Gerade sind deine Ansichten über Sex ziemlich simpel.

Es ist schwer zu erklären und ich verstehe es auch heute noch nicht so ganz, aber es passiert etwas Magisches, wenn zwei Menschen Sex haben. Es ist etwas fast Kosmisches, das zwei Seelen aneinander bindet,

10. Sex in der Ehe ist eine Art der Verehrung

Wenn ich sage Sex ist Verehrung, denkst du wahrscheinlich, ich bin verrückt. Aber es ist wahr.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 8 Angewohnheiten von Paaren, die ein erfülltes Sexleben haben

Der Akt ist eine Art der Verehrung, schlicht und einfach. Es ist wie alte Lieder singen, nur mit Körpern. Okay, das hat sich jetzt unheimlich angehört. Lass es uns einfach Verehrung nennen.

Ich hoffe wirklich, dass du dir diese Gedanken zu Herzen nimmst. Denn letzten Endes ist Sex in der Ehe noch viel schöner, als du es dir vorstellen kannst.

8일 도널드 트럼프 미국 대통령의 국회 연설은 1993년 7월10일 빌 클린턴 대통령에 이어 24년여만이다.

Was die Ereignisse, die sich heute vor 100 Jahren in Russland zugetragen haben, und die noch fälschlich als ""Oktoberrevolution"" bezeichnet werden, wirklich bedeuten, wird bis heute von der offiziellen Geschichtsschreibung ignoriert. Und in den Medien verfälscht.

Der staatliche TV-Sender Rossija 1 hat dem 7. November 1917 (nach dem damals gültigen Kalender der 25. Oktober 1917) eine ganze Talkshow gewidmet. Dort sagte der Chef der Kommunistischen Partei, Gennadij Sjuganow: ""Die Geschichte kennt keinen Konjunktiv. Was passiert ist, ist passiert.""

Aber das stimmt nicht.

Wenn man uns verbieten will, darüber nachzudenken, was ohne Lenins Putsch passiert wäre, dann ist das klare Zensur. Und auch eine Rechtfertigung für die Verbrechen in unserer Vergangenheit.

Russland hätte sich nicht in den ersten Weltkrieg einmischen sollen, sagte der Chef-Kommunist. Dabei war es Deutschland, das Russland den Krieg erklärte. Und zwar auch deshalb, weil die Deutschen davon ausgingen, dass unser Land sich zu einem Wirtschafts-Riesen entwickeln und zu groß und zu stark werden würde.

Aber gehen wir noch weiter.

Die neue Regierung wollte sich auf die Bürger berufen

Hunderte Jahre hielt man die Macht - die Zarenkrone - für gottgegeben.

Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts ließ der Glauben an Gott nach.

Die Februar-Revolution 1917 - der Sturz des Zaren - war deshalb zeitgemäß.

Die neue Regierung wollte sich nicht mehr auf Gott berufen, sondern auf ihre Bürger.

Deshalb hatte sie für November 1917 Wahlen ausgerufen.

Gleichzeitig setzte die Provisorische Regierung unter Alexander Kerenski den Krieg fort. An der Front schaffte sie erstaunliche Erfolge.

Dann kam Lenin und die Revolution

Wladimir Uljanow, der sich Lenin nannte, hatte zur gleichen Zeit nur ein einziges Ziel: An die Macht zu kommen. Und er wusste: Dazu musste Russland erst den Krieg verlieren, denn ein Sieg hätte Kerenski zum Helden gemacht.

Russlands Position im Krieg verbesserte sich rasch. Tschechen, Slowaken und Kroaten wollten nicht mehr weiter gegen Russland kämpfen, wo es jetzt keinen Zaren mehr gab, und Wien signalisierte notgedrungen Verhandlungsbereitschaft.

Als Berlin erfuhr, dass der eigene Bündnisgenosse abtrünnig werden könnte, wandte es sich an einen alten Freund, der von Deutschland bezahlt wurde - Wladimir Uljanow alias Lenin.

Der befahl seinen Leuten, unverzüglich die Minister der Provisorischen Regierung festzunehmen - am 25. Oktober (7. November): ""Jede Verzögerung wäre gleichbedeutend mit dem Tod"", war damals die Parole. Einen Tag später wäre der Frieden mit Österreich unterzeichnet worden.

Massenterror gegen das eigene Volk

Am 26. Oktober erließ Lenin sein ""Dekret für den Frieden"" - also die Kapitulation Russlands.

Der angebliche ""2. Kongress der Volksdeputierten"" - in Wirklichkeit nur eine Versammlung von Abgeordneten aus den wenigen Regionen, in denen Lenins Leute wirklich eine Mehrheit hatten - ""ernannte"" eine bolschewistische Regierung.

► Bei den Wahlen zur Verfassungsgebenden Versammlung, die diese ausrief, erhielt Lenins Partei im November 1917 nicht mal ein Viertel der Stimmen.

Im Dezember schaffen die Kommunisten hastig die WTscheKa, eine Vorgänger-Organisation des KGB, die Massenterror gegen das eigene Volk betrieb.

Lenins Kämpfer schossen auf Demonstranten

Am 18. Januar 1918 traf sich ein Teil der gewählten Abgeordneten zur verfassungsgebenden Versammlung.

Als diese die Erlasse der Sowjets für illegal erklärte, wurde sie aufgelöst. In der gleichen Nacht ließ Lenin seine Kämpfer mit Maschinengewehren auf Demonstranten schießen, die auf die Straße gingen, um ihre legitim gewählten Abgeordneten zu verteidigen. Mehr als hundert Menschen starben.

Lenins Mitstreiter Bucharin rief den Bürgerkrieg aus. Die bolschewistische Regierung hatte keine Legitimität. Sie kämpfte ausschließlich für die Interessen ihrer Anführer. Sie hatte keine soziale Basis, weder im alten noch im neuen Russland.

""Diktatur des Proletariates""

Selbst die russischen Marxisten wie Plechanow und Martow erkannten die so genannte Revolution, die in Wirklichkeit ein Putsch war, nicht an. Deshalb mussten Lenin und seine Anhänger sich von der ganzen tausendjährigen Geschichte Russlands lossagen.

Die nationale Symbolik - das Wappen, die Hymne, die Flagge, der Staatsnamen - alles wurde abgeschafft. Stattdessen schuf man die so genannte ""UdSSR"". An Stelle der demokratischen Republik, die sich gerade aus dem konstitutionellen Monarchie entwickelt hatte, trat eine ""Diktatur des Proletariates"".

Schon am 20. November 1917 erklärten die Bolschewiken das gesamte bestehende Recht für ungültig. Alle Gesetze verloren ihre Wirkung, die Gerichte und Staatsanwaltschaften wurden aufgelöst. Ganz offen wurde erklärt, dass die neue Regierung das Völkerrecht nicht anerkennt.

► Auch der bestehenden Moral wurde der Kampf angesagt. Ebenso wie der Kirche.

Der radikale Bruch wird heute ignoriert

Lenins ""Plan der monumentalen Propaganda"" sollte die Erinnerung an alles auslöschen, was mit dem alten Russland zu tun hatte. Denkmäler wurden zerstört, Ortsnamen geändert, ebenso der Kalender und die Rechtschreibung.

1921 wurden alle humanitären Fakultäten der russischen Universitäten geschlossen. Erst Jahrzehnte später wurde das Studium von Geschichte, Soziologie, Recht und Philosophie wieder möglich.

Dieser radikale Bruch durch die Bolschewiki wird heute von der russischen Politik - und deshalb auch der Geschichtsforschung und in den Schulbüchern - ignoriert.

""UdSSR und Russland - Mörder und Mordopfer""

Ein derartiger völliger historischer Bruch ist in der Geschichte selten, aber nicht einmalig. Das sowjetische und postsowjetische Regime hat in etwa so viel gemeinsam mit dem historischen Russland wie die Bundesrepublik mit dem Dritten Reich. ""Die UdSSR und Russland - das ist Mörder und Mordopfer"", schrieb Solschenizyn.

Statt der russischen Idee riefen die Bolschewisten die sowjetische Idee aus: Soziale Gerechtigkeit, Verzicht auf Ausbeutung, freie Entwicklung des Individuums, usw.

► Doch diese lauten Parolen waren nur ein Vorhang, mit dem die schreckliche sowjetische Realität verdeckt wurde.

In der Sowjetunion herrschte totale Zensur, die Grenzen waren geschlossen, die Menschen wurden maximal ausgebeutet, die Wirtschaft war rückständig, es herrscht Mangel selbst an Waren des täglichen Bedarfs, Hunger, Armut, ein katastrophaler Niedergang der Landwirtschaft und vieles mehr.

Es ist deshalb kein Wunder, dass die gesamte Geschichte der Sowjetunion auch eine Geschichte des Widerstands der einfachen Menschen gegen dieses System ist - und zugleich des Kampfes dieses Systems gegen die eigenen Menschen.

Russland hatte den Anspruch, eine Weltmacht zu sein

Bolschewismus - das sind drei künstlich erzeugte Hunger-Katastrophen, GULAG - ""ein Auschwitz ohne Krematorium"" - der ""rote Terror"" und der ""große Terror"", die Deportation von sechs Millionen Menschen.

Russland schritt in das 20. Jahrhundert mit dem Anspruch, eine führende Weltmacht zu sein. Es beendete das Jahrhundert mit dem Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion.

In 70 Jahren Kommunismus hat Russland 5,5 Millionen Quadratkilometer Landfläche verloren - das ist zehnmal so viel wie das Territorium Frankreichs. 1917 lebten in Russland 186 Millionen Menschen, heute sind es 143 Millionen.

Fast alle Opfer von Stalins Terror gegen das eigene Volk sind, still und leise, offiziell rehabilitiert.

► Das bedeutet, dass Lenin und Stalin einen Völkermord an ihrem eigenen Volk begangen haben.

Wir brauchen eine intellektuelle moralische Erneuerung

Was kann man dazu noch sagen? Um aus der 100-jährigen Sackgasse herauszukommen, in die Russland heute vor 100 Jahren eingebogen ist, brauchen wir eine gigantische intellektuelle moralische Erneuerung.

Nur, wenn wir uns von dem tief sitzenden Erbe und Denken aus der Sowjetzeit lossagen, das Geschehene juristisch aufarbeiten und endlich Vergangenheitsbewältigung beginnen, wenn wir an das alte Russland anknüpfen, und dessen Erbe reformieren und modernisieren, wenn wir uns dabei die Erfahrung der europäischen Demokratien zu Herzen nehmen, nur dann haben wir eine Chance, die russische Zivilisation wiederauferstehen zu lassen.

Nur so können wir uns aus der Rolle des Aussätzigen befreien, in die wir uns selbst manövriert haben. Und einen würdigen Platz in der Geschichte der Menschheit einzunehmen.

The reason for that, of course, is surging demand among (almost exclusively) men who have been accused of taking part in some terrible work-related behaviour.

From the plainly awful to the truly ridiculous, these men are providing example after example of how not to say sorry.

Interested in botching your own public apology? Take your cue from the pros and follow these five easy steps.

1. Go on the attack

Maybe you're prepared to at least partly concede to allegations in your apology. That's great. But don't let that fact get in the way of the real issue here: the people — and the media — who are taking you to task for the actions you're accused of are the ones who are truly awful!

Every bad apology must include a full-on swipe at those who brought your alleged misdeeds to light. Tech entrepreneur and blogger Robert Scoble nailed it recently in his apology for an alleged history of sexual harassment.

2. The form-letter approach

Another effective way to screw up an apology is to focus on speed and efficiency above all else. No one will be able to accuse you of meaningful contrition, and you can tell everyone you checked the sorry box. This is the approach actor Ben Affleck took when, initially responding to allegations that he groped actress Hilarie Burton, he tweeted a brief, just-the-facts statement.

Most impressive, he did it without even coming close to breaking the max character count. No wasted space here from Affleck: ""I did it, and I'm sorry."" He was in such a rush he even forgot to put a period at the end of the thing!

In a recent interview, Affleck added to the apology — sort of — when he said he wanted to be ""part of the solution"" in light of the many incidents of alleged sexual harassment flooding the media.

3. Use coded language

If you're going to really botch the apology, it's important to convey to people just how grudgingly you are making it in the first place. One way to do this effectively? Attach a bunch of conditional language to your apology – those little winks and nudges that help people understand what you really mean — or don't mean! — without having to spell it out.

Notice Kevin Spacey's skillful inclusion of the words ""would have"" and ""drunken"" in his apology to helpfully distance himself from any sense of responsibility when he responded to recent allegations of improper conduct made by actor Anthony Rapp.

4.Congratulate yourself

U.S. journalist and political commentator Mark Halperin risked issuing a rather decent apology. But he was able to turn things around and make real sorry mess out of it in the end. How? By assuring his audience that his alleged incidents of harassment are, regardless of the facts, firmly behind him now and that he has reinvented himself as a much better person.

5. Minimize individual wrongdoing

Finally, a key way to make a bad apology is to hide behind the fact that you're not the only one who may have engaged in wrongdoing. After all, how much of a bad apple can you really be if the entire bushel could be rotten? It's also a neat way to hide a resignation, as was the case with Sir Michael Fallon, who recently stepped down as U.K. Defence Secretary, amid allegations of misconduct.

""A number of allegations have surfaced about MPs in recent days, including some about my previous conduct,"" he wrote in a letter obtained by New Statesman.

""Many of these have been false but I accept that in the past I have fallen below the high standards that we require of the Armed Forces that I have the honour to represent. I have reflected on my position and I am therefore resigning as Defence Secretary.""

Of course, you can simply skip all this and not issue any apology whatsoever. In that case, you get to just sit back and let everyone else own the story and define what did and did not happen.

With so may examples of bad apologies, however, it won't take much effort to take a few minutes and craft one of your own. If these men could find the time, so can you.

SÉRIES - La suite de la série ""Westworld"" se fait désirer. La création HBO, qui a connue un succès phénoménal lors de la diffusion de sa première saison en 2016, est attendue comme un messie télévisuel. D'autant plus que le dernier épisode a laissé les téléspectateurs sur leur faim. Mais voilà (enfin) une information sur la saison 2!

Dans un élan de bonté, Evan Rachel Wood, qui campe le personnage de Dolores dans la série, a donné quelque chose à se mettre sous la dent aux fans de cette fiction qui plonge les spectateurs dans un parc à thème Western peuplé de robots. Sur Twitter, l'actrice a répondu à une téléspectatrice désespérée qui lui demandait la date du retour sur petits écrans de ""Westworld"".

""Printemps 2018""

C'est encore un peu vague, mais c'est mieux que rien!

Le tournage de cette nouvelle saison a commencé en juin 2017, comme l'avait à nouveau laissé entendre Evan Rachel Wood en postant, sur Instagram, une photo du corset qu'elle porte lorsqu'elle interprète Dolores.

Corset training has started again. Which can only mean one thing. A certain TV show is starting again very soon.... 👗🐎🌵⌨️🤖👁🏜 Une publication partagée par Evan Rachel Wood (@evanrachelwood) le 7 Juin 2017 à 9h43 PDT

Par ailleurs, le vendredi 3 novembre, quelques jours avant la révélation d'Evan Rachel Wood, la production de la série annonçait que le tournage avait dû être suspendu suite à une urgence médicale qui concernait le comédien Zahn McClarnon (""Longmire"", ""Fargo"", ""The Son""), qui est annoncé comme l'un des nouveaux personnages récurrents de cette nouvelle saison. Cependant, HBO a rapidement rassuré les fans en annonçant, quelques heures plus tard, que l'acteur allait bien et qu'il était en voie de guérison.

Pour faire patienter les téléspectateurs, HBO avait diffusé fin juillet, à l'occasion du Comic Con de San Diego, un premier trailer très intriguant. Cette nouvelle saison promet d'être sanglante mais aussi ambitieuse dans sa mise en scène et son esthétisme.

During the research, conducted by Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg , 43 patients with “severe” or “moderately severe” depression underwent an art therapy course.

Art therapy has a “clear effect” on severe depression, helping some people to get back to work after time off, new research suggests.

According to the researchers the majority of the participants were so affected by their depression that they were unable to work at the start of the study.

The individual art therapy took place in psychiatry or primary care and was conducted by a specially trained therapist.

Each session began with a short briefing and a relaxation exercise. After that participants created artwork with crayons and water colours.

“The materials were simple, allowing people to doodle and feel free to express themselves the way they wanted to, and then they would talk about the picture and its significance,” Christina Blomdahl, PhD at the institute of health and care sciences and licensed occupational therapist and art therapist, explained.

After 10 hour-long treatment sessions the patients had improved on an average of almost five steps on a rating scale used for depression.

Blomdah said this represents a large leap that entails a “considerable” change to everyday life, and sometimes it may also mean that a patient is able to return to work.

Anxiety, sleep, ability to take initiative and emotional involvement are some of the factors that are assessed. In the control group that had not undergone art therapy there was no definite change.

“The conclusion is that it was the art therapy that facilitated their improvement,” Blomdah said.

“Painting pictures based on themes and discussing the pictures with the therapist promotes self-reflection and brain stimulation that takes place outside of the conscious mind.”

Although Blomdahl’s study was based on adults, Mary­-Rose Brady, director of operations at the British Association of Art Therapists, previously told HuffPost UK art therapy can be particulalry useful for children struggling with mental ill health.

“We know that children who can’t understand or name their feelings are more likely to ‘act them out’, so art therapy can provide relief to a child whose only previous option was to dissolve into tears or have an angry outburst in response to overwhelming feelings,” she said.

“Art materials enable children to externalise troubling or confusing emotions, giving them form and enabling them to make links between thoughts, feelings and behaviours, perhaps for the first time.”

Debbie Thwaites, founder of art therapy charity Shine Again, explained how this works.

“One young boy I saw just wanted to paint poo,” she said.

“He wasn’t able to say ‘this person is making me feel like poo’, but he was able to get all the brown and black colours out, make a big mess and say ‘that’s what I feel like’.”

Based on the recent findings, Blomdahl hopes that art therapy will be used more extensively in healthcare.

“Based on evidence requirements it has been more or less scrapped by psychiatry, but this is one of the largest studies that has been conducted in this area,” she said.

“It is a step that may lead to more people being trained in it and the method being used again.”","Art Therapy Has 'Clear Effect' On Severe Depression, Research Finds",http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/art-therapy-has-clear-effect-on-severe-depression-research-finds_uk_5a0182abe4b066c2c039ee66

Bei den Jamaika-Verhandlern herrscht dicke Luft

Zwar machen die Grünen Kompromissangebote

Aus der CSU werden die aber harsch zurückgewiesen

Die Grünen strecken die Hand in Richtung FDP und Union aus. Doch gedankt wird es ihnen nicht.

Unmittelbar nach einem Angebot der Grünen, im Rahmen einer Einigung auf den bislang angestrebten festen Endtermin für Neuzulassungen von Verbrennungsmotoren zu verzichten, gab sich der CSU-Landesgruppenchef Alexander Dobrindt hart in der Sache und besonders rüde im Ton, berichtet die ""Süddeutschen Zeitung"".

Dobrindt sagte der ""SZ"": ""Wenn man Schwachsinnstermine abräumt, dann ist das ja noch kein Kompromiss.""

Seehofer hatte zuvor moderate Töne angeschlagen

Deutlicher kann man das Annäherungsangebot eines Gesprächspartners kaum ausschlagen. Dobrindts aggressive Haltung ist besonders bemerkenswert angesichts der Tatsache, dass sich der CSU-Vorsitzende Horst Seehofer bislang betont anders verhalten hat.

Auch am Dienstagmorgen schlug er moderate Töne an. Er sagte der ""SZ"", der Schritt der Grünen sei ""auf jeden Fall förderlich"". Eine Koalition bestehe immer aus einem Interessenausgleich, entsprechend sei der Start zur zweiten Runde ""sehr ansprechend und verheißungsvoll"".

Nur Stunden zuvor hatte Grünen-Chef Cem Özdemir in einem Zeitungsinterview angeboten, den festen Termin 2030 aufzugeben, sollten sich Union, FDP und Grüne in den Grundzügen in die richtige Richtung bewegen.

Grünen rücken von Maximalforderung ab

Der Stuttgarter Zeitung sagte Özdemir: ""Mir ist klar, dass wir alleine nicht das Enddatum 2030 für die Zulassung von fossilen Verbrennungsmotoren durchsetzen werden können.""

Statt des konkreten Datums für den Ausstieg verlangt die Umweltpartei nur noch ""ein klares Bekenntnis, dass wir alles dafür tun, um die Fahrzeuge der Zukunft - vernetzt, automatisiert und emissionsfrei - zu bekommen"".

Nach Informationen der ""SZ"" ist das keineswegs ein Alleingang Özdemirs, sondern in der großen Koordinierungsrunde seiner Partei vorab so besprochen worden.

Auch deshalb kritisierte der Grünen-Abgeordnete Dieter Janecek das Verhalten Dobrindts. Janecek twitterte: ""Solche Polemik ist nur Ausdruck der eigenen Verunsicherung der CSU. Die Menschen werden genau registrieren, wer glaubhaft um Lösungen ringt.""

While it might feel like the world is just doing this to you for fun there are in fact a whole range of strange and unexpected obstacles that could be stopping your WiFi from working. In a survey of 2,000 people, Post Office Telecoms it found that over half of us are placing our routers right next to a object that could be causing interference and in turn slowing down our WiFi. Here are just some of the objects that could be affecting your WiFi: TVs, or any electrical appliance That’s right. While many of us set up our routers right alongside our TVs for convenience, it’s actually one of the worst places to put one. Your TV, games console, set-top box are all giving off electrical signals and it’s these that can drastically interfere with a routers ability to send out a strong WiFi signal.

Fish tanks Your heard us. A fish tank is actually a double-whammy of bad WiFi because not only do you have the electrical circuits powering the tank but then the enormous body of water that’s absorbing the signal being given out by the router. Walls This sounds like a no-brainer but looking at the layout of your house and working out where walls could block your router’s signal could make all the difference. Almost a quarter of those asked in the survey have admitted to putting their router by a window (bad), shared wall (worse) or even at the top of their house (just no).

Le cancer du col de l'utérus est le troisième cancer le plus courant chez les femmes.

Pour ces travaux, les auteurs ont analysé les données de 16 études effectuées avec plus de 12.000 femmes à travers le monde.

Les chercheurs n'ont pas établi avec certitude pourquoi le stérilet réduit autant le risque de tumeur du col de l'utérus. Mais ils citent la possibilité que ce contraceptif stimule une réponse du système immunitaire qui aiderait à combattre des infections responsables du cancer provoquées par des papillomavirus humains.

Plus de recherches doivent toutefois être menées pour comprendre le mécanisme biologique qui procure cette protection.

Des résultats prometteurs pour les pays en voie de développement

De ce fait, il est prématuré, selon les experts, de recommander à un plus grand nombre de femmes d'utiliser ce dispositif intra-utérin.

Les études sur lesquelles se basent ces travaux ont été réalisées avant que les vaccins contre le papillomavirus humains ne soient disponibles, rappelle pour sa part The Guardian. Ses résultats seraient donc plus pertinents parmi les populations de moins de 30 ans non vaccinées, en particuliers dans les pays en développement où ""un nombre impressionnant"" de femmes sont concernées, souligne Victoria Cortessis.

La fréquence du cancer du col de l'utérus augmente dans le monde. Quelque 528.000 femmes ont reçu ce diagnostic en 2012 et 266.000 en sont mortes cette même année, selon l'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS).

D'ici 2035, plus de 756.000 femmes pourraient être atteintes de ce cancer et 416.000 en décéder, indiquent les projections de l'OMS.

Bringing the perspectives of citizens, including the most marginalized, into health policy processes remains a challenge. Doing so requires great effort and patience, and it can be a long and difficult road, but one that will lead to transformative change as well as bring health for all.

First of all, what is health for all? In simple words, it means to bring health and well-being to everyone regardless of where they live, and which ethnicity, group, caste or social status they belong to. Health and well-being is not only about having health care services available, but is about ensuring that all people lead a socially and economically productive life. Health for all is an aspiration.

Policy debates in the past have often revolved around the supply side of health care, and the availability of health care facilities. For example, this is reflected in the emphasis of international efforts on increasing the number of health care facilities, along with a focus on childbirth at the facilities. While this has certainly improved health outcomes (such as higher immunization coverage and reduced child and maternal mortality), there has been relatively less focus, and as a result less progress worldwide, on improvements to access and quality of health care. This is particularly true for the marginalized.

I have seen this firsthand. With the IDRC's research award, I spent four months in a rural community of Nepal studying needs of women. One of the questions I had planned to ask pregnant women I would interview was: why don't you go the health facility for prenatal care during pregnancy, since the service is available? During the fieldwork however, after hiking for 3 hours to get to a community, I could no longer ask this question to a 17-year-old in her third trimester. How could I expect her to walk 6 hours, up and down the hill, to access the health facility? During my stay in the community, it became clear to me that not all the knowledge on local context (such as how community members access health care, and their experience with and expectations of the quality of these services) is known to those of us, researchers, who do not live there. Such knowledge can be understood and shared by engaging those community members. A three year study done in Nepal, for example, found that the maternal mortality ratio decreased significantly and women were more likely to have prenatal care where citizens were engaged in the project planning and intervention processes.

""The people have the right and duty to participate individually and collectively in the planning and implementation of their health care"" The Alma Ata Declaration 1978

Citizen engagement & community empowerment

The importance of citizen engagement and community empowerment in policy processes and development projects has been widely discussed by academics. Educators, economists, scholars and activists such as Paulo Freire, Amartya Sen, Gita Sen, Robert Chambers, Lawrence W Green have argued for many years that development and health policies thrive with community-driven approaches and local empowerment. Along with the theoretical work, there is ample evidence to suggest that engaging citizens in decision-making processes improve population health. Involving citizens in discussing root causes of health issues and deriving solutions that speak to them and their social determinants is essential, and it works.

Given the extensive evidence and experience now available, I believe it is now time to listen, reflect, act, and turn development on its head to construct development from the bottom up. The aid world, which plays a pivotal role in achieving health for all,needs to stop working for the poor and marginalized and work with them. The processes must provide space for citizens to lead and not take over their lives and their ability to make decisions.

The global goals to achieve health for all

A study undertaken by the Participate Initiative, with evidence from 84 participatory studies on progress toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), finds that the most marginalized are often not reached by development projects. With the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at hand, the opportunity is ripe to build structures that ensure inclusive decision-making processes and move forward with community engagement. The SDGs, which embraced an inclusive process of goal setting, present an opportunity to radically transform conventional public policy processes. Such transformations can provide space for citizens to exercise their power to shape the decisions that affect their health and well-being.

""Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels"" SDG 16 target 16.7

Citizens can identify the root causes of health problems and barriers to health care access. When they participate in research and discussions and contribute in generating evidence and solutions, this leads us closer to attaining health for all, and in understanding the mechanisms for how to get there.

SITTWE, Myanmar - Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, on Thursday urged people ""not to quarrel"" as she visited Rakhine State for the first time since a military crackdown that drove more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee the country.

Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, has faced heavy international criticism for not taking a higher profile in responding to what U.N. officials have called ""ethnic cleansing"" by the army.

Myanmar has rejected the accusations of ethnic cleansing, saying its security forces launched a counter-insurgency operation after Rohingya militants attacked 30 security posts in northern Rakhine on Aug. 25.

On Thursday, amid heightened security, Suu Kyi boarded a military helicopter at Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State, to be taken to Maungdaw, one of the districts worst hit by the violence.

Suu Kyi met a group of Muslim religious leaders, said Chris Lewa, of the Arakan Project monitoring group, citing Rohingya sources.

""She only said three things to the people - they should live peacefully, the government is there to help them, and they should not quarrel among each other.""

""She only said three things to the people - they should live peacefully, the government is there to help them, and they should not quarrel among each other,"" Lewa said, quoting information from a religious leader who was present.

Rohingya began fleeing predominantly Buddhist Myanmar for neighbouring Bangladesh in late August to escape violence in the wake of a military counter-insurgency operation launched after Rohingya militants attacked security posts in Rakhine State.

A U.S. State Department delegation will be in Bangladesh on Friday and Saturday to discuss the humanitarian crisis and human rights concerns stemming from the crisis in Rakhine state.

The delegation will be led by Simon Henshaw, acting assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, the department said in a statement.

On Wednesday, Reuters photographers saw thousands of desperate Rohingya wade through shallows and narrow creeks between islands of the Naf river to reach neighbouring Bangladesh as the exodus begun two months ago was far from over.

Some had small boats or pulled makeshift rafts to get to Bangladesh on the river's western bank, but most walked, children cradled in their arms and the elderly carried on their backs, with sacks of belongings tied to staves on their shoulders.

Reaching the far side, some women and older people had to be pulled through the mud to reach dry land atop steep banks.

More than 4,000 crossed at different points on the river on Wednesday, Major Mohammed Iqbal, a Bangladesh security official in the southern district of Cox's Bazar, told Reuters.","Aung San Suu Kyi Visits Rahkine For First Time Since Exodus Of 60,000 Rohingya Muslims",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/03/aung-san-suu-kyi-visits-rahkine-for-first-time-since-exodus-of-60-000-rohingya-muslims_a_23265317/

You should take a portion of dip onto your plate to eat it instead.”Professor Schaffner added that double dipping shared food could “potentially” be harmful to health.
Double dipping would spread the virus to the food and make someone else sick,” he said.
“Double dipping is pretty yukky, but the extent to which it is actually unhealthy varies depending on the food,” she told HuffPost UK.","Dunking your canapé into a shared sauce after taking a bite might go against party etiquette, but is it also a risk to health ? We asked the experts to find out.

The controversial habit is so commonplace that it even appears in one of Lidl’s new Christmas adverts, which poke fun at stereotypical festive partygoers.

Each year a hideous crime is committed at Christmas parties across the UK: double dipping food.

A Foods Standards Agency (FSA) spokesperson said double dipping food if you’re the only person eating it is not the biggest crime, but is “not recommended”, especially if you’re putting leftovers in the fridge to save for later.

“While double dipping if you are the only person using the jar is fine in theory - as you are the only person being exposed to any bacterial/viral cross contamination between your mouth and the jar contents - it is poor hygienic practice,” they told HuffPost UK.

“Your own saliva contains enzymes that could affect the food over time in the fridge.”

Professor Donald Schaffner, a specialist in food science at Rutgers University, agreed that double dipping your own food is “probably not” a problem if you’re not sharing with others.

“There is a chance that if you have an infection, i.e. an abscessed tooth, the infection from the tooth can spread to the food,” he told HuffPost UK.

“If the bacteria can multiply in the food to high levels they can make a toxin that will make you sick. Then you will have vomiting, diarrhoea and an abscessed tooth.”

But the real grossness kicks in when you start double dipping food with a communal sauce that’ll be used by others.

The FSA spokesperson said: “We do not recommend this. Bacteria in your mouth could cross-contaminate the food and spread a variety of illnesses, such as colds and flu. You should take a portion of dip onto your plate to eat it instead.”

Professor Schaffner added that double dipping shared food could “potentially” be harmful to health.

“If you are sick with norovirus and you vomit, you might have the virus in your mouth. Double dipping would spread the virus to the food and make someone else sick,” he said.

“Even if it’s low risk, it’s gross. I don’t want to eat your mouth bacteria.”

Meanwhile Dr Clare Morrison, the GP for online doctor MedExpress, said you should consider the type of food you’re eating before thinking about double dipping.

“Double dipping is pretty yukky, but the extent to which it is actually unhealthy varies depending on the food,” she told HuffPost UK.

“For example, researchers have discovered that while all sauces contain more bacteria when a chip has been double dipped, salsa got the worst deal - with more than five times the bacteria in comparison to other two sauces.

“It’s believed that this is because salsa is watery, so contaminated parts are likely to fall back into the bowl after dipping.”

Dr Morrison also joked that you should “have a close look at the person who’s double dipping” before using a communal sauce. If they look ill, avoid that sauce like the plague.

Les trois hommes parcourent le Québec à l'heure actuelle pour s'inspirer des meilleures pratiques dans leurs champs d'expertise – l'alimentation, l'architecture et les saines habitudes de vie, respectivement – et ensuite proposer leur vision de l'«école-modèle».

Le fruit de leur labeur ne verra le jour qu'en 2021. Ils estiment pouvoir rénover et améliorer cinq ou six établissements à ce moment-là qui correspondront à leur vision pour aider à l'apprentissage et la réussite des élèves dans leur «milieu de vie» qu'est l'école.

Pierre Lavoie, à droite, promoteur des saines habitudes de vie et co-fondateur du projet Lab-École présente le projet aux étudiants et aux médias, lors d""une conference de presse, mardi, 7 novembre 2017.

Égide Royer, professeur à la Faculté de sciences de l'éducation à l'Université Laval, étudie la réussite scolaire depuis des décennies. Il maintient que les meilleures pratiques d'apprentissage sont connues, mais qu'elles ne peuvent pas être implantées en raison d'un manque criant de ressources.

«Je peux vous apporter une brouette de recherches qui dit que l'activité physique est bonne pour les enfants et bien se nourrir, c'est très bon pour les enfants aussi. Il n'y a pas de trouble là-dessus. Tant mieux si ça met le projecteur sur ces dimensions-là, mais ce ne sont pas les leviers les plus importants pour la réussite scolaire.»

M. Royer a tout de même salué les «bonnes intentions» des instigateurs du «Lab-École», mais lance qu'il est «naïf» de croire qu'ils pourront réinventer la roue. «Il y a un noyau de connaissances important qui existe déjà et il y a déjà de très belles écoles qui ont été bâties par les communautés scolaires.»

Louise Chabot, présidente de la Centrale des syndicats du Québec, critique le fait que le «Lab-École» ait été mis sur pied par trois personnes à l'extérieur du monde de l'éducation, sans consulter «ceux qui font l'école au quotidien» au préalable.

«Le ministre [de l'Éducation, Sébastien Proulx,] a fait le choix de mettre des sommes d'argent confiées à trois hommes d'affaires pour parcourir le Québec et de nous expliquer en quoi [l'école] serait mieux», tranche-t-elle.

Environ 1,5 million de dollars par année seront dédiés à MM. Larrivée, Thibault et Lavoie pour réaliser leur projet.

«Inclusion», mot tabou?

À l'Assemblée nationale, Alexandre Cloutier du Parti québécois et Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois de Québec solidaire ont uni leurs voix pour dénoncer la «ségrégation scolaire» - qui écrème le réseau d'éducation public des meilleurs élèves et des élèves plus fortunés en les envoyant dans le système privé ou dans des programmes spécialisés.

«On est ici pour rappeler au ministre Proulx que c'est bien beau, parler d'architecture et du menu de la cafétéria, mais que la question fondamentale pour l'école québécoise du 21e siècle, c'est celle de l'égalité des chances», a lancé M. Nadeau-Dubois, en marge du lancement du «Lab-École» qu'il a qualifié de «bling-bling».

M. Royer explique que le Québec a en effet les écoles «parmi les moins équitables» au Canada, puisque les meilleurs élèves quittent les classes «ordinaires». Il regrette que le mot «inclusion» n'ait pas été mentionné lors du lancement du projet «Lab-École».

«La journée où on cesse de concentrer nos élèves en difficulté uniquement dans des écoles ordinaires publiques, après que les écoles publiques à projets particuliers et les écoles privées ont fait la sélection, ça aussi c'est un levier important.»

Le ministre Proulx a défendu l'offre éducative multiple, comme les programmes de sports-études, qui offrent «des occasions multiples de réussir». Il convient toutefois qu'il faut rester vigilants pour ne pas discriminer des élèves.

«On ne veut pas d'une école unique pour tout le monde, a-t-il dit. Je voudrais avoir plusieurs projets, des centaines de projets pour accrocher et pour intéresser les jeunes. Ce que je veux, c'est qu'il y ait de l'accessibilité et de l'égalité à l'intérieur de ces projets.»","«Lab-École»: des bonnes intentions, mais de la naïveté",http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/11/08/lab-ecole-des-bonnes-intentions-mais-de-la-naivete_a_23270101/

The pillows, by interiors brand Jonathan Adler, come in three styles: Xanax (sometimes prescribed for anxiety), Prozax (a common antidepressant) and Quaalude (an illegal sedative).

A range of cushions replicating medication used to treat depression and anxiety have divided mental health campaigners.

The pillows reportedly first sparked a backlash on Instagram after a photo of them was shared by the official Jonathan Adler account.

According to Metro.co.uk, some commenting claimed the cushions were made in “poor taste” while others thought they were “funny and irreverent”.

The Instagram post has since been deleted, but the cushions remain available to purchase online.

“Perk up your sofa with the right pharmaceuticals,” the product description reads.

“Our Prozac Needlepoint Pillow brings our affair with all things medicinal to your pillowscape. Take just one, or follow our professional recommendation to mix the whole assortment.”

Commenting on the mixed reception the products have received, Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity SANE, said the pillows could normalise mental ill health.

“While some people may take offence at these cushions, we do not wish to criticise Jonathan Adler, or to demand their withdrawal from sale,” she told HuffPost UK.

“If there is no intention to cause offence we don’t think it is helpful to be too prescriptive, as it risks creating a climate in which people may be frightened from talking about mental health at all.

“And if we are constantly treading on egg-shells, how can we make mental health an accepted part of everyone’s life?”

But Craig Butler, a mental health campaigner who has previously written about his own experiences of depression, disagrees.

“I’m not a big fan of these,” he told HuffPost UK.

“I’m all for trying to making light of serious issues as it’s important, but this is at a point where society is just establishing mental health as a credible and major issue and my personal opinion is that this jeopardises that.

“I think things like this just turn a serious issue into a gimmick - it feels cheap to me and I don’t think turning mental health into a novelty is helpful.”

It seems the jury is well and truly out on this one. What do you think of the pillows? Tweet us at @huffpolifestyle to tell us your thoughts.

""Leurs appareils génitaux peuvent avoir l'air différent, ou pas -parfois ils ressemblent à ceux de n'importe quel garçon ou fille. Ils peuvent ne pas découvrir qu'ils sont intersexes avant la puberté parce que c'est leur anatomie reproductive interne qui est atypique.""

Gaëtan, lui, est né sans gonades, testicules ni ovaires. En janvier, la mannequin Hanne Gaby Odiele, qui a posé pour Chanel, Dior ou encore Alexander Wang, révélait être intersexe. Son cas est différent: elle était né ""garçon"" (avec un chromosome X et un Y) mais son corps était résistant aux androgènes, des hormones mâles. C'est pourquoi elle ressemblait plus à une ""fille"".

Comme l'explique Elizabeth Reis, il existe de nombreuses formes d'intersexualité, chaque personne intersexe pouvant avoir des caractéristiques différentes.

Souvent confondues avec les ""hermaphrodites"", les personnes intersexes n'ont pas deux sexes en état de fonctionnement. Elles peuvent également être confondues avec les personnes trans, qui ne se sentent pas en accord avec leur genre de naissance. ""Les trans sont en demande d'opération ou de changement de perception sociale de leur genre"", explique à L'Obs Vincent Guillot, fondateur de l'Organisation internationale des intersexes (OII). ""Nous, on veut juste qu'on laisse nos corps tranquilles: on ne touche à rien tant que la personne n'est pas en capacité de s'autodéterminer"", poursuit-il.

Des enfants souvent ""mutilés""

En effet, bien souvent, les médecins décident d'orienter le nourrisson vers un genre ou l'autre. Et cette orientation passe par une opération chirurgicale que, bien sûr, l'enfant ne décide pas.

C'est le cas de Hanne Gaby Odiele. A 10 ans, elle a en effet subi plusieurs opérations pour retirer ses testicules. Les médecins auraient dit à ses parents qu'elle pourrait ""développer un cancer et que je ne deviendrais pas une fille normale. Plus tard, après l'opération, j'ai su que je ne pourrais pas avoir d'enfants car je n'avais pas mes règles. J'ai su que quelque chose n'allait pas"", confiait-elle en janvier 2017.

Vincent Guillot, lui, dénonce même des ""mutilations"". A 52 ans, faute d'avoir pu lire l'intégralité de son dossier médical, il ne sait pas exactement quel type d'opération il a subi enfant. Mais ce dont il est sûr, c'est que ces chirurgies l'ont fait souffrir psychologiquement parlant pendant des années. Il a dû prendre des antidépresseurs. ""On n'attente pas à un corps en bonne santé, sans urgence vitale. Sinon, on autorise aussi l'excision"", regrette-t-il auprès de l'AFP.

Prise de conscience

La France a été condamnée à trois reprises en 2016 par l'ONU pour ces opérations faites sur des enfants afin de leur attribuer un sexe masculin ou féminin.

Début mars 2017, des sénateurs rendaient public un rapport demandant à ce que soient reconnues et indemnisées les souffrances des personnes intersexes. ""Pour certains, les traitements chirurgicaux et/ou hormonaux ont été vécus comme des tortures"", soulignait la sénatrice écologiste Corinne Bouchoux, corapporteuse de ce rapport intitulé ""Variations du développement sexuel: lever un tabou, lutter contre la stigmatisation et les exclusions"".

Quelques jours plus tard, lors d'une cérémonie à l'Elysée, François Hollande estimait que ""l'interdiction des opérations chirurgicales subies par des enfants intersexes, de plus en plus largement considérées comme des mutilations"", était un ""combat à mener"".

When U.S. President Donald Trump's Twitter account was deactivated by a rogue Twitter employee on their last day of work last week, his detractors breathed a sigh of relief.

The reprieve lasted only 11 minutes until the account was reinstated. But after the Twitterer-In-Chief flies from Seoul to Beijing today, his critics may have two whole days to enjoy his absence from the platform while he's in the middle kingdom.

Trump, usually a fan of walls, may come up against one he won't like in China -- the 'Great Firewall' of online censorship that blocks websites like Twitter, Facebook and Google.

If Trump does manage to keep up his Twitter habit, it will most likely be through the use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN). For ordinary Chinese citizens, getting access to VPNs has become harder. Beijing has been ramping up efforts this year to shut down VPNs, even pressuring American tech giant Apple to remove them from its app store in China.

Asked whether the U.S. President will be able to tweet while on Chinese soil, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zheng Zeguang told reporters: ""How President Trump communicates with the outside is not something you need to worry about"".

But it might be something the Chinese authorities need to worry about. After all, if the U.S. President can't get his Twitter fix, he might be tempted to open a Weibo account. Many users of the Twitter-like Chinese micro-blogging service are certainly clamoring for him to sign up. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined ahead of his China visit in spring 2015 and now boasts more than 185 thousand followers on the platform.

Trump needs only to ask his daughter Ivanka about how to use the service. Her own Weibo account gained a huge following before she disabled it in 2014 (her posts are still archived here). Even without a continued personal presence on the platform, Ivanka's jewelry store remains on the site, though it hasn't posted since early 2015. Ivanka still has a sizable following on the platform where her admirers have set up an account called 'Goddess Ivanka Trump' to honour her.

Despite his seemingly strong anti-China positions (on trade issues, in particular) the U.S. President enjoys a great deal of support on the platform. Many Chinese people preferred candidate Trump over his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton who was seen as particularly hawkish, and in favour of a pivot to China which they saw as an attempt to contain their country.

Even as President, many Chinese Weibo users have expressed their admiration for his disdain for so-called 'political-correctness' and have cheered on his contempt for liberal values.

Trump's denunciation of NFL players for kneeling during the national anthem went viral on Weibo in October, with the vast majority of upvoted comments on the video in support of his stance.

""The biggest appeal of Trump is his frankness"", read the top comment on a post about the video.

""For those who refuse to stand during the national anthem, who are contemptuous of the state, they deserve to be fired, even put into prison"", read the second most-liked comment.

Weibo was for a brief period (from around 2009 to 2011) filled with vibrant debate, but its most prominent liberal voices have now largely been brought to heel by government censors.

A recent study by Berlin-based think tank MERICS showed that while there is a plurality of views to be found online in China, the party-state has ""taken drastic measures to suppress ideas it considers hostile"".

Among those new measures are new regulations that crack down harshly on group chats, putting the onus on group admins to police their friends' conversations or face punishment.

Just last week, China's cyberspace authority said it will create a database of online news practitioners, a blacklist of 'fake news' platforms and a mechanism for users to report fake articles.

Now a new study has uncovered one of the most important elements of fighting cancer - how to cut off the supply of food that allows the cells to grow at such a rapid rate and develop new tumours.

In the fight against cancer , one of the most important things scientists can understand is how the disease moves so they can stop it in its tracks before it spreads.

Cancer cells consume exorbitant amounts of glucose when they are taking hold, in fact they require so much of this sugar, that doctors use glucose isotopes to pinpoint the exact location of a tumor and its metastases within the human body.

Where there are abnormally high levels of glucose being used, chances are there is a cancerous growth.

As a result, inhibiting glucose uptake has long been suggested as a logical therapeutic strategy, but the ability to do this has been missing.

Now the team have finally identified a way to do this by stopping a gene CDK8.

CDK8 has long been linked to the development of many cancers including colorectal cancer, melanoma, and breast cancer, where it regulates pathways that drive the growth and survival of cancer cells.

When cancer cells start to grow quickly, they strip the blood supply of oxygen, and then force the body to enter a hypoxic condition, and move on to consuming glucose instead.

Consequently, many cancers are heavily dependent on glucose metabolism for their growth and survival.

CDK8 comes into the picture, because it is the switch that turns on the body’s ability to produce more glucose.

POOL New / Reuters

INTERNATIONAL - La première tournée du président Trump en Asie est forcément un événement, surtout quand on connaît sa propension à la boulette diplomatique. Après avoir quitté les Etats-Unis le 3 novembre et avoir visité le Japon et la Corée du Sud, il est attendu en Chine mercredi 8 novembre par le président Xi Jinping.

Pékin s'apprête à l'accueillir en très grande pompe, et à lui offrir plus de cérémonial que d'ordinaire. Garde militaire d'honneur, banquet officiel et des milliards de dollars d'accords commerciaux, la Chine veut en imposer.

Un protocole très élaboré qui arrive dans un contexte de tensions sur toute une série de sujets, du vaste déficit commercial américain à la gestion par Pékin de la Corée du Nord, son imprévisible voisin.

""C'est un homme puissant"", a dit Donald Trump récemment du président chinois. ""Il se trouve que je pense que c'est un type très bien"", a-t-il ajouté. Pour David Dollar, spécialiste de la Chine à Brookings, il est peu vraisemblable malgré le tapis rouge déroulé que Pékin fasse beaucoup de concessions.

Et pour cause. La Chine voit bien au-delà du déficit commercial américain. Xi Jinping est surtout connu depuis plusieurs années pour son plan à long terme qui vise à remettre en cause l'hégémonie américaine, économique et militaire, au moins en Asie.

Voici comment.

La réouverture des routes de la soie

La route de la soie désigne les anciens itinéraires de commerce entre l'Asie et l'Europe. Par voie de terre et de mer, ces routes auraient été pratiquées dès 2000 avant notre ère, avant d'être progressivement désertées à partir du XVe siècle, puis définitivement après l'ouverture du canal de Suez (1867).

Le grand projet de Xi Jinping est tout simplement de les ressusciter. Le 21 avril 2016, un premier convoi ferré a ainsi rallié Wuhan à Lyon en 15 jours, après un périple de 11.000 kilomètres. Le 23 février, Bernard Cazeneuve, alors Premier ministre de passage en Chine, a assisté à l'arrivée en sens inverse d'un train chargé de bouteilles de Bordeaux et de pièces détachées en provenance des usines PSA.

La Chine a aussi l'intention de financer la construction d'un chapelet de ports, ces anciens comptoirs, qui rallient l'Europe en passant par l'océan indien et la mer méditerranée. Ce n'est pas un hasard si la Chine a racheté le port du Pirée, à Athènes, en janvier 2016. Le groupe Cosco s'est engagé à investir 350 millions d'euros dans ce qui sera son terminus européen.

""Ce qui est nouveau, c'est que le sens des routes de la soie s'est inversé"", analyse Jean-François Di Meglio, président du think tank Asia Centre, interrogé par Europe1. ""La première route de la soie marchait avant tout dans l'intérêt de l'Occident. Cette fois, c'est la Chine qui prend l'initiative et compte en profiter.""

Mi mai, lors du sommet à Pékin sur ""Obor"" (One belt, one road), Xi Jinping a rassemblé un ""G20 réapproprié"", selon les termes de Jean-François Di Meglio, présent pour l'occasion. Vladimir Poutine, Recep Erdogan pour la Turquie, Alexis Tsipras pour la Grèce ou encore la présidente du FMI et le secrétaire général de l'ONU.

En revanche, les Etats-Unis ont décliné l'invitation, tout comme les dirigeants européens du G7, à l'exception de l'italien Paolo Gentiloni. Comme un boycott de la concurrence?

La nouvelle banque chinoise qui bouscule le FMI

C'est le bras armé financier de la nouvelle route de la soie. Face au monopole des Etats-Unis sur les grandes institutions financières internationales que sont le FMI et la Banque mondiale, la Chine a lancé en 2015 la Banque asiatique d'investissement pour les infrastructures (BAII).

Comme pour le FMI, elle compte de nombreux pays actionnaires, 57 au total pour le lancement en 2015. Malgré les réticences et les mises en garde des Etats-Unis, la France, l'Allemagne, le Royaume-Uni, ou l'Italie en font partie, tandis que les Etats-Unis, et le Japon et l'Inde, les deux grands rivaux régionaux, ont décliné l'offre.

Normal, son but est justement de s'affranchir de la tutelle américaine pour décider du financement de grands projets d'infrastructure. Au Pakistan, ce sont des dizaines de milliards de dollars qui financent un véritable ""plan Marschall"" pour créer une route des cols de l'Himalaya au port de Gwadar.

En Afrique, le port de Djibouti s'est aussi mis au chinois sous l'impulsion de grands travaux, tandis qu'une ligne de chemin de fer a été construite pour le relier à la capitale éthiopienne Addis-Abeba. En tout, des dizaines de ports doivent être développés et des milliers de kilomètres de voies ferrées construits.

Imposer le yuan en Asie à la place du dollar

Cela peut sembler très technique, le sujet est pourtant crucial à long terme. La Chine a pour ambition d'imposer la yuan comme monnaie de référence, et, surtout, comme monnaie de change sur les marchés internationaux à la place du dollar.

Kézako? Aujourd'hui, l'écrasante majorité du commerce international est facturé en dollar, y compris celui de la dette publique. Demain, la Chine rêve que le yuan occupe le même rôle. ""Elle se dit que comme premier exportateur mondial, elle pourrait se délivrer des risques de change avec le dollar, éviter la dépendance à l'économie américaine"", analyse Philippe Crevel, président du Cercle de l'épargne.

Il en va ni plus ni moins de la stabilité économique de l'Asie. En 1998, c'est la remontée des taux d'intérêts américains par la Fed qui est à l'origine de la crise asiatique. Le changement des taux a provoqué une dépréciation des monnaies asiatiques, plongeant dans le rouge certains pays dont la dette devait être remboursée en dollars.

Accessoirement, l'influence de la Chine sur ces pays serait grandement accrue...

A corredo di una foto pubblicata su Instagram, ha scritto: ""Spero un giorno di poter parlare di più di misure concrete. Di ciò che abbiamo fatto in questi anni: dopo di noi, terzo settore, omicidio stradale, posti di lavoro, cooperazione, diritti, Expo, infrastrutture. Ma soprattutto di ciò che vogliamo fare: sostegno alle famiglie, abbassamento delle tasse, investimenti per la crescita e lotta alla povertà. Mettiamo da parte le polemiche della politica politicante: l'Italia merita di meglio per il proprio futuro. Andiamo avanti, #avanti insieme"".

A commentare con soddisfazione gli ascolti di La7 è anche il deputato del Partito democratico Michele Anzaldi, segretario della commissione di Vigilanza Rai.

“PREPA’s system appears to be running on fumes.”The story of PREPA is the story of Puerto Rico.
By offering stable, well-paid jobs to electrical workers, PREPA helped create a Puerto Rican middle class, says José Caraballo Cueto, an economist at the University of Puerto Rico.
Puerto Rico has hired a tiny Montana-based contracting company called Whitefish Energy to oversee grid restoration.
“But Puerto Rico never said ‘Hey, we need crews’,” says Mike Hyland of the American Public Power Association (APPA), which represents 1,100 utilities.","IN A room beneath the smokestacks of the Aguirre steam plant in south-eastern Puerto Rico, an engineer points to a colourful poster entitled “How Electricity Arrives at Your Home”. In normal circumstances, explains Alexis Torres, burning oil turns water to steam, which spins mechanical turbines and sends energy out through power lines that criss-cross the island territory. Hurricane Maria made landfall 30 miles from the Aguirre steam plant. The south-east, where coal and oil plants generate much of the island’s electricity, suffered the worst damage.

A month later, 82% of Puerto Ricans still lack power. The island operates a centralised electricity grid: the plants in the south-east provide power to beach resorts in the north-west and metropolitan San Juan; 80% of the power lines were destroyed by the storm. Restoring them is a finicky process. By October 10th 16% of the island’s power had been restored. Later that day it dropped back down to 8% when a plant partially shut down, leaving the airport, police headquarters and several hospitals in the dark. “I was in the middle of open-heart surgery,” one surgeon said. A back-up generator saved his patient. Thousands of the diesel-fuelled contraptions are powering food refrigeration, water purification and other vital needs. But closed schools and shuttered businesses are the new norm. Tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans have left the island.

Maria’s fury would have battered any grid, but the scope of the damage, the sluggish pace of repairs and the suffering from weeks without power have almost as much to do with mismanagement as they do with wind and rain. Last year Synapse Energy, a consultancy based in Massachusetts, carried out the first-ever audit of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and found that the power lines were “cracking, corroding and collapsing”. The utility had been operating for decades without regulation or oversight. Imprudent spending was accelerating a decade-old debt crisis. “The results are grim,” the authors wrote. “PREPA’s system appears to be running on fumes.”

The story of PREPA is the story of Puerto Rico. The utility, created by a New Deal governor in 1941, powered rapid industrialisation in the 1970s as American pharmaceutical and other firms flocked to the island to take advantage of federal tax benefits. By offering stable, well-paid jobs to electrical workers, PREPA helped create a Puerto Rican middle class, says José Caraballo Cueto, an economist at the University of Puerto Rico. The boom was short-lived. When the federal government peeled back the tax perks in 1996, factories started leaving and PREPA began losing customers.

Declining revenues were exacerbated by political patronage, corruption and inefficiency. Municipalities and government agencies do not pay for electricity in Puerto Rico. Successive governments spent tens of millions of dollars evaluating solar and natural-gas projects in order to wean PREPA off its dependence on oil, but did next to nothing. Less than 3% of the island’s energy came from renewables.

PREPA is responsible for $9bn of Puerto Rico’s $73bn of debt. As PREPA and other agencies borrowed billions of dollars from international creditors (and from each other, a practice some have compared to a Ponzi scheme), the utility started skimping on maintenance. In 2014 an austerity law prompted hundreds of experienced employees to retire and claim their pensions before cuts took effect. They were never replaced. The result, according to Synapse’s report, was generator failures, blackout rates four times higher than other American utilities, rising consumer costs, environmental violations and an increasing numbers of worker injuries and fatalities. A three-day blackout in 2016 caused by a fire at the Aguirre plant foreshadowed the darkness and economic standstill Hurricane Maria would bring. “We took the risk and we are paying the price,” says Mr Torres, peering at his poster.

In the aftermath of the hurricane, debate is swirling about how to fix the electrical system and who should pay. “We must rebuild better,” Governor Ricardo Rosselló has said, voicing enthusiasm for a proposal from Elon Musk, founder of Tesla, to deploy solar panels and batteries throughout the island to decrease dependence on the weak grid. This is a fine idea, but also an expensive one. Besides, federal emergency aid—the House of Representatives approved a $36.5bn package on October 12th, though only a fraction will go to Puerto Rico—can typically be used only to reconstruct what existed before the disaster.

The reconstruction has begun in an unusual fashion. Puerto Rico has hired a tiny Montana-based contracting company called Whitefish Energy to oversee grid restoration. Normally, states and municipalities contact a “mutual aid network” that can quickly mobilise thousands of repairmen. “But Puerto Rico never said ‘Hey, we need crews’,” says Mike Hyland of the American Public Power Association (APPA), which represents 1,100 utilities. Mr Rosselló originally claimed he could not get in touch with the APPA, and then later explained that he began negotiating with Whitefish before Hurricane Maria. The company had responded to a request for repair work after Hurricane Irma, and it appeared to be Puerto Rico’s cheapest option. José Roman of the Puerto Rican Energy Commission, an independent body created in 2014 to regulate and monitor PREPA, confirmed that no official bidding process took place. “The government was in emergency mode,” he said.

“It wasn’t like all the big guys were jumping up and down to go to a bankrupt island,” said Ken Luce, a spokesman hired by Whitefish a week ago. The company, which has two full-time employees, began as a joint-venture in 2015 with a Brazilian company called Comtrafo to build a transformer plant in Montana, a project that has since sputtered out. The Puerto Rican government declined to provide details on the contract, but Mr Luce said that Whitefish demanded only a $2m deposit for supplies and crews. It has 220 men on the island, though it plans to increase these to around 1,000 in order to meet the government’s goal of 95% power restoration by Christmas. Until several days ago, Whitefish’s website consisted of a single page with a photo of a helicopter and the contact information for a spokesman.

Puerto Rico’s ability to get the lights back on—and get them to stay on—may determine the island’s future. People will not wait indefinitely for schools without electricity to reopen if they can afford flights to mainland America. Yarimar Bonilla, a Puerto Rican anthropologist at Rutgers University, asked thousands of residents how they felt about Puerto Rico’s territorial status. They told her that, historically, reliable government services like electricity, water and communications made them feel superior to their non-American neighbours like Dominicans and Cubans.

Denn in der RTl-Sendung werden Menschen aus der Provinz bloßgestellt - mit fatalen Folgen

Katastrophen fangen oft ganz harmlos an. So auch die neue Folge von „Bauer sucht Frau“, jener scheinbar putzigen und doch so giftigen Reality-Soap auf RTL.

Kameraschwenk über die thüringische Provinz. Hintergrundmusik: 70er-Jahre-Geträller. Rosi sitzt am Frühstückstisch eines Bauernhofs vor zwei drögen Scheiben Brot. Der Hausherr hat ein Milchtrauma aus der Jugend und kann keinen Käse riechen. Dafür hat er sie mit einem Pfund Butter überrascht.

Doch die Dame stellt ihn auf die Probe und drapiert den eigens mitgebrachten Edamer auf den Tisch.

Weibliche Stimme aus dem Off: „Auch Rosi erbringt einen Liebesbeweis, sie versteckt den Käse unter Marmelade.“ Der Bauer muss vor die Tür. „Nur die frische Landluft kann dem 66-Jährigen jetzt helfen. Rosi bleibt ratlos zurück. Muss sie sich vom Käse verabschieden, wenn sie bei Günter bleiben möchte?“, sagt die Sprecherin.

Nahaufnahme. Hintergrundmusik: italienisches Liebesgeschnulze.

Offenbarungseid der Sonderlichkeiten

Die ersten Minuten, die ersten Lacher. Das Muster bei „Bauer sucht Frau“ ist ewig gleich: Die ganze Sendung ist ein Spott auf die Mittelmäßigkeit der Provinz. Auf die Sorgen der Menschen. Auf deren Ausdrucksweise, Marotten und Schrullen. Das ist infam, und auch gefährlich.

Am größten ist die Freude bei dem Produzenten, wenn die ganzen, normalerweise aus verständlichen Gründen unbeleuchteten Peinlichkeiten des Kennenlernens mit der Lupe seziert werden.

Dann hält die Kamera drauf, als ginge es darum, den Mord an John F. Kennedy aufzuklären. Und ab und zu grinst Moderatorin Inka Bause in die Kamera.

Die kleinen und großen Fehlkommunikationen, die Missverständnisse. Das Offenbaren der eigenen Sonderlichkeiten, in der Hoffnung, der andere möge sie annehmen. Die Schwierigkeiten, sich ins Leben des anderen einzufühlen. All das ist hier ein großer Witz fürs Millionenpublikum.

Peep-Show für die Bessergestellten

So wird das Landleben zur Peep-Show für die Bessergestellten und für jene, die es werden wollen. Da können sich Lasse und Laura aus Prenzlauer Berg genauso wie Jupp und Jutta aus Krefeld in dem wohligen Gefühl ins Fernsehkissen drücken, dass sie in der besseren von zwei möglichen Welten an diesem Abend leben.

Nageldesignerin Christa darf die vollgeschissenen Kälber-Iglus abkärchern. In glänzenden Turnschühchen. Haha.

Der „waschechte Westerwälder“ Uwe trennt sich beim erzwungenen Küchenputzen schweren Herzens von einem, nach eigener Aussage, „jahrzehntealten“ Topflappen. Igitt, hihi.

Eine grantig schauende Bauernmama isst ein Gericht, das ihr die Schwiegertochter in spe zubereitet hat. Hintergrundmusik: „Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod“. Und, oh Wunder: Die ältere Dame ist eigentlich eine ganz liebe Person, bedankt sich, freut sich, macht ein paar ziemlich trockene, gute Witze. Hintergrundmusik: „Here Comes the Sun“. Hoho.

Die ganze Niedertracht der RTL-Fernsehmacher

Überhaupt: Am nervtötendsten ist der Soundtrack.

Mit schmalzigen Liebesliedern, die sich selbst der heißgelaufendste Kuchelrock-Ultra nicht in einer Öffentlichkeit zu spielen trauen würde, die größer ist als die eigene, demente Hauskatze; schunkeltauglichen Unterhaltungsschlagern aus der Wirtschaftswunderzeit mit dem Cool-Faktor von Schnarchpflastern; und amerikanischen Große-Welt-Songs, die einen ironischen Kontrast zu den Misthaufen der deutschen Provinz herstellen.

Hier wird die ganze Niedertracht der Fernsehmacher von RTL offensichtlich. Was für Eltern muss man haben, um anderen Menschen so eine spöttische Inszenierung anzutun?

Als Zuschauer kann solche Fernsehsendungen wegkonsumieren wie eine Tafel Milchschokolade, dafür sind sie ja gemacht.

Doch am Ende bleiben die Kalorien auf der Seele: Ist es wirklich richtig, dabei zuzusehen, wie ganz normale, bisweilen ziemlich liebenswert wirkende Menschen zum Belächelt- und Belachtwerden preisgegeben werden? Sollten wir wirklich dabei zuschauen, wie die deutsche Provinz als Hort der Unzulänglichkeiten dargestellt wird?

Eine bösartige Sendung

Nein, verdammt. „Bauer sucht Frau“ ist eine bösartige Sendung. Sie sorgt dafür, dass ganze Gesellschaftsschichten in Deutschland gegeneinander ausgespielt werden, nur damit RTL und der Bertelsmann-Konzern ihre Gewinnmarge steigern können.

Wenn wir über die Bruchlinien in unserer Gesellschaft sprechen, die derzeit zu immensen politischen Verwerfungen in Deutschland führen, dann fängt die Diagnose an einem beliebigen Abend bei Sendern wie RTL an. Wir haben verlernt, uns gegenseitig zu respektieren. Und das hat auch mit dem öffentlichen Bild zu tun, das von Milieus und Regionen medial produziert wird.

„Bauer sucht Frau“ ist Wahlwerbung für die AfD. Hier wird der Graben ausgeschaufelt, der Menschen in Deutschland trennt, und hinter dem jene Barrikaden errichtet werden, an denen derzeit gekämpft wird. Man kann RTL dafür nicht oft genug kritisieren.

Indeed, these two have much in common: a painful colonial history, a moment of glory as the post-colonial ruling elite made the nation proud, followed by a rather disappointing and depressing end to the relevance of liberation movement politics.

Does it follow that South Africa has to follow the same downward trajectory, or that there is no rescuing Zimbabwe from complete collapse? Not necessarily. It is worth noting that a range of factors conspire against positive and peaceful outcomes. One relates to leadership weaknesses -- ruling and opposition parties alike.

Despite the dangers of predicting the ""demise of Mugabe"" (by now a legendary tale of how to get it wrong, a bit like predicting the end of the Cold War), it is becoming clear that even as Mr Mugabe nears the end of his reign, he manages to disrupt the succession race -- using his motley crew of supporters to remove any and all challengers to the throne.

A supporter of the ruling party Zanu PF holds a poster outside the party headquarters to show support for President Robert Mugabe following a wave of anti-governement protests over the last two weeks in Harare, Zimbabwe July 20, 2016.

One after the other, they end up joining the equally bleak opposition landscape. Could it be that Grace Mugabe has a chance to take control of the presidency? Under these conditions, conspiracy theories and speculation swirl and clog the social media.

Eerily, South Africa's ruling party fortunes are beginning to show similar symptoms of degenerate behaviour. There is no telling the outcome of the December elective conference and whether the Zuma or Ramaphosa block will take control of the party (and it is another question what to expect at the forthcoming national elections in 2019).

South Africa's President Jacob Zuma (R) jokes with his party's newly appointed Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa (L).

Accompanying this trend -- the failure of liberation movement politics -- is the growth of complex and multilayered criminal networks that benefit from state fragility. Its dynamics have variously been described as ""state capture"", or the ""shadow or mafia state"" at work.

Viewed together with the established phenomenon of the rule of the big man -- patrimonialism -- it is hard not to conclude that both Zimbabwe and South Africa are inescapably degenerating into violent state failure.

South Africa as the most powerful neighbour seems divided over strategy. A range of civil society organisations demand action.

Several initiatives are at hand to intervene, arrest, and recover the slide. In Zimbabwe, the most recent big intervention -- SADC mediation under the leadership of Mr Mbeki resulting in a government of national unity -- brought temporary relief, but arguably allowed criminal networks to spring even deeper roots.

South Africa as the most powerful neighbour seems divided over strategy. A range of civil society organisations demand action. Political interests at home and abroad attempt to blow new life in the governing ZANU-PF or the fractured opposition.

The private sector appears disinterested, passively awaiting the inevitable. What is to be done? Unfortunately, South Africa finds itself under similar pressure -- trying to avoid falling over the socio-economic, political and fiscal cliff.

Under these conditions, it is everyone for him and herself, and the prospects for the twins look bleak indeed.

Es una tarifa demasiado baja""Primero, hay que reconocer que esta tarifa es extremadamente baja, de hecho, es la más baja del mundo.
Antes de la tarifa cero (con la que operadores no pagaban nada por interconexión) se pagaban hasta 32 centavos por minuto.
Pero esto no significa que no van a protestar y que no habrá argumentos de presión para regresar a la tarifa cero.
Lo que sí es un hecho, es que la tarifa cero no era viable a largo plazo: tenía que subir en algún momento, según explica Levy.","Y después que se anunció que se elimina la tarifa cero, ¿pagarás más por hacer llamadas a través de tu celular?

El aumento en las tarifas de interconexión no afecta en absoluto al usuario... Al contrario, podrían seguir bajando"", explicó Irene Levy, presidenta de Observatel, el observatorio de las telecomunicaciones en México.

El 2 de noviembre, el Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones (IFT) notificó que todos los operadores de servicios de telefonía celular deberán pagar a Telcel, a partir del 2018, menos de 3 centavos por minuto por tarifa de interconexión (0.028562 pesos). Esto es el pago por cada llamada de voz que pase por la red Telcel, de parte de un operador de la competencia (AT&T, Movistar, Axtel, Virgin...)

¿Qué garantías hay que este costo no se le pasará al usuario? Levy da tres razones que explican por qué no.

1. Es una tarifa demasiado baja

""Primero, hay que reconocer que esta tarifa es extremadamente baja, de hecho, es la más baja del mundo. Antes de la tarifa cero (con la que operadores no pagaban nada por interconexión) se pagaban hasta 32 centavos por minuto.

¿Por qué entonces los operadores defienden que sí tendrán que pasarle el costo a los usuarios? De acuerdo con The Competitive Intelligence Unit, a partir de la reforma de telecomunicaciones se ha observado una disminución de precios en telefonía celular de alrededor de 45% (y por tanto, una baja en el ingreso promedio por usuario que obtiene cada operador).

De hecho, todos los servicios de telecomunicaciones han bajado, según muestra este gráfico del IFT.

2. Tarifas de interconexión no 'pesan' en los ingresos de un operador

""Segundo, tenemos que tomar en cuenta que el pago de tarifas de interconexión es sólo 2.8% de los ingresos de la industria, es decir, los operadores no viven de esto"", dice Levy.

Con ello, sería poco probable que por estas tarifas, los operadores dejarán invertir en infraestructura o en un buen servicio al cliente.

Pero esto no significa que no van a protestar y que no habrá argumentos de presión para regresar a la tarifa cero.

""Estaremos viendo cómo la competencia de Telcel hablará de las consecuencias... pero AT&t no se va a ir del país por esto, por ejemplo"".

Y sí, también Carlos Slim (dueño de Telcel) podrá poner otro amparo para que la tarifa de menos de 3 centavos sea mayor. ""Jurídicamente sí puede hacerlo, diciendo que esta tarifa tan baja no le conviene... no pierde nada"".

Lo que sí es un hecho, es que la tarifa cero no era viable a largo plazo: tenía que subir en algún momento, según explica Levy.

3. Cada vez menos llamadas de voz

Hay tomar en cuenta que las tarifas de interconexión son sólo para los servicios de voz, es decir, para las llamadas de teléfonía celular.

Hoy, según explica Levy, los usuarios utilizan menos servicios de voz y usan más servicios de datos (conexión a internet). Por ejemplo, los servicios de datos hoy representan el 50% (estaban en 46%) y los de voz están en 46%.

Si dudas que estás usando más datos, es decir, tu conexión de internet, en lugar de tu señal de teléfono, pregúntate cuántas llamadas haces vía WhatsApp, en lugar de hacer una llamada de teléfono convencional; o cuántas llamadas has dejado de hacer debido a que mandas más mensajes por redes sociales.

La importancia de las tarifas asimétricas

Para entender mejor el tema se tiene que tener claro qué son las tarifas asimétricas.

""Vamos a suponer que vas a correr contra Usain Bolt... si te da unos minutos para que tú salgas corriendo antes, tendrías un poco de ventaja y no te daría una super barrida, ¿cierto? Algo así son las tarifas asimétricas, que con la Reforma Telecom buscan que los competidores de Telcel (que es el operador preponderante porque tiene la mayor parte del mercado) tengan un poco de ventaja para competir mejor en el mercado"", explica Levy.

Esto es, que lo que paga cada operador, en términos de tarifas de interconexión, depende de su situación en el mercado: no paga lo mismo Telcel que su competencia. ¿Y por qué Telcel? Al segundo trimestre del 2017, Telcel tenía 75.4% del mercado de telefonía celular, que es una gran mayoría del mercado (por lo que se le considera 'preponderante). En tanto que AT&T tiene 13.5% y Telefónica 10.9%; el resto de los operadores se reparten el 0.2% restante.

Respecto al tema de las tarifas asimétricas, Gonzalo Rojon de The Competitive Intelligence Unit, explica a través de una columna, que la asimetría de tarifas de interconexión ""ha detonado un escenario de mayor competencia en el corto plazo, con evidentes ganancias en adopción, calidad, asequibilidad y cobertura para nosotros los consumidores"".

Así que lo importante en este tema es que se mantenga la asimetría (el operador preponderante tiene unas reglas en tarifas, y los demás, otras). ""Ésa es la decisión que el regulador (IFT) deberá de tomar en los próximos días, mantener el mayor diferencial posible para enfatizar su eficacia en los próximos años y evitar la perpetuidad de una asimetría competitiva entre operadores competidores"".

Aún con todo, es aún imposible saber qué sucederá en este tema: los operadores podrían seguir presionando, argumentando que pagar tarifas de interconexión les generará bajas en ingresos, y Telcel podría buscar la manera de que la tarifa sea mayor a 3 centavos.

Esperemos que los operadores y analistas nos hayamos equivocado y que esta reducción no signifique un retroceso en los beneficios que hemos obtenido los consumidores"", dice Gonzalo Rojon, a través de un artículo.

""Die Entscheidung habe ich in Absprache mit Andreas Ferber, meinem Ehemann und Manager, sowie meiner Plattenfirma getroffen"", erklärt die Schlagersängerin der ""Bild""-Zeitung.

Der Pop-Titan erzählt dagegen eine ganz andere Version der Geschichte und nennt verschiedene musikalische Interessen als Grund für die Trennung.

Einige Muslime haben darauf ziemlich coole Antworten gefunden

Muslim zu sein, das kann gerade keinen Spaß machen. Neben ein bisschen sachlicher Auseinandersetzung gibt's vor allem Vorurteile und Gepöbel. Im Netz, auf der Straße, überall.

Wie schön, dass sich viele Muslime ihren Humor bewahrt haben. Eine kleine Sammlung der lustigen, sarkastischsten, besten oder anrührendesten Antworten von Muslimen auf die täglichen Zumutungen:

1. Bad Hair Day

Klar, mit einem Kopftuch lässt sich ein Bad-Hair-Day schon mal eher rumbringen als ohne. Aber eine Dauerlösung ist das nicht.

Der US-Biologiestudentin Heraa Hasmi wurde das Gefrotzel jedenfalls zu blöd. Als eine junge Frau twitterte: ""Kopftuchträgerinnen haben es gut, sie müssen sich nicht Haare waschen"", schrieb sie:

""Menschen haben es so gut, sie müssen nicht duschen, seit sie Kleidung tragen.""

2. Sorry, keine Zeit für Dschihad

Kurz nach Weihnachten 2015 soll der Chef der IS-Terrormiliz Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi alle Muslime dazu aufgerufen haben, sich dem Kampf anzuschließen. Der Autor und Menschenrechtsaktivist Iyad El-Baghdadi – er schreibt vorsichtshalber in seinem Twitter-Profil, dass er also nicht der Baghadadi sei – hat die Info verbreitet. Seine Follower wussten die offenbar ironisch gemeinte Vorlage zu schätzen.

Und antworteten, warum sie, leider, leider, auf keinen Fall kämpfen könnten: ""Ich muss meinen Goldfisch noch zum Tierarzt bringen.""

3. Danke, Mr. Trump

Am 13. Oktober twitterte US-Präsident Donald Trump einen Auszug aus einer Rede. ""In Amerika beten wir nicht die Regierung an, sondern Gott."" Es sollte ein Anbiederungsversuch an konservative Christen sein, vor denen er sprach. Er mag diesen Satz sehr, denn im Sommer hatte er ihn schon einmal unters ergeben lauschende Volk gebracht. Denn die mag er, ganz im Gegensatz zu Muslimen.

Und da hatte sich Hend Amry, einen bekannte muslimische Bloggerin, vernehmen lassen: ""Can I get an Allahu Akbar"".

CAN I GET AN ALLAHU AKBAR https://t.co/mSM0VTb3YY — Hend Amry (@LibyaLiberty) 26. Juli 2017

Heißt so viel wie: Danke, Mr. Trump. Sie haben soeben gesagt, dass wir unseren Gott, Allah, anbeten dürfen.

Der Tweet hat inzwischen mehr als 102.000 Likes und wurde 38.000 Mal geteilt.

4. Die arme, unterdrückte Muslima

Muslimische Frauen sind brav, folgsam und räumen den ganzen Tag Männern und der Kinderschar hinterher. Soweit das Klischee.

Als eine Twitter-Nutzerin fragte, vor was denn die Follower am meisten Angst in der Ehe hätten, schrieb die Kopftuch tragende Gül trocken: ""Müde nach Hause zu kommen und zu sehen, dass mein Mann das Abendessen noch nicht gekocht hat.""

5. Homosexuell? Na klar!

Homosexualität ist im Islam eine schwere Sünde. In vielen Ländern wie Pakistan werden Homosexuelle brutal verfolgt.

Aznahn Munas ist laut Medienberichten selbst Muslim, stammt aus Pakistan und hat in Australien eine Firma mitgegründet, die Tücher für Frauen verkauft: Halstücher, Kopftücher.

Seit ein paar Tagen hat die Firma ein neues Produkt im Angebot. Es ist nur gerade ausverkauft, weil die Nachfrage so groß ist: ein Kopftuch in Regenbogenfarben. Den Farben der Homosexuellen.

6. Der falsche Yoga-Guru

Hamzah ist Muslim aus Texas. Und wenn Muslime beten, knien sie mal hin, mal beugen sie den Oberkörper. Auf Twitter schrieb Hamzah, wohin das führte:

""Ich war in der Turnhalle und betete im Yoga-Raum. Drei Frauen folgten meinen Bewegungen. So habe ich versehentlich eine Yoga-Klasse geleitet.""

I was at the gym praying in the yoga room and 3 ladies started following my motions.That's my story on how I accidentally led a yoga class. — Hamzah (@Hamzah_AlS) 14. August 2013

7. Message an den IS

Nach jedem Terroranschlag fordert jemand, Muslime müssten mehr gegen den Terror tun. Eine Forderung, über die man sicher diskutieren muss.

Nur sind viele Muslime genervt - denn so einfach ist die ganze Sache eben auch nicht.

""Lass mich schnell mal eben dem IS 'ne Whatsapp schicken und den Typen sagen, sie sollen mal chillen.""

Lemme just whatsapp ISIS and tell them to chill out Piers, one sec https://t.co/qc6DGE3MyE — ١١ (@babyygrill) 23. Mai 2017

8. Christen ohne Fehl und Tadel

Der bekannte US-Anwalt und Aktivist Qasim Rashid war sauer. ""Ein weißer Übermensch hat mir geschrieben, der Islam sei gewalttätig und höhnte, ich solle ihm eine christliche Version des IS zeigen.""

Die Antwort Rashids:

""400 Jahre transatlantischer Sklavenhandel, im Zuge dessen 20 Millionen afrikanische 'Heiden' verkrüppelt, ermordet, verschleppt und versklavt wurden, um sie auf den Weg Christi zu bringen.

Der Völkermord an den amerikanischen Ureinwohnern im Namen Christi.

Der Genozid an den australischen Ureinwohnern, bei dem 90 Prozent von ihnen in weniger als einem Jahrhundert umgebracht wurden, wiederum von christlichen Europäern.""

Und das ist erst der Anfang der Aufzählung.

Die 17-jährige Lamyaa aus dem US-Bundesstaat Pennsylvania veröffentlichte im Frühjahr 2017 eine Konversation mit ihrem Vater in Saudi-Arabien.

Sie fragt ihn, ganz vorsichtig, was er davon halte, dass sie vielleicht ihr Kopftuch ablegen wolle. Der britischen BBC sagte sie, sie hatte das nicht wirklich vorgehabt, aber sie habe ihn testen wollen.

Kids under five can only get the flu shot from their health care provider, so book appointments before the worst of flu season hits.
Ontario's flu shot program has been running for 18 years and has helped to reduce flu-related deaths and hospital/doctor visits dramatically.","This year, thousands of Ontarians will get influenza (the flu). The flu can be serious and can spread before symptoms, like chills and fever, start showing. That means you can infect your family and friends even before you start to feel sick.

As the colder weather sets in and we start to spend more time indoors and in closer proximity to one another, the risk of influenza increases. It's essential that parents make sure the whole family is prepared and protected for flu season by getting the flu shot.

Here are five things you should know about the flu so you can stay healthy and protected this season.

The flu is not a bad cold.

Unlike a case of the common cold, the flu can lead to serious problems such as ear infections or, more seriously, pneumonia or dehydration which, in severe situations, can result in hospitalization. Influenza and pneumonia are ranked among the top 10 leading causes of death in Canada.

Though the flu and a cold have some common symptoms, the symptoms of the flu are more severe.

Know the difference between a cold and the flu?

*It's important to note that not everyone with the flu will have a fever.

The only way to catch the flu is by being exposed to the influenza virus, typically from a cough, sneezing, talking or even from contaminated hands and surfaces. You cannot catch the flu from going outside without a coat or with wet hair.

The flu virus changes year to year.

The influenza viruses evolve and can change every year, so getting vaccinated each year is important to make sure you're protected. The immunity the flu vaccine provides declines over time, so an annual vaccination is needed to get the best protection against the flu.

Children under five are at higher risk.

Young kids love to touch everything they encounter, which makes picking up or passing on the flu virus incredibly easy within this age group. Kids spread more of the flu virus because there's more virus in their mucous secretions. That means when they cough or sneeze (especially when they forget to sneeze into their elbow), more of the virus is being released for others to pick up.

Infants and toddlers are especially vulnerable to complications from the flu because their immune systems are still developing. These children under the age of two are more prone to blockage, impacting their ability to breathe with ease, during infection because their airways are smaller. Kids with medical conditions such as asthma are at higher risk of flu-related complications.

The virus lives longer than you think.

The flu virus can spread up to six feet (two metres) with just one sneeze and can live for up to eight hours on surfaces that kids commonly touch such as toys, books, door handles and desks. This puts their family members and their community at risk of getting the flu. You can be contagious and start spreading the flu virus up to a day before symptoms appear, so it may not be easy to avoid contact with those infected.

Washing hands with soap and warm water, or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer and coughing and sneezing into sleeves are good practices, but you can't always protect yourself from others and very young kids often haven't mastered this habit. Getting the flu shot early is your family's best defence against the flu. In Ontario, the flu season is at its peak in late fall and during the winter months.

Getting the flu shot is easy.

The flu shot is available now. In Ontario, there are a number of places for your family to get the flu shot including your health care provider, local public health unit, community clinics and in more than 2,400 pharmacies across the province. Kids under five can only get the flu shot from their health care provider, so book appointments before the worst of flu season hits.

PORTLAND, Oregon, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Federal agents have seized records from a national company that solicits thousands of Americans to donate their bodies to science each year, then profits by dissecting the parts and distributing them for use by researchers and educators.

The search warrant executed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation at MedCure Inc headquarters here on November 1 is sealed, and the bureau and the company declined to comment on the nature of the FBI investigation. But people familiar with the matter said the inquiry concerns the manner in which MedCure distributes body parts acquired from its donors.

FBI spokeswoman Beth Anne Steele confirmed the day-long search of the 25,000-square-foot facility, but declined to comment further because the matter is under seal. A person familiar with the matter said that FBI agents took records from MedCure but did not remove human remains.

The search warrant, though sealed, signals that an FBI investigation of MedCure has reached an advanced stage. To obtain a search warrant to seize records, rather than demand them via subpoena, FBI agents must provide a detailed affidavit to a U.S. magistrate with evidence to support probable cause that crimes have been committed and that related records may be on the premises.

""MedCure is fully cooperating with the FBI, and looks forward to resolving whatever questions the government may have about their business,"" said Jeffrey Edelson, a Portland attorney who represents the company. ""Out of respect for the integrity of the process, we do not believe that further comment is appropriate at this time.""

It is illegal to profit from the sale of organs destined for transplant, such as hearts and kidneys. But as a Reuters series detailed last month, it is legal in most U.S. states to sell donated whole bodies or their dissected parts, such as arms and heads, for medical research, training and education.

Commonly known as body brokers, these businesses often profit by targeting people too poor to afford a burial or cremation. Reuters documented how people who donate their bodies to science may be unwittingly contributing to commerce. Few states regulate the body donation industry, and those that do so have different rules, enforced with varying degrees of thoroughness. Body parts can be bought with ease in the United States. A Reuters reporter bought two heads and a spine from a Tennessee broker with just a few emails.

MedCure, founded in 2005, is based outside Portland, Oregon, and has offices in Nevada, Florida, Rhode Island and Missouri, as well as Amsterdam, the Netherlands. At some locations, including the one near Portland, MedCure provides training labs for doctors and health professionals to practice surgical techniques. MedCure also sends body parts and technicians to assist with medical conferences across the country.

MedCure is accredited by the American Association of Tissue Banks, a national organization that primarily works with transplant tissue banks. The broker is also licensed by the state health departments in Oregon and New York, among the few states that conduct inspections. According to Oregon state health records, officials renewed MedCure's license in January, following a routine on-site review.

The commercial, posted on Nov. 2 on Coca-Cola Middle East’s YouTube page, shows a dad handing his daughter the keys to his car, and then sitting in the passenger seat as she makes several attempts to drive, starting and stopping hesitantly. But once she has a sip of Coke, she peels off down the road with confidence. “Change has a taste,” the ad concludes.

As of Monday, the video had garnered over 60,000 views.

The ad comes five weeks after the conservative Muslim kingdom announced plans to lift its ban on women driving, which will come into effect next June.

Under Saudi law, women still cannot mix freely with men, obtain a passport or leave the country without a male guardian’s permission. They also have to wear an abaya that covers their bodies down to their feet, among other rules.

Personen, die sich dauerhaft weder dem weiblichen noch dem männlichen Geschlecht zuordnen lassen, würden in ihren Grundrechten verletzt, wenn sie das Personenstandrecht zwinge, das Geschlecht zu registrieren - aber keinen anderen positiven Geschlechtseintrag als weiblich oder männlich zulasse.

Die Beschwerdeführerin, die sich selbst Vanja nennt, hatte erfolglos bis zum Bundesgerichtshof geklagt.

Vanja ist intersexuell, also zwischen den Geschlechtern geboren. Sie verfügt über einen atypischen Chromosomensatz. Nach Schätzungen gibt es rund 80.000 intersexuelle Menschen in Deutschland.

Sie stoßen im Alltag auf zahlreichen Probleme. Das Geschlecht auf dem Personalausweis entspricht für Mitmenschen nicht dem Aussehen, auf öffentlichen Toiletten werden Intersexuelle gefragt, ob sie sich verlaufen haben. ""Wir werden in eine zweigeschlechtliche Welt gesteckt, in der wir uns nicht wiederfinden"", sagt Lucie Veith, die den Bundesverband Intersexuelle Menschen leitet.

For years, high-tech homes were seen only in cartoons and movies (remember The Jetsons, or the Stark Mansion from Iron Man?). But as time rolled on, innovations such as flat-screen televisions and voice-controlled assistants have gone from fantasy to reality. And experts say that the fun's only just beginning.

When asked by Vanity Fair at the event whom he would most like to profile, Talese said that it would be Spacey. And while it’s not inherently wrong to profile complex and even predatory public figures, his reason for wanting to do so was troubling.

“I would like to ask [Spacey] how it feels to lose a lifetime of success and hard work all because of 10 minutes of indiscretion 10 years or more ago,” Talese said.

Was die Ereignisse, die sich heute vor 100 Jahren in Russland zugetragen haben, und die noch fälschlich als ""Oktoberrevolution"" bezeichnet werden, wirklich bedeuten, wird bis heute von der offiziellen Geschichtsschreibung ignoriert. Und in den Medien verfälscht.

Der staatliche TV-Sender Rossija 1 hat dem 7. November 1917 (nach dem damals gültigen Kalender der 25. Oktober 1917) eine ganze Talkshow gewidmet. Dort sagte der Chef der Kommunistischen Partei, Gennadij Sjuganow: ""Die Geschichte kennt keinen Konjunktiv. Was passiert ist, ist passiert.""

Aber das stimmt nicht.

Wenn man uns verbieten will, darüber nachzudenken, was ohne Lenins Putsch passiert wäre, dann ist das klare Zensur. Und auch eine Rechtfertigung für die Verbrechen in unserer Vergangenheit.

Russland hätte sich nicht in den ersten Weltkrieg einmischen sollen, sagte der Chef-Kommunist. Dabei war es Deutschland, das Russland den Krieg erklärte. Und zwar auch deshalb, weil die Deutschen davon ausgingen, dass unser Land sich zu einem Wirtschafts-Riesen entwickeln und zu groß und zu stark werden würde.

Aber gehen wir noch weiter.

Die neue Regierung wollte sich auf die Bürger berufen

Hunderte Jahre hielt man die Macht - die Zarenkrone - für gottgegeben.

Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts ließ der Glauben an Gott nach.

Die Februar-Revolution 1917 - der Sturz des Zaren - war deshalb zeitgemäß.

Die neue Regierung wollte sich nicht mehr auf Gott berufen, sondern auf ihre Bürger.

Deshalb hatte sie für November 1917 Wahlen ausgerufen.

Gleichzeitig setzte die Provisorische Regierung unter Alexander Kerenski den Krieg fort. An der Front schaffte sie erstaunliche Erfolge.

Dann kam Lenin und die Revolution

Wladimir Uljanow, der sich Lenin nannte, hatte zur gleichen Zeit nur ein einziges Ziel: An die Macht zu kommen. Und er wusste: Dazu musste Russland erst den Krieg verlieren, denn ein Sieg hätte Kerenski zum Helden gemacht.

Russlands Position im Krieg verbesserte sich rasch. Tschechen, Slowaken und Kroaten wollten nicht mehr weiter gegen Russland kämpfen, wo es jetzt keinen Zaren mehr gab, und Wien signalisierte notgedrungen Verhandlungsbereitschaft.

Als Berlin erfuhr, dass der eigene Bündnisgenosse abtrünnig werden könnte, wandte es sich an einen alten Freund, der von Deutschland bezahlt wurde - Wladimir Uljanow alias Lenin.

Der befahl seinen Leuten, unverzüglich die Minister der Provisorischen Regierung festzunehmen - am 25. Oktober (7. November): ""Jede Verzögerung wäre gleichbedeutend mit dem Tod"", war damals die Parole. Einen Tag später wäre der Frieden mit Österreich unterzeichnet worden.

Massenterror gegen das eigene Volk

Am 26. Oktober erließ Lenin sein ""Dekret für den Frieden"" - also die Kapitulation Russlands.

Der angebliche ""2. Kongress der Volksdeputierten"" - in Wirklichkeit nur eine Versammlung von Abgeordneten aus den wenigen Regionen, in denen Lenins Leute wirklich eine Mehrheit hatten - ""ernannte"" eine bolschewistische Regierung.

► Bei den Wahlen zur Verfassungsgebenden Versammlung, die diese ausrief, erhielt Lenins Partei im November 1917 nicht mal ein Viertel der Stimmen.

Im Dezember schaffen die Kommunisten hastig die WTscheKa, eine Vorgänger-Organisation des KGB, die Massenterror gegen das eigene Volk betrieb.

Lenins Kämpfer schossen auf Demonstranten

Am 18. Januar 1918 traf sich ein Teil der gewählten Abgeordneten zur verfassungsgebenden Versammlung.

Als diese die Erlasse der Sowjets für illegal erklärte, wurde sie aufgelöst. In der gleichen Nacht ließ Lenin seine Kämpfer mit Maschinengewehren auf Demonstranten schießen, die auf die Straße gingen, um ihre legitim gewählten Abgeordneten zu verteidigen. Mehr als hundert Menschen starben.

Lenins Mitstreiter Bucharin rief den Bürgerkrieg aus. Die bolschewistische Regierung hatte keine Legitimität. Sie kämpfte ausschließlich für die Interessen ihrer Anführer. Sie hatte keine soziale Basis, weder im alten noch im neuen Russland.

""Diktatur des Proletariates""

Selbst die russischen Marxisten wie Plechanow und Martow erkannten die so genannte Revolution, die in Wirklichkeit ein Putsch war, nicht an. Deshalb mussten Lenin und seine Anhänger sich von der ganzen tausendjährigen Geschichte Russlands lossagen.

Die nationale Symbolik - das Wappen, die Hymne, die Flagge, der Staatsnamen - alles wurde abgeschafft. Stattdessen schuf man die so genannte ""UdSSR"". An Stelle der demokratischen Republik, die sich gerade aus dem konstitutionellen Monarchie entwickelt hatte, trat eine ""Diktatur des Proletariates"".

Schon am 20. November 1917 erklärten die Bolschewiken das gesamte bestehende Recht für ungültig. Alle Gesetze verloren ihre Wirkung, die Gerichte und Staatsanwaltschaften wurden aufgelöst. Ganz offen wurde erklärt, dass die neue Regierung das Völkerrecht nicht anerkennt.

► Auch der bestehenden Moral wurde der Kampf angesagt. Ebenso wie der Kirche.

Der radikale Bruch wird heute ignoriert

Lenins ""Plan der monumentalen Propaganda"" sollte die Erinnerung an alles auslöschen, was mit dem alten Russland zu tun hatte. Denkmäler wurden zerstört, Ortsnamen geändert, ebenso der Kalender und die Rechtschreibung.

1921 wurden alle humanitären Fakultäten der russischen Universitäten geschlossen. Erst Jahrzehnte später wurde das Studium von Geschichte, Soziologie, Recht und Philosophie wieder möglich.

Dieser radikale Bruch durch die Bolschewiki wird heute von der russischen Politik - und deshalb auch der Geschichtsforschung und in den Schulbüchern - ignoriert.

""UdSSR und Russland - Mörder und Mordopfer""

Ein derartiger völliger historischer Bruch ist in der Geschichte selten, aber nicht einmalig. Das sowjetische und postsowjetische Regime hat in etwa so viel gemeinsam mit dem historischen Russland wie die Bundesrepublik mit dem Dritten Reich. ""Die UdSSR und Russland - das ist Mörder und Mordopfer"", schrieb Solschenizyn.

Statt der russischen Idee riefen die Bolschewisten die sowjetische Idee aus: Soziale Gerechtigkeit, Verzicht auf Ausbeutung, freie Entwicklung des Individuums, usw.

► Doch diese lauten Parolen waren nur ein Vorhang, mit dem die schreckliche sowjetische Realität verdeckt wurde.

In der Sowjetunion herrschte totale Zensur, die Grenzen waren geschlossen, die Menschen wurden maximal ausgebeutet, die Wirtschaft war rückständig, es herrscht Mangel selbst an Waren des täglichen Bedarfs, Hunger, Armut, ein katastrophaler Niedergang der Landwirtschaft und vieles mehr.

Es ist deshalb kein Wunder, dass die gesamte Geschichte der Sowjetunion auch eine Geschichte des Widerstands der einfachen Menschen gegen dieses System ist - und zugleich des Kampfes dieses Systems gegen die eigenen Menschen.

➨ Das könnte euch auch interessieren: Friede mit Russland - bloss wie?

Russland hatte den Anspruch, eine Weltmacht zu sein

Bolschewismus - das sind drei künstlich erzeugte Hunger-Katastrophen, GULAG - ""ein Auschwitz ohne Krematorium"" - der ""rote Terror"" und der ""große Terror"", die Deportation von sechs Millionen Menschen.

Russland schritt in das 20. Jahrhundert mit dem Anspruch, eine führende Weltmacht zu sein. Es beendete das Jahrhundert mit dem Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion.

In 70 Jahren Kommunismus hat Russland 5,5 Millionen Quadratkilometer Landfläche verloren - das ist zehnmal so viel wie das Territorium Frankreichs. 1917 lebten in Russland 186 Millionen Menschen, heute sind es 143 Millionen.

Fast alle Opfer von Stalins Terror gegen das eigene Volk sind, still und leise, offiziell rehabilitiert.

► Das bedeutet, dass Lenin und Stalin einen Völkermord an ihrem eigenen Volk begangen haben.

Wir brauchen eine intellektuelle moralische Erneuerung

Was kann man dazu noch sagen? Um aus der 100-jährigen Sackgasse herauszukommen, in die Russland heute vor 100 Jahren eingebogen ist, brauchen wir eine gigantische intellektuelle moralische Erneuerung.

Nur, wenn wir uns von dem tief sitzenden Erbe und Denken aus der Sowjetzeit lossagen, das Geschehene juristisch aufarbeiten und endlich Vergangenheitsbewältigung beginnen, wenn wir an das alte Russland anknüpfen, und dessen Erbe reformieren und modernisieren, wenn wir uns dabei die Erfahrung der europäischen Demokratien zu Herzen nehmen, nur dann haben wir eine Chance, die russische Zivilisation wiederauferstehen zu lassen.

In the year since the Nov. 8, 2016 election, dread and anxiety around the world has only mounted with the realization that Trump doesn’t care for strategic alliances or multilateral solutions to global challenges. His is a zero-sum approach to world affairs in which the “winner” takes all and diplomacy is for losers.

The United States has become less respected under Trump, polls suggest, and as the president disdainfully discards the nation’s mantle of global leadership, erstwhile close allies are relying less on America and instead are going their own way.

The new @DerSPIEGEL cover story on Trump's election will be online in English this evening (European time). pic.twitter.com/OKNYPXZgtD — SPIEGEL English (@SPIEGEL_English) November 11, 2016

Trump’s management of U.S. foreign policy is “revolutionary in a very negative way,” said Aaron David Miller, who is vice president and Middle East programs director at the Woodrow Wilson International Center and a former State Department negotiator in past Democratic and Republican administrations. “It’s a galactic disaster.”

Trump has disempowered Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by farming out foreign policy to his son-in-law and chief adviser, Jared Kushner, and to Gary Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council and Trump’s chief economic adviser. He’s also allowed U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley to speak on issues that normally fall under the purview of the secretary of state, Miller said, adding that Trump also contradicts himself, his advisers and members of his Cabinet.

“Messaging has been wandering all over the parking lot,” Miller said.

“The rest of the world is shaking its head,” he added. “They’ve lost a good bit of faith in American leadership and what America stands for.”

A Disregard For American Values

Trump’s pugnacious style and his Manichean rhetoric on the world stage, along with the unpredictability of a White House in near-constant disarray and the abandonment of several existing international commitments have only further eroded America’s position.

“It’s the worst of all worlds,” said Stephen M. Walt, professor of international affairs at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. “The United States is continuing to intervene in various places … but we’re now doing it with an incompetent president. And this will not end well.”

The biggest difference between Trump and his predecessors, Walt argued, is Trump’s seeming disregard for foundational American values such as freedom, democracy and equal rights. That, combined with ease around thuggish authoritarian presidents including Vladimir Putin in Russia and Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, directly undermine America’s standing in the world.

“He’s very comfortable with dictators of all kinds,” Walt said. “It’s one thing to recognize that there are sometimes trade-offs and that sometimes you have to compromise on those values … But in Trump’s case, he’s throwing those values out of the window. And that is giving up a great advantage that the United States has had in terms of foreign policy ― namely, that the United States stood for something other than just self-interest.”

America’s Global Reputation Hurt By Trump

“Trump and many of his key policies are broadly unpopular around the globe, and ratings for the U.S. have declined steeply in many nations,” according to the Pew Research Center, which polled more than 40,000 people from 37 countries around the world earlier this year.

Most non-Americans consider Trump “arrogant,” “intolerant” and even “dangerous,” the poll found. Just 22 percent of respondents expressed “confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs,” compared with 64 percent during Barack Obama’s presidency. The decline in trust was most marked among America’s closest allies in Europe and Asia, as well as in neighboring Mexico and Canada.

Pew Research Center Global confidence in the U.S. president and views of the U.S. have both taken a plunge in the year since Donald Trump's election.

In only two of the polled countries ― Russia and Israel ― did people believe Trump is a better president than Obama.

“I don’t think you need a Pew poll to come to the conclusion that our allies are beside themselves ― both in terms of the issue of competency and strategy. And our adversaries … have exploited every conceivable opportunity Trump has thrown their way,” said Miller.

American presidents once heralded the country as the shining city on a hill ― an exceptional beacon to the rest of the world ― and allies saw the appeal in making common cause with the U.S., with British leaders often boasting of the “special relationship” that spanned the Atlantic.

These days, apprehension about the U.S. has even crept into the halls of Westminster.

“‘America First’ doesn’t sound like the basis for a mutually beneficial partnership,” one Tory Member of Parliament told HuffPost on condition of anonymity.

A Surprising Trump Effect

After the U.S. election, European liberals feared a wave of Trump-style populism that would upend the political map on the continent and bring down the post-World War II political order.

But when Dutch voters went to the polls in March, they rejected the nativist populism embodied by Geert Wilders, a far-right leader who had praised Trump throughout his campaign.

The “Trump factor” played a role in “making people think twice about voting for a populist, as people have seen that if you elect a populist, you can get all kinds of wacky policies,” Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a London-based research organization, told The New York Times.

In France, Emmanuel Macron won the spring elections in a landslide by shrewdly positioning himself as the anti-Trump: A liberal, progressive globalist believer in diplomacy and international institutions. When Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate deal, Macron tweeted, “Make Our Planet Great Again,” earning 230,000 retweets and sparking a French government-funded website by that name that encourages those concerned about climate change ― especially scientists and entrepreneurs ― to immigrate to France.

Pascal Rossignol/Reuters People gather to protest the visit of U.S. President Donald Trump in Paris on July 13, 2017.

Trump is so disliked in France that the label “Trump à la française” has become a mark of political infamy, and former allies, such as the far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen, rarely invoke his name. Even far-right voters don’t like Trump anymore. Supporters of the National Front, a populist, anti-immigrant party, hold increasingly negative views of Trump.

According to a new poll by HuffPost France, only around 20 percent of National Front voters say they have a positive opinion of Trump ― a decline of 11 percent since a similar poll from last year ― suggesting that familiarity has bred dislike.

Given the intense disregard of Trump, European leaders have, by and large, sought to distance themselves from the American president lest they be tainted by association.

In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party made one small but significant change to its electoral program before national elections earlier this year, substituting the word “friend” with the word “partner” when referring to the U.S. That puts America in the same category as Turkey, a country with which Germany has strained relations.

Conversely, British Prime Minister Theresa May waded into political trouble when she invited Trump for a state visit soon after his inauguration. Formally, invitations for state visits have to be extended by the queen on advice from her government, and more than 1.8 million people signed an online petition to have the visit downgraded because Trump would “cause embarrassment to Her Majesty.” The speaker of the House of Commons also refused to allow Trump the honor of addressing the Westminster Parliament, citing Trump’s “racism and sexism.”

For now, the visit appears to be postponed until sometime next year.",It Only Took Trump One Year To Trash America's Global Reputation,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-one-year-world-perspective_us_5a029dc4e4b06ff32c9456ac?utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage

Denn ""Neue Zürcher Zeitung"" und ""Die Welt"" lehnen das Verteufeln von Steueroasen ab

Für Steuergewerkschafts-Chef Thomas Eigenthaler ist diese Argumentation ""absurd""

Für den Durchschnittsdeutschen liegen die Steueroasen in weiter Ferne. Das liegt weniger daran, dass Reisen in die Steuerparadiese der Südsee vergleichsweise teuer sind. Vielmehr mangelt es ihnen am Vermögen, um die zahlreichen Schlupflöcher skrupellos auszunutzen.

Erst ab einem bestimmten Steuerbetrag rechnet sich der Aufwand, und damit zugleich der Ertrag, um Geld am deutschen Fiskus vorbeizuschleusen.

Doch diese augenscheinliche Ungleichheit ist für Olaf Gersemann, ""Die Welt""-Ressortleiter für Wirtschaft und Finanzen, und Peter A. Fischer, Leiter der Wirtschaftsredaktion der ""Neuen Zürcher Zeitung"" (""NZZ""), kein Problem.

Denn beide verteidigen in ihren Kommentaren die Steueroasen.

""Simpler Ausdruck der globalen Natur""

So schreibt Fischer in seinem Beitrag für die NZZ, indem die investigativen Journalisten einige Fälle vermuteten Missbrauchs publikumswirksam herauspicken, würden sie versuchen, alle Offshore-Geschäfte zu verteufeln. Doch diese haben ""in einer immer globaleren Welt nicht nur ihre Berechtigung, sondern sind oft sogar zwingend.""

Der Wirtschaftsjournalist betont, Offshore-Transaktionen seien meistens entweder ""simpler Ausdruck der globalen Natur eines Geschäfts"" oder Resultat von tatsächlichen Unzulänglichkeiten und Missständen in den betroffenen Ländern.

Für letzteres nennt Fischer ein Beispiel: die aus seiner Sicht ""prohibitiv scharfe"" Besteuerung von Unternehmensgewinnen in den USA.

Deshalb dürfe man Steueroasen nicht grundsätzlich verteufeln - wie es weltweit Medien machen.

Übergriffige Kassenwarte

Gersemann von der ""Welt"" sieht das ähnlich. Hinter den Offshore-Geschäften gebe es keine Doppelmoral - und ""eine pauschale Vorverurteilung aller Offshoreaktivitäten ist durch nichts gerechtfertigt.""

Seine Argumentation: ""Konten in Steueroasen sind im Grunde nichts anderes als das Bargeld des reichen Mannes: desjenigen, der mehr Geld besitzt, als sich in Matratzen oder Wandtresoren verstauen ließe"", behauptet er in seinem Kommentar.

Gerade angesichts einer immer weiter alternden Gesellschaft würden die Finanzminister laut Gersemann zunehmend ""internationale Kartelle mit Mindeststeuersätzen bilden, denen niemand entrinnen kann"".

Deshalb würden Steueroasen dazu dienen, ""auf Dauer zu verhindern, dass die Kassenwarte allzu übergriffig werden."" Die Steuerverstecke würden Schutz bieten – vor der ""Gier der Finanzminister"".

Denn wenn man Leistungen des Staates abrufe, dann sei es ihm zufolge es unmoralisch, wenn man sich nicht am Staatswesen beteilige. Zudem ist es demokratisch beschlossen, dass die Wohlhabenderen mehr schultern und nach unseren Gesetzen einen höheren Steuersatz zahlen als die niedriger Verdienenden.

The Trudeau government's push for so-called progressive chapters in a revamped Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement are likely to be a tough sell among many of Canada's partners in the region, experts say.

International Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne has said part of Canada's negotiating strategy, aside from preserving market access, is to press for the inclusion of chapters on the environment, labour rights and gender equality.

But trade experts like former Quebec premier Jean Charest believe Canada should proceed carefully as it tries to persuade some of its partners around the table for an updated Pacific Rim treaty.

""They're addressing the angst of Canadians that's shared elsewhere in the world about trade agreements having to be more than just about lining up numbers on a sheet of paper,"" Charest, a partner at McCarthy Tetrault who is also on the board of the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, said in an interview.

Watch: The latest news on TPP talks

""When we bring those issues — environment, workers' rights — I think we're in a broader trend. How far we want to push it when we're dealing with developing countries that are going to follow their own path of development is another issue.""

For example, Charest, who was involved in international-trade talks as a federal and provincial politician, said Mexico hasn't pushed back against Canada's effort to include similar progressive elements in the new North American Free Trade Agreement. But when it comes to following through, he said Mexico lacks the training and education at the same level as a country like Canada.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Champagne will be in Danang, Vietnam this week for meetings with Canada's partners in the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation bloc.

The TPP is expected to be a key theme during the APEC summit as 11 economies, including Canada, try to revive the deal following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw earlier this year.

There are expectations that some kind of agreement on a revised TPP — also known as TPP11 — could come together when the leaders meet later this week.

A senior government official has said Canadian negotiators are seeking changes to the original TPP in several areas, such as its intellectual-property provisions, cultural exemptions and its impact on Canada's supply management system for dairy, poultry and eggs.

Champagne has also said Canada wants the revised pact to contain progressive chapters on the environment as well as workers' and women's rights. He added that New Zealand's new government supports a similar approach.

Maude Barlow, a veteran human-rights activist, said while it would be an improvement to have these progressive chapters within the bodies of trade agreements, she warned they will end up ""more meaningless than meaningful"" unless the partners undo the other, bigger concerns with these deals.

Barlow, the honorary chair of the Council of Canadians, pointed to elements in trade deals like the original TPP such as investor-state dispute mechanisms. They would enable corporations to challenge government regulations and standards, including environmental standards, she said.

She also noted concerns that TPP could open up local procurement to foreign bidders and raise drug prices.

""You've got to get at the heart of what's wrong with these trade agreements."" Maude Barlow, Council of Canadians

""Suddenly, everybody's talking about labour rights and environmental rights, but I doubt it. So, I just wish they would slow down and I wish we could get some true public consultation.""

Carlo Dade of the Canada West Foundation think tank says he expects the progressive chapters will be a ""non-starter"" for countries like Japan, which he believes would likely prefer to keep trade issues separate from social issues that would be handled domestically.

""It's not that they're against gender (equality), it's not that they're against stronger environment, it's not that they're against labour,"" said Dade, who has done extensive research on TPP11.

""It opens up a whole bunch of contentious issues for them. Where do you stop adding things to trade agreements? For these guys, the agreements are trade agreements.""

Dade has done modelling that shows TPP11 would be a major economic benefit for Canada. He said the deal presents a stark choice for the federal government and has him wondering how far Ottawa wants to push the progressive chapters.

""How much are they willing to sacrifice in trade gains?"" Dade said.

Apple préfère l'île de Jersey pour mieux payer ses impôts aux États-Unis

Apple a choisi l'île de Jersey, paradis fiscal bien connu, pour réduire son taux d'imposition lorsque ses montages en Irlande ont été pointés du doigt il y a quatre ans, ont rapporté le 6 novembre plusieurs médias, dont le New York Times.

Lorsque des parlementaires américains puis des officiels irlandais ont examiné à partir de 2013 les dispositifs pour réduire très fortement ses impôts grâce à des filiales en Irlande, le fabricant de l'iPhone a décidé de chercher un autre endroit favorable, explique le quotidien américain.

Mi-2014, sous la pression d'autres pays, l'Irlande a souhaité mettre fin a l'une des astuces d'optimisation fiscale utilisée dans ce pays par Apple, et d'autres multinationales.

Avec l'aide d'Appleby, Apple a alors jeté son dévolu sur Jersey, dépendance de la Couronne britannique, qui n'impose pas les entreprises, poursuit le New York Times, qui avance aussi que le groupe a ""accumulé plus de 128 milliards de dollars de profits offshore - et sans doute plus - qui ne sont pas imposés aux Etats-Unis et à peine dans d'autres pays"".

Selon des échanges de mails évoqués par le New York Times, Apple tenait à ce que cette recherche reste secrète. Sollicité par l'AFP, Apple n'a pas donné suite.

La groupe a fini par publier un communiqué d'une longueur inhabituelle: ""Lorsque l'Irlande a changé ses lois fiscales en 2015, nous nous y sommes conformés"" en procédant à certaines modification.

Apple reconnaît que ""parmi ces changements, (sa) filiale détenant ses liquidités à l'étranger a été domiciliée à (...)

Chez Dassault, on a le sens du commerce. D'après Le Monde, la maison sait se montrer arrangeante avec les clients près de leurs sous. Ainsi, Dassault n'a pas hésité à livrer plusieurs jets privés à un riche homme d'affaires russe sur l'île de Man pour échapper à la TVA française.

Oleg Tinkoff, qui a fait fortune dans l'électronique, la production de bière et la finance, a acheté en 2013 un petit Falcon 2000LX (21 millions d'euros), revendu en 2014 pour acheter un 900LX (32,8 millions d'euros), avant de se raviser pour le 7X en 2016 (41,4 millions d'euros).

Or, d'après les documents examinés par Le Monde, Dassault n'a pas facturé de TVA. Pourquoi? Parce qu'il revenait à l'île de Man, lieu de résidence de la société acheteuse, de percevoir les sommes. Sauf qu'elle ne l'a jamais fait...

Grâce à un jeu de sociétés écrans, Oleg Tinkoff a économisé des millions d'euros de TVA. ""Le Russe s'est donc loué son propre avion à lui-même pour donner l'illusion que la coquille vide de l'île de Man produisait une activité commerciale, afin d'obtenir son laissez-passer dans l'espace aérien européen sans jamais payer la moindre TVA"", résume le quotidien.

Pour Dassault, la plaisanterie pourrait prendre un mauvais tour. D'après le code des impôts, cette ""exonération ne s'applique pas lorsqu'il est démontré que le fournisseur savait ou ne pouvait ignorer que le destinataire présumé de l'expédition ou du transport n'avait pas d'activité réelle"". Or, plusieurs e-mails semblent bien le prouver...

Comment Nike passe entre les mailles du fisc hollandais

L'équipementier sportif américain Nike profite d'un ""trou"" dans la législation néerlandaise pour réduire à seulement 2% son taux d'imposition en Europe, selon de nouvelles révélations publiées par le journal Le Monde.

Deux sociétés basées au Pays-Bas concentrent ""tous les revenus européens"" de Nike et lui permettent ainsi d'échapper ""à la taxe sur les bénéfices dans les pays où il vend effectivement les chaussures"".

L'équipementier ne paie ainsi que 2% d'impôt sur les bénéfices contre 25% pour la moyenne des entreprises européennes. ""Pour réussir ce tour de force, Nike a utilisé toutes les ressources du système fiscal néerlandais et ses immenses possibilités d'optimisation"", assure Le Monde.

Le groupe américain se paie ""à lui-même le droit d'utiliser sa marque"" et parvient ainsi à réduire ""artificiellement ses profits et donc baisser ses impôts, tout en constituant un trésor avec ces royalties"", explique le quotidien.

Ce schéma, mis en place en 2014, ""a permis à Nike de réduire sensiblement son taux d'imposition global, passé de 24% à 16% en trois ans"", tandis que les pays européens ont demandé aux Pays-Bas de combler cette lacune.

L'ONG Oxfam a réagi en qualifiant Nike de ""mauvais payeur"". ""Ces dizaines de milliards qui échappent à l'impôt au bénéfice d'une infime minorité d'ultra-riches et de multinationales représentent des pertes considérables pour les budgets des Etats, et ce sont les plus pauvres qui en paient le prix"", a déclaré Manon Aubry, porte-parole pour la France, citée dans un communiqué.

""Ce que prouve également le montage fiscal de Nike à travers les Pays-Bas, c'est que le système d'évasion fiscale est organisé depuis l'Union européenne et (cela) rappelle une nouvelle fois l'urgence de s'attaquer aux paradis fiscaux européens"", a-t-elle souligné, appelant Bruxelles à effectuer des réformes.

Vor seiner Hochzeit dachte er, er wisse schon alles über Sex

Erst nach und nach hat er gelernt, was guten Sex wirklich ausmacht

Ich bin 41 Jahre alt und schon seit fast zwei Jahrzehnten mit der gleichen, wunderschönen Frau verheiratet. Über die Jahre hinweg musste ich mich mit einigen Mythen und Irrtümern über Sex auseinandersetzen.

Die meisten dieser falschen Vorstellungen hatte ich schon, bevor ich verheiratet war und es hat Jahre gedauert, bis sie sich aufgelöst haben. Wenn ich zehn Tipps für guten Sex an mein unverheiratetes Ich schicken könnte, wären das diese:

1. Sex läuft nicht wie im Fernsehen oder in Filmen ab

Das meiste, was du über Sex weißt, kommt aus der Werbung, aus dem Fernsehen oder aus Filmen.

Anders ausgedrückt: Sex sieht aus wie spontanes, makelloses Liebemachen, voller Romantik - Marvin Gaye läuft und Kerzen sind auf dem Fensterbrett drapiert.

Sexuelle Intimität funktioniert in einer Ehe definitiv NICHT so. Im seltensten Fall läuft Marvin Gaye.

Aber sei nicht enttäuscht: Sex in der Ehe ist anders als im Film, aber es ist auch viel besser.

2. Eine Randnotiz zur Häufigkeit - bereite dich darauf vor

Im Moment denkst du noch, dass man in einer Ehe ständig Sex haben wird, so gut wie jede Sekunde am Tag und tausendmal in der Woche - denn, warum denn auch nicht!?

Lebe diesen Traum, so lange du kannst und reite dein getreues Einhorn in den Süßigkeiten-bedeckten Sonnenuntergang, wo du dann deinen wilden Ewok streicheln kannst und über die Brücke nach Terabithia gehst.

Glaub an deinen Traum. So lange du kannst. Das ist alles.

3. Sex ist wie ein guter Wein - er wird besser im Alter

Sexuelle Intimität ist etwas, in dem du immer besser werden wirst. Es braucht Kommunikation, Übung und Zeit.

Im Moment denkst du, dein Sex-IQ ist auf dem Level eines Genies, aber du würdest in einer Sex-Abschlussprüfung komplett versagen mit dem, was du weißt.

4. Sex ist nicht nur ""bekommen"", sondern auch ""geben""

Es ist tatsächlich schön, dem anderen etwas zu geben. Sei nicht die ganze Zeit über ein ""Nehmer"".

Sexuelle Intimität ist wunderbar, um Verzicht und Anstrengung zu vereinen. Wenn du das jetzt in deinen Kopf bekommst, wird das ""bekommen"" nur noch besser.

Im ""geben"" liegt eine unfassbare Schönheit und viele Geheimnisse. Sei großzügig.

5. Männer und Frauen denken nicht auf die gleiche Art über Sex

Für dich ist Sex körperliche Anziehung und es ist sehr visuell und augenblicklich.

Vielleicht ist es besser, wenn du dich jetzt erst mal setzt: Frauen empfinden Sex als Teil einer Beziehung, als Sicherheit und als Anzeichen, wie sehr sie geliebt und verlangt werden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Sex-Experten raten: Diese 9 Dinge solltet ihr mit eurem Partner viel öfter machen

Für dich ist Sex wie ein Lichtschalter ohne Dimmer. Du bist sowas von bereit, jederzeit (außer du schläfst... aber das muss dann schon eine Todesschlaf sein).

Für sie ist Sex wie ein Schmorbraten, der viel Zeit braucht, um zu köcheln.

Das wird euch beide sehr frustrieren. Aber das ist ok. Das bringt euch näher zusammen, auf einer viel tieferen Ebene.

6. Sex macht dein Leben nicht vollkommen

Momentan legst du wahnsinnig viel Wert auf Sex. Lass uns ehrlich sein: Du denkst ständig daran.

Du sollst wissen, sexuelle Intimität ist fantastisch und sehr befriedigend und unglaublich auf die schönsten Art und Weisen - aber es darf kein Götzenbild sein. Es ist ein Geschenk, das man in der Ehe genießen sollte.

7. Sex kann Spaß machen, lustig und verspielt sein

Es gibt so viele Blickwinkel, was sexuelle Intimität betrifft und die meisten davon sind dir jetzt noch nicht bewusst. Du denkst zu eindimensional über Sex.

Sexuelle Intimität ist auch Verletzlichkeit und Authentizität und wenn du jemanden wirklich liebst, hast du nichts zu verstecken - und ich meine wirklich nichts.

Du kannst dein ehrlichstes Ich sein.

8. Sie zu verführen ist wie eine legale Sexdroge für ihre Seele

Ich habe es vorhin schon angedeutet, aber das ist wahrscheinlich das beste Geheimnis, dass ich dir mit auf den Weg geben kann: Verführe sie.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Diese Paare haben mit dem Sex bis zur Hochzeit gewartet - jetzt verraten sie, ob es sich gelohnt hat

Zeig ihr, dass du sie nicht nur körperlich willst. Verführe ihren Geist. Verführe ihr Herz. Verführe sie auf jede mögliche Weise.

Denk daran, sie denkt nicht so an Sex, wie du es tust - du bist Haut und Haar und sie ist Herz und Seele.

9. Es ist geheimnisvoller als du denkst

Und noch mal: Gerade sind deine Ansichten über Sex ziemlich simpel.

Es ist schwer zu erklären und ich verstehe es auch heute noch nicht so ganz, aber es passiert etwas Magisches, wenn zwei Menschen Sex haben. Es ist etwas fast Kosmisches, das zwei Seelen aneinander bindet,

10. Sex in der Ehe ist eine Art der Verehrung

Wenn ich sage Sex ist Verehrung, denkst du wahrscheinlich, ich bin verrückt. Aber es ist wahr.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 8 Angewohnheiten von Paaren, die ein erfülltes Sexleben haben

Der Akt ist eine Art der Verehrung, schlicht und einfach. Es ist wie alte Lieder singen, nur mit Körpern. Okay, das hat sich jetzt unheimlich angehört. Lass es uns einfach Verehrung nennen.

Ich hoffe wirklich, dass du dir diese Gedanken zu Herzen nimmst. Denn letzten Endes ist Sex in der Ehe noch viel schöner, als du es dir vorstellen kannst.

Der Politikwissenschaftler Hamed Abdel-Samad warnt eindringlich vor dem politischen Islam

Dieser würde die Integration von muslimischen Migranten in Deutschland massiv behindern

Auch die katholische und evangelische Kirche trügen daran eine Mitschuld

Der ägyptisch-deutsche Politikwissenschaftler Hamed Abdel-Samad hat vor dem politischen Islam in Deutschland gewarnt. Insbesondere kritisierte er den größten Moscheeverein in Deutschland, die von der Türkei dominierte Ditib.

Auf einer Veranstaltung der “Passauer Neuen Presse” sagte er am Montagabend, Ditib stehe für einen Islam, mit dem muslimische Migranten in Deutschland nicht erfolgreich mit einbezogen werden könnten. Das Ziel dieses politischen Islam sei “niemals die Integration der Muslime“.

Auch wenn sich islamische Organisationen in Deutschland oft als offizielle Repräsentanten der hierzulande lebenden Muslime darstellen würden, habe das nichts mit der Realität zu tun.

Abdel-Samad begründet das damit, dass nur ein kleiner Teil der fünf Millionen Muslime in Deutschland Mitglieder solcher Verbände sind. Für eine gelungene Integration sei es viel wichtiger auf die einzelnen Individuen einzugehen, als auf politische Gruppierungen.

Oft geäußerte Kritik

Wenn Abdel-Samad so etwas sagt, erzeugt das immer Aufmerksamkeit in Deutschland. Der Politologe ist für seine harte Haltung ebenso bekannt wie umstritten.

Neues hat sein Beitrag am Montagabend in der Diskussion denn auch nicht gebracht. Dass die türkische Regierung über Ditib Einfluss in Deutschland zu nehmen versucht, ist bekannt. Der Glaubensverband steht hierzulande schon länger in der Kritik. Unter anderem werden Imamen von Ditib Spionage für die türkische Regierung vorgeworfen.

Gleichwohl hält Abdel-Samad damit eine Diskussion am Laufen, die tatsächlich geführt werden muss. Zuletzt hatte etwa der CDU-Politiker Jens Spahn in harschen Worten angemahnt, die Zusammenarbeit mit den Islamverbänden zu überprüfen.

Dabei geht es darum, wie der Islam in Deutschland in der Gesellschaft vertreten werden soll, wer für Muslime sprechen kann und darf.

Denn klar ist: Muslime sind traditionell weniger hierarchisch organisiert als etwa die Christen.

""Die Kirche macht sich mitschuldig""

Abdel-Samad nahm am Montag auch die Kirchen in die Pflicht. Auch sie setzen seiner Ansicht nach zu stark auf Verbände wie die Ditib.

Er warf Heinrich Bedford-Strohm, dem Landesbischof der evangelischen Kirche in Bayern, Fehler im Umgang mit der Ditib vor.

So habe seine Kirche zur Gedenkfeier nach dem Terroranschlag auf dem Breitscheidplatz in Berlin 2016 einen Imam eingeladen, der zu diesem Zeitpunkt vom Verfassungsschutz beobachtet wurde.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Der Islam ist kein Problem, das man lösen muss""

“Indem man solche Leute hoffähig macht, macht man sich als Kirche mitschuldig”, so Abdel-Samad. Die Kirche würde keinerlei Konsequenzen im Umgang mit Ditib folgen lassen, und das obwohl man um ihre problematische Rolle wisse.

Bedford-Strohm argumentierte, man wisse um die Kritik - aber deswegen werde man den Dialog nicht abreißen lassen. Denn er sei unabdingbar.

Doch Abdel-Samad wehrt sich gegen solche Kompromisse. Nur mehr Ehrlichkeit mit dem Islam und mit seinen Vertretern in Deutschland könne zu einer besseren Integration führen.

""I'm not going to apologize for the fact we believe we need to be supporting more women in politics,"" she said.","OTTAWA — Federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna says she hadn't planned to confront a reporter from the Rebel during a news conference last week, but when the right-wing website posed the first question at a news conference in Vancouver, her pent-up frustrations at the outlet's ""climate Barbie"" tag just came out.

The incident happened at the conclusion of a meeting of provincial and federal environment ministers and McKenna asked the Rebel's Christopher Wilson if he would commit that neither he nor his outlet would use the sexist label anymore.

She concedes it was a little bit ""awkward"" to raise the issue in that manner but she ""just thought it was really important.""

'I'm quite pleased I did it'

""I'm quite pleased I did it and I'm pleased because hopefully it makes ... it more possible for other women and girls to step up and do the same,"" McKenna said in an interview Tuesday with The Canadian Press.

The ensuing feedback since the incident has been overwhelmingly positive, said McKenna, adding she wants the Rebel and anyone else to stop using sexist names for all women, not just her.

""There's a group of people who continually attack me because of the colour of my hair or supposedly the tone of my voice or all sorts of reasons,"" McKenna said.

""But it's about making sure that women and girls can see a place for them in politics and recognizing that it's not OK to make fun of women because of how they look.""

The ""climate Barbie"" tag was coined by Rebel media almost as soon as McKenna was named environment minister in November 2015.

The term gained more mainstream awareness in September when Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was forced to condemn its use by one of his MPs.

Gerry Ritz tweeted the slur in the final weeks of his career as an MP but after an online outcry he deleted the post and apologized.

McKenna received bipartisan support both then and this past weekend, with Conservative, NDP and Liberal politicians among those publicly supporting of her decision to confront the Rebel.

Conservative MP Michelle Rempel, who has also been a frequent target of sexist online trolls, took to Twitter on Sunday with some of the more egregious comments she's received. She said her staff keeps a running daily tally on a white board of the number of sexist calls they receive.

Rempel posted a creepy letter from someone who wrote about whether she was wearing underwear and said if she dressed provocatively no men would listen to what she had to say.

But Rempel also said it angers her that partisans try to pretend there is a political overtone to sexism, or that one party is worse than another.

""Every party has done stupid sexist shit,"" Rempel tweeted. ""Trying to paint it as an issue to one party or another for gain is part of the problem.""

L'incrédulité a suivi l'effarement: beaucoup ont vu dans cette victoire une erreur, un ""bug"" politique, voire une franche manipulation, un coup des Russes, forcément. Pour se rassurer, ils ont parié sur la faiblesse d'un président-businessman inexpérimenté, s'attendant à ce qu'il soit tenu en laisse par le parti républicain, par le vice-président Mike Pence, par la First Daughter Ivanka ou par les lobbies de Wall Street. Et pourtant, un an après son élection, après plus de 9 mois au pouvoir, il faut, une fois pour toutes, se faire à cette idée, aussi désagréable soit elle pour certains: Donald Trump a gagné, non seulement en novembre dernier, mais aussi au sein de son camp, dans les médias, et dans l'opinion publique.

Un faisceau de facteurs a contribué à sa victoire en novembre 2016: une primaire ouverte, une candidate démocrate mal aimée, une mobilisation de l'Amérique conservatrice, une campagne clivante émaillée d'ingérences russes. Il n'en reste pas moins qu'il y a eu un net vote d'adhésion pour Trump et ses idées, en particulier chez les hommes blancs sans diplôme universitaire, séduits par une offre politique inédite, mélangeant ferveur populiste, fierté nationaliste et repli protectionniste. Depuis son arrivée au pouvoir, Trump ne respecte et ne travaille que pour ceux qui l'ont mis au pouvoir, sans s'en excuser jamais. Il honore une à une ses promesses de campagne, sur l'immigration, le commerce, le climat, l'Iran, la santé, quel qu'en soit le coût politique. Pour nourrir le culte, il ne cesse de rejouer le scénario victorieux de sa campagne présidentielle, alimentant les polémiques autour d'Hillary Clinton. Tout cela lui garantit une base électorale entièrement dévouée qui voit en lui leur héros, un outsider antisystème dont le comportement indigne leur rend leur dignité.

A la Maison Blanche comme sur les routes de sa campagne présidentielle, Donald Trump applique sa méthode inimitable: il survole les sujets de fond, s'enfonce dans les controverses au lieu d'en sortir, ne respecte pas les règles du jeu politique, ou de la bienséance. Le président ne fait aucune concession, ni aux familles des soldats morts au combat, ni aux champions nationaux de football américain, ni même à la communauté internationale. Ses chiffres d'approbation sont au plus bas, parmi les plus bas qu'un président ait connu à ce stade, mais Trump remporte la bataille médiatique: ses outrances à répétition le rendent maître du temps et ne cessent de détourner l'attention du public. La méfiance grandit vis-à-vis de la presse d'investigation taxée d'être à charge et la lassitude croissante du public lui donne des marges de manœuvre.

Puisque le personnage est insolite, on a voulu voir dans sa candidature un épiphénomène, échappant aux explications politiques. Mais Donald Trump n'est pas une erreur de l'histoire, il en est son produit. Le produit de l'histoire économique et politique du monde occidental, balayé par une vague de populisme rageur qui veut réparer les torts causés par la mondialisation et la crise identitaire des démocraties libérales. Il est aussi le produit de l'histoire du conservatisme américain, en transformation profonde depuis 25 ans. De Newt Gingrich à Ted Cruz en passant par Sarah Palin et le Tea Party, le parti républicain s'est engagé dans un long processus de purification idéologique, qui récompense davantage l'extrémisme que la recherche du consensus bipartisan. Le système des primaires, la carte électorale et le redécoupage des circonscriptions portent au pouvoir les républicains les plus idéologues, désormais soutenus par Trump et son alter ego médiatique Steve Bannon.

Le président peut ainsi compter sur la loyauté des républicains du Congrès qui craignent d'avoir à affronter un challenger trumpien lors des prochains primaires précédant les élections de mi-mandat de 2018. Il les récompense de cette liaison forcée en appliquant à la lettre le programme républicain sur les questions règlementaires, judiciaires ou encore fiscales. Si quelques sénateurs, non soumis à réélection en 2018, osent encore le contredire, la plupart de ses adversaires, tels que les sénateurs Bob Corker ou Jeff Flake, ont déjà jeté l'éponge. C'est pour cette raison qu'il est illusoire de croire à son explosion en plein vol. Le procureur Mueller détricote lentement les fils des relations entre la Russie et la campagne Trump, mais, en dehors d'une preuve flagrante, le président ne sera pas inquiété. Les équilibres politiques étant ce qu'ils sont aujourd'hui, Trump ne sera pas destitué, il ne démissionnera pas, il n'y aura de révolte dans son parti, ni de révolution dans la rue. Ses opposants devraient plutôt se préparer à l'affronter en 2020 dans une campagne de réélection qui sera compétitive.

Oui, Donald Trump a vraiment gagné. Les Américains se sont habitués à ses turpitudes, sa base le vénère, les Républicains traditionnels se contentent de ce qu'il peut leur apporter, et les démocrates sont aux abonnés absents. Le temps joue en sa faveur. Au sommet du pouvoir, il pose les bases d'un mouvement trumpiste, une idéologie nationaliste-populiste qui n'avait pas d'incarnation jusque-là mais qui, grâce à Trump et ses soutiens, survivra à son créateur et comptera désormais dans la vie politique américaine.

This year, however, the U.N. faces a new challenge: Addressing the phenomenon after U.S. President Donald Trump, leader of the planet’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, pledged to do nothing to curb emissions.

The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change will deal with that question in Bonn, Germany, from Nov. 6 to Nov. 17 as countries work to firm up their commitments to adapt to a warmer world in line with 2015′s landmark Paris Climate Agreement. Scientists say the world should prevent the planet from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius beyond pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst effects of climate change, a benchmark set by the Paris accord. Meeting the target means dramatic reduction in global emissions, and the Paris pact urges signatories to craft voluntary pledges to do that.

However, the agreement is not legally binding, and Trump followed through on a campaign pledge to withdraw America from what he calls the “draconian” pact in June. It is a multi-year process to do so, and the U.S. cannot leave until Nov. 4, 2020 ― the day after the next presidential election.

The U.S. and Syria are now the only two nations opposed to the climate deal.

Wolfgang Rattay / Reuters Empty seats of U.S. delegation are seen before the opening session of the COP23 UN Climate Change Conference 2017, hosted by Fiji but held in Bonn.

The Trump administration announced last week it would actively promote fossil fuels during a presentation at the climate conference, also known as the Conference of the Parties, or COP. Delegates sent by the White House will host a talk titled “The Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation,” which will tout the supposed benefits of coal, natural gas and nuclear power.

A delegation of U.S. negotiators are expected to work in Bonn to help write the rulebook for the Paris agreement, but their presence will be awkward. It’s unclear if negotiators from other countries will be willing to listen to a White House, which, under Trump, would not abide by any rules that emerge.

The summit will feature some U.S. star power, however. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and billionaire activist Tom Steyer are funding a pavilion to showcase climate action by U.S. cities and businesses. The federal government usually pays the $200,000 or so cost of the showcase, but declined to do so this year.

“The American people and American industry are pretty much all behind doing what the Paris agreement is designed to do, and that is to cut the amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere so we will slow down and maybe even stop climate change, which has the potential to destroy the world,” Bloomberg told The New York Times last month.

Environmental groups and local governments around the U.S. reacted with fury following Trump’s decision to quit the Paris deal, but pledged to do their part to combat his agenda with or without federal support. Other world leaders have vowed to move forward regardless, and in July, every member of the G20, aside from the U.S., unveiled a detailed policy to abide by the Paris pact in a clear rebuke of the White House.

Wolfgang Rattay / Reuters People march during a demonstration two days before the start of the COP 23 UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, Nov. 4, 2017.

Trump, while a presidential candidate, notably called climate change a “hoax” manufactured by the Chinese and has long promised to end the “war” on fossil fuels. He has signed several executive orders rolling back environmental regulations on the energy industry and has promised an American future flush with “really clean coal.”

But, as HuffPost’s Alexander Kaufman reports, such energy doesn’t exist. Environmental groups have long called such rebranding a bait-and-switch by the coal lobby to try and revive an industry dying not due to regulation, but rather the rapidly falling cost of cleaner energy sources.

In fact, the solar industry employed far more people than the coal industry in 2016, according to numbers from the Department of Energy. Natural gas, a far cleaner fossil fuel product in terms of emissions, and oil production jobs are the two leading employers in the industry.

“There is no such thing as ‘clean coal,’” Travis Nichols, a spokesman for Greenpeace, told HuffPost in March. “It’s a myth used by the industry to get taxpayer money in order to prop up a dying industry. It’s worse than pixie dust and hope, it’s coal dust and nope. Coal miners deserve a just transition, not snake oil and empty promises.”

Countries gathered in Bonn already understand this. Many of the world’s biggest economies, including China and India, are on track to meet their emissions-reduction targets years earlier than expected, and both have invested heavily in renewable energy.

The talks in Bonn will be relatively low key compared with prior summits, as countries work to refine guidelines and review procedures to ensure signatories are meeting their commitments.

Mach dir klar, dass es Zeit brauchen wird, es zu schaffen - aber du schaffst das!","""Phubbing"" heißt, dass wir jemanden wegen unseres Handys ignorieren

Viele von uns haben wahrscheinlich selbst schon mal ""gephubbed""

Im Video seht ihr, welche anderen Anzeichen es für eine scheiternde Beziehung gibt

Ein Date kann fast schon nicht mehr deprimierender werden als dieses: Eine Klientin der Eheberaterin Christine Wilke war so sehr in ihr Handy vertieft, dass sie nicht mal bemerkt hatte, dass das Date vorbei war.

“Sie hatte ein ernsthaftes Problem mit ihrem Smartphone und hat es nach diesem Essen mit ihrem Freund bemerkt”, sagt die Therapeutin aus Pennsylvania.

“Meine Klientin war in ihrem Bildschirm versunken und als sie aufsah, hatte ihr Partner schon längst bezahlt und wartete an der Tür auf sie.”

Diese Frau hat ganz extremes “phubbing” betrieben - ihren Partner ignoriert und nur ihrem Handy die Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt.

Das Wort “phubbing” setzt sich aus den englischen Wörtern “phone”, also Handy, und “snubbing”, jemanden oder etwas ignorieren, zusammen.

Und dieses Verhalten scheint sich immer mehr zu verbreiten und sich in unser Leben einzuschleichen - vor allem in Beziehungen.

Wenn der Partner eine Affäre mit dem Handy hat

In einer neuen Studie der Baylor Universität wurden 143 Paare gefragt, wie oft ihre Interaktionen mit ihrem Partner durch ihr Handy unterbrochen wurde.

70 Prozent gaben “manchmal”, “oft”, “sehr oft” oder “ständig” an.

In einer weiterführenden Umfrage mit 145 Menschen gaben 22,6 Prozent an, dass “phubbing” in ihrer Beziehung zu Streit geführt habe. 36,6 Prozent gaben an, dass sie sich deprimiert fühlen, wenn sie das Gefühl haben, dass ihr Partner ihr Handy über sie stellt.

Wilkes bekommt dieses frustrierende Schauspiel die ganze Zeit in ihrer Praxis zu sehen. “Die Paare, die zu mir kommen, haben ein starkes Verlangen, eine starke Verbindung zueinander aufzubauen oder sie zu vertiefen - aber ihre Handys haben ihr Leben übernommen”, erklärt die Therapeutin.

“Oft erzählen sie mir dann, dass es sich anfühlt, als hätte ihr Partner eine Affäre mit dem Smartphone.” Eine Beziehung vor einem Bildschirm zu führen, ist zweifellos keine Art und Weise zu leben.

Wilkes und andere Eheberater und Therapeuten geben deshalb ihre besten Ratschläge, wie ihr eurer “phubbing” in den Griff bekommen könnt:

1. Hört auf zu denken, dass ihr euer komplettes Date auf Snapchat und Instagram teilen müsst

“Eine Sache fasziniert mich immer wieder (als Therapeut macht sie mich allerdings eher traurig): Ein Paar geht zusammen aus, aber eine Person ist ständig damit beschäftigt, Bilder zu teilen, anstatt dem anderen Aufmerksamkeit zu schenken.

Social Media hat viele Vorteile, aber es kann auch dazu führen, dass die Menschen sofortige Bestätigung suchen, anstatt einfach mit dem Moment zufrieden zu sein, in dem sie sich gerade befinden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Liebe Konzertfans, packt endlich eure verdammten Smartphones weg!

Wenn du auch einer der Übeltäter von “Schau mich an!”-Postings bist, anstatt die gemeinsame Zeit mit deinem Partner zu genießen, solltest du dich bemühen, Disziplin zu lernen.

Hör auf, so besessen von Likes zu sein. Das heißt natürlich nicht, dass du kein süßes Selfie von euch posten kannst.

Aber halte dich einfach mit dem Posten zurück, bis das Date vorbei ist - oder, wenn es sein muss, warte, bis dein Partner auf die Toilette verschwindet. ― Carin Goldstein, Eheberaterin und Familientherapeutin aus Sherman Oaks, Kalifornien

2. Lass dein Handy mal für 30 Minuten am Tag liegen

“Eine der Aufgaben, die ich meinen Paaren mitgebe, ist eine 30-minütige “Elektronik-freie-Zone” zu schaffen - jeden Tag.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Digitalisierung - Fluch und Segen zugleich

In dieser Zeit können sie wertvolle gemeinsame Zeit verbringen, ohne gestört oder abgelenkt zu werden. Diese 30 Minuten werden über die Zeit hinweg länger, denn es wirkt wie eine Pause, die die Paare sehr schätzen.” ― Christine Wilke

3. Bring dein technisches Time Out aufs nächste Level: Handy-Freier Wochenend-Trip

“Ich arbeitete mit einem Pärchen, das über ein Wochenende nach Palm Springs vereisen wollte. Gemeinsam haben wir ein paar Regeln erstellt, was die Elektronik betrifft: Die Handys müssen das ganze Wochenende aus bleiben und in ihren Koffern bleiben.

Jeder darf sein Handy einmal am Tag für fünf Minuten an machen - das ist genug Zeit um kurz seine Nachrichten zu checken und sicher zu gehen, dass einen zu Hause kein Weltuntergang erwartet.

Als das Wochenende vorbei war, schwärmten sie davon, wie viel mehr sie die kleinen Dinge schätzen gelernt haben, der erfrischende Pool, gemeinsam lachen und tiefe, verbundene Intimität.” ― Spencer Scott, Psychologe aus Santa Monica, California



4. Wenn sich dein Partner “gephubbed” fühlt, erkenne es an und höre auf damit

“Ihr solltet ausmachen, dass ihr es euch gegenseitig sagt, wenn ihr euch “gephubbed” fühlt oder einen “phubbing”-Rückfall habt.

Wir verlieren uns alle gerne mal in den Tiefen des Bildschirms, es kann also schnell passieren, dass wir es gar nicht bemerken, dass wir es schon wieder machen.

Es ist wichtig seinem Partner zuzuhören und sein Smartphone zur Seite zu legen, wenn der andere das Gefühlt hat, dass du “phubbst” - das ist ein wichtiger Schritt in die richtige Richtung für eine gesunde Beziehung.” ― Kristin Zeising, Psychologin aus San Diego, Kalifornien



5. Dein Smartphone ist nicht dein Gegner

“Das mag gegen die eigene Intuition sein, aber wenn du das Verlangen nach Zeit und Aufmerksamkeit hast, versuche nicht zu denken, dass dein Handy das Problem ist - sondern sieh es als einen Teil der Lösung an.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Dieses lustige Video macht auf die Gefahren von Smartphones aufmerksam - und es hat eine wichtige Botschaft

Fürsorgliche Nachrichten über den Tag verteilt, oder Snapchats, die nur zwei Sekunden dauern, können eine schöne Erinnerung daran sein, dass du und dein Partner über den Tag hinweg aneinander denkt. Es hilft vielleicht auch, sich so weniger isoliert und gereizt zu fühlen.” ― Spencer Scott

6. Mach dir klar, dass es nicht so einfach sein wird, dein Handy wegzulegen

“Es ist ein Suchtverhalten - es ist nicht so einfach, damit aufzuhören. Mach dir klar, dass es Zeit brauchen wird, es zu schaffen - aber du schaffst das! Am Anfang wirst du noch eine sogenannte kognitive Dissonanz spüren.

Deine Gewohnheit, wie du dein Handy benutzt, zu unterbrechen wird sich falsch für dich anfühlen.

Es wird ungefähr einen Monat dauern, bis sich die neue Gewohnheit - deinen Liebsten, Freunden und Familie Aufmerksamkeit in Person zu geben und nicht über dein Handy - natürlich anfühlt.

Aber vertrau mir: das wird es wert sein.” ― Barbara Melton, Beraterin aus Charleston, South Carolina

Ask any Delhi resident these days to describe the city's summer weather and they will report ""scorching hot"" conditions, but for those who check their mobile weather app the current conditions reveal a more sinister story that goes well beyond the record-breaking heat. Dust. Smoke. Haze. These are the words one sees instead of the usual expected adjectives of ""cloudy,"" ""sunny"" or ""rainy"" alongside temperatures reading in the 40s Celsius. The sky outside doesn't always reveal the entire story when it comes to the air we are breathing. Air that is often filled with tiny, dangerous particles that harm our health, particularly the most vulnerable--children and the elderly.

Declared the world's most polluted city by the World Health Organization in 2014, Delhi's air leaves a lot to be desired. There are plenty of villains in this air apocalypse: outdated fuel standards for our vehicles yield astronomical emissions; nearby factories, coal and gas plants sputter out toxic smoke; annual crop burning in neighbouring states is so massive in scale that NASA can track it from space; waste burning both inside our local colonies and massive landfills spews poisonous fumes every day.

[Children's] lungs are not fully developed until their late teens and they breathe more air per kilo of body weight. That means more harmful particles entering their body.

One thing has become apparent after two rounds of odd-even car rationing--it's going to take more than a two-week episode of limited car restrictions to clean up our air. And it's going to take a dedicated proactive strategy on an individual level to protect our family's health. To live in Delhi and guard your health ""pollution control"" is not a politician's PR campaign--it must be a personal mantra, a daily mind-set and regular habit. If it's not already, it certainly should be especially for those of us with young children.

When I first started talking to experts about air pollution, I learned an eye-opening fact: air pollution is not always visible. The sky does not always reveal whether the air outside is ""good"" or ""bad."" Tiny particles suspended in the air made of harmful materials can travel hundreds of miles before they settle and are ultimately inhaled, travelling deeply into our lungs and entering our blood stream. And children are more vulnerable. Their lungs are not fully developed until their late teens and they breathe more air per kilo of body weight. That means more harmful particles entering their lungs, bloodstream and wreaking havoc over the short and long term on their body.

My heart was shredded when my otherwise uber-healthy eight year old recently developed breathing difficulties and had to be started on inhalers.

As a mother to three young children, a professional and a person who loves to get off the sofa and get outside to move, Delhi's air concerns me. A lot. I go to sleep at night and wake up most mornings wondering what outdoor activities we should shorten or reschedule altogether. I think twice before opening the windows until I've checked my air quality apps to see what air I might be letting into my home. I wonder if it's just a coincidence that I have nearly year-round allergies and a dry cough after a four-decade-long allergy-free, healthy life. And my heart was shredded when my otherwise uber-healthy eight year old recently developed breathing difficulties and had to be started on inhalers.

Short of packing up and leaving town what is one to do? When faced with an obstacle we try to tackle it. Or so I was taught from childhood. There is always a solution. So I've tried to learn a lot about this health and environmental emergency facing India and many other countries too. Many solutions are beyond our reach as individual citizens. They require institutional changes by government and improvements to local infrastructure. But there are, thankfully, some things we can do. There are some short-term, interim measures we can take to help safeguard our health, and the health of our children, from air pollution.

Avoid aerobic activity during the ""bad"" air times. That typically means early morning and late afternoon and evenings.

So how can we protect our little ones from taking the brunt of the bad air in our city? Well for starters, keep a few things in mind:

1) Check the readings. Download real-time air-quality apps to monitor hourly readings and even see forecasts for the next day. Check out: http://safar.tropmet.res.in/ or http://aqicn.org/city/delhi/r.k.-puram/

2) Avoid aerobic activity during the ""bad"" air times. That typically means early morning and late afternoon and evenings. Talk to the coach about moving the children's cricket, tennis or football practice to late morning timings. Perhaps on weekends and school holidays a midday indoor AC environment is possible. Try ice skating, for example, at the Ambience Mall in Gurgaon for better air while also getting a break from the searing heat.

3) Talk to your child's school. Ask them to monitor air quality both inside the class room and outside. Then encourage them to adjust outdoor sports and activities to help limit exposure during the bad air times. Ask them to create ""idle-free zones"" on the streets outside the school gates to reduce ""pollution hot spots"" in the places where the children walk and wait on a daily basis.

4) Look into buying a high-quality face mask for your child. These can filter out dangerous airborne particles. Look for either N95 or N99 rated masks and be sure the fit is secure with no outside gaps to let outside air in. The gap would negate the positive benefit and protection from the mask by allowing pollutant particles back in.

5) Consider an indoor HEPA air filter for your home, specifically for your child's bedroom. This would ensure 8-10 hours of sleeping time with cleaner air for your little one. There are some great options on the market from the affordable SmartAir filter at ₹3,000 to the pricier options from Smart and BlueAir. Best to look for air-cleaning devices with HEPA filters, the only ones that can remove PM 2.5 particles from the air.

On my last night in Puerto Rico, I have dinner with a businessman who’s lived in San Juan for decades.","ADJUNTAS, Puerto Rico — In the final frantic days before Hurricane Maria devastated this small town in the mountains of central Puerto Rico, Rosana Aviles Marin did everything she could to help her elderly parents prepare for what was coming.

She brought in food and water, and used plywood to reinforce the walls and roof of their modest two-story cement house. It didn’t matter. The winds of up to 155 miles per hour that roared across the island buckled the house’s walls and tore holes in the ceiling, letting in water that destroyed furniture, framed photos of Marin and her siblings, and brightly colored ceramic statues of Jesus.

That wasn’t all it destroyed. The storm also downed power lines throughout the area, and Marin and her parents have been entirely without electricity for weeks. Much of their food went bad, they have no cellphone service, and local markets and restaurants remain closed. Her parents use a small diesel generator to power lights and, for a few hours per day, a small refrigerator. The rest of the time, she tells me during a recent trip to the area, “my parents live in darkness.”

They aren’t the only ones. Hurricane Maria, one of the strongest ever to hit Puerto Rico, caused unprecedented damage to the island’s already fragile power grid. Four weeks after making landfall, roughly 79 percent of the island still doesn’t have electricity.

Local and federal officials say it will be months before the power is fully restored, and they acknowledge that in some places it could take far longer because their crews have yet to even reach the hardest-hit areas. The head of Puerto Rico’s debt-ridden power utility says repairs will cost $5 billion; some officials privately tell me the figure will be far higher.

With the national grid down for the foreseeable future, generators are in such high demand that their prices have skyrocketed, putting them out of reach of many average Puerto Ricans. There are regular reports of generators being stolen from outside homes and businesses.

Walking through the walled neighborhood of Old San Juan, the island’s main tourist attraction, I see police officers installing floodlights in a central square and then flipping on a shiny new generator. One of the officers tells me he’ll be there all night to keep an eye on the equipment. “It would otherwise be gone by morning,” he says, shrugging.

Electricity is something you don’t notice until it’s gone. On the mainland, where power outages are rare and brief, Americans are used to simply flipping a switch and watching the light come on, plugging in an air conditioner and feeling the cold air, and trusting that your refrigerator will keep fresh food and milk from going bad.

When the power goes out, that sense of comfort quickly disappears. The parts of daily life that were once taken for granted are suddenly gone, with no clear sense of when they’ll be back. To not have power — to be literally and figuratively in the dark — is to leave the modern world and retreat into an older and more precarious one. In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, that’s Puerto Rico’s new normal.

The lack of electricity doesn’t simply mean months of hardship for the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Rican who will be without air conditioners, fans, televisions, and refrigerators for the foreseeable future. It’s also significantly slowing the entire US relief effort, and preventing other vital parts of the island’s battered infrastructure from coming back online.

Internet and cellphone service can’t be fully restored without a steady flow of electricity to individual cell towers. The pumps, filtration systems, and other equipment used to treat sewage and provide clean drinking water also can’t function without power. Right now, those plants aren’t receiving much of it.

The lack of electricity is significantly slowing the entire US relief effort on Puerto Rico. Cellphone networks and water systems won’t come back online without it.

“People need to understand this is not something that can be turned on tomorrow,” José Sánchez, who is leading the Army Corps of Engineers’ program to restore the grid, tells me in an interview in San Juan. “This something that’s going to take months to fix. We’re dealing with a very tender system, a very sensitive system, and it will require a lot of work to get it back up.”

Sánchez, a soft-spoken man who uses the precise language of a trained engineer, says the Corps could eventually bring at least 500 of its employees to the island, alongside 1,000 private contractors. He was born in Puerto Rico, and says the effort to bring power back is deeply personal for him. The island can’t recover, much less prosper, without it.

“I think of electricity like water, as a basic need and a basic requirement to have a semi-normal life,” he tells me. “Electricity is the linchpin of everything.”

That means the lack of electricity is a literal life-and-death issue — and one that may wind up killing more Puerto Ricans than the storm itself. The island’s government says 48 people died because of the hurricane, but my colleagues Eliza Barclay and Alexia Fernández Campbell estimate that the real death toll from the storm is probably well into the hundreds.

That number could spike even higher if the blackouts continue because the island needs electricity to operate its water and sewage systems; if the grid remains offline, huge numbers of Puerto Ricans will be at real risk of dying from heatstroke, dehydration, or exposure to contaminated water.

In a darkened Puerto Rico, where cellphones don’t work and clean water doesn’t flow, there’s never been more of a need for electricity. It’s also never been in such short supply — or so difficult and expensive to bring back.

Puerto Rico’s power system was a mess before Maria. Now it’s barely clinging to life.

President Trump’s slow and halting response to the Puerto Rico crisis has been widely criticized, with a new poll showing that public approval for Trump’s handling of recent hurricanes has plummeted by 20 points in less than a month. (Trump himself, it should be noted, rates his response as a “10.”)

Trump has also been hammered for a series of recent tweets that appeared to blame Puerto Rico itself for the island’s current woes. One said “Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble.” Another said “it’s [sic] old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated.”

But here’s the thing: The substance of what Trump said about the electrical grid was largely correct. The island's grid is antiquated and hasn’t received any major upgrades in years. Power outages were a regular part of daily life on the island even before the storm (a 2016 report found they were four to five times more common on the island than in the mainland US). Maria has made those shortfalls exponentially worse, but it didn’t cause them.

Battered by Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico has never needed electricity more but had less of it

The reasons have to do with geography and money. Puerto Rico’s biggest power generators are on the south of the island, but most of its inhabitants live on the north side, primarily in San Juan. There are four high-capacity transmission lines that carry power from the south to the north, and they pass through the center part of the island, the region Marin calls home. The problem is that central Puerto Rico is mountainous, full of huge swaths of thick forest, and mainly reachable only by driving on terrifyingly narrow dirt roads.

That makes it hard to reach those four vital lines even in the best of circumstances. In post-Maria Puerto Rico it’s even harder, because the center of the island was the region hardest hit by the hurricane. Since the government is trying to get power to San Juan first, that means those in the regions devastated most by the hurricane will be waiting the longest for power to be restored. Sánchez, the engineer, says workers would need to be flown in by helicopter to clear debris before repairs could even begin. As of now, three of those four lines are inoperable.

The second major problem is a financial one. PREPA, the island’s widely despised electric utility, hasn’t done any major upgrades to the grid in decades. The median age of the island’s power plants is 44 years, more than double the normal industry standard of 18 years, according to a report from FiveThirtyEight. The plants are so old that it’s hard to find replacement parts when individual pieces of equipment break down.

It’s also difficult to find workers who know how to keep that aging equipment up and running. Vox’s Fernández Campbell reported last month that PREPA has lost thousands of workers in recent years, including 600 — fully a tenth of its workforce — this past April alone.

Ricardo Ramos, who runs PREPA, says that bringing the grid back to its pre-Maria state could cost up to $5 billion. The problem is that the utility itself is more than $9 billion in debt and filed for bankruptcy this past summer.

That means money for repairs, let alone upgrades, can only really come from two places.

One is Congress, which passed legislation in mid-October authorizing $36.5 billion in hurricane and wildfire relief. The package included $4.9 billion in loans for Puerto Rico’s cash-strapped government, which filed for a form of bankruptcy in May. Lawmakers from Florida and Texas have indicated that they’re going to ask for tens of billions of dollars more, though it’s not clear if Congress will sign off on the additional money, or how much of it would make its way to Puerto Rico.

The other way to raise funds is through higher rates on the utility’s customers, but the Puerto Rico Energy Commission, which oversees PREPA, might not sign off on them. There are also legitimate concerns that Puerto Ricans, who already pay some of the highest electricity rates in the US and are now facing widespread unemployment because of the storm, won’t be able to afford to pay them.

José Román Morales, the head of the commission, tells me that the island needs to find a way to get the old system back to its pre-Maria state — which would bring power back to desperate citizens sooner — while looking for ways to modernize and upgrade it.

“That’s the main topic of conversation at the moment,” he says. “There’s an emergency that needs to be addressed, and we need to get power to the hospitals and other essential institutions for life on this island. But stopping there isn’t enough. One way or another, we have to make the grid more resilient and energy-efficient.”

Renewable energy is one appealing option, since the island has an abundance of sun and wind. Tesla founder Elon Musk says he can build a new and more efficient grid that would use solar power to generate electricity.

Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló says he wants to talk to Musk in more detail, but it’s not clear who would pay for Musk’s proposed system given that both the electrical utility and the island itself have declared bankruptcy. (Rosselló has also promised to bring power back to 95 percent of the island by Christmas, a deadline US officials here dismiss as unrealistic.)

As Vox’s Umair Irfan notes, building a grid centered on renewable energy would almost certainly be more expensive than reconstituting the flawed system that was there before the storm. That means “the default solution — rebuilding the island’s electrical grid the way it was — may end up becoming the likeliest scenario,” he explains.

For now, the military and civilian officials working to pull Puerto Rico back from the brink are focused on bringing powerful generators to the island. Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, the three-star Army general leading US military relief efforts in Puerto Rico, says civilian personnel are surveying hospitals, water plants, and sewage treatment facilities to find out which facilities have generators that are already working, which have ones in of need repair, and which don’t have any at all.

“If they don't have a generator, do they need one, and can we bring one in?” he tells me. “And when we talk generators, I'm not talking your little Honda one. I’m talking about massive generators, like the size of a semi-truck.”

FEMA has already installed 100 generators at individual hospitals, sewage treatment plants, and water pumping facilities. It plans to bring in up to 400 more, according to officials on the ground here.

Generators are a short-term fix, however; a permanent solution will take far longer.

That is, in part, because of the technological hurdles to generating renewable energy on the island — especially in the aftermath of the hurricane.

A high-tech wind farm is ready to start producing power. Here’s why it can’t.

On a sweltering day in mid-October, Ruben Rivera drives his cluttered pickup truck down the mottled mud roads that run through his company’s wind farm in Santa Isabel, in the far south of Puerto Rico. As we make our way across the property, Rivera points to row after row of towering white wind turbines.

Built by the German industrial giant Siemens at a cost of more than $2 million apiece and capable of adjusting themselves to keep pace with shifting wind patterns, the 44 wind turbines at Santa Isabel are some of the most advanced on earth. They also, to Rivera’s surprise, made it through the hurricane without a single scratch or dent.

Rivera, who runs the facility on behalf of its owner, California-based Pattern Energy, lives about 90 minutes away from Santa Isabel. He rode out the storm at home with his wife and children, and waited until the worst of the weather had passed before setting off for the wind farm, afraid of what he’d find.

“I was counting the number of turbines on the drive down because I kept thinking that we must have lost some,” he tells me. “But then I saw that they were all still standing, and that they looked intact. We’ve checked the turbines and blades, and I haven’t seen any damage. They’re ready to go”

Rivera stops his pickup truck next to one of the turbines, clambers up a metallic staircase, takes the padlock off a small door, and steps inside the towering structure.

The interior is spotless, with a ladder extending up through a hole in the ceiling that can be used to climb to the very top of the 24-story tower. The power is generated by three long, tapered white blades, and then brought down to the base of the structure by a thick bundle of cables that connect to a large metallic box a few feet from the door. Rivera points to the floor, where other cables carry the power out of the turbine and then onto the grid. There isn’t a speck of dirt, despite the fact that one of the strongest hurricanes in US history roared though the area less than a month ago.

There also isn’t any noise. The turbines are in perfect working order and could be a vital source of energy for the power-starved island. Except that they can’t actually be turned on without a small amount of electricity from the grid — which, of course, isn’t currently capable of providing it.

When the grid eventually comes back online, the wind farm will be able to provide power to about 35,000 homes. Until then, the blades aren’t turning.

Rivera, in the meantime, spends his time checking, and rechecking, each turbine so they can be turned on as soon as the power starts flowing again. He’s on a clock. Siemens, the manufacturer, says the turbines can’t sit idle for more than six weeks without potentially damaging the equipment. The hurricane slammed into Puerto Rico almost a month ago, so each day brings that deadline closer.

“It’s frustrating coming to the site and trying to provide energy to the grid but not being able to because we’re still waiting for the power to come back,” Rivera tells me. “The equipment is ready to go. We’re ready to go. But I don’t know when we’ll be able to start back up again.”

Puerto Rico’s medical system is being reshaped by the hurricane

The lack of electricity is reshaping Puerto Rican life in ways big and small. It’s also forcing many here to improvise solutions to problems they never thought they’d face.

The community health center in Loíza, a small town about 20 minutes outside of San Juan, is a low-slung gray building set just off the main road. When I visit it on a warm, cloudy day in October, the facility is eerily quiet and empty. The TVs are turned off, the information booth is empty, and steel shutters cover the windows of the pharmacy.

The medical center is still in operation, however, though at a severely reduced capacity than it had been before the storm. Dr. María Rodríguez, who runs the facility, has worked there in various capacities for 24 years. She says she expected the storm to be bad but was still taken aback by the hurricane’s destructive power.

She leads me back to her cluttered office, which is filled with overflowing boxes of medical supplies, diapers, baby formula, Purell hand sanitizer, and small packets of children’s multivitamins shaped like gummy bears. A pile of shrink-wrapped sleeping bags sits on the floor near her desk. “My office has become a distribution center,” she says with a half-smile.

In the weeks since the storm, Rodríguez and her staff have worked with Loíza’s municipal government to ensure a steady supply of the diesel needed to power the center’s generators. Most parts of the center — from OB-GYN services to its primary care clinic — are functioning, though for fewer hours and without air conditioning.

The medical center, though, is rapidly changing its normal ways of doing business in order to adapt to the new reality on the ground. Rodríguez tells me that many local residents have lost their homes and are living in large communal shelters. They may not know the medical center is open; even if they do, they often have no way of getting here.

In response, Rodríguez is sending doctors and nurses to the shelters, which are already seeing periodic outbreaks of infectious diseases such as conjunctivitis and parasite-borne skin diseases like scabies. That’s a new approach for the medical center, but Rodríguez feels like she’d be letting down her community if she didn’t experiment with alternative methods of delivering care. “This is our new normal,” she says.

The lack of power is changing life on Puerto Rico. It will take a long time for it to change back.

On the outskirts of Loíza, several concrete pylons that once held power lines lie shattered on the side of the road, a loose tangle of metallic rebar sticking up from the wreckage. Work crews are out installing new wooden poles, but there are dozens — in both directions — that still need to be replaced. The repair work will take weeks, and Loíza is only one small town on an island teeming with larger ones.

Back in San Juan, the only part of the city with steady and reliable electricity is the area surrounding the city’s gleaming convention center, which is now the headquarters for the military and civilian relief effort. The power is also on at the Sheraton hotel across the street, as well as in its bustling casino, which has one of the few ATMs on the island that is still distributing cash.

The light starts to fade as I drive away from the convention center and make my way through blackened streets lined with shuttered restaurants and stores. A small number of houses, office buildings, and apartment buildings have their own generators, but it’s possible to drive for blocks without seeing any lights.

On my last night in Puerto Rico, I have dinner with a businessman who’s lived in San Juan for decades. He’s survived other hurricanes, but he’s not sure the island will bounce back from this one. At 11:15, he excuses himself and says he needs to start heading home to make sure he’s off the roads before the city’s midnight curfew goes into effect. He has a long drive ahead of him, and the trip back always takes longer in the dark.",Darkness: life in Puerto Rico without electricity,https://www.vox.com/2017/10/23/16501164/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-power-water-sewage-trump

The Duchy of Lancaster, the private estate of the Queen, was found to have millions of pounds invested in offshore arrangements.

Around £10m from the Queen’s private fund was paid into funds in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda between 2004 and 2005, according to the so-called Paradise Papers leak.

Corbyn suggested the Queen’s finances should fall within the scope of an investigation into the leak.

Asked on Monday if the Queen should apologise, Corbyn said:

“Anyone that is putting money into tax havens in order to avoid taxation in Britain, and obviously investigations have to take place, should do two things: not just apologise for it but also recognise what it does to our society. “If a very wealthy person wants to avoid taxation in Britain and therefore put money into a tax haven somewhere, who loses? Schools, hospitals, housing, all those public services lose and the rest of the population have to pay to cover up the deficit created by that.”

A spokesman for the Labour leader said Corbyn did not mean the Queen should say sorry herself.

“Jeremy did not call for the Queen to apologise, but said anyone who puts money into a tax haven to avoid paying tax should, and that they should recognise the damage done by avoidance to society,” the spokesman said.

Later he told Bloomberg TV there should be “an inquiry into all the revelations about the Paradise Papers”.

Asked if that included the Queen, Mr Corbyn replied: “Everybody. The Royal Household are subject to taxation. I don’t know what has happened in that case. These issues all must be part of that.”

La compañera de reparto de Wolfhard en la primera temporada de la serie, Shannon Purser, también ha manifestado su opinión en Twitter:Vale, no.","La actriz de Juego de Tronos Sophie Turner ha roto una lanza a favor de los protagonistas de Stranger Things. La defensa llega tras la polémica surgida con el joven actor Finn Wolfhard, de 14 años, que interpreta a Mike Wheeler en la serie. El intérprete salió del hotel donde se hospedaba durante la gira promocional y se encontró con numerosos fans esperándole para pedirle fotos y autógrafos.

El actor pasó de largo junto a su guardaespaldas y los fans reaccionaron diciéndole que eso era ""de mala educación"" y grabándole un vídeo increpándole en el que se veía como les ignoraba. A las horas del incidente, el vídeo se había convertido en viral con más de 3000 retuits en Twitter acompañado de la siguiente frase: ""¡Imagina que tienes 14 años y eres tan cruel que ni siquiera puedes detenerte ante tus fans que te hicieron famoso!"".

Ante la polémica generada, la actriz que interpreta a Sansa en Juego de Tronos, que empezó a grabar la serie de HBO a los 14 años, ha utilizado su cuenta de Twitter para defender al actor criticando también a aquellos adultos que presionan a los niños de esta manera.

En sus 11 tuits se podía leer la siguiente reivindicación:

Joder, ver a adultos esperando a los niños de Stranger Things en el hotel y acusándoles cuando no se paran con ellos es súperraro. Primero, ¿qué adulto en sus cabales espera a un niño fuera de su hotel? y segundo, ¿quién se ofende cuando el niño no se para? No importa si son actores, son ante todo niños. Dadles el espacio que necesitan para que crezcan sin pensar que deben hacer lo que sea a quien sea por cumplir sus sueños de la infancia. Oh, imagina que tú como padre vas con tu hijo o hija de 13 años y ves a un adulto enfocándole con la cámara del móvil. Harías lo que estuviese en tu mano para borrar la fotografía de esas personas y evitarle esa situación a tu hijo lo más pronto posible. No importa que ese chico sea actor y consienta que un equipo de grabación profesional le filme cuando interpreta un personaje. Eso no significa que consienta ser perseguido con una cámara en su cara. No me importa si piensas ""viene con el trabajo"". No, no lo hace. ¿Cómo te atreves a huir y degradar a un niño porque no pose para adultos desconocidos o que no se dirija a hablar con ellos cuando le están haciendo una foto que él no ha consentido? ¿No va eso en contra de lo que le enseñamos a nuestros hijos? Algunas personas deberían callarse.

Los tuis en lo que la actriz ha mostrado su apoyo a los protagonistas de la serie son los siguientes:

La actriz no ha sido la única que ha apoyado al joven reparto de la serie que acaba de estrenar su segunda temporada. La compañera de reparto de Wolfhard en la primera temporada de la serie, Shannon Purser, también ha manifestado su opinión en Twitter:

Vale, no. Ningún actor tiene la obligación de pararse con nadie. Finn es una persona increíblemente agradable, pero es un ser humano y también necesita descansar. Soy una adulta y no puedo imaginarme a esa edad ser apabullada por toda una multitud requiriendo atención. Resulta intimidatorio. He sufrido esto también en menor escala, obviamente, pero he tenido a gente esperándome en hoteles, aeropuertos... Como hermana mayor, cómo te atreves a hacer sentir culpable a unos jóvenes actores porque no puedan saludarte. Ellos te dan su arte, les encantan sus fans, no se distancian de ellos y si no puedes entender que necesitan espacio, apártate.

El hilo de tuits publicado actriz que da vida a Barb ha mostrado su apoyo a Wolfhard es el siguiente:

By continuing to associate Mr. Singer's name with our university, USC is openly supporting a man who has been publicly accused of reprehensible sexual misconduct.
USC has responded to Halaka's petition, saying they are taking it very seriously.
In a statement issued on Tuesday the University said:""We are aware of the Change.org petition and appreciate the concerns of our students and alumni.","Hollywood has been rocked by more and more scandals in the wake of allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct directed at Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey and now a group of students are taking matters into their own hands.

University of Southern California student Emily Halaka has started a Change.org petition asking that director Bryan Singer's name be removed from the USC School of Cinematic Arts. The petition alleges that Singer has been ""accused multiple times of sexual harassment, assault and pedophilia"".

""Despite Singer's philanthropic work for SCA, having his name attached to a division of the School of Cinematic Arts gives the impression that we, both as an institution and as members of the entertainment industry, value his financial contributions over the safety, respect and future of students.""

In early October it was reported that USC rejected a $5 million donation from Weinstein to grant scholarships to women after a similar Change.org petition demanded the university refuse to accept the money.

""As a woman at USC,"" the petition's creator Tiana Lowe wrote, ""the prospect that my university might sell an indulgence to ease Harvey Weinstein's non-existent guilt saddens me"".

Singer has worked on a bulk of 20th Century Fox's X-Men films.

That petition only had 599 supporters while Halaka's, at the time of writing, had over 1,700.

Halaka noted in her own description the refusal of Weinstein's money was a step in the right direction, yet demanded more action.

""Sexual harassment and assault are prevalent issues in Hollywood, the entertainment industry, and the American workplace as a whole, and they require action to catalyze change, little by little. By continuing to associate Mr. Singer's name with our university, USC is openly supporting a man who has been publicly accused of reprehensible sexual misconduct. Our university should promote education, respect, and consent, as well as prepare its students to be model members of the USC and entertainment communities, and this continued relationship with Mr. Singer publicly negates those values.

BuzzFeed's Adam B. Vary, who published the interview with actor Anthony Rapp in which he publicly alleged sexual misconduct against Kevin Spacey, wrote an in-depth feature on Singer's antics in 2014 after a lawsuit against the director alleged he had sexually assaulted an underage actor in 1999. Singer's lawyer called the case ""complete fabrications"".

Soon after the initial case a second lawsuit was filed in 2014 and again Singer denied the allegations. The first case was eventually dropped while the second accuser voluntarily dismissed their case against Singer.

USC has responded to Halaka's petition, saying they are taking it very seriously. In a statement issued on Tuesday the University said:

Angeblich sei seine Wohnung in Iserlohn zu teuer für das Jobcenter. So hieß es damals.

Eine Gesetzesänderung in den Wohnraumnutzungsbestimmungen (WNB) NRW zum 01.01.2010 begünstigte Sozialleistungsbezieher dahingehend, dass fortan Wohnungen bis 50 m² als angemessen zu gelten hätten.

Davor waren es nur 45 m². Bereits die Differenz von 5 m² machten eine Entschädigungssumme von monatlich 25,05 € aus.

""Alleinstehende Bezieher von Hartz-IV-Leistungen haben in NRW Anspruch auf 50 qm Wohnfläche"" bestätigte das Landessozialgericht Nordrhein-Westfalen (LSG NRW) in einem Urteil vom 16.5.2011 (L 19 AS 2202/10).

Das Ministerium für Arbeit, Integration und Soziales (MAIS) reagierte in einem Erlass vom 15.08.2012. Auch die Geschäftsführung des Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis wurde über die veränderte Rechtslage in Kenntnis gesetzt und zur Korrektur bestandskräftiger Leistungsbescheide von Amts wegen verpflichtet.

In dem Erlass heißt es unmissverständlich:

""II. Von Amts wegen sind bestandskräftige Leistungsbescheide nach § 22 SGB II mit Wirkung für die Vergangenheit nach § 44 SGB X iVm. § 40 SGB II zurückzunehmen, wenn die Rechte der Leistungsberechtigten infolge der Nichtanwendung der ab dem 01 .01.2010 geltenden WNB betroffen und Leistungen nach § 22 SGB II zu Unrecht nicht erbracht worden sind. Ggf. reicht die Rückwirkung in der Regel bis zum 01.01.2011.""

Mittels Überprüfungsantrag gem. § 44 SGB X hatte P. Vorsorge getroffen, dass auch für das Jahr 2010 keine bestandskräftigen Leistungsbescheide vorliegen. Damit erweiterte sich sein Rechtsanspruch automatisch um ein Jahr.

Dazu kam noch die Tatsache, dass das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis über kein „schlüssiges Konzept"" für die Ermittlung der Kosten der Unterkunft verfügte. (Auch das aktuelle Konzept der Firma Analyse & Konzepte ist derzeit noch beim LSG (L 6 AS 120/17) anhängig.)

Bereits die Weisung MAIS war eine Rechtsverletzung in der Absicht der Vermögensschädigung für Tausende von Betroffenen im Jahr 2010.

In den Mühlen der Rechtsverdreher - Jobcenter verweigert Erstattung

Existenzsichernde Sozialleistungen gibt es anscheinend nur auf dem Klageweg.

In der Zeit vom 08.07.2011 bis zum 26.11.2013 führte P. zwei KDU-Klagen vor dem Sozialgericht in Dortmund. In dieser Zeit wechselten dreimal die zuständigen Richter.

Zuletzt musste das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis den erfolgreichen Rechtsanwalt und für die Bewilligungszeiträume vom 01.08.2011-31.01.2012 (S 19 AS 4056/11; W 578/11) und vom 01.02.2012-31.07.2012 (S 19 AS 308/12, W 83/12) 12 x 48,40 € = 580,80 € bezahlen.

Trotz ministerialer Weisung vom 15.08.2012 verweigerte das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis Jahre lang die von Amts wegen angeordnete Erstattung von Januar 2011 bis Juli 2011, also weitere 7 Monate á 48,40 € = 338,80 €.

Am Donnerstag, den 17.07.2014 wurde ein weiteres Hauptsacheverfahren über die Nachzahlung der KDU für das Jahr 2010 im Sozialgericht Dortmund unter Vorsitz der Richterin Sülow verhandelt. Dabei ging es um den Beweis des fristgerechten Zugangs zweier Überprüfungsanträge.

Als Behördenvertreterin des Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis behauptete die Datenschutzbeauftragte Frau Andrea Sch. im Termin ""das Fax sei nicht zugegangen"". Diese Behauptung wurde ohne jeden belastbaren Beweis vorgetragen und völlig anhaltslos geglaubt.

Richterin Sülow schenkte der unbewiesenen Aussage mehr Glauben als dem Verfasser als Faxversender, obwohl nachweislich drei gesendete Faxe mit Datum, Uhrzeit und Nummer des Jobcenters an das Jobcenter Iserlohn gesandt worden waren.

Untätigkeitsklage trotz unstritigem Rechtsanspruch

Mit dieser Entwicklung hatte niemand gerechnet. 580,80 € verloren, weil die Jobcenter-Mitarbeiterin behauptete ""das Fax sei nicht zugegangen"".

Im Urteil des Sozialgericht Dortmund vom 17.07.2014 (S 19 AS 357/12) heißt es:

""Zur Begründung führt sie aus, ein Überprüfungsantrag vom 14.06.2011 sei dort weder bekannt noch zugegangen. Empfangsjournale des Faxgerätes mit der Nummer 02371/905799 für den 14.06.2011 seien bei dem Beklagten nicht mehr vorhanden.""

Damit wurde die Untätigkeitsklage für den Zeitraum 01.01.2010 bis 30.06.2011 über 48,40 € monatlich und damit insgesamt 871,20 Euro Existenzsichernde Leistungen abgewiesen, obwohl der Rechtsanspruch auf der Grundlage des WNB NRW unstrittig ist.

Spätere Recherchen zeichnen die Vorgänge jedoch klarer: Die Behauptung des Nichtzugangs des Antrags erfolgte durch die Datenschutzbeauftragte Frau Andrea Sch., die nicht einmal in dem Gebäude Friedrichstraße 59/61, sondern in der Brausestraße arbeitet, in dem das entsprechende Faxgerät steht.

Außerdem war wohl zum Zeitpunkt des Faxzugangs (21:37 Uhr) niemand mehr im Gebäude. Ob die betreffende Beklagtenvertreterin überhaupt nur einmal einen Faxeingang in der Hauptzentrale miterlebt hat? Von der Erfassung im ""Eingangsbuch"" ganz zu schweigen.

Als sicher gelten darf aber, dass die Reinigungskräfte das Büro häufiger betreten als die Wortführende ""Zeugin"" mit ihrer Behauptung.

Auch die Zeit der Faxübertragung, Dienstag, 14.06.2011 um 21:37 Uhr, lässt die Aussage der Jobcentervertreterin unglaubwürdig erscheinen.

Aber niemand ist so blind, wie der, der nicht sehen will.

Diese Behauptung des Nichtzugangs des Antrags wertete die Vorsitzende Richterin höher als die Aussage der Person, die das Fax versendet, die ordnungsgemäße Übertragung überprüft hat, die Eintragung der Übersendung eigens dokumentiert hat und anschließend den Überprüfungsantrag in den entsprechenden Ordner einlegt hat.

Berufungsverfahren bei Landessozialgericht in Essen

Am 03.04.2015 wurde eine Berufungsverhandlung beim LSG NRW verhandelt. Die Richter stellten auch einen gravierenden Rechtsverstoß in der Bescheidbearbeitung fest, was zu einer weiteren Nachzahlung von 338,80 € für die Zeit vom 01.01.2011-31.07.2011 führte, wollten aber keine Nachzahlung für das Jahr 2010 entscheiden.

Noch immer sind 580,80 € offen.

Und noch eine weitere Klagerunde

Nachdem weder das SG Dortmund noch das LSG NRW vollständig Abhilfe schaffen wollten, wurde ein drittes Mal in gleicher Sache der Rechtsweg über eine juristische Hintertür beschritten.



Am 01.07.2015 wurden zwei Überprüfungsanträge wegen der Ablehnungsbescheide vom 03.04.2012 & 16.04.2012 per Fax an je drei Faxgeräte im Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis (Fax: 02371 905-799; 905-848; 905-859) gesandt.

Um postalische Eingangsbestätigung der Überprüfungsanträge wurde ausdrücklich gebeten.

Am 03.08.2015, 31.08.2015, 05.10.2015, 28.10.2015, 30.11.2015 und 31.12.2015 erfolgten Erinnerungen. Zwei Faxe an jeweils drei Faxgeräte im Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis. - Ganz wie beim ersten Mal!

Siebenmal Sechs Fax-Anträge. Bei keinem der 42 Anträge erfolgte auch nur ein Bescheid. Nicht einmal eine Eingangsbestätigung. Aber diesmal ist jede einzelne Übersendung dokumentiert und das auch mit Bildvorschau und OK-Bestätigung.

Inzwischen ist eine weitere Untätigkeitsklage (Az.: S 14 AS 1515/16) anhängig und die Überprüfungsanträge sind aus der Akte verschwunden.

Non esiste neanche una legge italiana che preveda la possibilità di fare un testamento in cui le ""disposizioni anticipate di trattamento"" siano vincolanti.
La legge non può in nessun caso violare i limiti imposti dal rispetto della persona umana"".
Ad aprile di quest'anno la Camera dei Deputati ha adottato a larga maggioranza un disegno di legge che regolamenta il cosiddetto ""testamento biologico"".","I fatti sono noti: Fabiano Antoniani, un dj dall'intensa vita spensierata e spericolata, anni fa ha un incidente che lo rende tetraplegico e che progressivamente gli toglie anche la vista. Dopo un'esistenza a mille, ritrovarsi in quelle condizioni di crescente dolore psico-fisico gli fa prendere una decisione: salutare madre e fidanzata e porre fine alla propria presenza su questa terra.

Da solo però non ce la fa e si rivolge a Marco Cappato, che con Mina Welby e Gustavo Fraticelli da anni s'è messo a disposizione di chi desidera guadagnare una morte opportuna per cessare una vita non più degna d'esser vissuta. Cappato non si tira indietro e, dopo averlo accompagnato in Svizzera all'inizio del 2017, si auto-denuncia ai carabinieri di Milano assumendosi la responsabilità di aver dato seguito ai desideri di Fabo. I pubblici ministeri, due donne, chiedono l'archiviazione perché, in qualche modo, la ""dignità della vita"" è un diritto da riconoscere nel bene e nel male. Il giudice non concorda e chiede l'imputazione coatta per Cappato ritenendo che, oltre ad aver aiutato Fabo, il tesoriere dell'Associazione Luca Coscioni abbia rafforzato la volontà suicida dell'ex Dj.

Il nostro codice penale, retaggio del regime fascista, all'articolo 580 prevede che ""chiunque determina altri al suicidio o rafforza l'altrui proposito di suicidio, ovvero ne agevola in qualsiasi modo l'esecuzione, è punito con la reclusione da cinque a dodici anni"". Nel suo libro Credere Disobbedire e Combattere, tra le altre cose, Cappato racconta la vicenda nel dettaglio. Oggi, 8 novembre, inizia il processo a suo carico.

Non esiste una legge italiana che parli di eutanasia, esistono, come abbiamo visto, il reato dell'aiuto e istigazione al suicidio (il codice Rocco prevedeva addirittura la penalizzazione del suicidio!) e l'omicidio del consenziente. Non esiste neanche una legge italiana che preveda la possibilità di fare un testamento in cui le ""disposizioni anticipate di trattamento"" siano vincolanti. Esiste, come spesso in Italia, una zona grigia molto scura in cui il dolore delle persone viene gestito come si può nella speranza di trovare qualcuno che si muova a compassione o chiuda un occhio.

Eppure la Costituzione, quella ""più bella del mondo"", quella che ""non si tocca"" e che ""difenderemo colla lotta"", all'articolo 32 prevede che ""nessuno può essere obbligato a un determinato trattamento sanitario se non per disposizione di legge. La legge non può in nessun caso violare i limiti imposti dal rispetto della persona umana"".

Giuristi, accademici, avvocati - e cittadini - quando affrontano il tema sono, tutti a favore (almeno) di una regolamentazione che dia alle persone il diritto di essere libere di scegliere per se stesse fino alla fine. La Chiesa timidamente fa capolino sul fronte dei contrari ma senza eccessive convinzioni.

Ad aprile di quest'anno la Camera dei Deputati ha adottato a larga maggioranza un disegno di legge che regolamenta il cosiddetto ""testamento biologico"". Non si fa menzione dell'eutanasia, ma sicuramente si tratta, anzi si tratterebbe, di un importante passo avanti rispetto al contesto attuale - tratterebbe perché la legge è ferma in Senato in attesa che si trovi una giornata tra le poche che restano di questa XVII Legislatura per concludere il tutto. Senza niente togliere a nessuno, la questione è stata affidata alla Commissione sanità e non a quella Affari Costituzionali...

A fine ottobre, l'Associazione Luca Coscioni aveva organizzato una giornata di dibattito sugli aspetti costituzionali del ""Caso DJ Fabo"" - che forse andrebbe ora chiamato ""Caso Cappato"". In queste ore stanno arrivando sostegni da tutto il mondo all'azione di disobbedienza civile dell'ex eurodeputato Radicale a riconoscimento dell'importanza del suo operato e a favore della legalizzazione della libertà di scelta dei cittadini.

Bei den Jamaika-Verhandlern herrscht dicke Luft

Zwar machen die Grünen Kompromissangebote

Aus der CSU werden die aber harsch zurückgewiesen

Die Grünen strecken die Hand in Richtung FDP und Union aus. Doch gedankt wird es ihnen nicht.

Unmittelbar nach einem Angebot der Grünen, im Rahmen einer Einigung auf den bislang angestrebten festen Endtermin für Neuzulassungen von Verbrennungsmotoren zu verzichten, gab sich der CSU-Landesgruppenchef Alexander Dobrindt hart in der Sache und besonders rüde im Ton, berichtet die ""Süddeutschen Zeitung"".

Dobrindt sagte der ""SZ"": ""Wenn man Schwachsinnstermine abräumt, dann ist das ja noch kein Kompromiss.""

Seehofer hatte zuvor moderate Töne angeschlagen

Deutlicher kann man das Annäherungsangebot eines Gesprächspartners kaum ausschlagen. Dobrindts aggressive Haltung ist besonders bemerkenswert angesichts der Tatsache, dass sich der CSU-Vorsitzende Horst Seehofer bislang betont anders verhalten hat.

Auch am Dienstagmorgen schlug er moderate Töne an. Er sagte der ""SZ"", der Schritt der Grünen sei ""auf jeden Fall förderlich"". Eine Koalition bestehe immer aus einem Interessenausgleich, entsprechend sei der Start zur zweiten Runde ""sehr ansprechend und verheißungsvoll"".

Nur Stunden zuvor hatte Grünen-Chef Cem Özdemir in einem Zeitungsinterview angeboten, den festen Termin 2030 aufzugeben, sollten sich Union, FDP und Grüne in den Grundzügen in die richtige Richtung bewegen.

Grünen rücken von Maximalforderung ab

Der Stuttgarter Zeitung sagte Özdemir: ""Mir ist klar, dass wir alleine nicht das Enddatum 2030 für die Zulassung von fossilen Verbrennungsmotoren durchsetzen werden können.""

Statt des konkreten Datums für den Ausstieg verlangt die Umweltpartei nur noch ""ein klares Bekenntnis, dass wir alles dafür tun, um die Fahrzeuge der Zukunft - vernetzt, automatisiert und emissionsfrei - zu bekommen"".

Nach Informationen der ""SZ"" ist das keineswegs ein Alleingang Özdemirs, sondern in der großen Koordinierungsrunde seiner Partei vorab so besprochen worden.

Auch deshalb kritisierte der Grünen-Abgeordnete Dieter Janecek das Verhalten Dobrindts. Janecek twitterte: ""Solche Polemik ist nur Ausdruck der eigenen Verunsicherung der CSU. Die Menschen werden genau registrieren, wer glaubhaft um Lösungen ringt.""

Avant de devenir l'une des stars de la série Netflix ""Stranger Things"", l'actrice, qui interprète Joyce Byers depuis deux saisons, a eu une jeunesse difficile. Comme de nombreux adolescents, elle a dû faire face au harcèlement scolaire et à l'ignorance totale de son établissement face aux agissements de ses camarades.

Winona Ryder a raconté avoir été harcelée parce qu'elle portait des vêtements masculins. Son histoire, retranscrite dans un tweet posté par une internaute le 5 novembre, est rapidement devenue virale sur les réseaux sociaux.

""Je portais un vieux costume de garçon de l'Armée du Salut. Alors que je me rendais aux toilettes, j'ai entendu des gens lancer: ""Salut tapette."" Ils m'ont plaqué la tête contre un casier. Je suis tombée par terre et ils ont commencé à me passer à tabac. J'ai eu des points de suture. Le collège m'a virée, pas mes harceleurs.""

Son histoire ressemble à tant d'autres... Mais Winona Ryder a eu sa revanche. Elle poursuit son récit en expliquant que, des années plus tard, elle s'est retrouvée face à l'une de ses harceleuses dans un café. Cette dernière, reconnaissant l'actrice, lui a demandé un autographe. Cependant, Winona Ryder n'avait pas oublié le visage de celle qui l'avait frappée: ""Tu te souviens de moi? Étant enfant, tu m'avais tabassée quand on était en cinquième?"". La concernée a alors reconnu s'en souvenir plus ou moins. L'actrice tenait sa revanche et a asséné: ""C'était bien moi. Va te faire voir"". Mic drop, Ryder a gagné.

Son histoire a su émouvoir les internautes, et le tweet la partageant a atteint plus de 160.000 partages et 518.000 mentions ""j'aime"". De nombreux témoignages de soutien ont été diffusés et d'autres personnes ont fait part de leurs propres expériences d'harcèlement. Certains ont même souligné la ressemblance frappante entre l'actrice et Will Byers, le fils du personnage qu'elle interprète dans ""Stranger Things"".

""Ce moment où tu réalises que Will Byers ressemble trop à Winona Ryder quand elle était adolescente. Ce casting est parfait.""

À l'origine, Winona Ryder racontait cette anecdote dans le livre biographique ""Winona Ryder: The Biography"", publié en 1998. D'après l'auteur, Nigel Goodall, cet incident serait survenu trois jours après la rentrée de l'actrice en cinquième dans le collège Kenilworth Junior High de Petaluma, en Californie.

Winona Ryder ajoute par ailleurs qu'elle présumait que ses harceleurs pensaient qu'elle était un garçon homosexuel. Mais même après leur avoir annoncé qu'elle était une fille, ils ont continué à la harceler. D'après l'ouvrage de Nigel Goodall, elle aurait eu plusieurs côtes fracturées et six points de suture à la tête.

L'interprète de Joyce Byers n'a jamais caché son ancien look. Elle explique par ailleurs que sa coupe lui a permis de se faire repérer pour de nombreux rôles. Sur Instagram, il n'est donc pas rare de tomber sur des photos d'elle adolescente, arborant ses cheveux courts.

Une publication partagée par Winona Ryder (@winonaryderofficial) le 1 Sept. 2017 à 5h03 PDT

""Petit look de gars""

Ce look a fait craquer des acteurs comme Rob Lowe ou encore Christian Slater dans les années 80, alors que Winona Ryder était adolescente. Mais même après avoir rencontré le succès avec le film ""Beetlejuice"", où elle interprète le personnage de Lydia, l'actrice a continué a être harcelée par ses camarades: ""Beetlejuice a rendu les choses encore pires. Ils m'appelaient la sorcière.""

Ses harceleurs ne doivent pas se sentir fiers aujourd'hui...

SANTÉ - Une personne sur cinq souffre dans sa vie d'un épisode dépressif et pourtant la prise en charge de la dépression n'est pas satisfaisante en France, selon la Haute autorité de santé (HAS) qui relève, entre autres, un ""mauvais usage des antidépresseurs"".

""Environ 40% des personnes souffrant de dépression ne recourent pas aux soins dans notre pays, ce qui a des effets délétères sur leur vie quotidienne et aggrave le risque de suicide"", note l'autorité sanitaire, qui a publié ce mercredi 8 novembre des recommandations pour aider les médecins généralistes, ""en première ligne pour détecter cette maladie"".

""Certaines déprimes passagères ou certains troubles psychiques graves sont parfois pris pour des dépressions et traités de façon inadéquate"", souligne-t-elle.

La HAS rappelle que pour établir un diagnostic de dépression, il faut s'assurer du cumul de différents symptômes (humeur dépressive, perte d'intérêt ou d'énergie mais aussi concentration réduite, diminution de l'estime de soi, sentiment de culpabilité, idées et comportement suicidaires ou encore troubles du sommeil ou de l'appétit) qui se manifestent de manière quotidienne, depuis au moins deux semaines et avec une certaine intensité.

Quelle que soit l'intensité de la dépression, l'évaluation des idées ou intentions suicidaires est nécessaire, et l'hospitalisation envisagée si le risque est élevé, ajoute-t-elle.

Les personnes âgées ou en deuil et les femmes qui viennent d'accoucher doivent faire l'objet d'une ""vigilance particulière"", souligne-t-elle aussi.

Un mauvais usage des antidépresseurs

""Même lorsque la dépression est correctement diagnostiquée, on observe souvent un mauvais usage des antidépresseurs: trop souvent prescrits pour des dépressions légères, pas assez dans des dépressions sévères, ou délivrés sans psychothérapie ni suivi"", déplore la HAS.

Le recours aux antidépresseurs doit être limité à certains cas, suivi et associé à une psychothérapie. Il n'est pas indiqué pour les dépressions légères, mais doit en revanche prescrits d'emblée dans les formes sévères, explique l'organisme.

Elle recommande des consultations régulières ""toutes les 4 à 8 semaines pour évaluer la tolérance et l'efficacité du traitement, le moduler si besoin, et surveiller d'éventuels comportements suicidaires ou des facteurs extérieurs pouvant les déclencher"".

Une fois les symptômes disparus, le traitement médicamenteux devra être poursuivi entre 6 et 12 mois pour prévenir le risque de rechute. L'arrêt ""progressif"" doit être accompagné par le médecin.

""Quel que soit le niveau de dépression, la prise en charge repose en premier lieu sur une assistance psychologique"" qui peut tout à fait être conduite par le médecin traitant, par un psychologue ou un psychiatre ""pour les cas complexes et/ou sévères notamment"", ajoute la HAS.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s rescue cat Paddles, who rose to fame last month following her owner’s election victory, died on Tuesday night after being struck by a car.

An unnamed neighbor found the ginger and white puss in the road outside Ardern’s home, the New Zealand Herald reported. A veterinarian later declared the animal dead.

“I’m pretty upset,” said the neighbor. “She’s very much part of the neighborhood. Most people around here would know who she is.”

Ardern paid tribute to her late pet on Facebook:

Ardern’s partner, Clarke Gayford, expressed similar sentiments on Twitter:

Thank you so much for all the nice messages. Our crazy little 'sleep anywhere' ginger will be sorely missed, the house feels so empty now :( pic.twitter.com/OCJuJ3i4Xl — Clarke Gayford (@NZClarke) November 8, 2017

Paddles, who had six toes on each foot, became an internet sensation in October when the @FirstCatofNZ Twitter feed launched. Both Ardern and Gayford denied running the account, which posted pictures of Paddles posing with her powerful owner. The account also interacted with other important felines from around the world.

The person behind the account honored Paddles with this tweet:

Denn ""Neue Zürcher Zeitung"" und ""Die Welt"" lehnen das Verteufeln von Steueroasen ab

Für Steuergewerkschafts-Chef Thomas Eigenthaler ist diese Argumentation ""absurd""

Für den Durchschnittsdeutschen liegen die Steueroasen in weiter Ferne. Das liegt weniger daran, dass Reisen in die Steuerparadiese der Südsee vergleichsweise teuer sind. Vielmehr mangelt es ihnen am Vermögen, um die zahlreichen Schlupflöcher skrupellos auszunutzen.

Erst ab einem bestimmten Steuerbetrag rechnet sich der Aufwand, und damit zugleich der Ertrag, um Geld am deutschen Fiskus vorbeizuschleusen.

Doch diese augenscheinliche Ungleichheit ist für Olaf Gersemann, ""Die Welt""-Ressortleiter für Wirtschaft und Finanzen, und Peter A. Fischer, Leiter der Wirtschaftsredaktion der ""Neuen Zürcher Zeitung"" (""NZZ""), kein Problem.

Denn beide verteidigen in ihren Kommentaren die Steueroasen.

""Simpler Ausdruck der globalen Natur""

So schreibt Fischer in seinem Beitrag für die NZZ, indem die investigativen Journalisten einige Fälle vermuteten Missbrauchs publikumswirksam herauspicken, würden sie versuchen, alle Offshore-Geschäfte zu verteufeln. Doch diese haben ""in einer immer globaleren Welt nicht nur ihre Berechtigung, sondern sind oft sogar zwingend.""

Der Wirtschaftsjournalist betont, Offshore-Transaktionen seien meistens entweder ""simpler Ausdruck der globalen Natur eines Geschäfts"" oder Resultat von tatsächlichen Unzulänglichkeiten und Missständen in den betroffenen Ländern.

Für letzteres nennt Fischer ein Beispiel: die aus seiner Sicht ""prohibitiv scharfe"" Besteuerung von Unternehmensgewinnen in den USA.

Deshalb dürfe man Steueroasen nicht grundsätzlich verteufeln - wie es weltweit Medien machen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Politiker und Unternehmer umgingen Millionen an Steuern: Diese Deutschen tauchen in den Paradise Papers auf

Übergriffige Kassenwarte

Gersemann von der ""Welt"" sieht das ähnlich. Hinter den Offshore-Geschäften gebe es keine Doppelmoral - und ""eine pauschale Vorverurteilung aller Offshoreaktivitäten ist durch nichts gerechtfertigt.""

Seine Argumentation: ""Konten in Steueroasen sind im Grunde nichts anderes als das Bargeld des reichen Mannes: desjenigen, der mehr Geld besitzt, als sich in Matratzen oder Wandtresoren verstauen ließe"", behauptet er in seinem Kommentar.

Gerade angesichts einer immer weiter alternden Gesellschaft würden die Finanzminister laut Gersemann zunehmend ""internationale Kartelle mit Mindeststeuersätzen bilden, denen niemand entrinnen kann"".

Deshalb würden Steueroasen dazu dienen, ""auf Dauer zu verhindern, dass die Kassenwarte allzu übergriffig werden."" Die Steuerverstecke würden Schutz bieten – vor der ""Gier der Finanzminister"".

Gersemanns Quintessenz: ""Wenn es Steueroasen nicht schon gäbe, müssten sie dringend erfunden werden.""

""Zeugt von einer gewissen Staatsverachtung""

Thomas Eigenthaler, Vorsitzender der Steuergewerkschaft, hält diese Argumentation für ""absurd"". ""Wenn wir alles machen, was nicht verboten ist, um auf egoistische Weise einen persönlichen Vorteil zu erreichen, dann kann ein Gemeinwesen nicht funktionieren"", betont er im Gespräch mit der HuffPost.

Denn wenn man Leistungen des Staates abrufe, dann sei es ihm zufolge es unmoralisch, wenn man sich nicht am Staatswesen beteilige. Zudem ist es demokratisch beschlossen, dass die Wohlhabenderen mehr schultern und nach unseren Gesetzen einen höheren Steuersatz zahlen als die niedriger Verdienenden.

Wenn man sich allerdings den Steuerpflichte entziehe, sei das ein ""billiges und arrogantes Vorgehen"", dass ""von einer gewissen Staatsverachtung zeugt"", unterstreicht Eigenthaler.

During a news conference Monday in Tokyo, Trump said it was “a little bit soon” to get into a discussion about gun control.

“This isn’t a guns situation,” Trump said, noting that a person in the crowd with a gun shot at the attacker and caused him to flee. “This is a mental health problem at the highest level. It’s a very, very sad event.”

The president woke on Monday morning in Japan to the news that a lone gunman had opened fire on churchgoers at a small Baptist church in rural Texas and killed at least 26 people and injured another 20. The dead and wounded range in age from 5 to 72 years old.

While answering questions in Tokyo, the president referred to the gunman, who multiple reports identified as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, as a “very deranged individual.”

BHOPAL -- The enraged survivor of the gangrape in Bhopal has demanded that the perpetrators be hanged publicly.

""Such people (culprits) should not be left alive. Police should hand out such a punishment that it does not happen with anyone ever again. In fact, they should be hanged on the streets,"" the survivor told ANI on Sunday.

Her rage was also directed towards the police who initially refused to lodge her complaint.

""The most disgusting thing was police's behaviour; we were going from one police station to another, we visited at least three to four stations,"" she said, adding that the Government Railway Police (GRP) and MP Nagar Police were the most disrespectful towards her.

""We faced this despite both of my parents being in police, so you can imagine what general public faces in such situations,"" she lamented.

The survivor further informed that her parents caught hold of the accused after she helped in identifying the culprits.

''We took the accused to the police station, he confessed to the crime and still the police did not book a complaint,"" she added.

She said it took a whole day for the family to get their complaint heard in different police stations, until the Habibganj Police showed some cooperation and support.

On Thursday, the 19-year-old civil services aspirant was abducted by four men and allegedly gangraped when she was returning home after attending her coaching class.

On Friday, three of the accused were arrested.

Investigation is on to nab the fourth one.

Dans laquelle, pour le moment, la date de 2025 est toujours inscrite.","CLIMAT - C'est un pavé dans la mare qu'a jeté Nicolas Hulot, en annonçant mardi 7 novembre que la réduction de la part du nucléaire à 50% d'ici 2025 n'était pas atteignable. Il est ainsi critiqué ce mercredi 8 novembre par de nombreux écologistes, qui y voient un renoncement par rapport à l'objectif fixé par la loi de transition énergétique et au programme d'Emmanuel Macron.

Le ministre de la Transition énergétique assure pourtant que le nucléaire est bien en voie de diminution en France. Simplement, affirme Nicolas Hulot, le maintien de l'échéance de 2025 est tout simplement impossible, à moins d'augmenter nos émissions de CO2.

Car il faut le rappeler, l'énergie de l'atome rejette très peu de gaz à effet de serre. Et en dehors des énergies renouvelables, les autres centrales sont plus polluantes, en termes de CO2. Bref, climat ou baisse du nucléaire, il faut choisir, selon le ministre.

Nicolas Hulot n'a pas tort, soulignent les spécialistes du secteur. Déjà, lors de la mise en place de la loi sous François Hollande, beaucoup doutaient de la possibilité d'une telle échéance. Et le problème, c'est que depuis, les choses n'ont pas vraiment évolué.

8 ans, c'est trop court

""Du retard a été pris sur le précédent quinquennat"", note Nicolas Goldberg, du cabinet Colombus Consulting, spécialiste des questions de politiques énergétiques. Pour lui, la date de 2025 est clairement intenable.

Même son de cloche du côté de Thibault Laconde, consultant et auteur du blog Energie & développement. ""8 ans, c'est une échelle de temps très courte pour le secteur de l'énergie, où il y a une forte inertie"", précise-t-il.

Non pas que ce soit impossible techniquement parlant: après tout, la part d'éolien et de solaire visée est similaire à celle de l'Allemagne actuellement. Sauf que cela demande de l'argent, mais aussi du temps.

Pour schématiser grossièrement, ""il faut quelque chose comme 1000 éoliennes pour remplacer la fermeture d'un réacteur nucléaire"", explique le consultant. Aujourd'hui, nous en installons 500 par an. Le rapport de RTE, qui gère le réseau d'électricité français, estime qu'il faudrait fermer 24 réacteurs d'ici 2025 pour coller aux objectifs.

""Il faut aussi voir le côté économique et industriel d'un tel changement. Avons-nous les moyens de faire cela si vite? L'Allemagne, quand elle a choisi d'abandonner le nucléaire, disposait d'une économie florissante et d'entreprises permettant de produire ces énergies renouvelables. En France, je les cherche encore"", affirme Thibault Laconde.

En dehors de la date, une diminution qui fait consensus

Du coup, si l'on veut coller à la date de 2025, selon le rapport RTE -sur lequel se base en partie Nicolas Hulot-, il faudrait utiliser des sources d'énergies polluantes, non renouvelables, en attendant que les éoliennes et autres panneaux solaires puissent prendre le relais.

Tout n'est pas noir pour autant. Nicolas Goldberg et Thibault Laconde soulignent ainsi que dans le rapport, il n'est jamais envisagé d'augmenter la part du nucléaire dans la production énergétique française.

En effet, les 5 scénarios mis au point évoquent tous une diminution du nombre de réacteurs en service. Le plus optimiste estime même que le passage sous les 50% pour le nucléaire pourrait avoir lieu dès 2030, quand un autre évoque 2035.

C'est déjà une grosse évolution par rapport à 2013, où le PDG d'EDF estimait qu'il ne faudra fermer aucun réacteur d'ici à 2025.

Une question de symbole

Mais alors pourquoi Nicolas Hulot est-il si vertement critiqué? Si l'on peut y voir une bataille idéologique, il y a aussi la question du symbole. Ainsi, l'ONG Negawatt estime que ""si l'inaction passée pèse de tout son poids sur l'échéance de 2025, le Bilan prévisionnel ne porte pas un message de renoncement"". Au contraire, ""que l'on retarde cette échéance ou non"", ""il ne faut plus différer l'action"".

C'est également le point de vue de Pascal Canfin, directeur de WWF France, interrogé sur France Inter. Si celui-ci ne se dit pas attaché à la date de 2025, qu'il juge ""inadaptée"", il estime surtout que Nicolas Hulot a fauté en n'indiquant pas de date de remplacement, par exemple 2030, pour suivre le scénario optimiste de RTE.

Pascal Canfin souhaite donc que le gouvernement clarifie rapidement sa position et mette en place un calendrier clair permettant de fixer de véritables objectifs pour la réduction de la part du nucléaire.

Nicolas Hulot a d'ores et déjà annoncé que le gouvernement allait travailler sur ""l'échéance de 2030 ou 2035"". Reste à savoir quel sera le résultat. Pascal Canfin affirme que le premier ministre et le ministre de l'Economie sont très favorables à l'industrie nucléaire et ""souhaitent, au fond, en lien avec une partie de l'appareil d'Etat, ne pas bouger"" sur le choix du nucléaire.

Pro et anti-nucléaire devraient dans tous les cas être fixés rapidement.

Derzeit finden sich einige Schlagzeilen und dazu gehörige Artikel, in denen erklärt wird, warum die dreijährige Tochter von Mila Kunis jeden Freitag einen Schluck Wein trinken darf. Alkohol im Kindesalter? Ob das wirklich zur Religion gehört, wenn Kleinkindern schon der Geschmack von Alkohol nahe gebracht wird und ob es sinnvoll ist, derartigen kulturell aufgebauten gesellschaftlichen Geisteserkrankungen anzuhängen, bleibt hier einmal außen vor. Eindeutig belegbar ist hingegen, dass jemand, der glaubt, keine Ahnung hat, da er es immerhin nicht weiß.

Soviel zu Mila Kunis und ihrer dreijährigen Tochter, nun zum Thema: Alkohol im Kindesalter! Gelegentlich führt mein Weg durch das LWL-Museum für Naturkunde in Münster, in dem seit vermutlich Jahrzehnten eine Dauervorstellung zu den Indianern Nordamerikas genau dieses Thema aufgreift. Die Indianer wurden immer weiter zurück gedrängt, das Ziel war anscheinend ihre Ausrottung sowie sie erst ab 1924 durch ihre Geburt innerhalb der USA automatisch auch Staatsbürger der USA sind. Sie gelten aber gewiss noch heute nicht als vollwertige Bürger und mit Pech werden sie mal eben per Zwang von dem einen in das andere Reservat umgesiedelt.

100 Millionen Indianer sind durch die Entdeckung der neuen Welt durch den „Weißen Mann"" ums Leben gekommen, viele systematisch. Noch heute leben Indianer in Nordamerika meist in abgelegenen Reservaten wie in einem Drittweltland mit einer Arbeitslosigkeit von oft über 60%. Bereits in den Entdeckerjahren war es üblich, den Indianern Alkohol zu geben. Der Weiße Mann hatte wohl auch die Hoffnung, dass sich mit jeder Party einige Indianer totgesoffen haben. Alkohol hat ab diesen Entdeckerjahren eine feste Tradition im Indianerleben, Alkohol im Kindesalter gehört dazu.

Harold Red Eagle säuft seit seinem achten Lebensjahr

Alkohol im Kindesalter ist unter Indianern in US Reservaten anscheinend ein alltägliches Phänomen, sowie rund 75% der Indianerfamilien wenigstens einen Alkoholiker zählen. So die Zeitung „Montana's Indians"" aus dem Jahr 1996, die Harold Red Eagle einen Artikel widmete. Damals war er 37 Jahre alt, soff damit schon seit 29 Jahren und hält sich an einem Pfahl fest. Sein eigener Vater war es, der ihm den Alkohol gab. Was genau die Absichten eines solchen Vaters waren, geht aus dem Artikel nicht hervor.

Harold Red Eagles Tochter begann das Trinken erst mit 13 Jahren. Mit 18 muss sie für drei Jahre ins Gefängnis, immerhin hat sie ihren 14 jährigen Bruder getötet. Sie erstach ihn mit einem Messer, als sie betrunken war. Im Reservat gehen 79 Prozent aller Straftaten auf Alkohol zurück.

„It was her family's way of life.""

„All she saw us do was drink alcohol.""

Alkohol im Kindesalter vermutlich eine ganz schlechte Idee

Wenn die Eltern der Kinder Raucher sind und diese den Rauch bereits kennen, ist es wahrscheinlicher, dass sie mit dem Rauchen anfangen. Beim gesellschaftlich etablierten Alkohol ist es ähnlich. Wenn die Kinder sich bereits im Kleinkindalter an den Geschmack alkoholischer Getränke gewöhnen, ist das mehr als fraglich. Es ist wie beim Zucker, dass es nicht 100 Gramm sein müssen. Ein Stück Würfelzucker macht bereits den „Pin"" im Hinterkopf und die leuchtenden Augen, wenn es wieder einmal ein Stück Zucker oder auch mehr gibt. Dieser „Pin"" wird durch die Häufigkeit oder durch größere Mengen natürlich immer stärker.

Es kommt aber auch auf die Menschen an, ob sie für etwas empfänglich sind. Wer es bereits in den Genen oder im Wesen hat, ein Alkoholproblem hervor zu bilden und auch noch Alkohol im Kindesalter vorkommt, dann ist es nur um so wahrscheinlicher, dass genau dieses Problem früher, stärker und damit problematischer hervorgebildet wird.

Weiterhin sind die Organe oder die Psyche von Kindern erheblich empfindlicher. Wesentlich kleinere Mengen Alkohol, Drogen, Umweltgifte oder sonstige Gifte können einen maßgeblich größeren Schaden als beim Erwachsenen anrichten. Nicht Grundlos sind es die Kinder, nicht die Erwachsenen, die rund um Atomkraftwerken reihenweise an Leukämie erkranken.

Wenn dann zu lesen ist, dass Kinder alkoholfreies Bier trinken, ist dieser „Pin"" natürlich nicht vorhanden, auch in Sauerkraut oder anderen Speisen sind bis 0,5 % Alkohol enthalten. Dennoch bringt man den Kindern schon den Geschmack und das Ritual nahe. Auch wenn es eine den Indianern mitgebrachte Kultur des weißen Mannes ist, so wäre es schön, wenn sie wenigstens den Jugendschutz beachten oder den Alkoholismus weitgehend durchbrechen täten. Wer sich jedoch bereits selber als Schweralkoholiker klassifizieren muss und Kinder groß ziehen soll, der bringt damit ganz automatisch einige Defizite mit. Erlebte man selber Alkohol im Kindesalter und lebt folglich im Dauersuff, dann ist es gewiss schwerer, die eigenen Kinder vom Saufen abzuhalten als bei jemandem, der im Leben eine Perspektive mit Job und Einkommen hat. Wer die Armut in der Welt bekämpft, der bekämpft auch ihre Probleme.

S'agit-il d'une première, dans les relations entre un président et les médias?","ÉTATS-UNIS - ""Aussi incompréhensible que cela puisse sembler, la victoire de Donald Trump est aujourd'hui bien réelle."" Le 8 novembre 2016, le monde entier découvrait dans un semi-état de choc le nom du nouveau président des Etats-Unis, personnage aussi controversé qu'inattendu. Depuis, Donald Trump impose son style à la Maison Blanche comme sur la scène internationale. Et s'y adapter n'est pas de tout repos.

Si une chose ressort de la première année de présidence Trump, c'est bien qu'il faut s'attendre à tout. En un an, le président des Etats-Unis aura ordonné une intervention en Syrie devant une part de gâteau, transformé ses maisons de vacances en un nouveau lieu du pouvoir américain, fait un usage quotidien de Twitter, limogé ses conseillers presqu'aussi souvent qu'il ne tweete...

En un mot? Il aura agi comme aucun autre président avant lui, et il sait bien pourquoi: en rompant totalement avec la façon d'agir et de gouverner de ses prédécesseurs et de ses adversaires, Donald Trump continue à satisfaire son électorat qui l'a d'ailleurs élu en partie sur ce sentiment de ""ras-le-bol"", comme nous l'explique Amanda Terkel, cheffe du bureau du HuffPost américain à Washington.

""Donald Trump est un nouveau visage en politique. Il a eu des difficultés à s'adapter à Washington, il y a eu des rotations d'envergure dans son gouvernement, des difficultés avec certaines personnes -comme par exemple Michael Flynn- qui soulèvent des questions sur sa capacité à recruter à des postes importants.""

""Il n'était pas complètement préparé à la transition vers la Maison Blanche, parce que la plupart des gens s'attendaient à une victoire d'Hillary Clinton. Ce qui signifie qu'il n'avait pas de politique complète ni de plans prévus non plus"", analyse Amanda Terkel.

Durant le temps qu'il a passé comme ""président élu"" (entre novembre 2016 et le 20 janvier 2017), une telle situation n'est pas si exceptionnelle. Sans doute peut-on envisager qu'il faille un peu de temps pour comprendre le fonctionnement et les enjeux de la politique américaine, a fortiori lorsque, comme Donald Trump, on est davantage un ""businessman"" qu'un homme politique.

Mais une fois cette période de transition révolue, cette cacophonie ne s'est pas apaisée, loin de là. En témoignent les nombreux ""couacs"" qui agitent régulièrement les couloirs de la Maison Blanche, sur des questions internes -comme les licenciements et démissions en série- comme sur des questions de politique nationale (avec par exemple la difficulté pour le président à faire passer ses lois au Congrès où il a pourtant la majorité) et internationale.

Un exemple de dissonances régulières? La différence entre les annonces faites sur Twitter par le président et ce qui en découle réellement par la suite. ""Trump a dit qu'il excluait de l'armée les militaires transgenres. Mais il n'est pas vraiment passé par les canaux appropriés pour le faire. Et ensuite, lorsque la loi est sortie, elle n'était pas exactement la même que ce qu'il avait initialement dit"", détaille Amanda Terkel.

Trump, Twitter et les médias

Entre ce qui est annoncé -le plus souvent avec moult points d'exclamation, majuscules et superlatifs- et ce qui est fait, il y a donc une marge. Avec des conséquences différentes: du coté des opposants de Donald Trump, ces annonces brutales provoquent généralement des levées de bouclier (la Women March en est une illustration).

Mais pour les journalistes chargés de suivre l'actualité politique américaine, cet écart n'est pas sans conséquence professionnelle: ""Trump est toujours président, rappelle la cheffe du HuffPost à Washington. Donc quand il y a des déclarations contradictoires, nous devons le raconter dans l'article, et ensuite, observer ce qui se passe vraiment. Nous devons être sûrs que nous essayons d'expliquer au lecteur l'histoire complète, si il y a plus que ce qui a été tweeté ou ce que Trump a dit.""

""Ce qui a été tweeté"", précise Amanda Terkel. Le terme mérite d'être souligné. Car désormais, il semble difficile d'évoquer Donald Trump sans parler de son canal de communication favori, Twitter. Un nouveau paramètre à intégrer pour la population mais aussi pour les journalistes. ""Trump est le premier président à utiliser Twitter de cette façon"", confirme Amanda Terkel. ""Il l'utilise pour passer outre les médias et sa propre équipe, afin de véhiculer son message.""

""Les journalistes doivent définitivement se réveiller le matin, voir ce que Trump a tweeté et décider de la façon dont ils vont couvrir ses tweets. Qu'est-ce qui mérite d'être relayé par la presse? Vous ne voulez pas donner à ses tweets trop d'attention si ce n'est pas justifié, mais il est le président, donc vous ne pouvez pas non plus les ignorer.""

Mais tous les jours, les journalistes débattent, dans toutes les rédactions, de s'ils vont couvrir ou non un tweet de Trump.

A l'opposé des années Obama, où l'ancien président s'est distingué par une communication bien rodée qui inspire d'ailleurs certains, Donald Trump a donc choisi une stratégie plus agressive: énoncer ses idées sans filtre, sans hésiter à mentionner ses adversaires, qu'il s'agisse de ""crooked Hillary"" ou des ""fake news medias"".

Entre le 8 novembre 2016 et le 7 novembre 2017, ce terme ""fake news"" est d'ailleurs apparu 126 fois dans les tweets du président selon le site de décompte Trump Twitter Archive, l'expression ""fake news media"" revenant 32 fois. Des organes de presse aussi ancestraux aux Etats-Unis que le New York Times ou CNN ont été abondamment critiqués, avec parfois une violence suffisante pour interroger sur le respect du 1er amendement de la Constitution américaine.

S'agit-il d'une première, dans les relations entre un président et les médias? Amanda Terkel nuance: ""Le département de justice d'Obama s'est en pris aux lanceurs d'alerte qui parlaient aux journalistes également, et les médias étaient sous pression à ce moment là aussi"", rappelle-t-elle. Toutefois, si Obama préférait des représailles discrètes, Donald Trump a choisi une stratégie différente: ""Trump est plus agressif dans sa façon de s'en prendre aux journalistes, en les appelant par leur nom, en insultant les médias dans leur ensemble, et même en faisant semblant d'encourager la violence envers les journalistes. Il dit qu'il prend très à coeur le 1er amendement (qui protège la liberté d'expression, entre autres, ndlr), mais c'est vrai que sa rhétorique n'y correspond pas toujours.""

De l'avenir de la fonction présidentielle américaine

Le 12 juillet 2017, un élu démocrate de la Chambre des Représentants américains a déposé la première résolution pour la destitution de Donald Trump. La question est d'ailleurs régulièrement évoquée par les opposants au président, bien qu'une destitution n'ait en réalité que peu de chances d'aboutir. Mais qu'il achève (ou non) son mandat, l'élection de Donald Trump n'en aura pas moins eu des conséquences sur l'image de la fonction présidentielle américaine.

""Beaucoup de personnes soutiendraient que Trump a rendu la présidence moins professionnelle. Avec ses insultes, sa rhétorique incendiaire et à la façon dont il s'en prend aux autres, il ne correspond pas toujours à ce que les gens attendent d'un président. On ne sait pas si les futurs présidents reprendront ses répliques ou pas.""

Un an après l'élection, il est sans doute difficile de se pencher sur la question, et ce d'autant plus que les adversaires sérieux pour 2020 semblent manquer pour l'instant. En ce qui concerne les retombées immédiates en revanche, elles sont beaucoup plus claires: selon un sondage YouGov réalisé pour Le HuffPost et CNEWS, 68% des Français ont une opinion négative du chef d'état américain. Soit neuf points de plus qu'en février 2016 note l'institut de sondage.

Les raisons de cette baisse de popularité? Elles sont multiples: le retrait de l'Accord de Paris y est sûrement pour quelque chose, alors qu'un sondage réalisé dans 38 pays en août 2017 (soit deux mois après la décision du président) soulignait que le réchauffement climatique était considéré comme l'une des deux premières menaces planétaires par 61% des personnes interrogées (56% pour la seule population américaine). Les décisions d'ordre géopolitique du président ""America First"" ont aussi certainement leur place, et ce d'autant plus que Donald Trump succède à Barack Obama, qui a entretenu des relations pour le moins cordiales, sinon toujours apaisées, avec la plupart des autres dirigeants.

""Trump a tendu des alliances avec certains pays. Cela s'est également produit pendant l'administration du président George W. Bush, lorsque des pays ont été frustrés par la guerre en Irak, par exemple. Obama, quant à lui, a été accueilli plus chaleureusement dans le monde entier"", analyse Amanda Terkel, qui évoque cependant une évolution plus globale des mentalités en politique. ""Beaucoup de gens à l'étranger semblent être un peu déconcertés par Trump et sa victoire, mais là encore, les politiciens de droite gagnent aussi en popularité dans d'autres pays européens.""

En France, le second tour de l'élection présidentielle a opposé une candidate d'extrême droite et un candidat fraîchement débarqué en politique, qui a tout misé (avec succès) sur la rupture avec les partis traditionnels. Mais le Brexit, l'élection de Donald Trump, ou encore l'arrivée en Allemagne du parti d'extrême droite à l'Assemblée viennent également illustrer cette évolution, avec la particularité pour Donald Trump d'occuper une place centrale du tableau, en tant que dirigeant de la première puissance mondiale.

Ausmaß der Ungleichheit bisher verschleiert

Zucmans Rechenexempel basiert auf einer Reihe von öffentlich zugänglichen Daten. Insgesamt verliert die Europäische Union umgerechnet ein Fünftel ihrer Einnahmen aus Unternehmensteuern. Das entspreche 60 Milliarden Euro im Jahr.

Deutschland ist besonders betroffen. Von allen untersuchten Ländern verliert die Bundesrepublik am meisten Geld durch Steueroasen. Die Einnahmen aus Körperschaftsteuer könnten 32 Prozent höher liegen als bislang. In Frankreich liegt der Wert bei 25 Prozent, in Großbritannien bei 20 Prozent.

Le tueur, Devin Patrick Kelley, a notamment contacté son père pendant sa fuite. Il avait auparavant ouvert le feu, dimanche 5 novembre, sur des fidèles rassemblés dans l'église de Sutherland Springs, tuant 25 paroissiens dont une femme enceinte et en blessant 20, selon les dernier biland livré par les autorités.

Un différend familial, notamment une dispute avec sa belle-mère à qui il avait envoyé des messages de menaces, pourrait être à l'origine du carnage, selon les enquêteurs. ""À cette heure nous ne sommes pas capables d'entrer dans ce téléphone"", a expliqué Christopher Combs, responsable de l'enquête pour le FBI, lors d'un point-presse organisé 48 heures après la tuerie.

L'imbroglio de San Bernardino

""Cela souligne un problème auquel nous avons déjà été confrontés avec les avancées de la technologie pour ces téléphones et l'encryptage, les forces de l'ordre au niveau local ou fédéral ont de plus en plus de mal à entrer dans ces téléphones"", a-t-il affirmé, refusant de confirmer le modèle du téléphone, dont la rumeur disait qu'il s'agissait d'un iPhone.

Or, Apple s'était retrouvé au centre d'un bras de fer avec la justice américaine en refusant d'aider la police à contourner les mesures de sécurité pour accéder au contenu crypté d'un iPhone appartenant à l'un des auteurs de l'attentat de San Bernardino en Californie, qui avait fait 14 morts le 2 décembre 2015.

Le FBI voulait déterminer les liens éventuels d'un tireur avec le groupe État islamique, mais le constructeur avait fait valoir que cela mettrait en péril la protection des données de centaines de millions d'utilisateurs d'iPhone. Le FBI avait finalement réussi à déverrouiller l'appareil grâce à des prestataires extérieurs, dont l'identité n'avait jamais été révélée.

Un téléphone sur deux est inaccessible

Christopher Combs a assuré au cours du point presse que le FBI réussirait de toute façon à accéder aux données du téléphone car l'agence possède ""des partenaires avec lesquels elle travaille"" pour décrypter les données des téléphones mobiles.

En octobre, le directeur du FBI Christopher Wray avait admis l'ampleur du problème de décryptage sur le travail des enquêteurs, indiquant que les données de près de 7.000 téléphones portables n'avaient techniquement pas pu être débloqués dans les 11 précédents mois, alors même que la police fédérale ""a l'autorité légale pour le faire"".

It was rumoured in the mid-2000's that the 'Selecao' –– the Brazillian football team –– would play without demanding to get paid, as playing for your national team was the biggest reward any athlete could wish for. Whether that's true or not, representing the national team at the highest level is what football used to be about –– a heady mix of pride and honour.

However, these days when players reach a certain peak status, they tend to think they are bigger than the team. Here are the five instances of ego winning over national pride, when players rthought they were bigger than the team.

1. Thulani Serero -- South Africa (2017)

With a crucial World Cup Qualifier double-header against Senegal, Bafana Bafana needed to get all their best players to the camp, especially those playing abroad.

""He did not get in touch with me at all""

But when Thulani Serero, who plays in Netherlands for Vitesse, was picked for the squad, he rejected the national call-up, claiming that he was not going to fly all the way to South Africa from Europe if he was not guaranteed to play in the final team.

According to Bafana coach Stuart Baxter, Serero did not want to come to the camp unless he was not guaranteed he was going to play. ""He did not get in touch with me at all,"" Baxter said.

He obviously does not want to sit on the bench or play a cameo role, but rejecting a national call-up is disrespect to your team and country.

A player is never bigger than a team, and whether it was for his pride or ego, this did not sit well with South Africans.

Thulani Serero says he won't honour Bafana call up unless he's guaranteed to play against Senegal.

2. Joel Matip -- Cameroon (2017)

Cameroonian Joel Matip arguably made the biggest mistake of his footballing career when he rejected the chance to play for Cameroon in order to stay in England for his club fixtures. He ended up shooting himself in the foot –– his country won the 2017 Africa Cup Of Nations for the first time in 15 years.

""It is Africa, and you can never compare it to European things."" Joel Matip

Matip was one of seven players who refused to play so they could stay with their clubs, despite Cameroon's football association arguing against that the national team had to come first with the 2017 tournament on the horizon.

When Cameroon won the cup, Matip declared his international career over, saying, ""It is Africa, and you can never compare it to European things.""

3. Carlos Tevez -- Machester City (2011)

Manchester City was playing a crucial European tie with Bayern Munich when City boss Roberto Mancini requested that Carlos Tevez warm up so that he could be introduced into the game.

Tevez, however, refused, and Mancini was livid. The forward ultimately refused to play in the match at all, and was suspended by the club. He then spent an extended unauthorised spell in Argentina, going into self-exile for five months. On his return in March 2012, he issued an apology to Manchester City.

The ego-driven tantrum has a happy ending: he turned out to be an influential player at the conclusion of the 2011/12 season, helping City win their first Premier League title.

4. William Gallas -- Chelsea (2006)

(FRANCE - Tags: SPORT SOCCER WORLD CUP)

In a bizarre chain of events in 2006, when the French former international was desperate to leave Chelsea for Arsenal in the transfer window, William Gallas refused to play for the team he was still contracted to. Absurd, right? Chelsea even issued a statement claiming that Gallas had threatened to score own goals if he was chosen to play, and although he has denied that vehemently and other players have backed up his version, the story stuck. Either way, Gallas got his transfer to Arsenal that year...

( ITALY - Tags: SPORT SOCCER)

After four years with the Gunners, Gallas switched again, and played for Tottenham Hotspur from 2010-2013.

5. Paul Scholes -- Manchester United (2001)

Reuters / Ed Sykes Livepic

One of the finest players of his generation, Paul Scholes showed Sir Alex Furgerson his dark side in 2001, when he refused to play a third-round FA cup tie with Arsenal –– because he believed he was playing for ""a reserve team"". The team travelling to Arsenal comprised mostly fringe player, but instead of taking the opportunity to shine brighter among them, Scholes took the wounded-ego route.

""I don't know why I did what I did in 2001,"" he has since said, ""but it is something I really regretted doing. I wasn't in a great mood –– I had been left out the Liverpool game the previous weekend, and I knew that the team going down to Arsenal in the cup was basically a reserve side.""",5 Players Who Thought They Were Bigger Than The Team⚽️,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/11/08/5-players-who-thought-they-were-bigger-than-the-team_a_23270311/

Die deutsche wie die internationale Presse reagiert mit Empörung auf die Enthüllungen

Die Paradise Papers sorgen für Empörung auf der ganzen Welt. Großkonzerne, Promis, Superreiche – die Enthüllungen belegen ausführlich, dass weltweit Unternehmen und Privatpersonen bei der Steuer tricksen.

“Skrupellose Eliten vermeiden ihre gerechte Besteuerung, während Otto-Normal-Verbraucher zuhause Straßen, Schulen und Sozialausgaben finanziert”, bringt es Birgit Marshall für die “Rheinische Post” auf den Punkt.

Klar ist: Laut Wirtschaftsexperte Gabriel Zucman verliert allein die Bundesrepublik jedes Jahr 17 Milliarden Euro an Einnahmen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Paradise Papers"": Liebe Eliten, wundert euch nicht, wenn die Menschen AfD wählen, es liegt auch an eurem Verhalten

Politik in Bedrängnis

""Spiegel""-Journalist Jakob Augstein findet in seinem Kommentar harte Worte für den laxen Umgang der Bundesrepublik mit den superreichen Steuersündern. ""Das System ist zutiefst krank"", schreibt er. Und die Wut darauf wachse. ""Sie sucht sich nur die falschen Ziele. Der Hass der Betrogenen gilt eher dem Kriegs- als dem Steuerflüchtling"", bemerkt Augstein. Und ergänzt: ""Unser Planet ist ein Paradies für Arschlöcher.""

Auch die internationale Presse sieht die Politik in der Bringschuld, die Steueroasen durch härteres Vorgehen zu zerschlagen. “Um dieser Situation ein Ende zu bereiten, sollte man jene beiden Kräfte zerstören, die sie aufrechterhalten”, schreibt die französische Zeitung “Le Monde”: ""Die grenzenlose Gier einiger weniger und die Untätigkeit der Staaten.” Letzteres sei dabei nicht unbedingt einfacher anzugehen, als Ersteres.

Denn dass Unternehmen und Einzelpersonen sich Steuerparadiese wie den Kaiman Inseln, Malta, oder Bermuda bedienen, um Geld zu horten, ist spätestens seit den “Panama Papers” bekannt. Passiert ist jedoch nicht viel, um die Steuertrickser zur Rechenschaft zu ziehen.

Marshall von der “Rheinischen Post” glaubt, dass die “unerträgliche Schieflage” gefährliche Stimmungen verschärfen könne: “Gerade demokratisch gewählte Regierungen verlieren Glaubwürdigkeit, wenn es ihnen weiterhin nicht gelingt, die Reichsten ausreichend zu besteuern”, kommentiert sie.

Mehr noch: Ranghohe Politiker wie US-Handelsminister Wilbur Ross sind selbst in die Enthüllungen verwickelt.

""Bild""-Zeitung: Auch der kleine Mann trickst bei der Steuer

Der einzige Trost sei, dass die Digitalisierung für mehr Transparenz sorgen werde, weil Dateien gehackt werden können, folgert die belgische Zeitung “De Tijd”. “Jedes neue Leck stellt die steuerliche Doppelmoral bloß.”

Olaf Gersemann von der “Welt” ist da anderer Meinung. Er sieht in den Offshore-Geschäften keine Doppelmoral. “Konten in Steueroasen sind im Grunde nichts anderes als das Bargeld des reichen Mannes: desjenigen, der mehr Geld besitzt, als sich in Matratzen oder Wandtresoren verstauen ließe”, behauptet er in einem Kommentar.

Die “Bild”-Zeitung argumentiert sogar, auch der “kleine Mann” würde gerne mal bei der Steuer tricksen. Mehr als 40 Milliarden Euro gingen in Deutschland jedes Jahr durch alltäglichen Steuerschummel verloren, heißt es in dem Bericht.

„Dahinter stecken häufig dieselbe Gier, dieselben egoistischen Motive, einfach sparen zu wollen“, zitiert die “Bild” den Chef der Deutschen Steuergewerkschaft, Thomas Eigenthaler. Der Steuerexperte vermutet, dass viele Leute für sich beschließen: “Wenn die da oben sich das erlauben, dann erlaube ich mir das auch.“

Enthüllungen wie die Paradise Papers könnten dieses Gefühl noch verstärken.

Wieso sind Steueroasen schlecht?

Aber darf man Steueroasen grundsätzlich verteufeln? Die “Neue Zürcher Zeitung” springt jedenfalls für sie in die Bresche: “Offshore-Geschäfte gehören zu einer globalen Welt. Manchmal sind sie notwendig und manchmal Ausdruck von Missständen, kaum je aber deren Ursache”, heißt es.

Den internationalen Steuerwettbewerb anhand einiger missbräuchlicher Beispiele generell als kriminell hinzustellen, sei deshalb fahrlässig.

Die Londoner “Times” meint Offshore-Zentren hätten zwar prinzipiell eine legitime Rolle, würden sie doch “Besitztümer vor dem Zugriff durch Schurkenstaaten schützen.” Meistens, so räumt die britische Zeitung ein, wären sie jedoch dazu da, um Superreichen zu helfen.

Este drama médico tan longevo va a traer de vuelta a los fantasmas de temporadas anteriores para el gran capítulo Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story (Quien vive, quien muere, quien cuenta tu historia), que gira en torno a un accidente en una montaña rusa (Lo cierto es que esperamos que no se refieran a fantasmas de verdad, porque todos sabemos cómo acabó eso la última vez).

Aunque intérpretes como Katherine Heigl, Sandra Oh y T.R. Knight no van a volver (miembros del reparto original que ya han abandonado la serie), habrá pacientes con un gran parecido a esos personajes que harán su aparición en este episodio repleto de nostalgia.

""El episodio 300 va a ser como un viaje al pasado"", ha contado el actor James Pickens Jr. en E! News. ""Veremos a algunos actores que llegan al hospital después de un horrible accidente y que nos recordarán a Izzie, George y Cristina Yang"", señala.

""Encontraron a tres intérpretes increíbles... Cuando llegué y los vi me sorprendí mucho, porque fueron una parte imprescindible del éxito que tuvo la serie y tenían mucho talento, así que los echamos mucho de menos. Por tanto, a los espectadores les gustaría mucho decir 'Vaya, ahí están de nuevo"", ha señalado el actor.

La actriz Sara Drew ha explicado a Entertainment Weekly que ""ese parecido hace que el reparto original recuerde a esas personas y luche para que estas vivan"".

Heigl dejó Anatomía de Grey en la sexta temporada tras un supuesto enfrentamiento con la creadora de la serie, Shonda Rhimes. Esta supuesta enemistad surgió cuando la actriz tomó la polémica decisión de retirarse de la carrera por un Emmy en 2008 porque pensaba que su papel ""no merecía una nominación"".

Knight abandonó la serie antes que Heigl, cuando su personaje fallece tras un accidente de autobús. Por su parte, Oh fue la que más tiempo permaneció en la serie de los tres, y se despidió tras la décima temporada.

Rhimes ha dejado la puerta abierta para el regreso de esta actriz, pero no así con Heigl. Ella no volverá a los pasillos del Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, pese al hecho de que la actriz ha manifestado su deseo de volver a interpretar a su personaje.

""Ya basta con esa historia. Le he dado mil vueltas a esa idea y he reflexionado si podría funcionar. Y creo que la respuesta es no"", apunta Rhimes respecto a la posible vuelta de Heigl en 2015.

Η φωτογραφία είναι προφανές πως έχει τραβηχτεί από κάποιον παπαράτσι, καθώς η ποιότητα είναι αλλοιωμένη λόγω της απόστασης και η Sia είναι με την πλάτη γυρισμένη στο φακό, αγνοώντας την παρουσία του.

Η Sia ανέβασε ένα screenshot της «προσφοράς» που έκανε ο πωλητής της φωτογραφίας στους ενδεχόμενους αγοραστές, η οποία αναγράφει:

«Αν την αγοράσετε, δεν θα είναι θολή και θα λάβετε επιπλέον άλλες 14 φωτογραφίες».

Έτσι, προκειμένου να γλιτώσει τους φαν της από την κομπίνα και να ξεμπερδεύει μια ώρα αρχύτερα με το όλο θέμα, η Sia ανέβασε ολόκληρη τη φωτογραφία στον λογαριασμό της στο Twitter, γράφοντας:

«Απ' ότι φαίνεται κάποιος προσπαθεί να πουλήσει γυμνές φωτογραφίες μου στους φαν μου. Γλιτώστε τα χρήματά σας, ορίστε, εδώ είναι δωρεάν για όλους. Κάθε μέρα είναι Χριστούγεννα!».

Μπορείτε να δείτε ολόκληρη τη φωτογραφία εδώ.

Δεν είναι η πρώτη φορά που κάποιος, παπαράτσι ή χάκερ, προσπαθεί να πουλήσει γυμνές φωτογραφίες των σταρ στο διαδίκτυο. Όλοι θυμόμαστε το μεγάλο σκάνδαλο του 2014, όταν εξαιτίας μιας μεγάλης εισβολής στην υπηρεσία iCloud της Apple, διέρρευσαν στο ίντερνετ γυμνές φωτογραφίες δεκάδων διασημοτήτων, μεταξύ των οποίων ήταν η Jennifer Lawrence και η Kate Upton.

Κανείς όμως, μέχρι σήμερα, δεν είχε χειριστεί το θέμα τόσο έξυπνα και με τόσο αυτό-σαρκασμό, όσο η Sia.

Και ο κόσμος του Twitter της το αναγνώρισε αυτό:

They are animals unique to Australia, and they can't adapt as fast as we are changing the environment around them.
""Koalas can be found throughout Queensland, down to New South Wales and Victoria and South Australia.
They are animals unique to Australia, and they can't adapt as fast as we are changing the environment around them.
""Australia has a big issue -- Australia is wiping out its mammals faster than any other country on earth.","Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any worse, here comes the news that we are killing off our koalas.

Once widespread across Australia, the past 20 years has seen koala numbers decline dramatically, for some populations by as much as 80 percent.

""Yes, the dear old fluffy koala is suffering along with our other species quite badly,"" Ian Darbyshire, CEO of the Foundation for National Parks & Wildlife told HuffPost Australia.

""In the past five years, we have seen the population go from about 100,000 to 40,000. At this rate, they will be extinct by 2040.""

So what is causing this rapid decline? And what can we do to reverse it?

""There are a lot of different factors, but habitat loss is the main cause,"" Darbyshire said. ""If you look at south east Queensland and northern New South Wales, you've got Brisbane, which is expanding, and the Gold Coast which is expanding. With these developments comes a loss of habitat for koalas.

""Furthermore, you get habitat loss breaking down the connectivity between trees, so quite often these days you'll see koalas crossing the road. When they are down on the ground, that's when they are vulnerable, not only from traffic but also from dogs.""

Koalas are having to travel further for food.

Darbyshire said a fragmentation of koala population has also led to further problems for the marsupials.

""You can drive around the country and see koalas, they are widespread but local,"" he said. ""And their population is fragmented now. That leads to inbreeding, disease and stress.

""We are seeing Chlamydia become a real issue and that's because the population is getting stressed. And tragically, Chlamydia affects their ability to breed and they can also lose their sight.

""It's tragic because the koala is a national icon, it's a very important economic contributor for Australia's tourism and they are heading towards being vulnerable.""

Large scale fires are another serious problem.

Other issues koalas are facing include large scale fires and climate change, both of which can result in koalas forcing to relocate, which is actually problematic in itself.

""It's not easy to relocate koalas as they tend to be quite choosy about the trees they'll eat. They have to have flora that's developed to the area they are in. You can't just take from one area to another. You have to make sure you introduce the right bacteria into their gut,"" he said.

""Males are very territorial as well, and as food gets scarce a male might roam several kilometers. You can't then just stick another male in his territory. You really have to understand what you are doing.""

In terms of what you can do to help, Darbyshire said it all starts with education.

""I think the public needs a fair bit of education and support to understand they do need help. We need actions from individuals to make sure they have koala-friendly fences, that they have their dogs under control. If you see one on the road, help it across. We should be doing more to help them,"" he said.

A koala can't live anywhere else on earth. They are animals unique to Australia, and they can't adapt as fast as we are changing the environment around them.

If you're in an area where koalas can be found, Darbyshire encouraged you to leave water out for them on hot days and also to make it easy for koala to travel from yard to yard.

""Lean a pole on your fence or plant a tree so koalas can navigate backyards,"" he said. ""They are having to travel further for food, which sees them [forced to navigate suburban areas] and puts them in the path of dogs.

""Koalas can be found throughout Queensland, down to New South Wales and Victoria and South Australia. So if you live in these areas, think about planting the right trees, giving them connectivity from tree to tree, controlling the burn, keeping the vegetation for them... it all helps.

""Or make a donation to us and we'll help them for you.

""A koala can't live anywhere else on earth. They are animals unique to Australia, and they can't adapt as fast as we are changing the environment around them.

""They can only have one young a year and have to be about three years old until they can have one. We are moving much faster than they are.

""Australia has a big issue -- Australia is wiping out its mammals faster than any other country on earth. We need lots of help for our native species. Talking about the koala helps because it's iconic. It's the cute cuddly Aussie.

Although the end is in sight, the distance already covered in the race has been significantly challenging.

As a participant, your goal should be to successfully complete the race and claim the victory, having conquered the challenges along the way.

Determination

Just as a runner in the Comrades would need to motivate himself to continue towards his goal, despite being tired, sore and perhaps frustrated or disillusioned, so learners and parents will need to find positive ways to keep motivated and determined in the face of the exams and other assessments.

Runners who successfully complete the Comrades do so because they are prepared for the inevitable challenges that will be experienced along the way. Parents should know that the challenges of Term 4 can be navigated more easily with these helpful tips:

Arrange to get exam timetables and the exam scopes (what will be tested in each subject) as soon as possible. Parents; work with your child: break the seemingly overwhelming task of getting through it all into bite-size, manageable pieces. Create a daily to-do list and teach your child to tick off each completed task. This will give her a great sense of accomplishment and keep her motivated! Ask teachers how to get hold of practice tests and past papers. These are the best tools to use to learn for tests and exams! Create a study-friendly environment for your child. Set aside a special place with a desk and chair. Never study on a couch or a bed -- the brain will go into sleep mode. Switch off cell-phones and the TV during the period of study. Before getting started, make sure that your child knows what needs to be done during the allotted time. When completed, tick off on the to-do list. Do not forget to factor in time for exercise, healthy eating and rest. These are essential stress-busting activities. Study tip: The brain is said to remember things seven times better when you write it down! Encourage your child to write important information down while studying.

Term 4 can indeed feel much like the final struggle in the Comrades Marathon. Just as runners often seem to accomplish the impossible through good preparation and planning, so too, can your child!

Sin duda, en muchas partes lo es, pero resulta inquietante pensar que en algún extremo en cierto.","Hace unos días hubo un gran debate sobre el feminismo y sus consecuencias, luego que todas las participantes del certamen de belleza Miss Perú en su edición del año tomaran las pasarelas para denunciar las altísimas cifras de violencia de género y feminicidios en su país. ""Mis medidas son: 2.202 casos de feminicidios reportados en los últimos nueve años en mi país"" dijo una de las concursantes al micrófono mirando al público televisivo entre asombrado y desconcertado. ""Mis medidas son: el 81% de los agresores a niñas menores de cinco años son cercanos a la familia"" añadió la siguiente candidata. Una a una, las veintitrés mujeres participantes en el concurso describieron un temible paisaje de violencia y agresión que la mayoría de las veces suele ser silenciado y ocultado por medios oficiales e, incluso, por tabúes sociales y culturales.

Por supuesto, la iniciativa del certamen causó revuelo en redes sociales y en medios de comunicación, en los que como suele ser habitual, se discutió públicamente sobre los alcances del feminismo y, sobre todo, sus implicaciones. La iniciativa del concurso sorprendió y abrió una amplia discusión sobre la necesidad de convertir el debate sobre la violencia de género en una discusión pública. Pero no mucha gente pareció estar de acuerdo. Los acostumbrados argumentos sobre ""Una muerte es una muerte, no importa el género"" se enfrentaron a concienzudos análisis sobre el contexto que suele rodear un crimen de género.

En medio de ambas tendencias, la noción sobre los asesinatos de mujeres perpetrados por motivos machistas y sobre todo, menospreciados por el prejuicio y la tradición, mostró de nuevo un rostro duro y preocupante de la sociedad. Ese que ignora su existencia o lo que es aún peor, continúa sin asumir su gravedad e importancia.

¿Cuál es el error en la visión de nuestra sociedad que hace que la agresión contra las mujeres se normalice y se invisibilice, tanto como para considerarse un hecho normal y admisible?

Cuando tenía unos dieciseis años leí un articulo en un periódico que creo se convirtió en la huella de mis pesadillas más personales. No recuerdo su autor, aunque sí el hecho que estaba ilustrado con la caricatura de una mujer que, vestida de negro, se encogía hasta casi desaparecer del plano central de la imagen. El texto — crudo, mordaz y estremecedor sentenciaba — analizaba el maltrato de género desde la escalofriante perspectiva de la indiferencia: ""Al parecer, podrías ser víctima de la violencia solo por ser hermosa y joven, o simplemente tener un aspecto saludable. Eso quiere decir que las mujeres solo estaremos a salvo una vez que entramos en la vejez. Pero también he de mencionar que los casos de violencia sexual contra ancianas crecen exponencialmente año tras años. Tal vez, sea solo cuestión de no llevar ropas llamativas -tengas la edad que tengas — y vestirse de negro y muy cerrado para cubrir el hecho que eres mujer. Sin embargo, debo decirte que también existen pruebas irrefutables que hay cierto tipo de psicópatas que se excitan ante la visión de una mujer cubierta por ropas gruesas y eso desata un indice de agresividad inaudita. Así que, tal vez lo mejor sea no existir, no estar en la realidad, desaparecer cualquier huella de femineidad, porque es evidente que el mero hecho de ser mujer ya es premisa para sufrir una grosera manifestación de horror"".

La iniciativa del concurso sorprendió y abrió una amplia discusión sobre la necesidad de convertir el debate sobre la violencia de género en una discusión pública.

Sí, memoricé el pasaje. Y es que, a través de los años, lo he meditado en numerosas ocasiones, aterrada y asqueada. Tal vez se trate de una exageración de esa realidad de lo femenino y lo masculino. Sin duda, en muchas partes lo es, pero resulta inquietante pensar que en algún extremo en cierto. ¿Cuál es el error en la visión de nuestra sociedad que hace que la agresión contra las mujeres se normalice y se invisibilice, tanto como para considerarse un hecho normal y admisible? ¿Qué hace que frases como ""las mujeres desean que se les ponga carácter"" o ""se mereció ser golpeada"" continúen siendo pronunciadas por hombres jóvenes?

No nos engañemos, toda esta estructura social machista tiene su origen en el hecho que continúa existiendo una creencia cultural que menosprecia a la mujer, moral e intelectualmente hablando. Por cada mujer emprendedora, fuerte y luchadora, existen diez que son educadas para el servilismo, que carecen de una educación sólida y una preparación cultural sustentable. Y por ese motivo es tan importante la lucha diaria, la noción sobre a qué se enfrenta una mujer en medio de una cultura hostil y cómo podemos construir una idea sobre la igualdad, que brinde una nueva manera de confrontar la violencia y el dolor femenino.

Me pregunto si al escuchar las cifras pronunciadas por las concursantes de Miss Perú la mayoría del público comprendió su trascendencia. Su importancia y poder. El necesario trabajo que se requiere para comprender la envergadura del problema del maltrato de género y sus consecuencias. Sin duda, se trata de un hito en medio de la lucha por mostrar las consecuencias de la cultura del machismo en nuestro continente. El primero — de muchos pasos — para crear un ambiente seguro para las mujeres y niñas latinoamericanas. Y eso tiene su mérito.

Die Gegner des Landeschefs Uwe Junge rufen zur Revolte auf

Der Vorgang ist außergewöhnlich - und könnte Auswirkungen auf die gesamte Partei haben

Auch nach den Querelen um den Rückzug der AfD-Chefin Frauke Petry kommt die Partei nicht zur Ruhe.

Während sich die AfD im Bundestag sortiert, gärt es in den Landesverbänden gewaltig.

Der Landtagsfraktion in Sachsen und Nordrhein-Westfalen droht nach einer Austrittswelle das Aus. In Petrys Landesverband in Sachsen wurde gar ein Notvorstand berufen. Und auch die Auseinandersetzungen in der AfD-Fraktion in Rheinland-Pfalz nehmen zu.

Im Fokus: Der rheinland-pfälzische AfD-Chef Uwe Junge. Er muss sich seit einigen Wochen mit lautem, parteiinternen Widerstand herumschlagen.

Querelen um den Parteitag

► Ende Oktober versäumte er, die Einladungen zum Parteitag rechtzeitig an die Mitglieder zu verschicken. Daraufhin regte sich heftiger Widerstand. Die HuffPost berichtete.

Solche kleinen Formfehler könnten sich ""bitter rächen"", sagte der Polit-Experte Werner Patzelt von der TU Dresden. “Das machen sich interne Gegner zu Nutze, die sich in der Partei gegen die Führung durchsetzen wollen.”

► Nun steht Junge erneut unter Druck - im Kern geht es um eine Initiative seiner parteiinternen Rivalin und Stellvertreterin Christiane Christen.

In einem Aufruf, der bereits mehrere hundert Unterzeichner hat, appelliert sie, zu den ""Gründungsidealen der Partei"" zurückzukehren. Christen kritisiert die undurchsichtige Verteilung von Posten und deren Bezahlung. Der Landesvorstand solle zur ""Integrität und Rechtstreue"" zurückkehren.

Vorwürfe sind ""falsch und böswillig""

Junge wandte sich daraufhin in einer Mail wütend an die rheinland-pfälzischen AfD-Mitglieder. Die Vorwürfe seien ""falsch und böswillig"", heißt es einem Schreiben, dass der HuffPost vorliegt.

Weiter schreibt Junge an die Mitglieder: ""Schenken Sie Gerüchten und Böswilligkeiten keinen Glauben!""

Der Aufruf suggeriere, den Mitgliedern werde ""die Partei weggenommen oder es bestünde zumindest die Gefahr dazu. Ich möchte diesem Aufruf mit einem Schreiben an Sie alle entgegen treten, weil hier der erneute Versuch unternommen wird, die gute Arbeit des Landesvorstands und der Fraktion in Frage zu stellen.""

Christen hatte sich Mitte des Jahres aus dem Landesverband zurückgezogen, nachdem ihre Bewerbung auf die Spitzenkandidatur zur Bundestagswahl gescheitert war.

""Die Vorgänge sind bemerkenswert""

Die Vorgänge sind ungewöhnlich - und könnten auch über die Landesgrenzen hinaus in der AfD zu spüren sein. Denn der Machtkampf kann für Junge gefährlich werden, sagt Carl Berning, Politologe an der Universität Mainz.

""Seine Aussichten auf eine Karriere in Berlin schwinden, wenn der Eindruck entsteht, dass er seinen Laden nicht im Griff hat.”

Der Machtkampf sei insofern bemerkenswert, weil der Landesverband in der Außenwahrnehmung als einer der stabilsten in Westdeutschland gilt, erklärt Berning.

""Der Machtkampf könnte Junge gefährlich werden""

Junge gilt in der Partei als gemäßigt, galt bis zu Petrys Weggang als Vertrauter der damaligen Parteichefin und unterstützt den Partei-Ausschluss des Rechtsaußen Björn Höcke.

Einige Beobachter sehen in dem Machtkampf um Junge deswegen auch einen Kampf des rechten Lagers um die Vorherrschaft in der Partei.

""Zeit für einen Putsch ist günstig""

Zum Showdown könnte es auf dem Landesparteitag Ende des Jahres kommen. Weil dann auch der Landesvorstand gewählt werden muss, könnten Junges Gegner zur offenen Revolte blasen.

“Die Zeit für einen Putsch im Landesverband ist kurz vor dem Parteitag strategisch günstig"", sagt Politologe Berning.

Bis zur nächsten Landtags- und Bundestagswahl ist es noch lange hin. Ein Streit um die Parteiführung würde also keine Stimmen kosten - sofern es gelingt, wieder Einigkeit herzustellen.

""Dies wird nötig sein, sollte der Streit um die Parteiführung tatsächlich eskalieren, um einen personellen Wechsel hervorzurufen"", sagt Berning.

Falls es tatsächlich zum Putsch kommt, wäre das ein weiterer Schritt zur Radikalisierung der Partei.

Η φωτογραφία είναι προφανές πως έχει τραβηχτεί από κάποιον παπαράτσι, καθώς η ποιότητα είναι αλλοιωμένη λόγω της απόστασης και η Sia είναι με την πλάτη γυρισμένη στο φακό, αγνοώντας την παρουσία του.

Η Sia ανέβασε ένα screenshot της «προσφοράς» που έκανε ο πωλητής της φωτογραφίας στους ενδεχόμενους αγοραστές, η οποία αναγράφει:

«Αν την αγοράσετε, δεν θα είναι θολή και θα λάβετε επιπλέον άλλες 14 φωτογραφίες».

Έτσι, προκειμένου να γλιτώσει τους φαν της από την κομπίνα και να ξεμπερδεύει μια ώρα αρχύτερα με το όλο θέμα, η Sia ανέβασε ολόκληρη τη φωτογραφία στον λογαριασμό της στο Twitter, γράφοντας:

«Απ' ότι φαίνεται κάποιος προσπαθεί να πουλήσει γυμνές φωτογραφίες μου στους φαν μου. Γλιτώστε τα χρήματά σας, ορίστε, εδώ είναι δωρεάν για όλους. Κάθε μέρα είναι Χριστούγεννα!».

Μπορείτε να δείτε ολόκληρη τη φωτογραφία εδώ.

Δεν είναι η πρώτη φορά που κάποιος, παπαράτσι ή χάκερ, προσπαθεί να πουλήσει γυμνές φωτογραφίες των σταρ στο διαδίκτυο. Όλοι θυμόμαστε το μεγάλο σκάνδαλο του 2014, όταν εξαιτίας μιας μεγάλης εισβολής στην υπηρεσία iCloud της Apple, διέρρευσαν στο ίντερνετ γυμνές φωτογραφίες δεκάδων διασημοτήτων, μεταξύ των οποίων ήταν η Jennifer Lawrence και η Kate Upton.

Κανείς όμως, μέχρι σήμερα, δεν είχε χειριστεί το θέμα τόσο έξυπνα και με τόσο αυτό-σαρκασμό, όσο η Sia.

Και ο κόσμος του Twitter της το αναγνώρισε αυτό:

Trump attended a state dinner at Seoul's Blue House as part of his Asian tour on Tuesday evening, where he dined with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. While Trump's Japanese hosts catered to his preferences and provided him with grilled steaks and chocolate sundaes just a few days earlier, the South Koreans decided otherwise.

Guests at the dinner were served traditional, high-quality Korean cuisine, including a dish with a 360-year-old soy sauce. So if you do the math, the name of the sauce implies that it was made back in 1657, 119 years before the U.S Declaration of Independence was signed. So the sauce Donald Trump ate on Tuesday evening is older than modern America itself. I was really looking forward to a cheeseburger and fries. Here's what else was served at the dinner.

Corn porridge with fresh herb and vegetable side dishes;

Grilled sole from Geoje island with brown bean sauce consomme;

Pine mushroom rice in a stone pot with prawns caught in the waters of Dokdo mixed with stir-fried glass noodles and vegetables, and grilled Korean beef ribs seasoned with a special sauce made with a 360-year-old soy sauce served on a tray;

Triple chocolate cake served with raspberry vanilla sauce and cinnamon punch granita served with dried persimmons.

All sounds pretty delicious doesn't it?

Of course, Trump isn't in South Korea just to sample the food. The President is visiting South Korea as part of a wider Asian tour that includes visits to Vietnam, the Philippines and China as well as South Korea. He has already visited Japan.

The trip aims to address the threat of North Korea, promote trade in the Indo-Pacific Region and advance American trade and economic practices in the area.

During a press conference in South Korea, Trump called for North Korea to ""come to the table"" and discuss destroying the nuclear weapons the rogue state has in its possession. This more diplomatic approach contrasts to previous Trump rhetoric where he threatened ""fire and fury"" against Pyongyang.

Yeah, the twist that Cate Blanchett’s character, Hela, was Thor’s sister got out before the movie premiered on Friday, and Mark Ruffalo accidentally live-streamed the movie at an early screening, but many of the film’s secrets remain intact, including some major cameos.

Warning: “Thor: Ragnarok” spoilers below!

After Thor (Chris Hemsworth) gets back to Asgard, where Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has been ruling in an Odin (Anthony Hopkins) disguise after secretly exiling the real Odin, Thor witnesses a play honoring Loki’s “death,” which happened in “Thor: The Dark World.” (Don’t worry. The dude wasn’t really dead.)

In the play scenes, Thor is played by Luke Hemsworth, Chris’ older brother; Odin is played by Dr. Grant himself, Sam Neill; and Loki is played by Matt Damon wearing a ridiculous Loki wig.

Director Taika Waititi told HuffPost the Damon cameo really happened because he’s good friends with Chris.

“It was like an homage to the previous films but also being a bit more irreverent, being able to poke fun at ourselves,” he said in reference to the play scene. “Chris is very good at that. He has great self-deprecating humor.”

Steve Granitz via Getty Images Luciana Barroso and Matt Damon at the ""Thor: Ragnarok"" premiere Oct. 10.

The director said the play was planned as an in-joke for everyone who saw “Thor: The Dark World,” adding, “We shot everything the same size and the same angle and we basically copied the entire death scene from that movie.”

For those who haven’t seen the previous “Thor” film, Waititi says it is still an “interesting piece of story” that helps set up Loki’s storyline.

As far as the other surprises in the movie, you should probably just see them for yourself. Marvel has gone to great lengths to keep them quiet. Even the trailers were digitally altered from the final film to hide plot points.

“When we came out with our first trailer, there were a few stories in we weren’t sure if we wanted in the film or not,” said Waititi. The director said they just “wanted to make a cool trailer,” but promotion “shouldn’t necessarily be just showing shots from the finished movie.”
