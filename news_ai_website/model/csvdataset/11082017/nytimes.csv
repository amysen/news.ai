“Mad Men” is steeped in literary allusions.","It’s unusual for a debut author to be showered in such over-the-top accolades and compared to literary masters. But then again, Mr. Weiner, 52, has hardly been laboring in obscurity. In a screenwriting career that spans more than 20 years, he’s been a creative force behind some of our era’s most revered cable dramas, shows that were credited with reinventing the narrative possibilities of television. He received two Emmys for “The Sopranos,” which he worked on as a writer and producer, and was the creator, showrunner, head writer, director and executive producer for “Mad Men,” which aired for seven seasons and won four Golden Globes and 15 Emmys.

Writing fiction has long been a goal of his, but it always felt intimidating.

“I was always hoping I would do it,” he said during an interview this fall over lunch at the Carlyle Hotel on the Upper East Side, not far from where the novel takes place. “I just didn’t know if I could.”

Mr. Weiner’s foray into fiction surprised a lot of Hollywood observers. “Everyone was breaking down his door to do another show, and he goes off and does something that no one was expecting,” said Semi Chellas, a writer who worked on “Mad Men.” “The contrariness of going off and writing fiction after ‘Mad Men’ was very Matt.’ ”

For fans of “Mad Men,” a precisely observed, sprawling drama that chronicled the hedonistic, boozy office culture of a Madison Avenue advertising agency in the 1960s, “Heather” might seem like a surprising and perhaps unsatisfying creative pivot for Mr. Weiner. The story has just four central characters and can be inhaled in a single sitting. It lacks the long narrative arc and subtle character development that made “Mad Men” an addictive and gratifying show that rewarded close watching. But in other ways, “Heather” feels like a stylistic and thematic sibling of “Mad Men,” particularly in Mr. Weiner’s almost surgical dissection of the ways that social status, wealth, gender and class define us.

“As we know from his television work, he’s a great observer of people,” said Ms. Messud, author of “The Burning Girl.” “This is almost like a bullet train. He’s distilled the narrative down to its essence.”

“Heather” unfolds in present-day Manhattan, and like so many gripping New York stories, the plot hinges on real estate. The couple at the center of the story, Mark and Karen Breakstone, lead sheltered, privileged lives, and fawn over their perfect daughter, Heather. Mark, who works in finance, frets about his annual bonus and his status, while Karen stays home to tend to Heather, then becomes resentful when Heather grows up and no longer needs her. The Breakstones’s quiet, simmering dissatisfaction is interwoven with a darker, parallel story about a man named Bobby Klasky, who grew up neglected by his a heroin-addicted mother and developed a violent streak. The two narratives collide when Bobby finds work on a construction crew that is renovating the penthouse in the Breakstones’s building, and becomes obsessed with Heather.

In a way, it’s not all that surprising that Mr. Weiner turned to fiction. He grew up loving Mark Twain and J.D. Salinger. As a college student at Wesleyan University, he wrote poetry and studied philosophy, literature and history. “Mad Men” is steeped in literary allusions. Mr. Weiner has cited Cheever, Frank O’Hara and Sherwood Anderson as writers whose work influenced him and informed the show. At the start of every season in the writers room, Mr. Weiner began by reading Cheever’s preface to his “Collected Stories.” He often brought in short stories or poetry that he read aloud. Once, he brought in an audio recording of Sylvia Plath reading her poetry and had the writing staff listen for about an hour, Ms. Chellas said. “Very rarely was there a direct point, it was more a mood or a tone that he wanted to explore,” she said.

Over lunch at the Carlyle, Mr. Weiner was cheerful and animated, occasionally breaking into high pitched peals of laughter. He gushed about his favorite books and authors and seemed more eager to talk about his reading than his writing, noting that he went on a binge-reading tear after finishing “Mad Men,” and devoured books by Haruki Murakami, Donna Tartt, Delmore Schwartz, John Steinbeck and Hermann Hesse, among others. He gossiped about famous dead novelists like they were old acquaintances. While describing his writing process and sources of inspiration, he dropped in bits of literary trivia and issued pronouncements about writers he admires.

Mark Twain: “He’s amazing! He dictated!”

Tolstoy’s “Anna Karenina”: “There’s like five novels in that thing.”

Charles Dickens: “I consider him the first TV writer.”

Patricia Highsmith: “She was at Yaddo! I love her work. I like the fact that it isn’t judgmental and it’s a little perverse.”

The idea for “Heather” came from a scene Mr. Weiner witnessed when he was walking around the Upper East Side. in the fall of 2015. He saw an attractive teenage girl walking into an apartment building where construction work was being done, and noticed one of the workers staring at her with what looked like a mixture of lust and menace. Mr. Weiner jotted down his observations in a notebook where he collects ideas and stray bits of dialogue, and wasn’t sure if anything would come of it.

While he was at Yaddo, he kept thinking about the girl and the construction worker, puzzling over what he had seen, and began writing a fictionalized story about the years leading up to the encounter. He wrote 5,000 words over the next 16 days, and finished a draft in nine months.

Mr. Weiner is now back to writing and producing TV — he’s currently working on his new show, “The Romanoffs,” an anthology series for Amazon that follows people who believe themselves to be descendants of the Russian imperial Romanov family.

He still seems surprised that he’s adding novelist to his resume. He never expected to finish the book, much less publish it.

The garrison mentality and the aversion to non-Christians are influenced, at least in part, by France, Quebec’s colonial master until the British took control of the province in 1759. Unlike the rest of the country, Quebec sees itself in France’s model of “laïcité,” a fierce secularism in which public expressions of religion are frowned upon. France banned the wearing of face coverings in public in 2010.

Quebec’s politicians have long been willing to stoke fear of change for electoral gain.

In 2006, a Hasidic group petitioned a Montreal Y.M.C.A. to frost its windows — the sweaty flesh inside the gym, visible from the sidewalk, was too much for Orthodox Hasidim. Other isolated incidents followed, including a request from a Muslim group to have pork-free baked beans served at a maple syrup shack. From these episodes a fearsome narrative was formed, fueled by tabloid media and some populist politicians: Immigrants were destroying Quebec’s way of life.

In 2013, the separatist Parti Québécois government introduced the “Quebec values charter,” which sought to ban all “conspicuous” religious attire from anyone drawing a government paycheck.

It came with a helpful chart, displayed in subway stations and other public spaces, of an outsize crucifix, a hijab, a niqab, a turban and a skullcap — all types of religious accouterments the proposed law sought to ban. Attacks on Muslim women increased during the debate over the law, according to one of the province’s largest women’s coalitions. (The bill never passed, and the Parti Québécois lost the next election to the provincial Liberal Party.)

The new Quebec ban is popular. A recent Angus Reid Institute poll found that 87 percent of Quebecers are in favor of it. With its introduction, the unpopular Quebec premier, Philippe Couillard, has found a rare rallying point for his government.

Muslims who cover their faces in Quebec — perhaps fewer than 100 women in a province with nearly eight million people, according to a 2013 study — will face a bewildering set of rules. It must be removed in the classroom, though it can remain in hallways or on campus. Veil-wearers can read a book at the library, but must remove the veil when checking it out.

Quebec’s justice minister, Stéphanie Vallée, recently confirmed that the ban would include not only Muslim veils but accessories like sunglasses as well. This is ripe for satire similar to that inflicted on Quebec’s infamous language police, which must ensure that English on signs is less prominent than the French. It will be up to bus drivers to not only ferry passengers, but to measure the size and tint of their spectacles.

Religious face coverings are divisive, even among Muslims. Yet the freedom to practice one’s religion is enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The National Council of Canadian Muslims, along with the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and a Quebec Muslim who wears a veil, recently filed a legal challenge of the law, calling it a collection of “blatant and unjustified violations of freedom of religion.”

Quebec’s government has not only opened itself up to legal challenges, it has also put the province in the dubious company of countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran, where the governments also dictate what a woman can or cannot wear.",Quebec’s Anti-Muslim Ban on the Veil,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/opinion/quebec-veil-ban.html

Today’s most popular and effective classifiers for object recognition, used widely in self-driving car software, are called deep neural networks.
The trickiest part of the transition to a self-driving future may be figuring out liability when accidents do happen.
There will be some initial awkwardness around self-driving vehicles, just as there was around ride-hailing in the first place.","Technically speaking, self-driving cars are already here. But in even the most optimistic scenario — given their persistent difficulties with situations as simple as a snowy day — robot drivers will remain wildly outnumbered by human drivers for the foreseeable future. Autonomous cars can’t change the world until they’re a major presence on the road.

Call it 20 percent: the day, if it ever arrives, that one out of five vehicles you encounter will be driving itself. In some ways, the 20 percent era is harder to imagine than the fully automated era, because this supposedly unstoppable and frictionless technology will still be embroiled in a total mess. The best, safest models will most likely come with the highest price tags, out of reach for those with average incomes. Coexistence between human and robot drivers will be uneasy at best; road rage against the machine will boil over. One catastrophic accident could still imperil the whole experiment, no matter what the overall statistics show.

But that inevitable mess is precisely what makes the one-in-five future so interesting to ponder. It’s the first point, give or take, when it will be clear that a true self-driving future is even possible. When car companies will actually be able to rip out the steering wheels from some models, designing them in entirely different ways. When big trucking firms and car services like Uber will have begun to remove drivers from their vehicles. When hypercommuters will trust their cars to drive them three hours to the office while they sleep. When you might risk putting your child in one, alone.

Will We Need A License To Ride? By Tom Vanderbilt In 2008, I rode in a Stanford University VW Passat called Junior on a closed course in New York. Like a lot of beginners, it moved haltingly, with great caution; its minders in the front seats kept a close watch. But the moment felt transformative. Driving, burned since adolescence into my muscle memory and sensory apparatus, was being executed without my (or any human) involvement. I felt like a ghost in the machine. The autonomous vehicle went from test-track prototype to showroom reality far faster than I envisioned, propelled as much by advances in sensors and A.I. as by a collective hype cycle that seemed intent on willing these devices into existence, whether society was ready for them or not. Sitting with that “beginner” driver in 2008, as engineers closely observed its movements, took me back to that life-defining moment of getting a driver’s license. In my wallet, sparse with a library card and a school-lunch ticket, the license had real heft. It represented a primordial entry point to adulthood, a vast expansion of social possibility. As a rite, the driver’s exam — I have failed it in two countries — is a ritual by turns (three-point, of course!) tedious and terrifying. If you can summon nothing else of the 1988 teen comedy “License to Drive,” you can still see James Avery’s gleefully malevolent D.M.V. examiner, wielding his famous coffee cup. Once autonomous technology begins to really take off, will the driver’s license, and the pedagogy behind it, go the way of the stick shift? Will the ability to drive begin to seem some exotic, rarely necessary skill — like starting a fire with a flint? After all, in a vehicle that meets the Level 5 automation criteria of SAE International — “full-time performance by an Automated Driving System for all aspects of the dynamic driving task under all roadway and environmental conditions” — there would seem to be little point in possessing this vestigial skill. We don’t require people entering elevators, riding in airport trams or letting Roombas loose upon their living rooms to be able to take over operation in case of machine failure; it’s hard to see why our interaction with this automated technology should be any different. Our learning process could be as quick and dirty as it is with other high-tech products: Toss out the instruction manual and watch someone do it on YouTube. But this possibility, driver made passenger, broaches new territory in jurisprudence. With no licenses, what is the legal basis for restricting anyone — tweens, the elderly — from being ferried about? Young farm kids’ driving the family truck seems as obsolete as tail fins, but what’s stopping kids from being driven? Could children, often more adept at handling the smartphones of their parents than their owners are, have an advantage on older drivers less accustomed to technology? Yet the same fears that keep parents from letting their children walk to school may prevail over the allure of their autonomous vehicle handling the school run. It seems hard to say whether autonomous vehicles would hasten or delay the passage to adulthood. And as drivers interact with semiautonomous vehicles in the long run-up to Level 5, driver education and licensing, far from becoming obsolete, may become more important, argues John D. Lee, a professor of engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “Automation has a strong tendency to surprise people with unexpected behavior,” he says. Knowing what your car is doing — and when to take over — could be more vital than merely knowing how to drive. That water on the road — is it a surface puddle, or a veritable lake filling a gigantic pothole? That truck ahead with the dangerously swaying load — do you speed up to pass it? Is the pedestrian by the marked crosswalk waiting for you to yield or simply checking his iPhone? “Driving and managing the automation that is helping you drive,” Lee says, “are two quite different skill sets. Automation-management skills need to be learned as much as driving skills.” Tom Vanderbilt is the author of “You May Also Like” and “Traffic.”

Empty-Car Surfing By Rollo Romig Driverless cars will sometimes need to move around the city with no humans in them at all — en route to pickups or drop-offs. As empty moving vehicles become a common sight, they’re sure to enable an annoying off-label use: a flowering youth subculture of external joy riding, similar to subway surfing. All over the country, bored teenagers will lurk on the roadside, waiting to leap onto the roofs of empty cars, hanging on for as long as they can. The surfers will take advantage of advances in cloaking technology to help them confuse the cars’ sensors. Some will develop a clever assortment of grips and attachments to help them stay on, although the best among them will sneer at those who need to use tools. Fatalities will be inevitable, and often gruesome. To keep the kids off, car owners will try to coat their cars in slick repellents; these will be effective but too messy to be practical. Soon, dealers of autonomous cars will offer optional rows of spikes similar to those we already use to keep homeless people off benches. Once again, design will become more hostile in the name of safety. Rollo Romig is a journalist based in New York.

New Frontiers in Mobile Leisure By James Somers Just two months ago, the House unanimously passed a bill that would allow self-driving cars to be largely exempted from the safety standards that for decades have constrained the design of automotive interiors. There are only so many places you can bolt seatbelts to the car’s frame, after all. But once autonomous technology matures, some models will be made so much roomier that they will become rooms. A high clearance and thin frames will mean getting in without bending down. All the impedimenta of front seats — the jutting dash, the steering wheel and pedals, the high center console with a stick — can fold away. You’ll be able to swivel in your chair like a captain in “Star Trek.” Liberated from having to watch the road, commuters’ eyes will be free to — what else? — consume video content. Sound’s hold on drive time — first with terrestrial radio, then satellite radio, then podcasts — will gave way to sight. But what kind of videos will we watch? If Marchetti’s constant holds (this is the idea that as transportation technology and urban planning change, people contort their lives to keep their commutes to an average of one hour per day), they will be not feature films but TV shows and short videos of the kind being increasingly produced for Facebook and YouTube. Podcasts will be displaced by vodcasts. Media companies are already negotiating with carmakers about how to price their offerings. Should in-car entertainment work more like cable or like the on-demand system in a hotel? Like Netflix or like Roku? Most riders who play games will use their phones. But by the time one in five cars is autonomous, console makers will develop specific products for it. The nearly two hours a day of console gaming played by some 60 million Americans will tick up accordingly. Swarms of commuters hitting the morning and evening roads in waves will become swarms of druids or mercenaries in massively multiplayer online games, some of which might come to incorporate the driving experience itself, a Pokémon Go for the highway. It seems less likely that we’ll use this opportunity to steal time back from screens. But if there’s enough space for a table, maybe commuters will sit around it playing poker or telling stories. Cars are, indeed, the most private places we have, sealed shut, out of earshot. (The writer Nicholson Baker has said that he likes to write while in a car parked in a shady spot.) Chris Anderson — formerly the editor of Wired, now the head of a drone-data company and, in his spare time, of a racing league for autonomous cars — says the question of what we’ll do inside self-driving cars always comes up at cocktail parties. It always confounds him. “We have this world,” he says. “It’s called the back seat of an Uber.” We already know what passengers do in back seats, be they in a limo or an R.V. or a tour bus: They pull out their phones or their iPads, or they talk to one another, or they take a nap. Why should we think that not having a driver will change anything? In an essay for Real Life magazine titled “Perpetual Motion Machines,” Chenoe Hart argues that we miss something when we think of autonomous cars this way, as a difference in degree, not in kind. Because we won’t have to worry about driving, vehicle interiors can expand to a point where we’ stop thinking of them as vehicles: They might have fully functional kitchens, or gyms, or beds. Instead of going to the coffee shop, the coffee shop might come to you; instead of going into the garage to pull out your car, the garage will be the car. The ability to summon spaces like this, Hart writes, will turn the built environment into a kind of random-access memory — with every destination equally accessible from anywhere. Whether it drove to you or you to it will be irrelevant; motion will be so smooth and constant as to be imperceptible. Hart argues that when travel becomes fully autonomous, we will always be traveling: families or co-workers in quiet concert on giant roads, moving in a cluster of moving buildings, chasing good weather, hardly aware that we’re going anywhere at all. James Somers is a writer and programmer based in New York.

The Autonomous-Car Workout By Gretchen Reynolds Dashboard resistance straps would allow mid-ride rowing. A harness could allow squats on a balance ball. Ceiling straps would enable a classic pull-down exercise. Interiors could include exercise bikes with harness clips. This upper-body chest fly would require straps anchored to the windows and doors. Dashboard resistance straps would allow mid-ride rowing. Ceiling straps would enable a classic pull-down exercise. A harness could allow squats on a balance ball. Interiors could include exercise bikes with harness clips. This upper-body chest fly would require straps anchored to the windows and doors. There’s never enough time in the day to exercise, but perhaps the solution is in our cars. “A self-driving vehicle could definitely make a great gym, because it’s rigid all over,” says Marko Vujicic, an engineer and a partner at NPD Team, a company that consults with exercise-equipment manufacturers about machine designs. “That rigidity theoretically allows you to use every plane of the car against which to apply resistance. Your car becomes a full weight room on wheels.” It’s not as straightforward as it sounds. For one thing, the vehicles would not be freed from the laws of physics. Should your car abruptly brake while you were, for example, running on a treadmill, the treadmill would cease moving forward — but you wouldn’t, at least until you hit a windshield or door. It might be easier to remain seated. “The car could have special pockets all over the place that hold resistance bands of different strengths,” says Bryant Johnson, a personal trainer and the author of “The Ruth Bader Ginsburg Workout.” “You could use those to get a full-body strength-training workout.” Throughout your commute, your future car could scrutinize your efforts, says Steve McCauley, the head of health services for the Wynn Las Vegas resort, with fingertip monitors or other sensors tracking your heart rate and the composition of your sweat. But realistically, many of us will use our salvaged commuting time otherwise. In tomorrow’s cars, the area beneath the hood may not be needed for a combustion engine, Vujicic says — but it will remain, for reasons of mechanical stability and safety. Fitted with some padding and a safety belt, it becomes a napping cave. Gretchen Reynolds is the Well columnist for the magazine.



Limin Hee on Learning From Singapore Interview By Jenna Wortham If self-driving cars start to make up a significant portion of urban traffic, they’re likely to push cities to become more populous and compact, with fewer owned vehicles and more car sharing. The future, that is, would look more like Singapore, one of the world’s densest cities, whose government in recent years has tried to curb car ownership and ease congestion problems. We reached out to Limin Hee, the director of research at Singapore’s Center for Livable Cities, to ask her about how she thinks autonomous cars will begin to change urban life. Tell me about Singapore’s approach to self-driving cars. The idea of autonomous vehicles is one measure we’re looking at to see a reduction in private car ownership. According to research done with M.I.T., we would only need about a third of the current vehicle population to provide mobility on demand. We find that a lot of private cars spend most of their time in parking lots. The land we use for parking could be used for other purposes. We are a very dense city, and we have been trying to plan our households around concentration of people. By 2030, we anticipate that eight out of 10 households will be within a 10-minute walk of a rapid-transit station. What about people who don’t live in a dense urban environment? Eighty percent of our population lives in high-rise housing. So we can safely say the majority live in dense conditions. How else do you see autonomous cars being used? Another possible use for them is trash collection and road sweeping. They don’t have to operate during people’s working hours. They can work in the dead of night, which helps us with congestion problems. What are the other motivating factors? We also have to reduce our reliance on manpower. It’s been increasingly difficult to recruit truck drivers and bus drivers in Singapore from our local population. We’re also trying to reduce our reliance on foreign labor. How will the technology transform the city? We are not so excited about the technology itself, as far as people owning self-driving cars. We are more focused on using autonomous vehicles as an urban infrastructure — a shared system that could allow the kind of accessibility that people have come to expect from their own cars. They could be as convenient as private cars, but at a much more affordable price point, and without adding to congestion and pollution. How might the shift reshape the work-life balance? Our whole relationship to commuting will change. It’s very appealing to our millennial generation, who are constantly on their phones and screens, and it will free people from focusing on driving. They can email and go on social media or read a book. You’ve talked a lot about the upsides. Are there any potential downsides that you’re preparing for? There are people who rely on being drivers as their jobs, but this is part of a greater technological disruption. There will be ways of either retraining or reskilling people whose jobs depend on driving to keep them gainfully employed. And if we have larger fleets of driverless cars, there will be more jobs to maintain these vehicles and keep them up to speed. Will it be affordable? The price of public transportation is regulated and managed, but we do want to offer people a range of options, including trains and car-sharing, so people can pick the option at the price point that works for them. In some cities in the United States, public transit has made segregation and social inequality worse: For example, certain train stops and bus lines don’t run from lower-income areas to wealthier ones. Is it possible that driverless cars will cause similar discrepancies? We actually think this will make Singapore more equitable as we try to move away from private cars, which worsen the divide between the haves and have-nots.

The Blind Spot of A.I. Cars By Yiren Lu The ongoing transformation of cars — from mechanical systems of gears and switches into computers with dreams of self-determination — has been accompanied, perhaps predictably, by a parallel evolution in security threats. A decade ago, hacking a car relied on physically tapping into its internal network, for instance through a port sometimes found behind the radio. By 2011, it was possible to do the same thing remotely. In a series of demonstrations using internet-enabled navigation and entertainment systems as ways to hack into a Jeep Cherokee, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek — both of whom later worked on self-driving security issues at companies like Uber, Didi Chuxing and Cruise — turned on its windshield wipers, disengaged the transmission and disabled the brakes, all from 10 miles away. These exploits, though dramatic, took advantage of the same vulnerabilities in cellular networks that might plague any tablet or smart vacuum cleaner. But a future in which one in five vehicles is autonomous will not only increase the attack “surface” (in the metaphor favored by researchers) of the car; it will also force manufacturers to confront more insidious security risks that are only now coming into view. It will become possible to compromise vehicles by hacking the environment. A car that drives itself uses sensors to construct high-resolution images of its surroundings, then runs them through a “classifier” to identify all the objects in the image. The classifier can do this because it has trained on labeled images; after seeing a hundred thousand trucks, it learns to recognize certain features as indicating truck-ness. Today’s most popular and effective classifiers for object recognition, used widely in self-driving car software, are called deep neural networks. But a deep neural network offers researchers very little understanding of why objects become classified as they do. Think of its output as a map, with each classification corresponding, like a ZIP code, to some demarcated region. Insead of existing in just two dimensions, though, the map has more like a thousand dimensions — and the slightest move in any one of these dimensions can push us into a different ZIP code and produce a false classification. This makes it possible for a hacker to construct slightly perturbed images, called “adversarial examples,” that look innocuous to the human eye but fool the car’s brain into making the wrong call, with potentially fatal consequences. Adversarial examples are extremely difficult to defend against. “We don’t understand these attacks,” says Dawn Song, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. “But the deeper question is that we don’t understand deep neural networks.” In a recent paper, Song and her co-authors introduced a method of constructing robust adversarial examples that can even be printed on paper and pasted to road signs. A stop sign defaced with specially calibrated graffiti, for instance, is recognized as a 45 m.p.h. speed-limit sign. Song’s warning extends beyond road infrastructure. While researchers for decades have been working on — and developing countermeasures for — software vulnerabilities, the study of security issues related to deep learning is still in its infancy. “We don’t have a precise mathematical definition of a pedestrian,” Song says. “There’s no way for us to write down a formula describing exactly what a pedestrian is. So we can’t even really define our security goals.” Even with a recent surge of interest in adversarial examples, researchers are still struggling to understand the scope of the problem. Given the physical-world ramifications, Song says, “we should have started even sooner.” Yiren Lu is a writer and software engineer in New York.

The Liability Conundrum By Nathaniel Popper If you think the aftermath of car crashes is complicated now — the arguments over fault, over repair costs, over whose insurance policy will pay — wait until self-driving cars are sharing the roads with human drivers. Start with all those delicate and expensive parts that communicate with a car’s software in order to make its autonomy possible. A fender-bender involving a Tesla means an expensive fender needs to be paid for; a part full of sensors and cameras costs a lot more to replace than a hunk of plastic on the back of an old Camry. In fact, some car insurers, like one AAA affiliate, have already said they would charge more to insure certain Tesla models. Tesla has countered with a campaign to convince insurers that its cars will be in fewer crashes; the company points to findings by regulators that its vehicles are involved in 40 percent fewer accidents when its autopilot software is installed. The trickiest part of the transition to a self-driving future may be figuring out liability when accidents do happen. Instead of quarreling only about which driver was at fault, we will also be able to argue about whether the self-driving features in either car may have played a role. A preview of these complications was evident in the aftermath of the crash that killed Joshua Brown, the Ohio man whose autopiloted Tesla ran into a tractor-trailer. Federal investigators determined that the accident was not caused by a defect in the autopilot software, and Tesla has said repeatedly that drivers should always have their hands on the wheel even when they are using the technology. But officials noted that Tesla’s technology was unable to detect cross-traffic like that presented by the tractor-trailer. Tesla subsequently updated its software to make similar accidents less likely in the future. So who was responsible for covering the damages? The insurance policy that covered Brown, who may not have fully understood the capabilities of his car, or Tesla? Neither Tesla nor Brown’s family has commented on who paid. And both car insurers and insurance regulators have been relatively slow to contend with the difficulty in assigning liability when a person is driving a car only part of the time. “Insurance policies have not necessarily caught up with the global advancement of A.I. technology in cars,” Brown’s lawyer told me. Not surprisingly, Silicon Valley, which is racing to raise the curtain on the era of autonomous vehicles, is also thinking about insurance. A start-up called Driav intends to bring down insurance rates by monitoring the reams of data coming out of self-driving cars in order to figure out, on a second-to-second basis, who or what caused the errors that led to a crash. “It’s silly that claims are a ‘he said, she said’ argument,” Dan Peate, Driav’s chief executive, told me. “The data can just tell us what happened.” The company hopes to begin offering insurance policies next year, with the expectation that they will be cheaper in part because the cars will be in fewer accidents and in part because it plans to be able to shift some liability onto the carmakers. In the long run, when all vehicles are driving themselves, the manufacturers themselves are very likely to assume all of the blame for accidents. Most such companies have said that they plan to pay for anything that happens while their cars and software are in charge. When that’s the case, insurance begins to look a lot more like a product warranty, covered by the carmaker, than a stand-alone product that a customer has to worry about. But in the transition years until then, there are likely to be a lot more messy arguments. Nathaniel Popper is a technology reporter for The Times.

Get Ready for D.O.A.s By Mark O’Connell When I think about the future these days, I inevitably return to a tweet from the writer Elizabeth Hamilton-Argyropoulos (a.k.a. @bourgeoisalien): “The saddest part about self-driving cars will be all the times people die mid-trip and then ur dinner guests or pizza guy will arrive dead.” To read this joke is to become immediately certain that this will absolutely happen — of course it will! — and that it will furthermore become as much a part of the texture of everyday future life as, say, traffic delays caused by collisions are now. Admittedly, the dead-pizza-guy notion doesn’t seem very likely: A large part of the impetus behind the development of self-driving technology in the first place is the desire to do away with the need for flesh-and-blood people who demand wages for their work. But the image feels symbolically resonant precisely because of the ghostly future of all those moribund jobs. Self-driving cars bearing the earthly remains of the recently deceased — automated Ubers, say, with heart-attack victims sprawled incredulously across the rear seat — are, in this sense, an extreme metaphor for the near future of capitalism. The technology will be miraculous, yes; but if it functions as intended, it will serve as an uncanny vector of human obsolescence. Mark O’Connell is a writer based in Dublin.

What Uber Was Built For By John Herrman If the history of highly anticipated technologies is any guide, the big hairy questions about self-driving cars will quickly give way to more practical ones: Where to go? What to do with this extra time? Can I ... take a nap? Self-driving cars will arrive for us as prompts for us to reconsider our lifestyles, and the way transit shapes and fits into them; for automakers, the transition will be a huge and perilous opportunity, representing either a new beginning or the beginning of an end. But there is one party for whom the meaning of the self-driving future is unambiguous: the ride-sharers. “Ride-sharing” was always a misnomer for companies like Uber and Lyft. As with the rest of the “sharing economy,” nothing was ever being shared; labor and services were being bought and sold. But as ride-share companies have grown, their ambitions have multiplied and compounded. Currently, their horizons are limited by widespread car ownership, alternative transit options and, primarily, their own cost. But autonomous cars make their grander plans — dreams of vast fleets of perfectly allocated and used vehicles — more plausible. They zero out a single variable, the cost of labor, that these companies believe is holding them back from utterly reshaping the world. Ride-share businesses are uniquely poised to manifest and demonstrate the big ideas of self-driving cars. They aren’t waiting for this change; they’re doing everything in their power to hasten it. Autonomous cars aren’t just part of the plan; they are the plan. Conservative estimates put the world’s Ubers and Lyfts in an enviable position as self-driving cars roll out. Bullish projections put them in an unassailable one. A 2017 report by Tasha Keeney, an analyst with ARK Invest, told the story in four numbers. A rider’s “all-in cost per mile” for average United States taxi services was about $3.50. For a human-driven Uber in San Francisco, that number was about $2.86. Assuming the same fuel price, the figure for personal cars is much lower, at around 70 cents. The estimate for self-driving taxi services, circa 2020, would cut that cost in half. At 35 cents per mile, tasks that were previously too expensive or that would have felt ridiculous become reasonable and routine. A world in which moving yourself or moving things to you costs almost nothing in terms of money or attention would remake places and transform lives. It would also bring with it new and complicated absurdities — the sort Americans adapt to quickly and then forget. (Like bottles of water shipped around the world and sold for $2, or electronics products assembled in one country from parts from six others, to be shipped to a seventh.) Riders will thrill to this new infrastructure as it incorporates the roads around them, providing novel experiences and conveniences. But this excitement will prevent us from seeing that our aspiring fleet managers hope to create something like the profound consolidation of the internet’s recent past. Just as Amazon the online store laid the groundwork for Amazon the comprehensive and omnipresent service, apps for human-driven taxis may have laid the groundwork for a thrumming on-demand grid, on which people and things can be placed and retrieved. Like Google and Facebook before them, which remapped, rerouted and dominated the old and diverse web infrastructure on which they were built, Uber and Lyft could say, credibly, that they work better with size and full participation. That market domination is merely the flip side of completeness. They will aspire to monopoly and could achieve, with startling speed, real and unprecedented claims over the roads we share — they will say they’ve found a better use for them, and if all goes to plan, riders will agree.

John Zimmer on A Whole New Lyft Interview by Kevin Roose Unless you’re a millionaire or a truck driver, your first encounter with a self-driving vehicle will probably be a car you ordered through a ride-hailing app like Lyft or Uber. These companies, which spent the first stage of their lives trying to get drivers into their cars, are spending the next one trying to get them out. There will be some initial awkwardness around self-driving vehicles, just as there was around ride-hailing in the first place. (Remember when it was weird to get into a stranger’s unmarked car?) But Lyft, for one, is betting that it can put a trustable face on the tech. In July, it announced Level 5, a lab where it will work on its own driverless software, in addition to developing an open self-driving network that companies like Ford and Jaguar Land Rover will be able to plug their vehicles into. The idea of the network is to combine multiple kinds of autonomous vehicles under one routing-and-request system, so that when you order a Lyft, the app will assess your route, check the weather and other factors and send you the best ride, whether that’s an autonomous Waymo or a human-driven S.U.V. John Zimmer, Lyft’s co-founder and president, explained its thinking. Uber built its own self-driving technology. Why did you decide to do it the way that you did? We weren’t in a position to start this effort two or three years ago. But by being later to launch, we’re able to take a different approach. Many platforms and technology have changed a lot in the last couple years. There are things that we can skip over. Lyft made people comfortable with riding in strangers’ vehicles by having pink mustaches on the front of the cars and friendly drivers. How do you plan to make people comfortable with a car that has no driver? I think that the first wave of autonomous vehicles will look very similar to the ones currently on the road, but as we move to the second wave, they’ll be more like a room on wheels. In a situation where you have 10 or 12 people in a car, we will have more of a shared-vehicle experience. In those cases, having a driver-host will make a ton of sense. Having hospitality delivered by other people is another way to make users comfortable — that’s why we don’t think there will ever be a moment where there would be fewer drivers or fewer job opportunities. You don’t think that there might be fewer Lyft drivers even 20 years from now? I think you’ll have way more. The cost of owning a car is $9,000 a year. Let’s say we offer a $500 monthly plan in which you can tap a button and get access to transportation whenever you want it, and you get to choose your room-on-wheels experience. Maybe you want a cup of coffee on your way to work, or you want to watch the Warriors game later, so you’re in what’s basically a sports bar, with a bartender. If 0.5 percent of all miles driven are done on a ride-sharing app, and then if that number increases to, say, 80 percent, it’ll be such a huge industry shift that even if only 2 percent of that 80 percent is done by human drivers, it still represents a drastic increase in the number of human ride-sharing drivers. Will there be a price difference between human-driven cars and autonomous cars? Maybe in the early days, people will pay more for the service, and again in the long term, when it’s a full-on experience. There are a lot of variables. When cars first replaced the horse and buggy, there was a backlash from people who thought they would take over. Do you think something similar will happen in the next few years as people start to see autonomous cars on the road? If companies don’t do a good job of explaining what’s happening and how it will impact society, that’s possible. I’m confident in how Lyft is going to behave. Right now, you guys want to be everyone’s friends in this industry. Will there be a time when the business becomes more mercenary? We’ll see. We’ve never seen a shift like this in our lifetime. To think that only one or two companies will handle the transition is incorrect.

But Ms. Lupton believes that those simplistic judgments are rooted in a quirk of psychology that makes them hard to avoid, and harder still to alter once they take hold.

“In political psychology there’s this notion of confirmation bias: that you have a predetermined belief about either an outcome or in this case whether a person is good or bad,” she said. That bias leads people to subconsciously select information that reinforces those beliefs — and to ignore facts that are inconsistent with it.

That helps explain how Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s champions in the West seemed to overlook signs that she might not be a paragon of liberal democratic values after all.

In a 2013 interview with the BBC, for instance, she brusquely dismissed questions about rising violence against the Rohingya, saying that Buddhists had also been displaced from their homes and that there was fear “on both sides.” Asked why the violence had overwhelmingly affected Muslims, she deflected, saying that Buddhists lived in fear of “global Muslim power.”

Though such episodes mounted during her rise, they conflicted with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s saintly image, and so went largely unnoticed. Western leaders continued to embrace her, building her legitimacy as they pressured the transitional government to hold elections that were widely expected to elevate her to power.

“Confirmation bias is so powerful that we can ignore information that conflicts, and don’t even notice we’re doing it,” Ms. Lupton said.

That can feed a much more significant political bias, experts say, toward believing that a political system will take on the characteristics of its leader. In fact, the truth is often the opposite.

Together, those biases make it easy to conclude that if heroic individuals could just win power, that would be enough to bring democracy and freedom.

“We’re always in search of the leader that we can rely on to be our partner so that we can just kind of sign off on that person and go back to worrying about other things,” said Elizabeth Saunders, a George Washington University political scientist who studies American foreign policy.

A Long Line of Would-Be Saviors

The simple story of a crusading leader who will transform a nation rarely works out that way.

The United States once championed the Afghan leader Hamid Karzai as the democratic successor to the Taliban’s oppressive regime. But Washington was disappointed to find that Mr. Karzai, rather than rising above the problems of corruption and cronyism that had beset Afghanistan, established an inner circle that embodied them.

“If you hold up a leader as a paragon of virtue, you may aid in consolidating their power, which can have all kinds of unintended consequences,” Ms. Saunders said.

In Rwanda, President Paul Kagame was hailed as his country’s savior when he took office, with Western support, after the 1994 genocide. But despite successes in reducing poverty, he has proved to be an authoritarian leader. Opposition politicians often end up in prison, in exile or dead. Human Rights Watch has documented widespread military detention and torture.

And it was easy to support the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement when it was a rebel group fighting Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese leader currently under indictment for genocide in Darfur. But after the group’s officers and allies took power in the newly independent South Sudan, they helped plunge the country into civil war.

It is not only Western leaders who make such misjudgments. In the 1960s and ’70s, activists worldwide cheered the rise of African independence leaders like Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, many of whom later hardened into dictators.

There are exceptions, such as Nelson Mandela, the first post-apartheid president of South Africa. But the Mandelas are so uncommon, and their successes rely on so many factors clicking into place, that they are still marveled over as wondrous mysteries, including among frustrated activists in Myanmar.

‘Features of a Dictator’

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is not Mr. Kagame or Mr. Mugabe, but after less than 20 months in office she is showing hints of the traits that define such leaders.

Upon winning power, she quickly sidelined many of the activists and civil society groups that had aided her rise. “She is only listening to those close to her,” said U Yan Myo Thein, an activist with the pro-democracy 88 Generation group and a former political prisoner, characterizing her inner circle as a “personality cult.”

“This is one of the features of a dictator,” he said.

As international plaudits for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi continued to mount, some in Myanmar saw growing signs that she was consolidating power and suppressing critics.

“Though they claim themselves as an icon of democracy, they want to centralize and control everything,” Kyaw Thu, who leads the prominent civil society group Paung-Ku, said of the elected government. He added, “Anyone not supporting their agenda is the enemy.”

Dozens have been charged under a law that restricts criticism of the government, an echo of the imprisonment of dissidents under military rule.

Aaron Connelly, an analyst at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia, said such measures “have characterized N.L.D. rule in Myanmar,” referring to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s political party.

Even beyond her stance on the Rohingya, he said, “Aung San Suu Kyi has not been a particularly liberal leader.”

Though senior policymakers seem confident in their habits, younger voices are beginning to question whether the international community, after so many such disappointments, might have something to learn.

“This pattern is far too frequent to be ignored,” Tim Hirschel-Burns, a Peace Corps officer in Benin, wrote on his personal blog.

Perhaps the underlying model, of reforming a troubled country by installing a promising leader, might have the problem backward, he argued. Perhaps change needs to come bottom-up, even if this is harder and messier and takes longer.

“People in these countries, just as we are, are largely products of their environments,” he wrote.

Treating Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi as somehow above Myanmar’s problems allowed the world to see only her “moral righteousness and bravery rather than the political force she represented,” he added.

Even leaders who say all the right things and show good intentions tend to reflect the systems through which they rise. If those systems remain broken, it is fair to blame leaders for their mistakes, but unrealistic to expect a different outcome.

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, after all, may be enacting a version of democratic rule that is in line with what many of Myanmar’s citizens demand.

A 2015 survey by Asia Barometer found that most respondents in the country opposed checks on executive power, believed religious authorities should have a role in lawmaking and said citizenship should be tied to religion. Support for a strong-handed ruler was high and support for full rights for minorities was low.

“People want democracy in the sense of being rid of dictatorship and having a leader that’s popularly elected,” said Thant Myint-U, a historian and former United Nations official. “But that’s very different from accepting the whole panoply of liberal values, especially when it comes to issues of race, ethnicity or gender equality.”

It is worth asking how much of the Western anger now directed at Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, including calls to revoke her Nobel Peace Prize, is partly buyers’ remorse from supporters who regret their own role in transforming her into such a powerful symbol.

Cities Without Signs By Clive Thompson Street signage is the iconography of the automobile age. It’s like highly functional pop art: silhouettes of schoolchildren, white arrows, rectangular cries of WRONG WAY and, most central of all, the ubiquitous stoplight. The traffic light might be the first part of that iconographic world to be transformed, or vanish altogether, once we are fully in the age of autonomous cars. Robots, after all, won’t need signs to optimize the way they move through urban landscapes. Urban-transportation experts have been busily creating computer simulations to show how this might work. In one model, each crossroads would have an “intersection manager,” a computer that senses the approaching traffic and uses wireless communication to talk to the oncoming cars. When each self-driving car is perhaps 300 yards away, it sends a request to the intersection manager — to turn right, say, or to move on through. The intersection manager then does an on-the-fly calculation to route that vehicle most efficiently, like an omnipotent and tireless traffic cop. The result? A ballet of cars whizzing and weaving past one another in the intersection. Some slow down as they approach; others pass straight through. But crucially, compared with today’s intersections, many fewer cars come to a complete halt. This could significantly speed up traffic throughout an entire city. Peter Stone, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin who works with one model, has found that the “delay” time at intersections shrinks remarkably. “Right now, it takes me an average of 20 minutes to get to work, but with autonomous-car intersections, it might be half that time,” he says. Safety would be enhanced, too: Forty-three percent of car crashes in the United States occur at intersections, and Stone predicts that robot vehicles would crash only if there was a mechanical error. Better yet, autonomous intersections could produce an estimated 20 to 50 percent less carbon dioxide, because there would be fewer idling cars and jack-rabbit starts. “That’s the most expensive and most polluting part of driving,” says Remi Tachet des Combes, a mathematician who created robot-intersection models while at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For the human passenger, though, a robotized intersection could be mildly terrifying — like flying through a crowded asteroid belt, trusting the A.I. to find the right path. “At first I think it will be freaky,” Stone admits. “Some people will need the window darkened so they don’t freak out.” But in the long run, we’ll probably shrug, get used to it and barely look up from our games of Candy Crush as we zip through. And pedestrians? They would probably push a button at the intersection to request their turn — or even use a smartphone app. More subtly unsettling, however, might be the spectacle of a city devoid of stoplights. Indeed, devoid of all major street signs: no huge billboards across highways naming the exits, no complex merge instructions. Those signs are expensive to build and maintain. They’re designed for humans, and GPS-brained robots don’t need them to know where they’re going. Certainly, human pedestrians and cyclists will still need guideposts, but as Stone suspects, far fewer, and smaller, ones. A world with almost no street signs would feel strange. It could make a city less cluttered and more attractive. But it might also leave us feeling unmoored. Social critics worry that GPS has already eroded our knowledge of the city; some studies have found that the more we rely on devices, the less we deeply intuit where we are and how to navigate on our own. “We become more helpless,” as Greg Milner, the author of “Pinpoint,” a history of GPS, told me. If robots rule the roads, we might get where we’re going a lot more quickly — but end up not knowing precisely where we are.

Picturing the Self-Driving City By Anna Wiener Marshall Brown, an associate professor of architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology, recently traveled to Ann Arbor, Mich., to visit the Mcity Test Facility, the University of Michigan’s 32-acre testing ground for automated vehicles. Mcity, which looks like a soundstage of a midcentury suburb, is a simulator: It has no actual residents. Still, Brown found it “bizarre and frankly frightening” that it looked as though the track had been designed almost entirely by transportation experts, not urban planners or architects. He identified it as part of a larger problem: As technologists imagine the driverless world, they seem to be doing so with a distinct lack of imagination. Brown is a creator of the Driverless City Project, an interdisciplinary research initiative at I.I.T. that takes a playful, rigorous approach to envisioning the fully autonomous future. The project helps participants generate various situations for a city in order to determine how autonomous cars will fit into the picture. Central to the project is a “mind map” representing the group’s research, organized into four areas of impact: street space, parking space, commuter space and delivery space. The map, as well as other tools — including a set of large tokens for scenario building, like a tarot deck for urbanists — is meant to encourage others to be ambitious and creative about the world in which they want to live. “We should write the future,” Brown says, “rather than trying to predict it.” Brown has found two prevalent attitudes when it comes to self-driving vehicles: either an active but unimaginative approach, rushing to build robots to accommodate the world as it is now, or a totally passive approach, a sort of “wait and see.” The first, he says, is characteristic of the tech industry; the second, of the public sector. “I hear too much surrendering in the question about our future right now,” he adds. “Just surrendering to Google or Amazon, or surrendering to your phone, or surrendering to a driverless car. We should not surrender.” One way to stave off surrender, Brown believes, is to invite more diverse thinkers, like architects and urban planners, into the process of imagining and designing the autonomous future. (He also listed sociologists, fiction writers, Buddhist monks, poets and rabbis as useful stakeholders.) The current discourse around the future of autonomous vehicles is centered on “technologically deterministic fantasies,” Brown says. He’s concerned that technological values — like logic, predictability and efficiency — will be erroneously imposed upon the built environment, leading to urban spaces that fail to take into account delight, pleasure or human connection. “A society is cultural, and political, and aesthetic, and about desires — it’s not just how you solve problems,” he says. “They’re going to need more than just software engineers working on it.” As an architect, Brown is especially attuned to the unlocked aesthetic potential of urban environments. Today’s visual clutter, necessary for keeping human-driven cars as nonlethal as possible, could be eradicated. It is critical, in his view, to consider the beauty and quality of the world that self-driving cars could bring. It’s worth considering, then, where cars will go when people don’t need them. “What happens when a car can park itself anywhere?” Brown asks. He hypothesizes that parking, if performed robotically, could become “a negative externality, not unlike that of a trash dump,” should developers repurpose garages and parking lots for more lucrative uses. (Why look for parking in Greenwich Village if the car can park itself on the edge of New Jersey?) In the Midwest, he speculates, deindustrialized cities with waning property values could even be bought wholesale and transformed into vast, flat parking lots — a future that he deemed plausible, if “too dystopian,” in no small part because of the likelihood that it would be pushed upon lower-income communities. On the other hand, those same communities could benefit from increased mobility and access to employment. Brown is also considering the changes to storage: If robotic trucks constantly roam our landscape, will warehouses be abandoned? He’s focused on the changing needs and desires of a human driver. To accommodate an autonomous, cross-country route, truck cabs, he speculates, may need to expand according to a driver’s needs, perhaps going so far as to resemble a microapartment. An emphasis (or lack thereof) on efficiency also addresses the temporal dimension of cities: It favors — or facilitates — a working lifestyle in which there is never enough time. In a future of increased automation and accessibility, work culture may begin to shift; labor, and its attendant time constraints, may no longer be central to the urban experience. Brown envisions the possibility of a hands-free commute that opens up space for socializing — “an interior social world.” Riders could chat with people in adjacent cars or simply take the opportunity to watch the world go by. (A more cynical take on this, he says, is that the hands-free commute will simply increase the demands on workers, as the car becomes an extension of the home office — a WeWork on wheels.) Second-order effects of autonomous vehicles tend to get lost in the techno-utopian chatter, but there seems to be an increasing awareness that self-driving cars won’t just arrive in cities; they’ll change them too. Some tech companies are beginning to get into data-driven city-building, a movement largely galvanized by the seeming inevitability of autonomous vehicles. Last year, Y Combinator announced a research initiative, New Cities, that aimed to study how to build a metropolis entirely from scratch. In mid-October, Sidewalk Labs, an Alphabet subsidiary, announced that it will redevelop a 12-acre strip along Toronto’s waterfront, called Quayside, which will integrate technology across the human experience. The vehicles it is planning to accommodate will be shared, electric and self-driving. Power and control over autonomous-vehicle technology is already concentrated in the hands of a small few: If a company like Uber or Alphabet controls the dominant transportation infrastructure, you need not live in an intentional community like Quayside to feel as though your city is becoming a company town. Brown is wary of the smart-cities initiative, and he resents the efforts of technology companies to fully saturate the human — and urban — experience. “A city is not a problem to be solved,” he says. “A city is a cultural construct, even though it involves the deployment of technologies. A city is not science alone.” Anna Wiener is a writer based in San Francisco.

The Augmented-Reality Windshield By Ferris Jabr For obvious reasons, our present-day cars are designed for keen observation of the outside world, offering a nearly panoramic view of the road and landscape through panels of glass. The parade of images flitting past a car’s windows can be exhilarating or can induce a kind of pleasurable trance. By virtue of being transparent and inert, however, windows are inherently limited. Although we have begun to augment the car’s field of vision with new layers of information — phones suction-cupped to the windshield, or GPS built into the dashboard — there is still so much useful knowledge just out of reach. Today’s windows allow you to scope out a parking spot or search for that tiny cafe with the faded sign, but they can’t help you find them. Nor can they show you exactly where that highway exit will lead or identify the odd building you just passed. Tomorrow’s could. Unlike Google Glass — which awkwardly placed screens where they didn’t need to be — a car already requires a membrane between passengers and their environment. Why not turn that typically passive barrier into a dynamic canvas? Ordinary windows could be replaced with holographic glass or an advanced semitranslucent liquid-crystal display. They could anticipate our needs and instantaneously display weather forecasts, reviews of nearby restaurants and hotels, details about popular tourist attractions — and warnings about miserable tourist traps. As the technology improves and people become more comfortable obscuring their surroundings, your windows could begin to overlay a vast digital diorama onto passing scenery. Passengers would no longer have to wonder about the identity of a landmark and scramble to look it up on their phones. Instead, the car itself, wired with artificial intelligence, plugged into sophisticated mapping technology and equipped with magic eyes, would instantaneously recognize, annotate and augment its surroundings. A mountain, desert or coastline could become an interactive infographic, peeling away the physical surface of the earth to reveal hidden layers of geology. A self-directed double-decker bus ambling through London could rearrange the city like a Lego set, refashioning streets and buildings to illuminate the capital’s rich history. Early television sets made the distant accessible; the self-driving car could reveal the invisible in the immediate. As exciting as such possibilities are, recent history suggests plenty of reasons to temper our optimism. When windows double as screens, we will have the opportunity to gaze at the world anew through richly animated portals. Alternatively — and perhaps more realistically — we could end up staring into larger versions of our phones, distracting ourselves with email, mindless games and the infinite bazaar of the internet. The potential of the autonomous vehicle is to help us interact with our environment in ways never before possible. The temptation is to turn ever more inward, exchanging the physical world for yet another simulation. Either way, self-driving cars with ubiquitous screens will inevitably bring all the familiar drawbacks of digital media onto the open road. Taxi TV in New York City is just a preview of the potential nightmare. What if the price for enchanted windows of the future is a nauseating kaleidoscope of advertisements, vapid movie reviews and contextless late-night jokes? Rather than learning about the hidden history of your surroundings, you may very well learn only about two-for-one cricket tacos in the food truck a lane over, homeowner’s insurance for the Anthropocene or the sale on microdrones at a nearby mall.

The Seizure of Commuting Time By Rahawa Haile One big question about the driverless car will be who gets to own our new wealth of free time. Will it remain with commuters — or will corporations expect them to tap into the office as their vehicles ferry them there? While the potential for hours of unplugged leisure exists, the way we currently fill our downtime leads me to believe that some form of digital immersion will take precedence, as bosses expect employees to work on their way to and from work. It wouldn’t be surprising to see the remaining minimum-wage positions in the rapidly automating food industry go to those who have access to driverless cars; use their cars for deliveries while they work, and you get two employees for the price of one. It’s tricky. On their surface, driverless cars will take some of the mess out of living, but they can also take the living where they don’t want to go, both psychologically and physically. Some car interiors might more closely resemble cubicles. Or cells. Will private employers surveil workers in order to control off-duty behavior? It’s also easy to conceive of a future where newly created infrastructure, explicitly dedicated to automated vehicles, will enable people with the means to own the cars to avoid the people without. We should be wary of any technology that allows those with power to distance themselves even further from society. Rahawa Haile is an Eritrean-American writer of short stories and essays.

Nonstop Teenage Party By Geoff Manaugh In a short essay published in 1970, the British architect David Greene suggested that his colleagues pay more attention to cars. “A traffic jam is a collection of rooms,” he explained, and “so is a car park — they are really instantly formed and constantly changing communities.” It was a memorable observation that nonetheless would surprise few teenagers, who long ago embraced the transformative notion that cars are not just rooms, but rooms they can control. Autonomous cars will once again transform teenage life. Anab Jain, a founder of the design studio Superflux, says the ritual requirements of teenage socializing will inspire “a new range of acts and services that help you obfuscate your car’s identity or your own data.” Instead of trying to roll back the odometer on the family car à la Ferris Bueller, teenagers hoping to roam the city, free from parental view, might trick it into recording destinations they didn’t really visit. “The whole notion of freedom will change,” Jain says, even as some of the destinations remain familiar. Dark streets or quiet state parks where GPS doesn’t reach would be the coolest sites of all. The question of when, exactly, the party has started will also become an intriguing one: After all, each car is a room unto itself. The Situationist International, a loose group of artists, political agitators and heavy drinkers who roamed the streets of Paris and other cities in the 1960s, treating them as arenas for detours and debauchery, offers some clues about how such rooms could be transformed. “I only ever hear self-driving cars talked about as a functional solution to the problem of getting from A to B,” says McKenzie Wark, the author of a history of the Situationists called “The Beach Beneath the Street.” (The title is a reference to the sand that was revealed when protesters picked up cobblestones from the Paris streets to throw at the police.) Wark imagines these machines rolling out of the factory with more radical settings hard-wired into their operating systems. “A hybrid of the self-driving car and, say, Grindr could bring a whole new meaning to the concept of cruising,” Wark suggests. “There should be a ‘scenic route’ setting, a ‘random’ setting, a ‘surprise me’ setting. Or maybe ‘mystery destination,’ which whisks you — and algorithmically chosen others — to an undisclosed location. Algorithmic chicken for teenage drivers, where you drive head-on toward another car — then magically swerve off at the last minute.” Unlike today’s cars, autonomous cars can also be made to swarm together, creating somewhat of a paradox: a moving traffic jam. Once the swarm is formed, proximity algorithms could mine social-media profiles to arrange like-minded clusters, while enabling “shuffle mode” might one day be the equivalent of texting a friend to rescue you from the boring guy in the corner. Aspiring D.J.s will rely on software to assemble self-driving cars into the ideal configuration for louder bass. Couples armed with GPS jammers — the future’s perfect Valentine’s Day gift — will quietly steer strangers away, creating a halo of romantic privacy around their makeout sessions. If all else fails, hit “skip” to be transported to an entirely new party. Hidden beneath the hormone haze of future block parties, new opportunities for cultural pranks and political protest will emerge. Rather than throw cobblestones, protesters could quickly jam the streets to show political solidarity or organize a strike. With the right programming skills, they might be able to shut down a whole city just by blocking a few crucial nodes. They could even open the streets back up to foot traffic, remaking them as a space for celebration. Then, of course, when it’s time to go home, all those dull factory presets, optimized for safety and efficiency, will finally come into their own — no designated driver necessary. Geoff Manaugh is the author of “A Burglar’s Guide to the City.”

Your Autonomous Dealer By Jamie Lauren Keiles Drug dealers tend to choose cars at the extremes — on the one hand a cocaine-white G-Wagen, on the other a ’98 Toyota Tercel. Each suggests a kind of shady guarantee that the self-driving car isn’t likely to sustain. Like most new stuff from Silicon Valley, the autonomous car is bound to be cute — a gumdrop whip fit for a Pixar protagonist. Hardly what you dream of when you’re trying to score. If drugs are still cool, they’ll have stayed that way in part because of their illicitness and the mild supply-line chaos that brute fact engenders: the inconsistent product, unreliable hookups and hours spent waiting for the dealer to arrive. Self-driving cars will succeed only by reducing and avoiding such chaos as much as possible. If these two industries are ever to play nice, then the success of one will come at the cost of the cool-guy reputation of the other. In the self-driving future, a weed transaction will begin the same as always — by texting your dealer in search of “tree,” or by casually asking if he wants to “hang out.” En route to another customer’s house, he will text back immediately, freed from the imposition of two hands on the wheel. Memories of waiting impatiently on a flaky dealer will recede as his car appears on your app, predicting arrival time down to the minute. Watch as his vehicle weaves around school zones, or is maybe flagged and pulled over by the police. The new possibilities for surveillance are endless. In any case, if he makes it to your house, it is likely that he will emerge from his self-driving pod in a sweatshirt for a company with a name like TōkTaxi or Gangl.ly or Lyft’d. As weed begins to trend toward legality, we’ve already seen such standing-desk branding start to creep into the stoner vernacular. A scan down PC Magazine’s “15 Blazing Hot Weed Tech Companies to Watch” reveals Tokken (a blockchain system for dealers), MassRoots (a stoner social network) and Eaze (the obligatory “Uber for weed”). In this new age of cannabis, the only thing that moves faster than the tech is the rate at which smoking itself becomes corny. But cringe-worthy orthography is not the only thing that this self-driven industry will inherit from Silicon Valley. In the age of semiautonomous cars, dealers will be forced to file 1099s, sharing their profits as lowly subcontractors. As in the time when dealers drove themselves, this fleet of buddies-for-hire will offer five to 10 minutes of humanity-affirming chitchat. Unlike preautonomous dealers, they will plead that you tweet their referral codes in order to receive a complimentary edible. This, of course, is one good reason to strive for fully autonomous drugmobiles. The driverless vehicle eliminates small talk, supplying your fix directly from the glove box with a personalized passcode, à la Amazon Locker. With no human body attached to the cargo, suppliers will seek to move harder drugs, in bigger quantities, potentially unleashing a new set of problems. The narc, a liability throughout all of human history, isn’t likely to go anywhere soon. Self-driving cars will scan for hazards in the street but will also pickup telltale signs of an informant: nervous twitches, too-enthusiastic slang. A customer might even be asked to answer a question like, “Are you a cop?” (Because, as all drug dealers know, a real cop has to say yes, even to an A.I.) It is likely that a database of narcs will be compiled, and inevitably, this database of narcs will be hacked. Millions of Americans will be exposed as poseurs — a social problem tragically immune to disruption. Jamie Lauren Keiles is a writer in New York.

Policing With No Tickets By Gareth Cook The temptation is the greatest on nights when the evening rush seems to congeal around the car, and she just wants to be home. She waits until she has left downtown (too many traffic towers), and then, with a few taps to a screen, she goes for it. Chinese software hacks come well recommended, and it’s soon clear why: The car picks up speed and begins to weave through the slower traffic — pleasingly aggressive but more sure in its lines, with less lurching, than the typical Russian black-market goods. She returns to her movie, but before long she hears a chime and a grating alert: “Traffic ticket assessed.” She spots a police car speeding past, a quad drone fixed to the roof, as her own vehicle reverts to its factory settings and rejoins the docile march of the lemmings. In the coming world of ubiquitous self-driving, it will just be you, the open road and the vast apparatus of the nanny state. Cars won’t readily violate traffic laws and may well be legally required to report on their owners. Ignore that burned-out headlight for too long, and the overnight software update may include a virtual boot. Traffic tickets bring in billions of dollars annually, so all those well-behaved cars will have an economic impact. Governments that have historically viewed traffic citations as an extractive industry (Ferguson, Mo., say, or the State of California) will have no choice but to find alternatives. Far more consequential, for both the police and their communities, will be the death of the routine traffic stop. The Supreme Court has ruled that law enforcement may stop any car, whatever its true motive, as long as an infraction is observed. Human drivers can’t get far without breaking the letter of the traffic law, so the pretexts come easy. If officers then spot a dozen laptops stacked on the back seat, they can ask questions. Yet this broad, virtually unchecked power to stop has led to charges of racial profiling. (A recent linguistic analysis of bodycam footage from Oakland, Calif., for example, concluded that officers spoke “with consistently less respect toward black versus white community members.”) With pretexts largely automated away, these kinds of interactions will be rare. “The self-driving car,” says Elizabeth Joh, a professor at the U.C. Davis School of Law, “will come to be seen as a civil rights issue.” The police will have lost an important investigative tool, but the government will have gained new surveillance possibilities. Cars will sweep up vast amounts of data about their surroundings and their occupants, including 24/7 GPS trails. (An important Fourth Amendment case being heard this fall, Carpenter v. United States, will decide whether the government needs a warrant to gain access to cellphone locational data, setting a precedent that could apply to cars.) Another potential target is the pedestrian. In the first part of the 20th century, manufacturers lobbied to make “jaywalking” a crime, so the new horseless carriages could cruise along urban streets relatively unimpeded. The pedestrians of the future, emboldened by the fact that self-driving cars are sure to stop, could cause havoc. No worries, though: Facial-recognition technology is coming along nicely, and the automotive industry will be, if anything, even more powerful. Look for today’s complaints about speeding tickets to be replaced by stories of “jaywalking traps” and pitiless fines for a second offense. Gareth Cook is a contributing writer for the magazine.

The Rise and Fall of Aquacars By Jennifer Kahn Looking back at the decades when the autonomous car was developed, you may find it hard to believe that its engineers imagined that it would stay landbound. All along, sea levels continued to rise, gradually overwhelming the sea walls that many coastal cities built as protection and flooding the (now absurdly named) ground floor of apartment and office buildings. Rather than simply abandon these buildings, though, many residents chose to stay — fueling a demand for autonomous aquacars and, as that technology improved, for mobile aquahomes. This became especially true after the successful completion of the SeaOrbiter, a floating laboratory originally designed for oceanography research. Elegant and semisubmersible, the SeaOrbiter acted as a kind of prototype for local offshore living — and the rise of aerial drone delivery, originally pioneered by Amazon, made the challenge of resupplying straightforward. Unfortunately, hackers quickly figured out how to hijack the aquahomes’ navigation system — first by disabling it and then with programs that directed vessels to floating “chop shops” run by roving gangs of ship-breakers. Piracy rates dropped only after huge kelp growth, driven by a mix of ocean warming and overfishing, rendered the submerged communities as unnavigable by aquacars as they had been by roadbound ones. Jennifer Kahn last wrote for the magazine about the YouTube series “Primitive Technology.”

The fires, combined with car exhaust, smokestack emissions and the burning of garbage, contribute to pollution levels that often hover in the “severe” category, the highest level designated by the Central Pollution Control Board.

An article last month in the medical journal The Lancet found that pollution was responsible for up to 2.5 million deaths in India in 2015, more than in any other country.

Julia Child’s time in France inspired her to capture the country through its cuisine, introducing French cooking to kitchens around the world. But it was that same French magic — and Ms. Child herself — that inspired her husband, Paul, to also capture the country, albeit through a different medium, photography. A new book lets him offer a personal glimpse into the world beyond the kitchen.

“There is this combination of intimacy and formal, rigorous design,” said Alex Prud’homme, the couple’s grandnephew and a co-author of “France Is a Feast: The Photographic Journey of Paul and Julia Child.”

The Childs met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, leading them to various postings around Europe. But it was Paris, where they arrived in 1948, that captured their hearts.

“Apart from our official lives — cooking and government — the other things we do fall into fairly repetitive categories whose two main divisions are, being entertained and entertaining others,” Mr. Child wrote to his twin brother, Charlie. “Sometimes when we’re being entertained it isn’t people, but just Paris herself who acts as hostess.”

While Ms. Child took French cooking classes, and eventually began work on “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck, Mr. Child was engaged in diplomatic duties as a cultural attaché for the United States government. And he was rarely without a camera.

The photographs, taken between 1948 and 1954, focus on the beauty of postwar France. The perfectly-landscaped parks, the bustling waterfront in Marseille, the glow of Place de la Concorde at night, a cold fog settling over the Sacré-Coeur basilica. The shadow play on the grand entryways and the underpasses along the Seine.

But Mr. Child’s main subject was always his wife. Ms. Child in the kitchen; changing her clothes on the side of the road; legs propped up in a telephone booth; sunbathing in Cassis.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

The detail and expansive catalog of Mr. Child’s work raise the question: Did he have a sense that their lives would have a bigger impact than their immediate Parisian universe?

“He was an obsessive photographer and note taker, it’s almost like he knew back then that their lives were worth preserving for posterity,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “It’s like they were leaving breadcrumbs.”

Mr. Prud’homme helped Ms. Child write her memoir, “My Life in France” (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006), but he felt it wasn’t complete. That’s when Katie Pratt, a longtime family friend of the Childs and the book’s co-author, discovered a “Pandora’s box” of hundreds of black and white and color photographs, everything from surrealistic street documentary to formal portraits and landscapes.

Negatives were clearly labeled. Log books and letters provided a time frame, and were often accompanied by long letters detailing their routine: embassy comings and goings during the Cold War, their meals, the price of wine or the performance they saw the evening before. Everything was for the taking.

Mr. Child had a “distinct style,” Ms. Pratt said.

“His style as a visual artist, whether it was photography or other mediums, it was very important for him to have strong, well-organized, well-balanced compositions, often with perspective and depth,” she said. “There’s often a story going on.”

Mr. Child’s style was heavily influenced by artists living in France at the time. And as a cultural attaché, he quickly gravitated to the top artists of the day: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Edward Steichen were all friends of his. They even shared the same printer, using Pictorial Service owned by Pierre Gassmann in Paris.

“My interpretation was that Paul was a very independent-minded guy who really developed his own aesthetic, but he was swimming in the waters of these masters of 20th-century photography,” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off. But he always remained behind the camera.

“Paul and Julia, in their own ways, were really good teachers,” Ms. Pratt said. “They really cared about not only perfecting their craft and communicating it clearly with others. They put it to operational proof and shared it with others.”

“That’s something they learned while in the O.S.S.,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “Don’t trust common wisdom, find out for yourself whether something works or doesn’t. That’s something they both did in their art, and cooking.”

But it’s really the seat of anticipation. The amygdala primes you to react — your pulse quickens, your muscles tense and your pupils dilate — even before other parts of your brain can figure out if you need to be scared or not. We are particularly sensitive to anything new, other people’s fearful facial expressions, or anything that resembles something that harmed us in the past.

It’s why you jump when you sense rustling in the bushes before realizing it’s just your neighbor’s cat. That reflex can save your life in certain circumstances such as leaping out of the way of an oncoming car. Trouble starts when you can’t tamp down your amygdala’s response, which makes you obsess and perhaps do counterproductive things when faced with concerning but not life-threatening events like the Equifax hack or a vulnerable social situation like asking someone out on a date.

Consciously activating the more measured, analytical part of your brain is the key to controlling runaway fear and anxiety.

But it’s not so easy in an era when social media and cable news make us aware of every actual or potential disaster occurring anywhere in the world (and in a repeating loop). It’s even more difficult if you have lots of stress or instability at home or work.

To your primitive mind, it’s as if there are lions and tigers lurking around every corner.

The result is often a juiced-up amygdala more apt to flip you into fight, flight or freeze mode in response to even the slightest concern, and keep you there, rather than return you to a state of calm in the absence of clear and present danger.

Remaining in this state of wary hypervigilance can contribute to issues like social anxiety, hypochondria, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia and all manner of phobias. It also plays a role in racial and religious intolerance because fearful people are more inclined to cling to the familiar and denigrate the unfamiliar. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, roughly 18 percent of the United States population is afflicted with persistent, outsized fear responses to seemingly ordinary stimuli.

Arresting an overactive amygdala requires first realizing and then admitting you’re feeling uneasy and scared.

“Our culture valorizes strength and power and showing fear is considered weakness,” said Leon Hoffman, co-director of the Pacella Research Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Society & Institute in Manhattan. “But you are actually stronger if you can acknowledge fear.”

That’s how it was for Sean Tucker, a pilot who for 40 years has performed heart-stopping aerobatic stunts at air shows despite an almost paralyzing fear of crashing.

“I never told anyone how scared I was when I started flying,” Mr. Tucker said. “But what I learned was that fear turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy and if you have the courage to admit it, you’ll be able to focus and prepare and rise above it.”

If you can sense and appreciate your fear — be it of flying, illness or social rejection — as merely your amygdala’s request for more information rather than a signal of impending doom, then you are on your way to calming down and engaging more conscious, logic-dominated parts of your brain. At that point, you can assess the rationality of your fear and take steps to deal with it.

“The more you try to suppress fear, either by ignoring it or doing something else to displace it, the more you will actually experience it,” said Kristy Dalrymple, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Alpert Medical School of Brown University.

Dr. Dalrymple is a proponent of acceptance and commitment therapy for managing fear, which has recently been gaining clinical validation. It encourages people not only to accept that they are feeling fearful and examine the causes but also to think about their values and how committing to overcoming their fears would be consistent with who they want to be. The approach forces higher-order thinking, which theoretically disables or diminishes the amygdala response.

The classical pianist Emanuel Ax, whose career demands that he perform in front of thousands of people, has long struggled with stage fright. He didn’t go to a psychotherapist, but it seems that the strategies of acceptance and commitment are how he manages his fear.

“I’m still scared, but I’ve learned to accept that I’m going to be nervous,” Mr. Ax said. “Aside from being what I love to do, playing the piano is my employment and gives people pleasure. I wouldn’t be doing my job if I gave in.”

Psychologists and neuroscientists are also finding that the amygdala is less apt to freak out if you are reminded that you are loved or could be loved. For example, seeing images of people with frightened expressions is usually a huge trigger for the amygdala, but that response is greatly diminished when subjects are first shown pictures of people being cared for or hugged.

“I can feel the love from the city every day I step on the floor,” Giannis Antetokounmpo said.

Veronica Antetokounmpo, meanwhile, has moved up a flight to be with her sons on the fifth floor in the wake of her husband’s death.","Visitors to Milwaukee, however, quickly discover that it’s no exaggeration to describe Antetokounmpo’s future as the least of the Bucks’ concerns in their bid to become a credible contender for the first time in nearly two decades. It also doesn’t hurt that, by virtue of his speedy ascension to All-N.B.A. status and contention for other top individual honors, Antetokounmpo is on a course to be eligible for a so-called “supermax” contract extension from the Bucks via the league’s new Designated Player Exception during the 2020 off-season, which would put him in line for a new deal well in excess of $200 million.

As he tweeted in July, to the presumed glee of every Milwaukeean, “I got loyalty inside my DNA.”

An Unexpected Loss

The connective tissue that links this star, team and city runs as dense as you’ll find on the N.B.A. map, perhaps surpassed only by Nowitzki’s two decades’ worth of roots in Dallas or maybe the deep bonds shared in San Antonio by Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. Milwaukee hasn’t simply been the backdrop for Antetokounmpo’s fairy tale rise to American stardom; it has been home for virtually his whole family for all but the first few months of his N.B.A. life.

Antetokounmpo admits, furthermore, that the unexpected death of his father just over a month ago has him leaning on his adopted hometown more than ever. Charles Antetokounmpo died of a heart attack on Sept. 29 at age 54.

“I can feel the love from the city every day I step on the floor,” Giannis Antetokounmpo said. “For me, what I’m going through now, I appreciate it even more.”

Charles and Veronica Antetokounmpo, who moved from Nigeria to Greece as undocumented immigrants in 1991 in search of a better life, secured the necessary paperwork to relocate to Milwaukee along with Giannis’s two younger brothers halfway through his rookie season. Kostas Antetokounmpo is a redshirt freshman at the University of Dayton now, but the rest of the family moved into a new downtown complex before this season, with Giannis and Alexandros Antetokounmpo (a high school sophomore) housed on the fifth floor and Charles and Veronica on the fourth.

After years of well-chronicled struggle for the family in a northern section of Athens known as Sepolia, they have found Milwaukee as idyllic as it was portrayed to be in the sitcom “Happy Days,” where not even the frigid winters can detract from the comfort they’ve experienced as a unit.

Only now, as they confront Charles’s death, even more responsibility has been heaped on the ever-widening shoulders of the Bucks’ phenom. Veronica Antetokounmpo, meanwhile, has moved up a flight to be with her sons on the fifth floor in the wake of her husband’s death.

“Leading your family is a lot tougher than basketball,” Antetokounmpo said. “Especially right now. But I’ve got to be strong for my family.

“Things,” he continued, “are going to get better.”

Places to Improve

The areas for on-court improvement are obvious for Antetokounmpo even as he stuffs box score after box score. His outside shot still needs copious amounts of work — he is not close to trusting it in times of need — and there is room for growth in reading the game at both ends, consistently making his teammates better and refining his decision-making.

Yet it’s also ridiculous, and rather cold, to nitpick what is missing from Antetokounmpo’s blossoming game given the level he is consistently hitting with that 7-foot-3 wingspan of his. Doubly so at a time of profound grief.

“He’s like a plane that just started taking off,” Kidd said. “He’s at 10,000 feet.”

When he arrived in Wisconsin, via the 15th overall pick in the 2013 N.B.A. draft, Antetokounmpo was measured at 6 feet 9 inches and weighed less than 200 pounds. A half-decade later, he is closing in on 240 pounds, and coaches and teammates routinely refer to him as a 7-footer.

The Milwaukee assistant coach Frank Johnson, noting Antetokounmpo’s bulked-up body and added strength, said, “He gets bumped now and he loves it.”

As for his perimeter game, Johnson preaches patience, pointing to the countless nights of extra shooting he is getting alongside the mentoring “Coach Sweeney” — the Bucks assistant coach Sean Sweeney. The way Johnson talks about the work-in-progress jumper is reminiscent of what league observers said for years about Shaquille O’Neal’s persistent free-throw woes.

“If he had that already,” Johnson said, “it wouldn’t be fair.”

Terry, the Bucks guard, said: “Of course he has to keep working on his outside game. But Giannis just has a peaceful confidence about himself. You can see it. Last year, he didn’t have that.”

The legendary Kobe Bryant, now in his second season of retirement, had seen enough coming into training camp to challenge Antetokounmpo via Twitter in late August to make a bid for the league’s Most Valuable Player Award.

Asked why he set such a high target, as part of his #MambaMentality campaign, Bryant said last week via email that he was moved by Antetokounmpo’s “rare physical gifts that are matched by a rare inner passion.”",The Unspeakable Greatness of Giannis Antetokounmpo,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/sports/basketball/giannis-milwaukee-bucks.html

And Finally...

Can you imagine local art and architecture made of cans?

Canstruction, an annual contest and exhibition of unusual shapes, statues and towers built from full cans of food, has returned to Brookfield Place in Lower Manhattan. The event, now in its 25th year, is intended to generate discussion on food access and raise awareness about hunger. The architects, engineers and design students who have created the life-size structures competed this week for titles like “Most Cans,” “Best Use of Labels” and “Structural Ingenuity.”

(The structure with the most cans had 7,250.)

Stop by this year and you may see a tree made of cans. Or perhaps a can-made pineapple, Pokémon or Pacman character — to name just a few.

Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com.

Looking at Trump’s Hiring Habits

On “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert highlighted recent reports that Mar-a-Lago, President Trump’s golf resort in Florida, received government permission to hire 70 immigrant workers. Mr. Trump has criticized companies that don’t “hire American.”

“Mar-a-Lago has been granted what’s known as H2B visas, and to get them, Mar-a-Lago ‘had to show that no one else wanted the jobs,’ including ‘calling old employees and putting ads in the newspaper.’ They also posted the job online with You’re Going to Be Working for a Monster.com.” — STEPHEN COLBERT “Obviously, the way the law is drawn up, they have incentive to make the jobs look bad to American workers. And they succeeded —because look at this actual listing in the Palm Beach Post that read, ‘3mos recent & verifiable exp in fine dining/country club… No tips,’ and instructed applicants to ‘Apply by fax.’ You might as well post, ‘Dead-end job, slave wages, must apply via telegram, high probability of meeting Donald Trump.’” — STEPHEN COLBERT

On “Late Night,” Seth Meyers pointed out some questionable hiring practices within Mr. Trump’s administration — specifically in the Department of Agriculture. The Trump ally Sam Clovis recently withdrew from consideration for the job of chief scientist within the department — a job Mr. Trump had nominated him for — after he was linked to the Russia election-meddling scandal. Mr. Clovis is not in fact a scientist.

“Clovis is one example of what seems to be a pattern in the type of people Trump nominates and hires: The only qualification necessary is loyalty to Trump himself. And nowhere is that perhaps more blatantly obvious than at the U.S.D.A. According to reports, the Trump team has brought into the agency ‘a long-haul truck driver, a clerk at AT&T, a gas-company meter reader, a country-club cabana attendant, a Republican National Committee intern and the owner of a scented-candle company.’ That doesn’t sound like the leadership of a government agency, it sounds like the cast of ‘Survivor.’ Or like you’re assembling a team for a [expletive] bank heist. ‘Murph, you’re on candles. You, read the gas meter!’” — SETH MEYERS

Jon Stewart Gives Conan O’Brien the ‘N.Y.C. Citizenship Test’

Conan O’Brien is filming his shows at the Apollo Theater in Harlem this week, and he’s trying to reclaim his former identity as a New Yorker. Jon Stewart showed up to keep him honest with a “citizenship test,” administered with some help from Andy Richter. Somehow, Mr. O’Brien passed with flying colors.

He turned the crowd against himself with this exchange:

JON STEWART: Where in New York City is the ball dropped every year?

CONAN O’BRIEN: Citi Field.

But won them back with this:

ANDY RICHTER: Name the very famous New York resident who won the 2016 presidential election.

CONAN O’BRIEN: Hillary Clinton.

ANDY RICHTER: Right.

The Punchiest Punchlines (Rand Paul Edition)

“That can’t be right. Rene Boucher attacked a U.S. senator over leaves? That would be like finding out that John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln because he was sitting in his seat. ‘President Shmesident — I’m 12H! Bam! Yeah. Oh wait, I’m 10H. Oh, sorry, my bad.’” — TREVOR NOAH, reacting to reports that Senator Rand Paul’s next-door neighbor assaulted him over a landscaping dispute “According to a CNN poll, President Trump’s approval rating has reached a new low of 36 percent. He’s so unpopular, pretty soon it’s just going to be ‘Fox & Friend.’” — SETH MEYERS

The Bits Worth Watching

Mr. Colbert imagined an address from a very offended Kim Jong-un, in which the North Korean leader wished Mr. Trump were visiting his country during his current tour of Asia.

Jimmy Kimmel heard that a new study suggests alcohol can help people speak foreign languages more easily. He wondered if marijuana might help, too.

The company’s evasiveness and secrecy extended to self-driving cars, a subject it was unwilling to discuss in any detail.","Twenty miles east of Reno, Nev., where packs of wild mustangs roam free through the parched landscape, Tesla Gigafactory 1 sprawls near Interstate 80. It is a destination for engineers from all over the world, to which any Reno hotel clerk can give you precise, can’t-miss-it directions. The Gigafactory, whose construction began in June 2014, is not only outrageously large but also on its way to becoming the biggest manufacturing plant on earth. Now 30 percent complete, its square footage already equals about 35 Costco stores, and a small city of construction workers, machinery and storage containers has sprung up around it. Perhaps the only thing as impressive as its size is its cloak of secrecy, which seems of a piece with Tesla’s increasing tendency toward stealth, opacity and even paranoia. When I visited in September, a guard at the gate gave militaristic instructions on where to go. Turning to my Lyft driver, he said severely: “When you complete the drop-off, you are not to get out of the car. Under any circumstances. Turn around and leave. Immediately.”

To hear its executives tell it, Tesla is misunderstood because it is still perceived as a car manufacturer, when its goals are more complex and far-reaching. But at least some people have bought into these grand ambitions. This summer, Tesla’s stock-market valuation at times rose above those of Ford and General Motors, and its worth exceeded $60 billion. It did not seem to matter to investors that the company had never made an annual profit, had missed its production targets repeatedly and had become enmeshed in controversy over its self-driving “autopilot” technologies, or that Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, had conceded that the value of his company, of which he owns about 22 percent, was “higher than we have the right to deserve.” Tesla was a headlong bet on the future, a huge wager on the idea of a better world. And its secretive Gigafactory was the arsenal for a full-fledged attack on the incumbent powers of the car and fossil-fuel industries. The factory would help validate Musk and his company’s seriousness about leading humanity’s turn to greener technologies, with a vision now encompassing solar roofing tiles and battery packs for home and industry. Most crucial, it involved producing millions of Tesla cars and trucks, all of which would be sleek, electric and self-driving.

If ambitions were all it took, Tesla would be crowned the colossus of the global car industry. But rapidly accelerating new technologies have brought uncertainty as well. Automakers are encountering three destabilizing forces all at once: automation, electrification and sharing. And sizing up which companies will be the winners and losers in their wakes is in no way obvious. In terms of self-driving cars, it seems likely that long-established companies — General Motors and Ford, as well as BMW and Audi — will benefit from their substantial reserves of cash and deep manufacturing experience. Because these automakers can invest deeply in research (and spend hundreds of millions of dollars to buy start-ups), they can remain competitive with companies less inherently cautious, like Tesla and Waymo, the spinoff of Google’s self-driving projects.

Tesla’s goal has always been focused on going green, rather than creating the driverless future. (Its mission is emblazoned on its factory walls: “To accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.”) Yet as the automobile industry settles on the consensus that self-driving cars are coming — their promise to improve safety and to help ride-sharing replace car ownership for many Americans propels their inevitability — Tesla finds itself in the midst of a contest to do both. This set of challenges should be enough for any company, especially one led by a chief executive whose time is compromised by other business commitments as a founder of a rocket company (SpaceX), a new tunneling operation (the Boring Company), a company planning a human-computer interface (Neuralink) and a nonprofit focused on the dangers of artificial intelligence (OpenAI). But Tesla has given itself a few others too. One is to essentially reinvent modern manufacturing processes at the Gigafactory. Yet another is to create the first mass-market electric car ever. In the meantime, a company that has never made much profit needs to somehow figure out how to do so — that is, to put itself in the black before financial losses and missed deadlines curdle any hope that Tesla inspires, among customers or stockholders, into skepticism.

Four hundred possible sites all over the western United States were winnowed down to this Nevada location. I hopped into a Chevy Suburban at the Gigafactory with several Tesla employees to take a look around. We drove through an expansive parking lot and up a steep hill so we could overlook the sprawling building and commotion below. The Gigafactory is often described, somewhat reductively, as a plant where Panasonic, a large tenant within the space, manufactures customized lithium-ion batteries that Tesla then installs in its products. Such an enormous plant allows for long production lines and economies of scale, which company engineers believe will help them lower significantly the price of the batteries, and thus the price of electric cars. The logic within Tesla is that only by “scaling up” — making billions of cheaper batteries for millions of cars — can it have an actual impact on our worsening pollution and increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Gigafactory had to be big, Musk noted at its opening in July 2016, “because the world is big.” But the plant’s utility is actually in the sum of countless small improvements. As one Tesla executive involved in its design told me, the goal here was not only to minimize the movement of materials like lithium and cobalt but also to shorten the path of every molecule that moves through the plant. “Because the further a molecule needs to travel,” he said, “the more cost gets added into it. We actually think of it in terms of molecular distance.”

Still, the Gigafactory is considerably more than a battery factory: It’s the physical embodiment of various technological breakthroughs the company — which just manufactured its 250,000th car — is trying to bring to its cars and energy-storage systems. Tesla makes motors here for its new Model 3 car, for instance, which are then trucked to its assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., 240 miles away. When we went inside, after a labyrinthine walk through offices and up and down stairways, we reached a rapidly moving automated factory line, where batteries were being installed into Powerwalls and Powerpacks — the residential and industrial units that store energy collected from solar panels (or any electrical generator). Later in the month, devices like these would make their way to Puerto Rico, where Tesla rebuilt the power infrastructure for a children’s hospital, and southern Australia, where the company is involved in a vast public project to shore up the country’s electrical grid. “We think of this building as a product, because it is a product,” my guide told me as we walked alongside a production line. Every machine had been scrutinized, every inch mapped out, every efficiency contemplated. Tesla had taken the highly unusual step of setting up a separate entity to take full control of the building’s design, engineering and construction, reflecting Tesla’s D.I.Y. ethos to achieve levels of vertical ownership and quality control that its executives believe are unreachable otherwise. The company had even concocted its own Tesla blend of coffee to serve near its cafeterias. “If we cannot get exactly what we want from the world,” one executive told me, “then we have to go do it ourselves.”

Tesla’s grand plans in many respects depend on how much innovation the company can bring to the process of battery making. If the Gigafactory succeeds in reducing costs — one battery-industry analyst, Sam Jaffe, the director at Cairn Energy Research Advisors, told me he thinks the company should be able to drive down the price of its cells by 30 percent — multiple dividends will accrue to Tesla. Cheaper batteries mean more than cheaper cars. They mean Tesla can put larger battery packs into cars for the same cost, increasing the vehicles’ range, power and appeal compared with the competition. At the same time, they could make its home energy-storage systems more efficient. Tesla could also gain an advantage in the race to produce autonomous vehicles, or A.V.s. The electric vehicles, or E.V.s, that Tesla wants to make autonomous have zero emissions. If self-driving cars go on rotation, say, in Uber and Lyft fleets, they could run 24-7, possibly leading to more cars on the road. “One of the concerns about automation is that it’s going to drastically increase the miles we drive,” Stephen Zoepf, the executive director at the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford, told me. “So if we expect as a society that we’re going to be driving a lot more, we obviously want to mitigate the environmental impact.”

At the Gigafactory, J.B. Straubel, a Tesla founder and the company’s chief technology officer, recounted the plant’s origin story. In 2012, he did a back-of-the-envelope calculation and realized that if Tesla were to sell something on the order of 500,000 cars a year, it would require the world’s entire output of lithium-ion batteries at the time. “We realized, holy crap, this means we need a huge factory,” he said, “because there was no way to do this just by putting in an order with some cell company and have them ship a few more.” His projections were not far off. When we met in September, orders for the Model 3, which began production in midyear and has been billed as the company’s first mass-market car, were around 455,000 through July, suggesting that the demand for E.V.s is far larger than any of the traditional automakers ever imagined. In the future, Straubel told me, Tesla plans to put up many more Gigafactories around the world, “ones that are actually quite a lot bigger than this one” — and it would construct those itself too. “This isn’t just a big building that’s full of equipment,” he added. “There’s this idea here of the machine that builds the machine, and it’s really true. This place is the embodiment of that.”

The impression he wanted me to have, I think, was that Tesla, once it gets this prodigious machine humming, will become robotically unstoppable at cranking out smaller machines, a great big clean-energy perpetual-motion device. At the same time, the company’s executives, from Straubel and Musk on down, were urging potential customers not to view each Tesla product in isolation but as parts of an ecosystem. The Tesla customer could soon use Tesla solar roof tiles during the day to charge up a Tesla Powerwall unit, filled with Gigafactory-made batteries — at night the Powerwall could in turn recharge the Tesla sedan. Perhaps the customer very much liked to drive? In that case, he or she might occasionally stop at one of the hundreds of Tesla “supercharger” stations in cities or along highways. Or maybe the owner didn’t like to drive at all and preferred to be driven automatically. Tesla would soon straddle our peculiar moment, the transitional era where humans begin to take their hands off their machines. “Every car made since October of last year,” Musk promised in early August, “is capable of full autonomy, we believe.”

The day after I toured the Gigafactory, I visited Tesla’s California headquarters in Palo Alto to see Doug Field, a top executive involved with the Model 3. Its price begins at $35,000, which gets you an average range of 220 miles on a full battery charge; a model with a larger battery pack (and a range of 310 miles) begins at $44,000. Even that price is a significant step down for the company, whose other cars’ most basic configurations start at about $70,000. I had driven from Reno to Palo Alto in a rented Tesla Model S valued at about $145,000; it was a four-hour trip, not including a 40-minute stop at a Tesla recharging station in Vacaville, Calif., and with the car’s neck-breaking acceleration it seemed the drive could have taken half that time but for speed limits. As the company’s flagship vehicle, the Model S is outfitted with several large LED screens but still has the feel of a conventional luxury car. The smaller Model 3 is a different machine altogether — spry and strikingly austere. One large touch-screen in the center of the dashboard essentially controls all the car’s driving and interior settings, while also monitoring the battery charge. When I arrived in early September, the first Model 3s had just come off the assembly line, and Field, a rangy engineer who spent a good part of his career at Apple, met me in front of the offices in a metallic blue model. He slid into the passenger side and invited me to take the wheel. “I’ll give you a quick orientation,” he said, “and then we’ll drive off.”

Field quickly showed me the controls. There weren’t many except for a few dials on the steering wheel. The screen to its right served as the car’s dashboard. “This looks forward to an era of autonomy,” Field explained, “but it’s also simpler and easier to manufacture.” That meant cheaper too, which was crucial: Tesla had concluded that every dollar saved on the cost of making the car would mean 100 more families could buy it in a year. As we drove through Palo Alto, the car was nimble and responsive, with the same kind of leaping acceleration that characterizes the Model S. But it took some time to get used to checking the screen to my right for my speed and autopilot settings. Field told me his team had concluded that it would be natural and intuitive for a younger generation. “It’s interesting when you put young people in the car,” he said. “This is the way all kids navigate technology.” It’s also possible that the kids might do more navigating, or giving the car orders, than driving. Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla’s design chief, later told me that in creating the car’s interior, he faced the question of making a car that was affordable and stylish but also relevant for a future era. There was vigorous debate within the company about what to do if the Model 3 became truly autonomous. As time went on, von Holzhausen’s group reasoned, this car would be driven less and would be driving more. Thus the decision to jettison dials and controls made sense, because the need for driver information would be reduced, and the central screen could mark routes and arrival times and double as an entertainment center. Those would be the essential tools. Or, as von Holzhausen put it, “The screen then became the hero of the vehicle.”

All of Tesla’s cars, including the Model 3, come with cameras and sensors; the sensors are small radar and ultrasonic devices situated around the car’s exterior that could enable it, presuming the right software is eventually developed, to become self-driving. Because each Tesla car maintains a cellular connection, over-the-air improvements dispensed by the company are a regular feature — tweaking acceleration or braking capabilities through uploaded instructions, for instance. Sometimes the extent to which the company can improve or alter its cars’ performance, even years after they left the factory, can be startling or unsettling, as was the case when Tesla temporarily extended the battery range for some drivers fleeing Hurricane Irma in Florida this summer. Self-driving, which Field assured me would ultimately come to pass with the right software and which Musk has repeatedly promoted to investors and customers, would allow Teslas to become something much more than they are. In the parlance of the Society of Automotive Engineers, which has quantified the capabilities a car must have to be considered self-driving, the vehicles will have nearly attained Level 5. This level denotes a safe and fully autonomous car that can operate in any place, and any conditions, without a driver.

At the moment, Teslas are at Level 2. Their cameras, sensors and software support a more modest capability known as “enhanced autopilot,” which costs an additional $5,000 in a new Model S or Model 3. In certain road and weather conditions, the cars can regulate speed and braking in traffic, steer automatically, change lanes and parallel park autonomously. By some industry rankings, these features now help make Teslas among the safest cars on the road. But following the deadly crash of a Model S driver who was using autopilot in Florida in May 2016, the company reconfigured what the cars permit. When I tried the automated steering on my Model S during the drive from Reno to Palo Alto, for instance, the car chimed frequently in distress and warned me through a dashboard notice when I took my hands off the wheel for a few seconds. I’d been informed that if this happened three times, the car would slow down, stop and rescind my autopilot privileges altogether. I didn’t push it. Clearly, the car — and Tesla, too — still needed its driver.

Whether the current fleet of Teslas can become A.V.s is not merely a technical question for the company; it may prove crucial as Tesla struggles to become a major automaker. In 2006, when Musk began to articulate his aspirations for Tesla publicly, he posted what he called his “Master Plan” on the company’s blog. He wrote that Tesla would transition from making an expensive electric sports car built in small numbers to making a luxury electric vehicle that expanded its manufacturing competence and market share before ultimately entering the electric mass market. The money from one project would be used to fund each successive project. And the larger idea was not to sell cool cars, or even fast cars, but to hasten the transition of automobiles from gas and diesel to electricity. Steve Jurvetson, an early venture investor in Tesla who now sits on its board, told me that there wasn’t much talk of a self-driving future at the start. “I don’t recall a discussion of autonomous vehicles and driving being part of the original pitch of Tesla,” he said. “It was a big-enough issue to prove that an electric drive train could be a success.” As he and Musk knew, there had not been a start-up American car company that had succeeded in nearly a century.

In the summer of 2016, Musk updated his vision for the company — “Master Plan, Part Deux.” In the decade since Part 1, the acceptance of electric vehicles had grown to the point where some traditional carmakers, in a surprising turn, were beginning to speak of an inevitable transition to an era when all models were battery-powered. Entire countries (like China) and enormous markets (like California) were also considering eventual bans on internal-combustion engines. As E.V. technology seemed ascendant, a variety of factors outside the auto industry were creating real potential for self-driving vehicles: great gains in computer-processing power, cheaper hardware sensors, better mobile connectivity, advances in artificial intelligence and enhanced mapping software. In his updated master plan, Musk stated that every Tesla would now have self-driving capabilities and that the application of “fleet learning” — a variation on machine learning — would help the company someday deliver a car that was 10 times safer in self-driving mode than when controlled by a human.

Musk also explained a new fundamental goal of the company. Tesla, he said, wanted to “enable your car to make money for you when you aren’t using it.” In other words, any new Tesla could in due time be part of a sharing network, able to taxi strangers around while its owner worked, slept or did whatever. Most Americans’ cars stay parked about 95 percent of the time. A Tesla would not. In the same way that Tesla’s electric drive train made the American car more efficient, the Tesla network would make the total utilization of the vehicle more efficient, too.

App-based sharing networks for cars already exist: These companies — Turo and Getaround, for instance — are different from, say, Zipcar, because they depend on peer-to-peer communications to arrange for rentals. In essence, they function like mobile Airbnbs, and in some cases have drawn the ire of users in the wake of driver crashes and insurance issues. A Tesla network would push this concept much further, involving perhaps hundreds of thousands or millions of cars, all of them already connected to the internet. Yet such a business network, one Tesla executive told me, most likely wouldn’t succeed unless Tesla’s cars were fully autonomous. Any concerns about insurance and lending a car to a risky driver would disappear, he argued, if autonomous driving proves to be much safer than manual driving. Just as important, autonomy makes irrelevant the problem of getting the car to where it’s needed next — it can be sent wherever it needs to go via mobile app. What’s crucial here is that the Tesla network, if it becomes functional, can defray the cost of an electric car like the Model 3, which is billed as Tesla’s affordable car but can easily surpass $50,000 with various options. If your car is making money for you when you’re not using it, it effectively becomes a tool that uses the virtues of A.V.s to promote the market adoption of E.V.s.

Over the course of several months, I often asked people at Tesla, as well as those working on autonomous technologies elsewhere, how far away the self-driving future might be. There was no solid consensus beyond somewhere between two and five years. I tended to believe that the timeline might extend much further and would depend on how tightly we regulate such vehicles and how we agree to define autonomy. Does it mean interstate driving on a sunny day? Or driving within a dedicated area on city streets? Is it a Level 5 overnight trip through heavy rain from Boston to Washington? A driverless taxi pickup on a crowded street under partial construction — orange cones, backhoes, chaos — as a nightclub lets out? Part of the debate concerns hardware and whether the collection of sensors that automotive engineers now build into their A.V.s can collect enough data to create a fully autonomous car. These sensors generally include radar, cameras and Lidar, the expensive laser-based technology that Tesla has so far declined to use. Many other A.V. researchers consider it essential. Lidar uses light waves, rather than radio waves, to map and “read” a car’s environs.

Musk has promised that before the end of this year, a Tesla vehicle will drive itself coast to coast completely on autopilot. A number of competitors — especially Waymo and General Motors — seem to be closing in on similarly ambitious goals. But it’s worth noting that no Level 5 car has ever been publicly deployed, and it’s doubtful one even exists; the coast-to-coast trip on autopilot, Musk suggested, wouldn’t yet be an instance where a driver could, say, go to sleep at the wheel. What’s more, no Level 4 car, where the vehicle is self-driving under certain weather and geographical conditions, has been put in regular service, either. In fact, while driver-assistance tools like autopilot can greatly reduce crash rates, no company or researcher has ever demonstrated that a robotic automobile can consistently operate in the everyday world more safely than a car with a human driver.

An executive close to Musk told me that his boss believes that creating a true A.V. is a “solvable” problem, one probably less difficult than others he has encountered in various business endeavors — for instance, creating cheap, reusable rockets for SpaceX, his other major company, or pushing Tesla’s Model S to such unlikely success. This may indeed prove true. But unlike other tech innovations, the development of driverless cars cannot count on something like Moore’s Law, which has projected a doubling of computing power at regular intervals and has allowed Silicon Valley entrepreneurs a clear window into the future. Based on conversations with engineers on the A.V. front lines, the most difficult problem is rigging cars with sensors and software that can take a rich, clear, picture of every element in the surrounding environment — people, bikes, signs, obstacles — and then algorithmically choreograph the future.

This challenge is as arduous for Tesla as it is for engineers everywhere working to solve it. And yet the exigencies of Tesla’s business model add an additional layer of complexity. To reach its sustainability goals and become profitable, the company must make lots of cars that are electric and sporty and increasingly affordable; meanwhile, to prepare for the future, Tesla has to build cars that eventually won’t need us. Some of the most experienced researchers working on A.V.s believe that these are two separate and possibly irreconcilable ambitions and that it makes more sense to focus on a pure driverless car, even if it proves to be a very expensive proposition at first, rather than follow Tesla’s incrementalist policy, which would involve rolling out software on a regular basis until the driver does less and less and finally nothing at all. With the second approach, one Silicon Valley engineer said, “the market pressures that are going to be applied to those technologies mean that you’re not going to climb up the safety and reliability curve” to build a true A.V. Keeping the vehicle affordable is in constant tension with making the vehicle autonomous. Musk’s optimism alone can’t change that.

The first company to succeed at A.V. technology won’t necessarily capture the market in a way that, say, Facebook did with social media. Tesla might have time to make its current strategy work, and it could be that what matters more in the near term are the company’s advantages in batteries and electric vehicles (assuming it can manage the transition to mass-market production). Jurvetson, the early Tesla investor, told me that he thought the company with the best artificial-intelligence systems would come to dominate the auto business of the future. But he did not put a time frame on it, and he did not see it as a winner-take-all prospect. Vivek Wadhwa, a prominent tech entrepreneur and Tesla enthusiast, told me that he sees Tesla’s success prefigured in the smartphone market. “After five years, Tesla will become the Apple in the industry,” he predicted, based on the fact that it is best positioned to capitalize on the potential combination of E.V. and A.V. technologies. But Wadhwa pointed out that phones running on Google’s operating system, rather than Apple’s, are the ones that dominate the world. “Musk will be exactly where Tim Cook will be,” he said. “Tesla will be the iPhone of cars — more elegant, better designed. Maybe even safer.”

Musk declined my interview requests over the course of several months. By early November, the number of Model 3 cars coming out of the factory had fallen far short of what Musk had promised, the company’s stock price had taken a nose-dive and there appeared to be serious software and robotic glitches at the Gigafactory. Musk was said to be too busy to talk, which did not always square with his social-media postings: jokes, poems, photos of tunnels he was digging, links to stories about the dangers of artificial intelligence and, in one instance, footage of a camping excursion on the roof of the Gigafactory.

The company’s evasiveness and secrecy extended to self-driving cars, a subject it was unwilling to discuss in any detail. One Tesla engineer I spoke with, who works on autopilot systems, maintained that the company’s camera and sensory hardware will prove good enough to get his team where it wants to go, which as a near-term goal means cars with a self-driving capability that is twice as good as a human driver (rather than 10 times as good, per the second master plan). By November, Musk was telling investors that the actual goal was to get the system simply on a par with a human driver and that that might require a more powerful computer in the cars, which Tesla would swap in free if necessary. Some customers have already paid $3,000 for a Tesla “self-driving” package (on top of the $5,000 for “enhanced autopilot”), based on Musk’s assurances that the new cars have all the hardware necessary and will be autonomous once regulations and functional software are worked out.

There’s no clear indication of whether these efforts are on track, and in the past year, several engineers who ran Tesla’s autopilot unit have left the company. In early October, Scott Miller, an executive involved with General Motors’ self-driving efforts, charged publicly that Musk was “full of crap” for claiming that his cars could offer self-driving capabilities with their current hardware. His assertions echo those of some other Tesla critics I spoke with: Without Lidar, or a more expensive hardware approach, Musk’s cars may be at a significant disadvantage. Indeed, several people familiar with the company’s A.V. work viewed its self-driving approach as a perilous one, given that there is no definitive way to predict how long it could take Tesla to satisfy the promises made to customers. In the best case, if A.I. and software breakthroughs ultimately transform cars like the Model 3 into self-driving vehicles, Musk will have pulled off something that perhaps seems impossible today. In the worst case, hundreds of thousands of owners will have cars that won’t achieve the status of true A.V.s and can only hope that the sharing network of the master plan will someday become a reality.

Tesla’s setbacks, Musk noted in November, shouldn’t eclipse the fact that the company has already grown faster by some measures than Ford when it rolled out the Model T in the early 1900s. He takes a longer view of his business than Wall Street analysts. In a recent TED interview, while discussing his plans for cities on Mars, he argued that it’s a mistake to assume that technology gets better as time goes on. “It does not automatically improve,” he insisted. “It only improves if a lot of people work very hard to make it better, and actually it will, I think, by itself degrade.” He cited the Egyptian pyramids and Roman aqueducts and how the knowledge to build them was lost for hundreds, or even thousands, of years afterward. The relevance is striking in a time when the federal government would rather subsidize the growth of the coal and fossil-fuel industries than renewable energy and electric cars.

Long before anyone saw Tesla as a legitimate player in the auto industry, Musk also appears to have understood that in taking chances that no established carmaker would, Tesla could be an innovative force to quicken our slow, plodding progress in transportation. Imagine Tesla didn’t exist, Steve Jurvetson told me. “What would the world look like? I have this sinking suspicion it wouldn’t look that different than 10 years ago. A bunch of hybrid cars. A bunch of noise about hydrogen vehicles. You know, I don’t think the world would look anything like today — where entire nations are saying, ‘We’re going to stop making gas cars.’ ”

The company’s impact, real and potential, is all the more surprising considering that Musk has staked Tesla’s success on the industrial equivalent of a shoestring, lacking the resources of established carmakers. He has used customer revenue, his own wealth, venture capital, bank and government loans, investments by other automakers and the American stock and debt markets to effectively fund a multibillion-dollar research-and-development project. In that way, he has led the industry to the start of a new era. And now his company, hindered by debilitating manufacturing bottlenecks and its extravagant promises of self-driving, is poised to find out whether, in laying the groundwork for an electric and autonomous future, he took one risk too many.",Tesla’s Dangerous Sprint Into the Future,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/07/magazine/tech-design-future-autonomous-cars-factory-tesla-sustainability-gigafactory.html

That result was no surprise to Mark Scheffler, the director of news for The New York Times’s video unit, which worked to uncover what really happened in Khan Sheikhoun. “You had the Russians and the Syrians telling a story about what happened in this location,” he said. “And the reporting, the work that the team did on that, really debunked it.”

After the attack, two of Mr. Scheffler’s team members, the senior story producer Malachy Browne and the video editor Natalie Reneau, pieced together satellite imagery, photographs and videos of the attack, drone footage and more into a seven-minute video examining the strike.

Amid all the work and publicity, Mr. Johnson is raising money for InGrained Hospitality Concepts, a group of new restaurants that he is planning, with a focus on rice and other grains. Mr. Johnson developed a passion for rice as he traveled the world and studied the African diaspora under the wing of Mr. Smalls. His parents also recalled his helping his grandmother clean rice as a boy.

On his Chefs Club menu, rice makes more than one appearance, and rises to a star attraction in the form of “con’con,” a dish of jollof sticky rice about the size of a moon pie, sweetened with coconut and topped with an eggplant curry and basil. It exudes comfort and grandeur at once.

He is cooking the food he wants, a right that he said was slipping away at the Cecil, which has recently rebranded itself as a steakhouse, with a new chef and a new menu. Gone are the collard green salad and the gumbo with Chinese chicken sausage, replaced by more-traditional fare like fried calamari, garlic spinach and steaks.

How and why the Cecil went from a restaurant that aimed for uncharted tastes to one banking on mainstream crowd-pleasers is a matter of dispute among Mr. Johnson, Mr. Smalls and Richard D. Parsons, an owner of the Cecil and a former chief executive of Time Warner.

Mr. Parsons said diners from outside Harlem were reluctant to trek during the week to the restaurant, at the corner of St. Nicholas Avenue and West 118th Street. And the menu was “too exotic,” he added, for the Cecil to become a weeknight habit for neighborhood residents.

“You’re not actually looking for a cinnamon-dusted guinea fried hen with piri-piri rice on the side,” he said.

Mr. Smalls, who remains an owner but had no hand in the new steakhouse menu, disagreed, blaming poor management and a business plan that he said failed to adequately adjust when a planned lunchtime seating never materialized.

Photo

The Cecil is also tethered financially to Minton’s, a sibling restaurant next door that never found its niche as Harlem’s version of the Rainbow Room, as Mr. Smalls and Mr. Parsons had envisioned. “The Cecil was the workhorse in the brother-sister relationship,” Mr. Smalls said.

As the owners tinkered to find the right formula, the restaurants closed, then reopened. Caught in the middle was Mr. Johnson, who started out as chef de cuisine of the Cecil and ended up as executive chef of both restaurants. The job, though, came with little autonomy.

Photo

Mr. Johnson, 33, said he needed to lay a foundation for himself; his wife, Samiyyah Chapman; and their 3-month-old twins. He told his bosses he wanted a bigger role and more restaurants.

“When they said to me they really didn’t want to do anything else, I had to go look in the mirror and say, ‘Would I be content here working for the next 10 years?’” he said. “At that point, I don’t mean to sound cocky, but I’m just better than that.” He resigned in June.

All three men remain on good terms. In an interview, Mr. Parsons called Mr. Johnson “the illustrious JJ” with admiration. Together, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Smalls have written a 375-page cookbook, “Between Harlem and Heaven: Afro-Asian-American Cooking for Big Nights, Weeknights, and Every Day,” to be published in early February. (Veronica Chambers, who co-wrote the memoirs of the chefs Marcus Samuelsson and Eric Ripert, also collaborated on the cookbook.)

Mr. Johnson has forged ahead alone in other ventures. He was trying to persuade Stephane De Baets, a founder and the president of Chefs Club, to invest in Ingrained Hospitality when another idea came to Mr. De Baets. “Why don’t you come do a pop-up to show me first your cuisine?” Mr. De Baets recalled asking him.

In August, Mr. Johnson previewed dishes at Chefs Club Counter, a new fast-casual sister of Chefs Club. “Within half a day, all tickets were sold,” said Mr. De Baets, who is considering an investment in Mr. Johnson’s restaurant group.

That success led to the longer stay at Chefs Club, a cavernous space with an open kitchen where diners can watch the chefs in action.

Mr. Johnson has filled the menu with brightly colored dishes and flavors, seen most obviously in a shared plate of cornmeal-crusted sea bass, seasoned with turmeric, that takes up an entire bowl and leaves just enough room for purple sweet potatoes, roasted carrots, papaya and long beans.

A few dishes, like udon noodles with braised goat, and piri-piri prawns, have followed Mr. Johnson to Chefs Club from the Cecil. His favorite dessert is a rice milk pop of raspberry and hibiscus with crispy puffed rice drizzled on top.

Photo

At Chefs Club, Mr. Johnson also did something he could never do at the Cecil: He put his name on it, placing the neon letters “JJ” in the window. He also required the restaurant to play his days-long soundtrack, which he commissioned a D.J. to compile. On a recent night, several diners bobbed their heads and swayed in their seats.

Music plays as much of a role in dining as food, Mr. Johnson said, recalling how his Puerto Rican grandmother played salsa while she prepared sofrito and plantain dumplings, and how his black American grandmother, raised in the Rocky Mountains, played Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Earth Wind & Fire as she made cherry pies and traditional Southern food.

His taste runs to ‘90s neo-soul and hip-hop. “That’s part of the diaspora,” he said. “That’s when I feel like black artists were having the best times in their careers. They were able to really put their music out. Like Biggie, Tupac, Wu-Tang, Mariah, Erykah Badu, they were talking about real stuff that was happening in our lives.”

For $360, a diner can have everything on the menu in a tasting that Mr. Johnson calls “It Was All a Dream,” a nod to The Notorious B.I.G.’s “Juicy.”

“This is a dream for me,” he said. “I get to the cook the food of who I am and listen to the music that I want to listen to.”

Photo

Mr. Johnson said he also wants to create jobs and hire people who look like him. His give-back attitude appears to come from his parents, Marcela Johnson, a retired teacher, and Joe Johnson, a bookkeeper who still runs a youth basketball program in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, where they raised their son and his younger sister. The family traveled on vacation to Barbados, Puerto Rico, Jamaica and North Carolina — trips that, in reflection, helped him see the African diaspora firsthand.

Though Mr. Johnson excelled in a variety of sports, including skiing, basketball and soccer, he wanted to be a chef. His mother insisted that, despite the expense, he study at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y. After graduating, he worked in New York at Tribeca Grill and the Smith, then as a personal chef and later in an executive dining room at Morgan Stanley.

In 2011, as a contestant on “Rocco’s Dinner Party,” a Bravo reality TV show hosted by the chef Rocco DiSpirito, Mr. Johnson wooed the judges with a dish of smothered shrimp and grits.

The meal caught the eye of Mr. Smalls, a South Carolina native, who said Mr. Johnson reminded him of his father, who would prepare the same Lowcountry dish for special occasions. Mr. Smalls reached out to Mr. Johnson, and they developed a teacher-apprentice relationship. Mr. Johnson accompanied Mr. Smalls on educational trip to Ghana, and that led to the job at the Cecil.

Mr. Johnson is now likely on his way to achieving a fame that has eluded Mr. Smalls, who recalled an exchange with Josh Ozersky, the food critic who picked the Cecil as Esquire magazine’s best new restaurant in America in 2014.

Saying the food was amazing, Mr. Ozersky told Mr. Smalls, “It’s a shame you won’t get credit for it.”

Mr. Smalls remembered pushing back. “It’s not important that I’m the person that’s cooking the food and most remembered for it. It’s important that it’s remembered,” he said. “If I did something right in selecting a protégé who is going to make that a platform, then I ain’t mad.”

Stead, whose tonally adroit knack for comedic dialog recalls Charles Schulz’s, lets readers eavesdrop on snippets of the onboard conversation. When sweet, uncomplicated Sherman asks what’s next for the goldfish—not if but when they succeed in finding him—Sadie responds by waxing eloquent on the proper care and feeding of those we love. She ends with a few choice words about Little Amy Scott, the cause of all their troubles, and let’s just say: no happy-birthday wishes for her.

“The Antlered Ship” aims for a dreamier, artier style of sea-faring fantasy. It features a splendid age-of-sail tall ship sporting an impressive antler-themed prow, and a surreal all-animal crew captained by a doe named Sylvia. In port, other creatures sign on as crewmembers, including some venturesome pigeons and a philosopher fox named Marco who is seeking answers to life’s big questions, or rather to pretty big ones like, “Why don’t trees ever talk?” and “Why is water so wet?” Oh dear—or perhaps, oh deer! As the ship and narrative drift in tandem, readers can only pray that Marco will not redirect his musings to more mundane matters, such as the odds of enjoying a pigeon repast.

More down to earth is “Robinson,” a dream adventure propelled by a schoolchild’s decision to attend a costume party dressed as his favorite storybook hero, Robinson Crusoe. Things go badly wrong when young Peter’s schoolmates mercilessly mock the elaborate faux-fur costume his mother prepared for him. Surely it would have been better to go in standard-issue pirate gear, as Peter knew the others were all planning to do. Or not: with a gentle nudge from his mother, he opted instead to make a more personal statement, and is repaid for his efforts with a jolt of group rejection that leaves him feeling as alone as any shipwrecked traveler on a desert island.

Photo

What began as a parent’s well-meaning intervention in her child’s social affairs morphs for Peter into a developmental flash point. Turning feverish, the shaken boy escapes into a dream that in some respects mimics Crusoe’s island exile (although happily not the part about Friday!). In this dream, Peter forages for food, makes his own clothing and shelter, and keeps an eye out for pesky pirates. Readers can see that on awakening Peter is more his own person than before, and is ready to re-connect on his own terms with school chums who, as children do, have also moved on and are keen for his company.

Peter Sís, who grew up in Soviet-Bloc Czechoslovakia and has lived in the United States since 1982, has made a specialty of chronicling the lives of maverick outsiders from Galileo to Darwin. He first told bits and pieces of his own coming-of-age story in “The Wall,” but the autobiographical “Robinson” is a more intimate, child’s-eye view of a schoolboy’s struggles to navigate the treacherous crosscurrents of self and society. It is hard not to feel for this child.

In his illustrations for “Robinson,” Sís reprises long-time favorite graphic maneuvers—arresting bird’s eye perspectives, imaginary landscapes that double as maps of themselves—while also showing a new interest in color that mirrors the story’s heightened emotional urgency. Growing up, these evocative images imply, can feel a lot like being lost at sea, but the imagination is a good map to steer by.

“I wish him nothing but the best success,” Mr. Gillespie said.
A native of Virginia’s rural Eastern Shore, Mr. Northam, 58, was perhaps an unlikely vessel for the resistance-era Democratic Party.
In his concession speech, Mr. Gillespie made no mention of Mr. Trump, and declined to answer questions about the president’s criticism on Tuesday night.
But Virginia Democrats were in little mood to offer any olive branches to Mr. Trump on Tuesday.","“Virginia has told us to end the divisiveness, that we will not condone hatred and bigotry — and to end the politics that have torn this country apart,” he said, adding that in this state, “It’s going to take a doctor to heal our differences.”

The Democrats’ electoral validation, though, took place well beyond the Virginia governor’s race: They wrested the governorship of New Jersey away from Republicans, swept two other statewide offices in Virginia, made gains in the Virginia State Legislature, and won a contested mayoral race in New Hampshire.

In New Jersey, Philip D. Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive, won the governorship, according to The Associated Press, by a vast margin that brought an unceremonious end to Gov. Chris Christie’s tumultuous tenure.

In both Virginia and New Jersey, voters rebuffed a wave of provocative ads linking immigration and crime, hinting at the limitations of hard-edge tactics in the sort of affluent and heavily suburban states that are pivotal in next year’s midterm elections.

Even though Republicans in the two states mirrored Mr. Trump’s grievance-oriented politics, they kept him at arm’s length: He became the first president not to appear on behalf of candidates for governor in either state since 2001, when George W. Bush shunned the trail after the Sept. 11 attacks.

Since then, four of the five governors Virginia has elected have been Democrats. The party was also in contention late Tuesday to seize control of the state House of Delegates, an unexpected show of strength that, along with Mr. Northam’s victory, offered Democrats a stronger hand to block any Republican attempts at gerrymandering after the next census.

Representative Scott Taylor, a Republican from Virginia Beach, said he considered the Democratic sweep in Virginia a repudiation of the White House. He faulted Mr. Trump’s “divisive rhetoric” for propelling the party to defeat, and said he believed traditionally Republican-leaning voters contributed to Mr. Northam’s margin of victory.

“I do believe that this is a referendum on this administration,” Mr. Taylor said of the elections. “Democrats turned out tonight, but I’m pretty sure there were some Republicans who spoke loudly and clearly tonight as well.”

Channeling the shock of Republicans across the state, Mr. Taylor voiced disbelief at the party’s rout down ballot. “I know folks that lost tonight who were going against candidates I’d never even heard of,” he said.

Mr. Trump was quick to fault Mr. Gillespie for keeping his distance, writing on Twitter while traveling in South Korea that the Republican candidate “did not embrace me or what I stand for.”

Mr. Gillespie made no mention of Mr. Trump in his concession speech, and alluded only in passing to the explosive themes he wielded as a candidate. Ticking off issues he campaigned on, Mr. Gillespie noted his supporters were worried about “safety for themselves and their families and their businesses.”

Addressing supporters in a hotel ballroom, Mr. Gillespie tried to tack a courteous finale on to a rough-and-tumble race, offering his assistance to Mr. Northam going forward. “I wish him nothing but the best success,” Mr. Gillespie said.

Mr. Northam’s victory was a tonic to an anxious national party that has been reeling since Mr. Trump’s win last year and was demoralized by losses in special House elections in Montana and Georgia.

A native of Virginia’s rural Eastern Shore, Mr. Northam, 58, was perhaps an unlikely vessel for the resistance-era Democratic Party. But the left overlooked the two votes he cast for George W. Bush before he entered politics, and his résumé — he is a pediatric neurologist and Gulf War veteran — proved far more appealing to the state’s broad middle than Mr. Gillespie’s background as a corporate lobbyist.

The Democrats’ success here came as Mr. Gillespie, trailing in the polls, turned to a scorched-earth campaign against Mr. Northam in the race’s final weeks. Mr. Gillespie, a fixture of his party’s establishment who had once warned against the “siren song” of anti-immigrant politics, unleashed a multimillion-dollar onslaught linking his rival to a gang with Central American ties and a convicted pedophile who had his rights restored, while also assailing Mr. Northam for wanting to remove Virginia’s Confederate statues.

The strategy appeared to help Mr. Gillespie narrow the gap in the wake of the Charlottesville protests this summer, but it was not enough to overcome the anti-Trump energy in an increasingly diverse state that has not elected a Republican to statewide office since 2009.

Mr. Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman, found it difficult to balance appeals to the president’s unflagging supporters in rural Virginia while simultaneously attempting to win over Mr. Trump’s skeptics in the state’s population centers. He often would not say the president’s name, referring instead to “the administration” or last year’s Republican “ticket.”

In his concession speech, Mr. Gillespie made no mention of Mr. Trump, and declined to answer questions about the president’s criticism on Tuesday night.

Mr. Northam did not have to concern himself with any such political contortions running in a state that has backed the Democratic nominee for president in the last three elections, a striking reversal from an earlier day here when Virginia Democrats had to distinguish themselves from their more liberal national party.

Indeed, support for Mr. Northam represented a vote for continuity. Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat barred by state law from seeking re-election, is broadly popular, as are the state’s two Democratic senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner. Mr. McAuliffe, who was elected in 2013 during President Barack Obama’s second term, was the first person in 40 years to win a Virginia governor’s race who was in the same party as the president’s.

In New Jersey, the Democratic ticket established a decisive advantage early in the campaign season, and that lead never flagged. Mr. Murphy, a wealthy Democratic donor who served as ambassador to Germany under Mr. Obama, ran on a message of rejecting both Mr. Trump and Mr. Christie, who is a politically toxic figure in the state.

National Republicans virtually ignored the race, viewing their nominee, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, as doomed by a deeply hostile political environment and her association with Mr. Christie. In Utah’s Third Congressional District, John Curtis, the Republican nominee, emerged as the winner Tuesday night, according to The Associated Press.

After blanketing Virginia’s airwaves before the primary with an ad in which he savaged the president as “a narcissistic maniac,” Mr. Northam struck a more sober-minded tone during the general election with another widely aired commercial in which he vowed to “work with” Mr. Trump when it is in the state’s interest.

But Virginia Democrats were in little mood to offer any olive branches to Mr. Trump on Tuesday.

Mr. Kaine, who a year ago was left achingly short of becoming vice president, was especially triumphant in speaking to supporters.

“Trump-style division, pitting people against people, it is not the Virginia Way and it is not the American Way,” he said.","With Virginia, Voters Give Democrats First Big Wins of the Trump Era",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/us/politics/virginia-election-democrats.html

“You wouldn’t know what Roy did because Roy wouldn’t tell you what he did,” Nocco said.","The news of Halladay’s death was quickly followed by expressions of grief on social media.

“We are numb over the very tragic news about Roy Halladay’s untimely death,” the Phillies said in a statement posted to Twitter. “There are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game.”

A two-time Cy Young Award winner and an eight-time All-Star, Halladay was a 6-foot-6 right-hander known for his durability and command.

After 12 major league seasons with the Blue Jays, who drafted him in 1995, he was traded to the Phillies in December 2009. Halladay made 2010 a definitive year in his career. He threw the 20th perfect game in major league history during the regular season, and in a division playoff series against Cincinnati, he threw the second no-hitter in postseason history.

After the postseason no-hitter, Dusty Baker, the Reds’ manager at the time and a fixture in the sport going back to the late 1960s, said, “That is the best-pitched game I’ve seen since I’ve been going to the playoffs and the World Series.”

One of the strongest messages of condolence on social media came from Pedro Martinez, the three-time Cy Young Award winner whose prime coincided with Halladay’s.

Halladay’s career was cut short by back trouble, however. He became a much weaker pitcher in the 2012 and 2013 seasons, and he retired at 36, signing a one-day contract with Toronto to leave the game as a Blue Jay.

Based on his retirement date, Halladay will not be considered for election to baseball’s Hall of Fame until 2019, but he will have a strong case because of his dominance in his strongest seasons. His career record of 203-105 and his 2,117 career strikeouts are not eye-popping numbers, but using the JAWS system, an evaluation tool that accounts for a player’s peak seasons as well as his overall career, Halladay is ranked as baseball’s 42nd-best starting pitcher. Only nine players ahead of him are not yet in the Hall of Fame, while more than 30 pitchers below him on the list are already enshrined in Cooperstown. His postseason success and his popularity with the news media also bolster his case.

Shortly after he retired, Halladay discussed how odd it felt not to play baseball.

“I find myself kind of sitting around the house thinking, ‘There’s something missing here — I should be working out, I should be running, I should be doing something,’” Halladay said. “For a second, it’s kind of a little bit of panic, and then it kind of sets in: ‘O.K., that’s right. I’m retiring now.’ It’s actually a very peaceful feeling.”

He eventually turned to flying as an outlet, and in October he posted pictures of the plane he had recently purchased.

Halladay, whose father was a pilot, knew the risks that flying presented. He joked about his wife’s opposition to his purchasing the plane in a video that had been posted to YouTube by ICON but that was removed shortly after the crash.

“She’s fought me the whole way,” Halladay said of his wife, Brandy.

“Hard,” Brandy Halladay said in the video. “I fought hard, I was very against it.” She conceded after flying in the plane, though, that she understood the appeal.

Piloting small planes has long been popular among athletes, and Major League Baseball has lost other athletes to similar crashes. Thurman Munson, an All-Star catcher and the 10th captain of the Yankees, died after crashing a Cessna Citation in 1979. And Cory Lidle, a former teammate of Halladay’s on the 2003 Blue Jays, died in 2006 when a Cirrus SR20 he was flying with a co-pilot crashed into an apartment building on Manhattan’s Upper East Side.

The fact that the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office led Tuesday’s recovery effort carried extra emotion because of Halladay’s personal relationship with the department, which included the donation of a police dog that the department named Doc, in reference to Halladay’s nickname.

“You wouldn’t know what Roy did because Roy wouldn’t tell you what he did,” Nocco said. “And that’s the legacy of a great man.”

Trump, in China, Seeks Help Over a Nuclear North Korea Video Since his election, President Trump has gone from hammering China on trade policy to praising President Xi Jinping for his country’s response to North Korea.

BEIJING — President Trump arrived in China on Wednesday, primed to ask his host, President Xi Jinping, to step up Chinese pressure on North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. But Mr. Trump’s latest foray into personal diplomacy may end in frustration, as the Communist strongman he calls his friend either cannot, or does not want to, do the job.

Mr. Trump, a senior administration official said, plans to call on the Chinese leader to cut off oil exports to North Korea, at least temporarily; to close down North Korean bank accounts in China; and to send home tens of thousands of North Koreans who work in China.

While Mr. Xi may move incrementally in Mr. Trump’s direction, experts said he was unlikely to fundamentally alter China’s dynamic with North Korea, a onetime client state with whom its relations have steadily soured during the reign of Kim Jong-un.

“There are big differences in the way of thinking between the United States and China on North Korea,” said Yang Xiyu, a former Chinese Foreign Ministry negotiator on North Korea. “Trump thinks of North Korea too simplistically — that if China cuts off the oil, the nuclear issue will be solved.”

Mr. Trump’s visit is the stiffest test yet of an audacious, but characteristic, bet: that if he cultivates Mr. Xi and offers him concessions, like delaying punitive trade moves, he can persuade the Chinese leader to move against the North in a way that none of his predecessors have.

Speaking in South Korea earlier Wednesday, Mr. Trump made an impassioned call for China and other countries to pull together to confront the North, which he described as a sinister regime that starved and terrorized its people — a tragic failed experiment in the “laboratory of history.”

“It is our responsibility and our duty to confront this danger together because the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows, and the fewer the options become,” he said to the National Assembly, South Korea’s parliament.

“To those nations that choose to ignore this threat or, worse still, to enable it, the weight of this crisis is on your conscience,” said Mr. Trump, who tried to travel to the heavily fortified demilitarized zone between the North and South but had to turn back after fog grounded his helicopter .

Since Mr. Trump first played host to Mr. Xi at his Florida estate last April, he has said he is counting on Mr. Xi to do the right thing with North Korea, alternately praising and prodding the Chinese leader about enforcing tougher United Nations sanctions.

To his frustration, however, Mr. Xi has stopped short of targeting Mr. Kim with unilateral sanctions that would threaten his regime, send refugees into China and raise the possibility of a Korean Peninsula under control of the South, a close American ally.

China supplies much of North Korea’s energy; almost all of its crude oil flows in an 18-mile pipeline from the port city of Dandong, under the Yalu River, into the North Korean town of Sinuiju.

Mr. Trump has offered Mr. Xi an unspoken quid pro quo that Washington would hold off on major trade action against Beijing, despite the president’s strident criticism of China’s trade practices.

“Trump somewhat naïvely calculated that China would be more helpful on North Korea if he was ‘magnanimous’ on trade; I doubt Beijing sees it that way,” said Matthew P. Goodman, a political economist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and an adviser on Asian economics in the administrations of Barack Obama and George W. Bush.

At the start of this trip, Trump administration officials denied the president was willing to make concessions on trade in the hope of extracting what was needed on North Korea. But the president is also not calling on China to make any significant moves to open its markets, preferring to put the spotlight on big-ticket deals for American companies.

Some China experts said Mr. Trump failed to understand the limits of Chinese influence on the North. Although China fought alongside the North against the United States in the 1950-53 Korean War and remains its chief economic patron, the two countries are barely friends.

Some Chinese call the relationship a “fake alliance.” The two militaries have no working relationship. Early in his rule, Mr. Kim executed his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who had served as the primary conduit between the North and China’s senior leadership.

China’s influence on North Korea may have been further eroded by Mr. Xi’s decision last month to restore relations with South Korea, a move that deepened the North’s suspicions.

For more than a year, China had encouraged a boycott of South Korean goods and downgraded relations in protest over the deployment of an American-made missile defense system. But China relented last month , as the countries agreed to end the dispute even though South Korea is keeping the system.

Officials in Beijing and Washington point out that China has taken some measurable steps on North Korea. After the North’s accelerating nuclear tests and intercontinental ballistic missile launches, China approved tougher sanctions at the United Nations.

It has agreed to sever banking ties, end joint-venture companies with North Korea and limit the export of diesel fuel. China shut down North Korea’s coal imports earlier this year.

As Beijing has agreed to harsher penalties against North Korea, the cutting off of crude oil has become one of its last remaining, and most devastating, economic weapons. Some experts doubt that China would go that far because of its potentially destabilizing effect on Pyongyang.

“I don’t see China being complicit in regime change, which is what totally cutting off North Korea’s energy will seriously risk,” said Bilahari Kausikan, an ambassador at large for Singapore.

“How can it, when in his 19th Party Congress speech, Xi stressed insistently China’s Leninist state identity?” he said. “And to do so, moreover, by being complicit with China’s main competitor, the United States.”

For China, North Korea remains a valuable buffer against the possibility of a united Korean Peninsula that would probably be capitalist, democratic and allied with the United States, said Evans J. R. Revere, a former State Department official who dealt with Northeast Asia.

“China’s newly invigorated Communist Party and its ambitious leader, Xi Jinping, see nothing positive in any of these outcomes,” he said.

Mr. Trump’s military threats against North Korea have caught Beijing’s attention, Mr. Revere said. But he added, “It is not clear that Beijing takes these threats any more seriously than does Pyongyang, which seems convinced that the United States is bluffing.”

On Wednesday, Mr. Xi sought to make up for his differences with Mr. Trump by showering him with hospitality. He welcomed him to the Forbidden City, where the leaders and their wives sipped tea, listened to Chinese opera and toured the Ming and Qing-era treasures in a shrine to China’s imperial past, which the hosts had cleared of tourists for their guests.

It was the third pomp-filled Asian stop, after Japan and South Korea, where the leaders competed to woo and flatter Mr. Trump with golf games, honor guards and fulsome references to his election victory and campaign promise to “Make America Great Again.”

There is a fundamental difference between those countries and China in terms of their relationship with the United States, said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former China adviser to Mr. Obama. “They need us in an existential way; the Chinese don’t need us in an existential way.”

Back Story

Bram Stoker’s immortality is proving more difficult to pierce than that of his bloodthirsty creation.

Stoker, who was born in Ireland on this day in 1847, gave everlasting life to Dracula, the Transylvanian vampire, in the 1897 novel of the same name, and then took it away.

Photo

Since then, Stoker’s tale has been reimagined countless times, in books, on television and in films like “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (1992).

Now, one of his descendants is hoping to revive previously unpublished parts of the story.

Stoker took seven years to write the original novel, clawing his way through an overabundance of imagination and research that left much of the material in drafts.

The novelist’s great grandnephew Dacre Stoker announced he would release a prequel, “Dracul,” in 2018. It draws heavily from Bram Stoker’s notes and journal and from family legends. Paramount has already bought the movie rights, so Dracula may be resurrected on the big screen once again.

“Andrej is stepping out of the research mode and saying: ‘I want to do this in practice,’” Mr. Abbeel explained.
Some researchers question how much these machine learning techniques will ultimately improve robotics, believing they are overhyped among both researchers and the news media.
“Machine learning is being thrown at so many problems in robotics,” said Robert Howe, a professor of robotics at Harvard University.
“It is obvious that this is what you need to build flexible, agile robotics,” said Geoff Hinton, a pioneer of machine learning.","“We now have teachable robots,” Mr. Abbeel said during a recent interview at the new company’s offices in Emeryville, Calif., just across the bay from San Francisco.

The new company is part of a much wider effort to create A.I. that allows robots to learn. Researchers in places like Google, Brown University, and Carnegie Mellon are doing similar work, as are existing start-ups like Micropsi and Prowler.io.

Robots already automate some work inside factories and warehouses, such as moving boxes from place to place at Amazon’s massive distribution centers. But companies must program these machines for each particular task, limiting their possible applications. The hope is that robots can master a much wider array of tasks by learning on their own.

“Today, every motion that an industrial robot makes is specified down to the millimeter,” said Sunil Dhaliwal, the Amplify founder who led the firm’s investment in Embodied Intelligence. “But most real problems can’t be solved that way. You have to be able not just to tell the robot what to do, but to tell it how to learn.”

Mr. Abbeel and the other founders of Embodied Intelligence, including the former OpenAI researchers Peter Chen and Rocky Duan and the former Microsoft researcher Tianhao Zhang, specialize in an algorithmic method called reinforcement learning — a way for machines to learn tasks by extreme trial and error.

Researchers at DeepMind, the London-based A.I. lab owned by Google, used this method to build a machine that could play the ancient game of Go better than any human. In essence, the machine learned to master this enormously complex game by playing against itself — over and over and over again.

Other researchers, across both industry and academia, have shown that similar algorithms allow robots to learn physical tasks as well. By repeatedly trying to open a door, for instance, a robot can learn which particular movements bring success and which don’t.

Much like Google and labs at Brown and Northeastern University, Embodied Intelligence is also augmenting these methods with a wide range of other machine learning techniques. Most notably, the start-up is exploring what is called imitation learning, a way for machines to learn discrete tasks from human demonstrations.

The company is using this method to teach a two-armed robot to pick up plastic pipes from a table. Donning virtual reality headsets and holding motion trackers in their hands, Mr. Abbeel and his colleagues will repeatedly demonstrate the task in a digital world that recreates what is in front of a robot. Then the machine can then learn from this digital data.

“We collect data on what the human is doing,” Mr. Chen said. “Then we can train the machine to imitate the human.”

These and similar machine learning methods have only begun to bear fruit over the past few years, but many believe they will overhaul the field of robotics. It is telling that OpenAI, a pure research lab that opened its doors less than two years ago, has now lost two big names to more commercial pursuits.

Poached away from OpenAI by Mr. Musk himself, the machine learning expert Andrej Karpathy is now the director of A.I. at Tesla, working to help autonomous cars get smarter faster. And Mr. Abbeel is launching Embodied Intelligence. “Andrej is stepping out of the research mode and saying: ‘I want to do this in practice,’” Mr. Abbeel explained. “That same thing goes for us.”

He said he believed his new start-up can rapidly push its methods into manufacturing operations like the auto industry. Although robotics already handle many tasks inside such factories, there are many others they can’t yet master. That is what Embodied Intelligence hopes to change.

Some researchers question how much these machine learning techniques will ultimately improve robotics, believing they are overhyped among both researchers and the news media. “Machine learning is being thrown at so many problems in robotics,” said Robert Howe, a professor of robotics at Harvard University. “And it produces just enough results that people can trumpet it.”

But Mr. Abbeel is among the world’s top researchers in his field, and his decision to start a own company is an indication that machine learning will continue to push robotics forward.

“It is obvious that this is what you need to build flexible, agile robotics,” said Geoff Hinton, a pioneer of machine learning.",A.I. Researchers Leave Elon Musk Lab to Begin Robotics Start-Up,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/technology/artificial-intelligence-start-up.html

Finding that inner peace took Mr. Hamill several months of frustration and self-pity — not to mention a Lucasfilm-mandated regimen of dieting and exercise, during which he thought to himself: “Why are they training me to turn and remove a hood? I could be the size of Marlon Brando in ‘Apocalypse Now,’ who’s going to know?”

You would understand if Mr. Hamill, now 66, had a conflicted relationship with “Star Wars,” which put him on a pop-cultural pedestal. The series defined and dominated his career, even as he took on other film, television and theater roles; the franchise went into periods of hibernation, then came roaring back and restored him to relevance when he least expected it.

But Mr. Hamill isn’t bitter or jaded, and he isn’t Luke, though he has retained some of that character’s incorruptibility. He’s gone from a new hope to an old hand, with a lined, expressive face and a gray beard, beneath which lurks a mischievous sense of humor, a yearning to perform and a joy in sharing “Star Wars” war stories.

At heart, he is as much of an unapologetic geek as any of his admirers, as astonished by the circumstances that brought “Star Wars” into his life as he is grateful that he gets to return to its galaxy of long ago and far, far away.

“I’m such a fraud,” he said with a theatrical air. “But I’m enjoying all the residual attention that the movie’s getting. I should be, by all rights, puttering in my garden with a metal detector, telling kids to get off my lawn. What’s not to love?”

On this October afternoon, he was at home with his wife, Marilou, and their daughter, Chelsea; the couple also has two sons, Nathan and Griffin. The spacious dwelling is hardly a shrine to “Star Wars” — it’s mostly decorated with artwork of cherubs and the Beatles, Mr. Hamill’s own cultural obsession, though you might spot a photo of the 2-year-old Nathan frolicking with Yoda on the set of “Return of the Jedi.”

Mr. Hamill is not unduly nostalgic, but he conducts himself with an impish refusal to grow up. In conversation, he will sometimes stretch on the floor in yoga poses; he’ll slip into the exaggerated voices of famous colleagues — the adenoidal clip of the “Star Wars” creator George Lucas or the disaffected monotone of Mr. Ford.

In many ways, he is still the boy who was fascinated with cartoon voice actors, musical theater, stage magicians and ventriloquists, and whose favorite film was “King Kong.”

Proudly recalling a fight scene from “Return of the Jedi,” Mr. Hamill said, “For me, sitting in the rancor’s hand, I was going all Fay Wray — it’s like a major accomplishment to me. But it was always that way. I’d say ‘Hey, you guys, my face is on the back of a box of C-3PO’s cereal!’”

The son of a Navy officer, Mr. Hamill was the middle child of seven siblings. He had an itinerant upbringing, living in California, Virginia and Japan, attending nine schools in 12 years and perpetually feeling like the new kid.

When he arrived in Los Angeles in 1969, Mr. Hamill was interested in acting, but really wanted to be involved in show business however he could. “If I didn’t get a part, no problem,” he said. “Then where do I go? I sell tickets. I make props. I make posters. I don’t have to be in the show – I want to be near the show.”

He landed early roles on “General Hospital” and “The Partridge Family.” And then, of course, came “Star Wars”: a strange screenplay, still in flux when he read it, with sentient robots, laser swords and a supernatural spirituality bound up in a fable about good and evil.

Mr. Lucas said he chose Mr. Hamill from a pool of young actors because he brought a measure of humanity to a film full of space vehicles and special effects. “I needed a protagonist who was comfortable treating these things both casually and seriously in order to give that world an air of authenticity,” Mr. Lucas said. He added that Mr. Hamill “brought a boyish enthusiasm and exuberance that really defined the character,” and that “made Luke accessible and relatable to people in the first ‘Star Wars’” and its sequels.

Mr. Hamill committed fully to the material, but was unsure it would find a wider audience. “I thought, even if this thing doesn’t slay at the box office, it’s got midnight cult movie written all over it,” he said. “Move over, ‘Rocky Horror,’ ‘Star Wars’ is here!”

Instead, “Star Wars” became an international phenomenon, tying Mr. Hamill to his character and to Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford — even now, he sometimes accidentally calls them “Harry and Carrison” — as they promoted the movie together.

When the critic John Simon wrote in New York magazine that Mr. Ford had performed “adequately,” Mr. Hamill “uninspiredly” and Ms. Fisher “wretchedly,” Mr. Hamill said, “We had T-shirts made: ‘adequate, uninspired and wretched.’ I said, ‘Harrison, adequate’s practically a rave compared to what we got.’”

Mr. Ford said that during this time, “the three of us were like a very small tribe in the wilderness. We really were figuring this out as we went along.” Mr. Hamill struck him as “a very bright, sincere young actor,” who Mr. Ford said “seemed probably the most clear on what he was doing.”

Mr. Hamill, who receives a percentage of the “Star Wars” royalties, did not go onto a mainstream career, but he is hardly rueful now. Of his cohort, Mr. Hamill said Mr. Ford was the one meant for matinee idol status: “He’s a brilliant actor — that’s a given,” he said. “He’s also a leading man. When I tested for this thing, I assumed he was the protagonist and I was his annoying sidekick.” Mr. Hamill believed he’d find his destiny on a different path — one that was less glamorous, but that fully embraced his affection for the esoteric, the offbeat and the weird.

After two blockbuster sequels, “The Empire Strikes Back” in 1980 and “Return of the Jedi” in 1983, Mr. Hamill believed the “Star Wars” story was complete. With newfound visibility, he decided to pursue a lifelong dream of performing on Broadway, where he had played John Merrick in “The Elephant Man.” “I wasn’t getting character parts in movies and television,” he explained. “Unless you’re Meryl Streep, they don’t let you do accents.”

He starred in the Broadway production of “Amadeus” while “Return of the Jedi” was still in theaters. But his 1985 musical “Harrigan ’n Hart,” about a pair of 19th-century variety-theater stars, was a notorious dud, running less than a week of regular performances.

Over the next 30 years, Mr. Hamill was cast in cult films and TV shows, often poking fun at his inability to shed his “Star Wars” legacy. He played an interstellar fighter pilot in the Wing Commander video games, and on “The Simpsons,” he portrayed himself playing Nathan Detroit as Luke Skywalker in a mediocre dinner-theater production of “Guys and Dolls.” Perhaps his best-known work from this era was providing the voice of the malevolent Joker in several animated Batman TV shows, movies and video games.

He was always comfortable being part of the “Star Wars” subculture, gladly attending conventions and engaging with the people he calls U.P.F.s (for “ultra-passionate fans”).

“It’s clearly not for everyone — I get that,” Mr. Hamill said. “But the passion of it all is just astonishing. The way it’s become part of the fabric of their lives — ‘I met my wife at this movie, we named our child Leia’ — it’s moving.”

He was not involved in the much-maligned “Star Wars” prequels from 1999 to 2005. And when Mr. Lucas invited him and Ms. Fisher to a lunch in 2012, to tell them he was giving control of Lucasfilm to Kathleen Kennedy and that a new “Star Wars” trilogy was being planned, Mr. Hamill had no expectation of being asked to participate. “We figured we had the middle three,” he said. “It was over.”

When Mr. Lucas said their characters would be included in these new films if they wanted to play them, Mr. Hamill said, “I was completely stunned. Carrie, not a minute went by — she slapped the table and goes, ‘I’m in!’ I said, ‘Carrie, poker face!’”

Mr. Hamill needed more time to think. “I was just really scared,” he said. “I thought, why mess with it? The idea of catching lightning in a bottle twice was ridiculously remote.”

He also feared that audiences would reject him and his veteran co-stars, all these years after their “Star Wars” heyday. “No one wants to see the 50-, 60-, 70-year-old versions of us, running around, bumping heads on the Death Star,” he said. “It’s sad.”

Mr. Hamill thought he would have some cover to refuse “The Force Awakens,” expecting that Mr. Ford would not return.

“He’s too old and too rich and too cranky,” Mr. Hamill said. “He’s not going to do this.” But when Mr. Ford said yes, Mr. Hamill realized he had to agree, too: “Can you imagine if I was the only one to say no? I’d be the most hated man in nerd-dom.”

Soon after accepting, Mr. Hamill got to bask in the adulation of “Star Wars” fans eager to see him on new adventures with the young novices Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega). He trained to get into shape and met with Lucasfilm artists. But deeper behind the scenes, J.J. Abrams, the director of “The Force Awakens,” and his co-writer, Lawrence Kasdan, a writer of “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi,” were realizing their ever-expanding script could not accommodate Luke’s story line. (The screenplay was credited to Mr. Abrams, Mr. Kasdan and Michael Arndt.)

“The idea of it was so enormous,” Mr. Abrams said. “It became clear that there was no way that that movie could also include those chapters. That had to be the next movie.”

Eventually Mr. Abrams had to tell Mr. Hamill that Luke would not be a significant character in “The Force Awakens.” “I let him know before he read the script that his role was minimal,” Mr. Abrams said. “I don’t think he knew just how minimal until he read it.”

In their next conversation, Mr. Abrams acknowledged, Mr. Hamill was “not particularly happy with how little he was in it.”

Mr. Hamill does not deny his initial disappointment, though he said he was mostly afraid that Luke’s big reveal at the end would fall flat. “If it smacks the audience as a cheat or a gimmick, if there’s a big groan in the house, the egg’s on my face, not J.J.’s,” he said.

Amid lingering feelings of petulance, Mr. Hamill traveled to London in 2014 for a table read — he jokingly calls it a “table listen” — of the “Force Awakens” script. He had no dialogue, so Mr. Abrams instead asked him to read the narration. (“I think he wanted to break me, like you break a racehorse,” Mr. Hamill said.) Still, he was excited to meet Ms. Ridley and Mr. Boyega, and to reunite with Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford.

Mr. Ford, who had not seen Mr. Hamill in many years and shared no scenes with him in “The Force Awakens,” lamented that they had worked together on the early “Star Wars” movies far less than viewers realize.

“The number of onscreen days that I spent with Mark were very, very few,” he said. “I knew Chewbacca better.”

Yet as soon as he spotted Mr. Hamill there, Mr. Ford said, “aside from the obvious passage of time, which had happened to both of us, he was very much the same guy, albeit bearded.”

“He’s very centered in his own experience and his own life,” Mr. Ford said. “He’s not a grandstander. He’s a quiet, sincere, workmanlike presence, and that’s what we’re there for.”

Mr. Hamill has come to appreciate his extended cameo in “The Force Awakens” — “when they talk about you that much in a movie before you even show up, that’s fabulous,” he said.

But now he and the “The Last Jedi” creators understand how much is riding on them with this film.

“I told him, everyone is going to be leaning forward for your first words in this,” said Rian Johnson, the “Last Jedi” writer and director. “Obviously, Mark came into this one with higher expectations for what we do with the character.”

Mr. Johnson said “The Last Jedi” also treated Mr. Hamill as an actor who has lived a whole life since he first played Luke. “In the same way that as a young man, he embodied the characteristics we all connected with — the youthfulness and innocence — he now embodies a person full of soul and experience,” Mr. Johnson said.

Video

While Mr. Hamill tries not to dispute the “Star Wars” filmmakers on big plot points — he’s still not sure whether Mr. Lucas always intended for Luke and Leia to be brother and sister — he found himself full of strong opinions about how the character he has been associated with for 40 years should be presented in “The Last Jedi.”

“That’s the hard part,” Mr. Hamill said. “You don’t want to admit how possessive you’ve become. There are times where you go, ‘Really? That’s what they think of Luke? I’m not only in disagreement – I’m insulted.’ But that’s the process and you thrash it all out.”

The film has become an unexpectedly poignant document since Ms. Fisher died in December. Though their contact was fitful in her final years, Mr. Hamill said that Ms. Fisher was a reliably caustic companion and correspondent — someone who brought a wicked sense of humor to the occasionally onerous media events they attended together and offered him a constant reminder of his obligation to “Star Wars.”

Several years ago, when Ms. Fisher noticed in a theater program that Mr. Hamill had referred only elliptically to his “Star Wars” work, he said, “She goes, ‘What’s your problem?’ I said, ‘Well, it’s theater, I want it to be more focused on theater.’ She goes, ‘I am Princess Leia. You’re Luke Skywalker. Get used to it.’”

More remorsefully, Mr. Hamill spoke of his frustration that Ms. Fisher would not get to complete this trilogy of films.

“She deserved that second act,” he said. “Harrison was more prominent in VII, I’m more prominent in this one, and she was meant to be more prominent in the last one. Her timing was perfect, except in this case.”

His “Star Wars” colleagues say that there is something fitting about the fact that the devoted, less heralded Mr. Hamill is the only lead actor from the original films presently involved with the franchise — “He’s the last man standing,” said Mr. Ford, whose character met his demise in “The Force Awakens.”

But Mr. Ford was reluctant to speculate what this distinction might mean to Mr. Hamill.

“It means what it means to him, and that’s all that matters,” he said. “I’m sure what he represents in the story is something worthy of attainment by those younger characters, and” — his voice took on an uncharacteristically whimsical tone — “that it’s all linked together in some cosmically glorious way that will assure Mark work for years to come.”

Photo

Mr. Hamill prefers not to scrutinize this too closely either. Pleading self-consciousness, he said he has not watched the original “Star Wars” movies outside of theaters and has seen “The Force Awakens” only twice.

“All I notice are flaws,” he explained. “‘Oh, why did I do that?’ ‘Look at my hair.’ ‘What was I thinking?’”

During production of “The Force Awakens,” he allowed himself to watch the audition reels of actors who were also considered for Luke Skywalker — Will Seltzer, Robby Benson, William Katt — and was struck by what he saw. “They were all great,” Mr. Hamill said. “They all could have been really good Luke Skywalkers, which really makes me appreciate the arbitrariness.”

One film Mr. Hamill goes back to frequently is “A Hard Day’s Night,” Richard Lester’s madcap comedy about the Beatles happily enduring the hardships of celebrity as they are pursued by fans.

As a teenager, Mr. Hamill said, “I saw it originally going, ‘Oh, can you imagine it? Girls chasing me down the street! It looks like so much fun.’” But when he viewed it again recently, he saw it in another light. “It’s like a horror movie,” he said. “They’re trapped. They can’t go anywhere.”

One scene that stuck in Mr. Hamill’s mind was the “Can’t Buy Me Love” sequence, when the Fab Four are running through a field, clowning around, blissfully free of the gravitational forces awaiting them in the outside world.

“It’s the one time they spontaneously feel exuberance and joy,” Mr. Hamill said. “It plays so differently now, when you’re on the other end of it.”",Luke Skywalker Speaks,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/movies/star-wars-the-last-jedi-luke-skywalker-mark-hamill.html

I had chased Halladay for two years, through his agency and his former teams, with no luck.
Halladay was a little bigger than I remembered, as many players are when their training stops.
“If I threw 120 pitches in a game, I would throw a 20-pitch bullpen,” Halladay explained.
After our tour, he asked for a framed Halladay photo collage from a store on Main Street.","He left behind a wife and two sons. He coached youth teams and seemed to be enjoying a blissful retirement — “in the air or on the water” as he wrote on his Twitter page, where he posted this right under his handle: “Courage is not being fearless but rather acting in spite of the existence of fear!”

That playoff debut, the one he had wondered so much about, will stand as Halladay’s signature performance. He threw a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds, the first in the postseason since Don Larsen’s perfect game in the 1956 World Series. And that was as good as it got.

In Halladay’s final playoff game, the next fall, he lost by 1-0 to the St. Louis Cardinals and Chris Carpenter, an old teammate who had taught Halladay his curveball while playing catch in the minors. Somebody had to win that day, and it was his friend, not him. Halladay had given his best, and lost. It happens, and he was rational enough to understand that.

I was in the Phillies’ clubhouse after that loss, when Halladay expressed a version of the comment above. It has struck me ever since as the essence of the competitor: All you really want is a chance to test yourself, to see how it all turns out with everything at stake.

Halladay had gotten his opportunities. He was proud of how he had handled them.

We spoke this spring as part of my research for a book I am writing on pitching. I had chased Halladay for two years, through his agency and his former teams, with no luck. On my visit to Clearwater, Greg Casterioto, the Phillies’ director of baseball communications, told me Halladay was there, working with prospects on the minor league side. He met me at the picnic tables while the major leaguers played on the main field.

Halladay was a little bigger than I remembered, as many players are when their training stops. He had been a fitness fanatic when he played, and said the work — the way it flowed into the competition — was what he missed most since retiring in 2013, at age 36.

Durability was Halladay’s hallmark. He pitched 63 complete games from 2002 through 2011, 30 more than any other pitcher in that decade. His back gave out, but he said his arm always felt strong. The workload never caught up to him because he measured it precisely.

“If I threw 120 pitches in a game, I would throw a 20-pitch bullpen,” Halladay explained. “If I threw 100 pitches in a game, I would throw a 40-pitch bullpen. If I only threw 80, I’d throw a 60-pitch bullpen. So I was always getting the same amount of pitches in a five-day period.”

We talked a bit about the modern state of pitching. Halladay had eight seasons of at least 220 innings, a total no pitcher reached in 2017. He said today’s pitchers, with their turbo fastballs, tried too hard to strike hitters out.

“I felt like with two strikes — 0-2, 1-2 — if they didn’t swing at it, it was going to be strike three,” he said. “I wanted something that they had either had to swing at and put in play, or was going to be a strike on 0-2. Now it’s two extra pitches, and we’re getting back to 2-2 and the count goes on. So I think it’s just changed a lot in the way people think about pitching. They want to stay just off the plate to where they’re avoiding contact.”

Halladay induced weak contact — and so many awkward swings — using the Greg Maddux model of moving the ball in or away on either side of the plate. Hitters knew that Halladay could carve an X in the air, down by their hands or out by their handle, with his sinkers and cutters. He could also lock them up with a curve in the zone, or a split-change — a pitch he learned from Rich Dubee, a Phillies coach — in the dirt.

“I wanted them to swing at every pitch,” he said. And with an arsenal like that, why not?

Halladay’s success was hard-earned. After parts of three seasons in the majors, the Blue Jays sent him to Class A to rebuild his psyche and master a lower arm slot. He appreciated how fleeting success could be, and approached his work with a serious demeanor that evoked Steve Carlton, an earlier Phillies ace.

Carlton was my baseball hero when I was young. My son now roots for the Phillies — his grandparents have tickets — and Halladay was his favorite. When I took him to the Hall of Fame two years ago, he took a picture with the cap Halladay wore for his perfect game in 2010. After our tour, he asked for a framed Halladay photo collage from a store on Main Street.

On Tuesday, my son took inventory of the shrine to Halladay in his bedroom: two framed wall-hangings, two bobbleheads, a pennant and a baseball card. He didn’t cry at the news of the crash; he is 15, too busy for that. He asked if he could go to the Y to practice jump shots. Basketball tryouts are coming up.

I told him I’d have to pick him up in the middle of writing this column, and he said not to bother; he wanted me to write a good story. I insisted he go, because Halladay would have wanted that. He laughed — it’s a trite thing to say, and I barely knew the man. But I meant it.

I learned a lot from Halladay in our interview this spring — how he mastered each of his pitches, how he held them, how he used them to very likely earn a plaque in the Hall. But mostly I learned again that what truly drove him was not the achievement, but earning the opportunity to have it. If he could do that perfectly, he could live with the rest.

Halladay did not live long enough. But his legacy, to me, is powerful and instructive in any field: The purity of the effort matters most.","Mourning Roy Halladay, a Master Who Craved the Big Moments",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/sports/baseball/halladay-death-plane-crash.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

On Tuesday, voters across the country returned to the polls. Believe it or not, Wednesday marks one full year since Election Day 2016.

And while some states held votes that attracted national attention — the governor’s race in Virginia, for example — Californians had only local contests to decide.

But don’t fret. Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst and professor at the University of Southern California, said the eyes of the national political parties will turn back to California soon enough.

There’s a governor’s race in 2018, and a fight brewing over Dianne Feinstein’s senate seat. And perhaps most important to national onlookers, Dr. Bebitch Jeffe said, “California will play a major role in determining whether the Democrats have a chance of retaking the House.” As many as nine of 14 Republican seats could be vulnerable, she said.

“They’re already running around beating up one another,” she said of the various candidates. “Californians are not patient.”

“We’re already into it,” she added, noting that, somehow, “it’s almost 2018.”

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

Can clever cluing turn a stale word fresh?
It struck me that if there were one word everyone could agree on as “fresh,” surely it’d be the A.D.S.","Ben Zimmer Talks About Word of the Year

What a great idea for a theme! Given the word-nerdy kinship between neologism watchers and crossword lovers, I’m surprised it’s the first time this theme has been attempted.

The American Dialect Society has been awarding Word of the Year honors since 1990, but maybe it took this long for the stars to align just right — after all, the last two WOTY winners, SINGULAR THEY (2015) and DUMPSTER FIRE (2016), are nicely symmetrical (12 letters, with the same 8-4 enumeration).

Deb asked me to comment on each of the WOTY honorees featured in the grid. Though a couple of them are before my time — I didn’t really get active in the WOTY proceedings until 2005 (the year of “truthiness”) — I’m happy to kibitz in my capacity as Chair of the New Words Committee for the ADS.

MILLENNIUM BUG (1997): This was a very forward-looking choice at the time, given that we were still a couple of years away from the Y2K doomsday scenario foretold by software unequipped to handle the calendrical change from Dec. 31, 1999 to Jan. 1, 2000. “Y2K” itself would go on to win WOTY honors for 1999, but thankfully the Cassandras were wrong and we weren’t all forced off the grid when the millennium arrived.

WMD (2002): Both “weapons of mass destruction” and its shortened form “WMD” received WOTY recognition for a year in which headlines were dominated by news of the Iraq War — and what turned out to be the shaky rationale for it. The U.S. never did find the WMDs that Saddam Hussein was thought to possess, but the abbreviation lives on (including the plural form “WMDs,” with the “-s” attached to the end like “RBIs”).

PLUTOED (2006): History hasn’t been kind to the 2006 selection. When the International Astronomical Union took away Pluto’s planetary status, it was such big news that “pluto” itself briefly became a verb — getting “plutoed” meant getting demoted or devalued as Pluto was. But the word quickly faded away, making this the most forgettable WOTY choice since 1990’s “bushlips” (a word for insincere political rhetoric, based on George H.W. Bush’s broken promise, “Read my lips, no new taxes”).

BAILOUT (2008): “Bailout” wasn’t exactly a new word in 2008 — it’s been used in the financial sense since the 1930s. But it was the prohibitive frontrunner in the WOTY race, since government bailouts were all the rage in the final months of the year, as we came to grips with the Great Recession. It beat out terms that had come to prominence in the ‘08 presidential race, like “maverick,” “lipstick on a pig,” and “hockey mom.”

APP (2010): The choice of “app” (short for “application”) reflected tech trends of the day, particularly Apple’s rollout of the App Store with the memorable slogan, “There’s an app for that.” Apple, in fact, tried to trademark the phrase “app store” after Microsoft, Amazon, and Google launched their own equivalents. A few days after the WOTY vote, the ADS press release about “app” was even quoted by Microsoft in its legal proceedings against Apple!

SINGULAR THEY (2015): The ADS picked a pronoun for the 2015 WOTY, but not just any pronoun. The selection of “they” as a gender-neutral third-person singular pronoun was a long time coming — singular “they” has been in use for centuries by everyone from Chaucer to Shakespeare to Jane Austen. But in 2015 it gained momentum, thanks to recognition by style books and its growing popularity among those seeking a pronoun that could transcend the gender binary of “he” and “she.”

DUMPSTER FIRE (2016): First of all, yes, like “millennium bug” above, “dumpster fire” is technically two words. Word of the Year voting recognizes any lexical item — something that could serve as an entry in a dictionary, or, indeed, a crossword. People gripe about this every time a phrase gets WOTY recognition. It happened all over again last week when Collins Dictionary announced “fake news” as its choice for 2017. “Dumpster fire” was a popular way to describe the mess that was 2016, or particular messes like the presidential election or the Brexit vote. It looks like it has legs for 2017, too: Pawel Fludzinki was the first to memorialize it in a Times crossword back in March.

The ADS will be gathering to anoint a new Word of the Year on Jan. 5, 2018 at our annual meeting, held this time at the Grand America Hotel in Salt Lake City (in conjunction with the Linguistic Society of America). The WOTY vote is open to all, so you’re welcome to join us — or if you can’t make it, feel free to submit your nominations by email to woty@americandialect.org or on Twitter to @americandialect.

Constructor Notes

This puzzle came about as a result of a minor philosophical crisis. I’d read a blog post where the author was complaining about a puzzle that he felt “lacked fresh fill.” This complaint surprised me, because I’d personally found the puzzle in question to be quite lively. It got me wondering: what do we mean when we talk about “fresh fill”? What separates perfectly O.K., workhorse words from gnarly crosswordese? Can clever cluing turn a stale word fresh? And when does a word go from “fresh” to faddish, twee, or just plain annoying? I soon began to doubt everything I knew about cruciverbalism and, indeed, language itself. Around the same time, I read on Language Log (a blog run by an international supergroup of academic linguists) that the American Dialect Society had recently announced “DUMPSTER FIRE” as their 2016 Word of the Year. It struck me that if there were one word everyone could agree on as “fresh,” surely it’d be the A.D.S. Word of the Year. So I made a puzzle based on that idea. My initial plan was to seed the past several years’ winners anywhere I could fit them into a grid. But when I looked at the WotY list, I realized the word lengths might allow for symmetric placement. Luckily, I was able to pull it off. I’m super-duper thrilled for this to be my debut puzzle in The Times. Thanks to my friends and family (especially Cliff, Nick, and the Daves Madden and Sheppard) for their support and feedback. Thanks also to Mr. Shortz for actually accepting this thing, and editing the clues to be better and more consistent overall. My only regret is that UHF is no longer clued as “1989 ‘Weird Al’ film set at a low-budget TV station.”

Maybe this will make you feel better, Mr. Poulos. If nothing else, it will bring back the 1980s for you in a big way:

Ralph Northam’s election as Virginia governor amid reportedly high turnout on Tuesday is a stinging and welcome rebuke to President Trump and white nationalism.

Virginia and New Jersey, where Democrat Phil Murphy easily won the governor’s race, were the first statewide general elections since Donald Trump won the presidency a year ago, and Virginia, the only southern state Hillary Clinton won in 2016, was by far the more consequential of the two. Late Tuesday Democrats were also registering gains in the Virginia House of Delegates, suggesting strong disapproval of Mr. Trump at the grass roots.

Having been nearly vanquished in the primary by Corey Stewart, an anti-immigrant conspiracy theorist who played on issues like preserving Confederate monuments, Mr. Gillespie, at the advice of Republican leaders, took up race-baiting. His ads, featuring menacing tattooed men, accused Mr. Northam of being “weak on MS-13,” the gang formed by Central American immigrants in Los Angeles that now threatens Virginia suburbs. They contained some of the darkest appeals in Tuesday’s off-year contests — and that’s saying something, given the Republican candidate ads that aired in places like Nassau County, N.Y., and New Jersey.

Tap the Ellipsis key and then locate the Rebus key.","SPECIAL POST — Some solvers love them, some solvers hate them, but rebus elements are a fact of life when it comes to solving crosswords.

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

The clue was “You might find one at a sawmill,” and the answer is LUMBERJACK, a 10 letter word, but the slot only has room for seven letters. How do you fill in the entire answer?

Entering a Rebus on the Web

Step 1: Select the square in which you want to enter a rebus. Click the Rebus button on the toolbar above the clue lists, or simply press Escape (Esc). This will open an expandable square in which you can type multiple characters. Step 2: Type in your answer and press Enter/Return, or click anywhere outside the field to close and save your rebus. To cancel your entry instead, press Escape.

“It is our responsibility and our duty to confront this danger together because the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows, and the fewer the options become,” he said to the National Assembly, South Korea’s parliament.

“To those nations that choose to ignore this threat or, worse still, to enable it, the weight of this crisis is on your conscience,” said Mr. Trump, who tried to travel to the heavily fortified demilitarized zone between the North and South but had to turn back after fog grounded his helicopter.

Since Mr. Trump first played host to Mr. Xi at his Florida estate last April, he has said he is counting on Mr. Xi to do the right thing with North Korea, alternately praising and prodding the Chinese leader about enforcing tougher United Nations sanctions.

To his frustration, however, Mr. Xi has stopped short of targeting Mr. Kim with unilateral sanctions that would threaten his regime, send refugees into China and raise the possibility of a Korean Peninsula under control of the South, a close American ally.

China supplies much of North Korea’s energy; almost all of its crude oil flows in an 18-mile pipeline from the port city of Dandong, under the Yalu River, into the North Korean town of Sinuiju.

Mr. Trump has offered Mr. Xi an unspoken quid pro quo that Washington would hold off on major trade action against Beijing, despite the president’s strident criticism of China’s trade practices.

“Trump somewhat naïvely calculated that China would be more helpful on North Korea if he was ‘magnanimous’ on trade; I doubt Beijing sees it that way,” said Matthew P. Goodman, a political economist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and an adviser on Asian economics in the administrations of Barack Obama and George W. Bush.

At the start of this trip, Trump administration officials denied the president was willing to make concessions on trade in the hope of extracting what was needed on North Korea. But the president is also not calling on China to make any significant moves to open its markets, preferring to put the spotlight on big-ticket deals for American companies.

Some China experts said Mr. Trump failed to understand the limits of Chinese influence on the North. Although China fought alongside the North against the United States in the 1950-53 Korean War and remains its chief economic patron, the two countries are barely friends.

Some Chinese call the relationship a “fake alliance.” The two militaries have no working relationship. Early in his rule, Mr. Kim executed his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who had served as the primary conduit between the North and China’s senior leadership.

China’s influence on North Korea may have been further eroded by Mr. Xi’s decision last month to restore relations with South Korea, a move that deepened the North’s suspicions.

For more than a year, China had encouraged a boycott of South Korean goods and downgraded relations in protest over the deployment of an American-made missile defense system. But China relented last month, as the countries agreed to end the dispute even though South Korea is keeping the system.

Officials in Beijing and Washington point out that China has taken some measurable steps on North Korea. After the North’s accelerating nuclear tests and intercontinental ballistic missile launches, China approved tougher sanctions at the United Nations.

It has agreed to sever banking ties, end joint-venture companies with North Korea and limit the export of diesel fuel. China shut down North Korea’s coal imports earlier this year.

As Beijing has agreed to harsher penalties against North Korea, the cutting off of crude oil has become one of its last remaining, and most devastating, economic weapons. Some experts doubt that China would go that far because of its potentially destabilizing effect on Pyongyang.

“I don’t see China being complicit in regime change, which is what totally cutting off North Korea’s energy will seriously risk,” said Bilahari Kausikan, an ambassador at large for Singapore.

“How can it, when in his 19th Party Congress speech, Xi stressed insistently China’s Leninist state identity?” he said. “And to do so, moreover, by being complicit with China’s main competitor, the United States.”

For China, North Korea remains a valuable buffer against the possibility of a united Korean Peninsula that would probably be capitalist, democratic and allied with the United States, said Evans J. R. Revere, a former State Department official who dealt with Northeast Asia.

“China’s newly invigorated Communist Party and its ambitious leader, Xi Jinping, see nothing positive in any of these outcomes,” he said.

Mr. Trump’s military threats against North Korea have caught Beijing’s attention, Mr. Revere said. But he added, “It is not clear that Beijing takes these threats any more seriously than does Pyongyang, which seems convinced that the United States is bluffing.”

On Wednesday, Mr. Xi sought to make up for his differences with Mr. Trump by showering him with hospitality. He welcomed him to the Forbidden City, where the leaders and their wives sipped tea, listened to Chinese opera and toured the Ming and Qing-era treasures in a shrine to China’s imperial past, which the hosts had cleared of tourists for their guests.

It was the third pomp-filled Asian stop, after Japan and South Korea, where the leaders competed to woo and flatter Mr. Trump with golf games, honor guards and fulsome references to his election victory and campaign promise to “Make America Great Again.”

There is a fundamental difference between those countries and China in terms of their relationship with the United States, said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former China adviser to Mr. Obama. “They need us in an existential way; the Chinese don’t need us in an existential way.”","Trump, in China, Seeks Help Over a Nuclear North Korea",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/world/asia/trump-china-xi-jinping-north-korea.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

He began conversations with the Vatican in 2015; the loan came from the Sistine Chapel sacristy Office for the Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff, as opposed to the Vatican Museums, since it involves garments still in active use. (They date from the mid-18th-century to the papacy of John Paul II.) Mr. Bolton said the church was immediately receptive to the idea of working together, though he had to make eight visits to Rome to discuss the show. And because of concerns about display and security, the loan contract was not signed until last week.

Asked if he had met the pope or knew whether he had approved the show, Mr. Bolton said he had had no contact with him, and did not have any idea if he was involved.

Greg Burke, the director of the Holy See press office, said: “The Roman Catholic Church has been producing and promoting beautiful works of art for centuries. Most people have experienced that through religious paintings and architecture. This is another way of sharing some of that beauty that rarely gets seen.”

The Vatican garments will be separated from the rest of the fashion in the exhibition, out of respect for the fact that they are still working garments and, presumably, to defray criticisms that could incur if a visitor were to see, for example, a sacristy robe next to a Jean Paul Gaultier dress with a chalice embroidered over the breasts.

Less has been done, seemingly, to defray the idea that Mr. Bolton’s definition of “fashion” is definitively Western. Save Isabel Toledo, who is Cuban-American, there are no South American or Latin American designers in the show, for example, though it is hard to imagine that no one else from that continent engaged with Catholic iconography. Challenged on the subject, he said he hoped to expand his purview in a future exhibition.

In any case, Mr. Bolton has been here before: In 2015, his show, “China Through the Looking Glass,” became the fifth-most-visited exhibition, despite accusations of skating over the surface of the issues it raised, underscoring for him the importance of tapping into the broader conversation. He followed it up with “Manus x Machina,” which examined the role of technology in fashion (and which became the Met’s seventh-most-visited show); and then “Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between,” the Costume Institute’s first retrospective of a living designer since 1983. Though it was widely praised, Ms. Kawakubo is a less obviously buzzy choice, and the show and the attendance were smaller.

Which may partly explain why the museum decided to roll the dice with this show.

Luckily, my helmet was securely in place when, for reasons unknown, I fell forward over the handlebars while riding slowly uphill a few houses from home. Although I suffered a mild concussion and have no memory of the accident (I also sustained a nasty cut on my chin, badly bruised ribs and a scraped knee), my helmet prevented a serious brain or facial injury.

I will never again mount a bicycle without the helmet on my head where it belongs, not in my backpack, bike basket or, worse, at home.

There are laws requiring young cyclists to wear helmets in 21 states and Washington, D.C., and at least 200 localities, but very few cover adult riders. A common sight in my neighborhood: Fathers riding helmetless with their helmeted child on a bike seat behind them.

There are many reasons besides helmet hair that keep people from wearing helmets. One of the most frequent excuses: “I’m only going to the store (or the gym).” Yet, as with car accidents, the majority of bike accidents happen close to home, as mine did, and not necessarily in traffic or at high speeds. Even low-speed falls on a bike trail can scramble brains.

“A very low-speed fall can be just as dangerous as a fall at higher speeds,” said Randy Swart, director of the consumer-funded Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute. “All it takes is gravity – the distance to the ground – to cause a head injury.”

Teenagers seem especially resistant to wearing helmets, yet with their still-developing brains they probably incur the greatest risks and have the most to lose from a head injury. “There’s often a rebellion aspect among teens,” Mr. Swart said. “They say, ‘All through childhood, my parents forced me to be safe. Now I want to make my own decisions about risk.’” College students and young adults often also think similarly, he said.

I worry too about younger children, even those whose parents insist that they wear a helmet when riding a scooter, tricycle or bicycle. I see many such riders with parents in tow in my Brooklyn neighborhood, and in at least half the cases I’ve observed, the helmet is too big or is not on correctly and likely to provide little protection in a serious fall or crash.

The most common error is positioning: If the helmet sits too far back on the child’s (or adult’s) head, it will not protect the most vulnerable part of the brain in a hard fall, especially if the skull fractures. When the straps are too loose (or, as I’ve often seen even among adults, the chin strap is not clasped), the helmet will fly off in a fall and offer no protection whatsoever.

The helmet should sit on the head straight, front to back, and not move when you shake your head. The straps extending from the helmet to the chin strap should each form a V right under the ears.

“A bike helmet is a like a seatbelt – it should feel snug, not tight, when you first put it on, but when you start riding, you should be able to forget all about it,” Mr. Swart said.

Another excuse I’ve heard, perhaps from those familiar with concussions among football players, is that helmets do not prevent concussions. And that is true. You don’t even have to actually hit your head to get a concussion. A concussion results when the gel-like brain sloshes violently or slams into the unyielding bony skull, and this can happen with almost any significant impact to the head. What the helmet can do is reduce the energy of the impact and the likelihood of a skull fracture or brain bleed.

If cost is a deterrent, Mr. Swart gleefully noted that many inexpensive helmets perform just as well as expensive ones. His organization had three “extremely cheap” helmets ($15 to $20 range) tested along with three “very expensive” ones ($150 and above) and, he said, “their performance level was almost identical.”

So if you’re not overly concerned about fashion or brand names, you can feel confident purchasing inexpensive helmets for every rider in the family at a chain or big-box store, he said. They all must meet the standards set by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

After determining a proper fit for head size and comfort within your price range, my advice is to select a helmet that is brightly colored; one of mine is red-orange and the other lime-yellow, the same as the colors of the jackets and backpacks I wear with them.

HONG KONG — In August, a court in Hong Kong sentenced three young pro-democracy activists to six to eight months in prison, making them what some have called the first political prisoners in the former British colony since its return to Chinese rule two decades ago.

On Tuesday, the city’s highest court said it would hear their appeals. All three — Joshua Wong, 21; Alex Chow, 27; and Nathan Law, 24 — are free on bail pending the outcome of the appeal.

For the young men, the sentences are time lost from studies or budding careers, and a black mark on their futures.

But they are also a burden for their parents, who have endured the anguish of seeing their sons taken away in handcuffs. In rare interviews, they shared the heartbreak and pride of watching their children come of age as leaders of a protest movement for free elections .

They also described grappling with disagreements with their children on career choice and political ideology, highlighting the generation gap that has divided Hong Kong in its struggle to define its future as part of China.

‘Repent of His Sin’

Roger Wong has seen his son Joshua Wong arrested at political protests, ejected from countries that feared crossing Beijing and even assaulted by strangers. Once, his son came home with a black eye ; another time, with egg in his hair .

Still, his heart sank on a windless August morning when his son paused at the door to kiss him. That was the day the court sentenced Joshua to six months in prison for unlawful assembly, in connection with his role, at age 17, in leading the 2014 demonstrations later known as the Umbrella Revolution .

“He had not done that since he was a little boy,” said Mr. Wong, 53, a former computer professional who now trades online.

The youngest of the three jailed activists, his son emerged as the international face of the opposition, even being featured in a Netflix documentary, “ Joshua: Teenager vs. Superpower .”

But Mr. Wong said he wakes each day prepared to see headlines blaring more bad news. To avoid the sidelong glances or adulation of strangers, he and his wife, Grace Ng, a homemaker, no longer say their son’s name in public, even when speaking about him with each other.

Mr. Wong, who identifies as a devout Christian, said the worst kind of attention came from fellow believers. “The greatest pressure has come from Christians who out of nowhere offered to pray for my son to ‘repent of his sin,’” he said, adding that such remarks came from friends dear to him.

He said he supports his son’s pro-democracy activism, saying Joshua Wong learned his sense of mission from his religious upbringing.

In fact, Mr. Wong said, his son was once an outspoken Christian, too, but now keeps his religious views out of the public eye. And differences over the role of faith in public policy have become a source of tension between them.

The two clashed over same-sex marriage , which Hong Kong does not allow. His son supports it, but Mr. Wong has organized protests against it and called for removing rainbow-colored lion statues that were erected in Hong Kong in support of LGBT rights.

Even now, the feelings may be a bit raw. Asked about their dispute, Mr. Wong threatened to cut short the interview.

He prefers to talk about another moment. After his son kissed him and his wife goodbye, he apologized. “I am sorry that I put so much pressure on you,” Mr. Wong recalled his son saying.

‘Selfish People Like You’

Helen Ngai had different hopes for her son, Alex Chow. Having helped build a prospering family business, she wanted her children to enjoy a life of comfort and status. She urged Alex Chow, the older of her two sons, to become a university professor.

This fall, he was supposed to go to the University of California, Berkeley, to pursue a doctorate in geography.

Instead, he went to prison.

“I wish my son had not taken this path,” Ms. Ngai, 58, said in an interview in a stylishly furnished apartment in Hong Kong, one of many properties that she and her husband own around the world, including in Queens.

“I’m just a selfish person. All I care about is making money,” she said. “Many in Hong Kong are selfish people. Why do so much for them?”

She said she was puzzled when her son volunteered in high school to counsel underperforming students. She could not understand the guilt that he confessed to her over living in a big apartment. She ridiculed him for considering a job at Greenpeace that would have paid $38,000 per year.

“Is that even enough for food and housing?” she recalled challenging him.

The Umbrella Revolution exposed such generation gaps among Hong Kong’s 7.2 million people. While those under age 40 overwhelmingly supported the protesters, people above that age were more critical, according to a Chinese University survey .

“I always tell my son, we must not oppose the country or the party because, at the end of the day, we are Chinese people,” Ms. Ngai said.

She and her husband are the sort of success story that has helped make Hong Kong one of the world’s wealthiest cities. Their garment business has factories across South Asia. The two travel so often that Ms. Ngai said her son was essentially “raised by maids.”

Ms. Ngai also cashed in on Hong Kong’s supercharged housing market, flipping apartments for profits. This put her at odds with her son, who accused her of driving up rents for working families.

“It’s selfish people like you who are holding back society,” she recalled her son accusing her.

“If I hadn’t, would you have such a big apartment?” Ms. Ngai retorted.

“I would rather live in subsidized housing,” her son replied.

“We never had to worry too much about money,” she said. “That’s why for him it’s all about justice and other people’s misfortunes.”

The first time she visited her son in prison, she cried so hard she could hardly speak. In an attempt to cheer her up, Alex Chow said prison had given him a new cause: advocating better conditions for inmates and prison employees.

“I told him not to meddle in other people’s affairs,” she said, “but he said that what is wrong must be set right.”

‘They Always Go for the Leaders’

On the night when protesters stormed government headquarters, Lam So-lan was across Hong Kong’s picturesque harbor attending a relative’s wedding.

She thought her son, Nathan Law, then 21, was back in his college dormitory.

She was stunned when someone switched on a television, and there he was rallying demonstrators.

“I knew he was in big trouble the moment he picked up the microphone,” said Ms. Lam, who had warned her son against getting involved in politics. “They always go for the leaders.”

Ms. Lam, 55, said she just wanted Mr. Law to focus on his studies. Born poor in China’s southeastern province of Guangdong, she had moved to Hong Kong with her three sons in 1999 in hopes of providing them a better life. She raised them almost entirely as a single mother, living in public housing and working as a janitor and in other jobs to put her sons through school.

She divorced her husband when Mr. Law, the youngest, was still in high school. In an interview, he described his upbringing as “working class.”

Despite that, she said she always tried to give her sons a lot of freedom.

“My only expectations are that he studies, doesn’t do heroin or gamble — the minimum requirements,” she said.

However, she said she objected when she first learned that Mr. Law had become a leader of a pro-democracy group at his university.

“I just wanted stability,” she said.

“If everyone is selfish, society will not change,” she recalled her son responding.

She said she had another reason for feeling dread. Growing up in China, she had seen the political violence of the Cultural Revolution. She feared that challenging power would only bring retribution.

On the first night of the Umbrella Revolution, she said she huddled in a hotel room with relatives, worried sick.

“He’s young. He’s inexperienced. He has not been through the kind of purge that happened on the mainland,” Ms. Lam said.

Now, she said, her fears have been borne out.

“He said, ‘Hong Kong wasn’t like the mainland.’ And I said, ‘You’ll see. I’m worried for you even if you’re not,’” Ms. Lam recalled. “Now it’s all happened.”

Mr. Bean, in an interview on Tuesday, said, “Dick Gordon was the perfect crew member in that he was easy to get along with all the time, and no matter what happened he never got upset, through the ups and downs of training.”

Mr. Gordon’s missions also included two troublesome episodes.

He emerged from the Gemini 11 cabin for a spacewalk that was to last an hour and 47 minutes after a separately launched unmanned space vehicle, the Agena, had docked with it. He was tethered to his Gemini capsule. But he quickly experienced difficulty stabilizing himself while trying to carry out various tasks.

He accomplished some of his scheduled assignments in his first 10 minutes outside the capsule, but the work was so arduous that he was perspiring into his helmet, temporarily losing vision in one eye, and his heart rate soared. He rested outside the Gemini for another half-hour, but had to re-enter it at that point because he was too drained to continue.

“Our understanding of spacewalking was still not good,” Chris Kraft, the director of flight operations for the mission, recalled in his 2001 memoir, “Flight.” “His strength was fading rapidly and his frustrations were growing apace. At one point, I thought he was going to have a panic attack.”

Mr. Gordon later spent more than two hours standing in an open hatch of the Gemini 11 spacecraft taking photographs for analysis by astronomers.

After docking with the Agena and uncoupling several times, Gemini 11 completed a three-day flight with a splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean.

There was trouble anew for Mr. Gordon, and a worrisome moment as well for his two fellow astronauts, all three of them Navy officers, in the first minute of their blastoff in a thunderstorm from Cape Kennedy, Fla., in Apollo 12.

Lightning twice struck the craft, and warning lights flashed on the astronauts’ console, signaling that the electrical and primary guidance systems had been knocked out. Batteries took over, but the systems were restored quickly and the flight continued without further electrical problems.

Mr. Gordon’s fellow astronauts advanced the exploration of the moon with their treks on its surface, the setting up of experiments and the collection of lunar rocks. Apollo 12 concluded a 10-day flight with a splashdown in the Pacific.

Richard Francis Gordon Jr. was born on Oct. 5, 1929, in Seattle, the eldest of five children of Richard Sr., a machinist, and his wife, Angela, an elementary school teacher. He majored in chemistry at the University of Washington and graduated in 1951. He then became a Navy aviator, graduated from flight-test school and was selected as a Gemini astronaut in October 1963.

He had hoped to walk on the moon as the commander of the scheduled Apollo 18 flight, but it was canceled because of budget cuts. He retired from NASA and from the Navy in January 1972 as a captain — and then embarked on an odd career change.

Mr. Gordon’s friend John Mecom Jr., the owner of the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League, hired him as the team’s executive vice president, a post that included handling the duties of general manager, though his previous football experience had consisted only of one season as a high school halfback.

“If anybody has any suggestions on how to run a football team, I’ll be glad to listen,” Mr. Gordon said at his introductory news conference.

Mr. Gordon spent five years with the Saints, during which they continued the losing ways they had endured since entering the league in 1967.

He later held executive posts with companies focusing on technology and energy.

Mr. Gordon’s wife, the former Linda Saunders, died in 2017. His first marriage, to Barbara Field, ended in divorce; she died in 2014. He is survived by five children from his first marriage, Carleen Trevino, Richard, Lawrence, Thomas and Diane Briggs; his sisters Barbara Pethick and Mary Frederick, and his brother, Norman; two stepchildren, Traci and Christopher; and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Alan Bean, one of Mr. Gordon’s fellow Apollo 12 astronauts, devoted much of his life after his NASA career to painting. One of his artworks solidified a bond between Mr. Gordon and his fellow crewmen, notwithstanding his disappointment over never having explored the moon.

He resolved to bring his reality to a wider world.

This was not quickly done. Outsiders are allowed to enter Canyon de Chelly only with a Navajo guide. He consulted with archaeologists and park rangers and with the Navajo families who still harvest corn and melons and cherries and apples in this canyon.

That first year it took two days to sign up 150 runners for the first Canyon de Chelly ultramarathon. Now runners wait at the assigned minute each year and hit the refresh button on the race’s website in hopes of getting in. The race draws runners from across the nation, and Australia, France and England.

To run is to become immersed in Navajo cosmology. “We run east to the first light,” Martin told the runners before they took off. “We yell to clear our passageways and to let the creator hear our prayers.”

All day long shouts echo up that canyon.

By midmorning the sandstone canyon walls turned a translucent pink and red, as if lit from within. The sky was razor blue. Our guide, Don Staley, passed boyhood summers here, herding his grandparents’ sheep. He nodded at seemingly sheer walls and pointed out the half-hidden paths by which he led the sheep down into the canyon.

He met his wife nearby, although he had to make sure she did not belong to the same clans as his father and his mother, as it is forbidden to date and marry so closely. “It’s a Navajo pickup line,” he said. ‘Hey, what‘s your clan?’ ”

We passed runners, some rocking out, others settled into a jog. Higdon, the Navajo college student, and a few other runners encountered a black bear walking up the sand path at them. They stepped into the woods and the bear passed.

There is beauty and terrible history hidden in these canyon walls. In Canyon del Muerto, which fingers off from de Chelly, Spanish soldiers slaughtered 115 Navajo in 1805; in the main canyon, Kit Carson and his soldiers and Ute allies cleared out the Navajo in 1864. “We feel their spirits dancing at night,” Staley said.

Earlier we watched a black and white rez dog — those mutts of many genetic fruits found everywhere in Navajo — follow Christian Gering, a lean, longhaired, world-class runner from the St. Felipe Pueblo, as he flew up the canyon. Gering grinned. “He was my pace dog,” he said. At the halfway point, atop the canyon rim, the dog disappeared.

The swiftest runners averaged a bit more than 8 minutes per mile.

Wolves are known to cooperate in hunting and even in raising one another’s pups, but they can seem pretty intolerant of one another when they are snapping and growling around a kill.

So researchers at the Wolf Science Center at the University of Vienna decided to compare the performance of wolves and dogs on a classic behavioral test.

There are tools that can help. Mr. Campagna organizes projects on Google Drive spreadsheets that he shares with his wife. Smartphone apps like HomeZada and BrightNest can also help you keep tabs on a to-do list that never ends.

Still, you need to know what to do — from the roof down to the basement, and out to the backyard. Here is how to get started.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

CHECK THE EXTERIOR

Start by giving the outside of your house a checkup. Walk around the perimeter and look for cracks in the siding or peeling paint. Are the windowsills in good condition? Check the roof for missing or broken tiles. Fix problems while the days are still relatively warm. After a rainstorm, walk around the house and look for any signs that water might not be draining properly, like pooling water or damaged gutters or downspouts.

“The objective is to get as much of the water away from your house as possible,” said Scott Johnson, the director of operations for WIN Home Inspection, a network of more than 190 home inspection firms in 33 states.

THE GUTTERS

Of all the fall chores, cleaning the gutters and downspouts is among the most critical. Your gutters direct water away from your roof and siding, and down into the drainage system. Clogged gutters can cause your roof to leak and lead to ice dams in cold weather. So clean them or hire someone to do the job after the leaves fall. “When the gutters aren’t kept clean, the moisture just sits on the rooftop,” said Dina Dwyer-Owens, a co-chair of the board of directors of the Dwyer Group, a parent company of home-repair franchises including Mr. Handyman and Mr. Rooter.

Just don’t do the work too soon. Clean the gutters before the last of the leaves fall, and you could find yourself back up on that ladder a few weeks later. “I think I did it a little too early,” said Mr. Campagna of West Orange, N.J., who rushed to clean his gutters before Mrs. Campagna, 30, gave birth to their first child in October. “That was a rookie mistake.” And a wasted Saturday afternoon.

If you plan to do the work yourself, be careful on that ladder. Ladder mishaps sent nearly 176,000 people to the hospital in 2013, according to the National Safety Council. If your ladder has seen better days, consider an upgrade. (These fiberglass models are recommended by Wirecutter, the New York Times’s product review site.)

If you hire a professional, expect to spend around $150 for the job, according to HomeAdvisor.

THE WINDOWS AND DOORS

If you have window air-conditioning units, take them out and store them until next summer. But handle those unwieldy appliances with care to avoid injury.

Or you could leave them in place. Ms. Levy of Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, covers the outside of her window units with an insulated sheath and wedges towels between the sill and the unit to keep drafts out.

Next, swap out screens for storm doors and windows. “It’s something that we automatically do when it starts getting cold out,” Ms. Levy said. While you’re changing out the screens for glass, check your windows and doors for drafts. Add weather stripping or caulk wherever cold air seeps in.

SMOKE ALARMS

Three out of five home-fire deaths happen in properties without working smoke alarms, according to the United States Fire Administration. So make sure yours work. Change the batteries in all your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors once a year; the day you set the clocks back is a good one to do it.

Check the manufacturing date, too, and replace any detectors that are more than 10 years old. Any reliable model will do, but if you’re interested in one that will alert you to problems when you’re away, a smart smoke alarm like the Nest Protect is sensitive to slow- and fast-burning fires, and has apps that will alert you anywhere in the world if something’s amiss.

Laundry dryers cause 2,900 home fires a year nationally and failing to clean them is the leading culprit, according to the United States Fire Administration. So call a professional once a year to service your dryer vent and help remove lint, debris and other hazards that could spark a fire.

THE CHIMNEY

Heat, smoke and dangerous gases from your fireplace and heating system travel up your chimney and out of your house, keeping the air inside breathable. A dirty chimney could affect air quality and also pose a fire hazard.

So keep your chimney clean. The Chimney Safety Institute of America recommends having it inspected annually and cleaned as needed. “In general, with chimneys and fireplaces, the more you use it, the more likely you need it to be swept,” said Mr. Johnson, of WIN Home Inspection. Expect to spend between $125 and $200 on a chimney sweep, according to Angie’s List.

THE HEATING SYSTEM

If you were going on a long road trip, you would get your car tuned up before you started your journey, not afterward. The same goes for your heating system. Call a plumber or a furnace repair company to prepare your boiler or furnace for winter before the cold weather arrives.

Your contractor should clean the equipment, make sure it is working properly and let you know if it needs any repairs. “The heating system ain’t going to break down when it’s 80 degrees out,” said Kerry O’Brien, the president of T.F. O’Brien Cooling and Heating in New Hyde Park, N.Y. “You don’t want to be stuck when it’s five degrees in the middle of the night” with a heating system that won’t turn on.

THE PIPES

No one wants a frozen pipe, so keep an eye on yours. Drain the outside water faucets and shut them off before the first freeze. On very cold nights, open cabinets beneath the sink to let warm air in and, if you are especially worried about freezing pipes, let a slow drip of water run through them. Resist the urge to turn down the thermostat to save money – you want to keep the pipes warm. Extreme weather “is not a time to start trying to save on your energy bill,” Mr. O’Brien said. “Crank your heat up during those weeks.”

PUT THE GARDEN TO BED

By November, you may not be thinking much about your hydrangeas, but they still need you. Prune your shrubs and hedges now. Cut foliage away from the house so that ice or snow on the branches won’t damage your siding or let water into your home.

But use restraint, so as not to cut off next spring’s bloom. “Try to contain yourself. Cut back half of what you want to cut back,” said Jan Johnsen, a landscape designer in Mount Kisco, N.Y.

If you have trees on your property, the battle of the leaves may feel endless, but ignore the pile on your lawn and it could mold and suffocate your grass. But before you succumb to the mighty leaf blower and start blasting away, consider a more measured approach. Rake up most of the leaves and use them as mulch for your flower beds. Mow the rest in place with your lawn mower. By mowing over the leaves, you help break them down so they can decompose and feed the grass. All that foliage “is not garbage, it’s black gold,” Ms. Johnsen said. “There’s a reason the leaves fall to the earth.”

THE PATIO

Empty ceramic pots of soil and store them in your garage or basement for the winter so they do not crack in freezing temperatures. Drain the hoses and store them, too. Shut down the sprinkler system and call the pool maintenance company to close up your pool, if you have one. But wait for a crisp sunny to day to cover patio furniture — you don’t want to trap any moisture under the tarp.

STOCK UP ON FIREWOOD

If you plan to build a fire this winter, order seasoned firewood in the fall. Stack it loosely on pallets to keep moisture at bay. Cover the pile with a plastic tarp. You can store wood in an unheated garage, but do not store more than a week’s supply in the house, as the wood could attract insects, according to Michigan State University Extension.

BRACE FOR WINTER WEATHER

If you have a snowblower, check it. You may need to have it serviced, and many local repair companies will pick up and drop off a blower as part of the service. “Start it up, run it for a couple of minutes and make sure it’s O.K.,” said Rich Janow, 74, who has lived in a six-bedroom house in South Orange, N.J., for 32 years with his wife, Nancy Chiller Janow, 64. “Do it now so that if you have a problem and you need the repair people to fix it, you have enough time before the really bad weather sets in.”

If you don’t have a snowblower, now is the best time to buy one, when it’s early in the season. (Wirecutter has some suggestions.)

If you have a portable generator, check that, too. If you don’t have one, now is a good time to consider investing in one. Update your emergency supply kit with flashlights, fresh batteries, a first-aid kit, food, water and a portable radio.

Stock up on Snow Melt and make sure your shovels are in good condition before the weatherman tells you snow is imminent. Make sure the supplies are accessible (and you remember where you put them) before the snow starts falling. Otherwise, you may find yourself digging your way to that shovel.

If the winter is a snowy one, use a roof rake to remove excess snow from your roof, and stay on the lookout for ice dams, accumulations of ice and snow along your eaves that could damage your gutters, roof and siding.

STAY ON TRACK

Learn how your house works and you may find that maintenance is something you actually – gasp — enjoy. “For me, it’s been such a great love affair,” said Judy E. Mendoza, 69, a saleswoman for Halstead who has lived in a three-bedroom house in East Hampton for 27 years and starts preparing for winter in July. “I’ve enjoyed taking care of the house, and the house has taken care of me.”

Tim Sini, the Democratic police commissioner in Suffolk County, scored a resounding victory in the race for district attorney there on Tuesday, convincing voters that he would clean up the corruption engulfing the county’s law enforcement agency.

It was only three weeks ago that the sitting district attorney, Thomas J. Spota, a Democrat, was indicted on charges of witness tampering and obstructing a federal investigation. Mr. Sini managed to distance himself from his fellow Democrat and convey his success in ridding the county’s police department of similar corruption.

“Together we have ushered in a new era of criminal justice in Suffolk County, an era of integrity, fairness and doing the right thing,” Mr. Sini said in a victory speech just before 11 p.m. “We are going to return the office to the honorable institution that it once was.”

Mr. Sini received 62 percent of the vote, with 92 percent of electronic ballot scanners counted. In defeating his Republican opponent, Ray Perini, a veteran defense lawyer and former prosecutor, Mr. Sini overcame the political math in a county that had voted for President Trump. Last November, Mr. Trump received 50,000 more votes in Suffolk County than did his opponent, Hillary Clinton — an eight-point margin in a county that had voted for Barack Obama in both of his presidential elections.

In a phone interview, Mr. Perini said that he was disappointed by the results. Unable to resist a final jab at his opponent, he said he hoped that Mr. Sini was “up to the task.”

Even before the indictments, which also ensnared Mr. Spota’s key anticorruption prosecutor, the race in Suffolk County had focused on ethics — along with the violent MS-13 gang and the opioid epidemic.

It was an open secret that federal prosecutors were investigating Mr. Spota’s office for its role in a possible cover-up in the beating of a suspect by the county’s former police chief, James Burke. A protégé of Mr. Spota, he is now serving a 46-month prison sentence for assaulting the suspect.

Mr. Perini, 70, and Mr. Sini, 37, had presented themselves as the best candidate to clean up an agency they said was marred by allegiances to Mr. Spota. A former assistant prosecutor with the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, Mr. Sini became commissioner of the county police department, one of the largest in the nation, shortly after Mr. Burke’s downfall.

During the campaign, Mr. Sini pointed to a number of changes he had instituted in the department, including strengthening the internal affairs bureau to weed out corrupt officers. And he promoted his work in fighting MS-13, which has recruited and terrorized young people across Long Island.

Mr. Sini highlighted his record of solving murders by MS-13 and sending its members to prison. The county police agency has made more than 300 arrests of MS-13 members, he said, and solved the most gruesome killings committed by MS-13 in the past two years — the murder of two teenage girls in September 2016 in Brentwood, and the quadruple murder of four young men in the woods here at the hands of a machete-armed gang.

But Mr. Perini countered that his own experience as a defense lawyer had given him a unique perspective on both MS-13 and the drug dealers who traffic in opioids. He also said he would draw on his 17 years of experience as a prosecutor, both in Brooklyn and Suffolk County (where he was head of the narcotics unit), in targeting criminals.

Specifically, he said he would make liberal use of the so-called kingpin statute, in which those making more than $75,000 from selling certain drugs in a six-month period face up to 25 years to life in prison upon conviction. “The heroin kingpins have to know that we are not plea-bargaining,” Mr. Perini said during the campaign.

For all their differences, both candidates sounded similar themes during the campaign, from the strategies they would use to tackle MS-13 to their desire to work with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies.

In his victory speech, Mr. Sini said the district attorney’s office would be “particularly focused on eradicating MS-13 and other violent street gangs” from the county. He vowed to pursue a multifaceted approach, including prevention and treatment, as well as “targeting drug dealers and treating them like murderers, as they should be.”

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at the Leica store in New York. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

Over that period, his work became more political — as in the 1982 photo of four black nannies pushing white toddlers in strollers. But there is also a crazy, funny beauty too, which is no accident.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

There are Soviet agents and Trotskyist agitators, a cross-dressing jazz singer, an Armenian mafia boss and a rich industrialist in cahoots with a group of army officers.

The star of the show, however, is Berlin. The lavish production lovingly recreates the city’s 1920s streets, cafes and nightclubs. Around 70 percent of the series was shot on location, with the rest filmed on a massive set at the historic Babelsberg studios.

Costing 38 million euros (about $44 million) to produce, the 180-day shoot involved three crews and three writer/directors: Tom Tykwer (of “Perfume” and “Run Lola Run” fame), Achim von Borries and Henk Handloegten, who had all long sought to work together on a project based on this period.

“The three of us had the idea to do a big panoramic view of the society at the end of the 1920s, the Weimar Republic, before we actually knew the novels,” Mr. Handloegten said.

Paul Cooke, professor of world cinemas at the University of Leeds, said TV depictions of this period have been rare. “Most obviously, Fassbinder’s ‘Berlin Alexanderplatz,’ which was a big hit in the 1970s,” he said. “It’s touched on in Edgar Reitz’s ‘Heimat,’ which was a huge international hit. But it’s later periods of history that tend to be the focus of German productions that do well internationally.”

The makers of “Babylon Berlin,” however, were interested in exploring the prelude to the Third Reich. “All these people didn’t fall from the sky as Nazis,” Mr. Handloegten said. “They had to become Nazis.”

In writing the screenplay, the creators made some key changes to the books. As well as expanding the political elements, they turned Gereon Rath into a more sympathetic character, traumatized by his experiences in World War I, prone to fits of shaking and addicted to morphine.

Charlotte Ritter is no longer a bourgeois law student but a street-smart working-class woman. “We felt very strongly that we should have a main character from this proletarian background, because Berlin was always a poor city,” Mr. Handloegten explained.

Work has already begun on Season 3, and there’s plenty more source material to draw on. Mr. Kutscher has already written six Gereon Rath novels and plans another three, culminating with Kristallnacht in 1938.

The TV adaptation is already a commercial and critical hit at home. Within a week of its German premiere on Oct. 13, the first episode had been watched by 1.2 million people — a German viewing figure bested only by “Game of Thrones.”

“The show is epic, the story is complex,” the Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel wrote. “The TV version gives the material what it requires while never taking away the striking images, ambiguous characters and exciting story: everything needed to suck you in.”

The weekly magazine Der Spiegel described the show as a “masterpiece” and a “great, dizzying panorama,” and predicted that it could be “the first big German TV production since ‘Das Boot’ to have really relevant success abroad.”

The praise, however, has not been universal. The Munich-based daily Süddeutsche Zeitung said: “The period it depicts may have been sensuous, but the show is not. The world of ‘Babylon Berlin’ remains behind glass.”

In Britain, the reception has been positive so far. “It’s all wonderfully gripping, and Bruch has the most pained, expressive eyes you’ll see all year,” the critic for The Financial Times wrote. “With the arrival of Charlotte … drab secretary by day, jazz baby by night, we enter the youthful Berlin of dance crazes and desperate excess.”

Some critics have also drawn parallels to current political events, like the American election of Donald J. Trump, the Brexit vote, and the arrival of the far-right Alternative for Germany in the Bundestag.

“The echoes of the ‘populism’ of the 1930s with what is going on right now is certainly a link that is being made,” Professor Cooke said. “How far this is played out in the show itself remains to be seen. But it is fair to say that these kinds of historical dramas always tend to use the past as a cipher for the present.”

But Hajo Funke, professor of political science at the Free University Berlin, cautions against making too many comparisons. “Economically, socially and politically, it was a totally different situation,” he said.

“In 1929, there was a brief phase of stability after the terrible shock at the end of World War I, the inflation crisis, the economic restrictions,” Professor Funke added. “It was not at all clear if it would be possible to overcome the next crisis.”

At the same time, he agrees that the show taps into the current mood. “It could serve to point to the dangers, to the destructive forces in society and politics,” he said.

For the makers of “Babylon Berlin,” it was crucial that the audience experience the past through the eyes of the protagonists.

In the first season, for example, Hitler is only mentioned once in passing. After all, Berlin was a left-wing bastion, and in the 1928 election, the Nazis got only 1.6 percent of the city’s votes.

“In 1929, there were no Nazis in Berlin,” said the producer Stefan Arndt. “You cannot see or even smell that there’s danger coming.”","Sex, Drugs and Crime in the Gritty Drama ‘Babylon Berlin’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/arts/television/sex-drugs-and-crime-in-the-gritty-drama-babylon-berlin.html

It also doesn’t hurt that, by virtue of his speedy ascension to All-N.B.A. status and contention for other top individual honors, Antetokounmpo is on a course to be eligible for a so-called “supermax” contract extension from the Bucks via the league’s new Designated Player Exception during the 2020 off-season, which would put him in line for a new deal well in excess of $200 million.

As he tweeted in July, to the presumed glee of every Milwaukeean, “I got loyalty inside my DNA.”

An Unexpected Loss

The connective tissue that links this star, team and city runs as dense as you’ll find on the N.B.A. map, perhaps surpassed only by Nowitzki’s two decades’ worth of roots in Dallas or maybe the deep bonds shared in San Antonio by Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. Milwaukee hasn’t simply been the backdrop for Antetokounmpo’s fairy tale rise to American stardom; it has been home for virtually his whole family for all but the first few months of his N.B.A. life.

Antetokounmpo admits, furthermore, that the unexpected death of his father just over a month ago has him leaning on his adopted hometown more than ever. Charles Antetokounmpo died of a heart attack on Sept. 29 at age 54.

“I can feel the love from the city every day I step on the floor,” Giannis Antetokounmpo said. “For me, what I’m going through now, I appreciate it even more.”

Charles and Veronica Antetokounmpo, who moved from Nigeria to Greece as undocumented immigrants in 1991 in search of a better life, secured the necessary paperwork to relocate to Milwaukee along with Giannis’s two younger brothers halfway through his rookie season. Kostas Antetokounmpo is a redshirt freshman at the University of Dayton now, but the rest of the family moved into a new downtown complex before this season, with Giannis and Alexandros Antetokounmpo (a high school sophomore) housed on the fifth floor and Charles and Veronica on the fourth.

After years of well-chronicled struggle for the family in a northern section of Athens known as Sepolia, they have found Milwaukee as idyllic as it was portrayed to be in the sitcom “Happy Days,” where not even the frigid winters can detract from the comfort they’ve experienced as a unit.

Only now, as they confront Charles’s death, even more responsibility has been heaped on the ever-widening shoulders of the Bucks’ phenom. Veronica Antetokounmpo, meanwhile, has moved up a flight to be with her sons on the fifth floor in the wake of her husband’s death.

“Leading your family is a lot tougher than basketball,” Antetokounmpo said. “Especially right now. But I’ve got to be strong for my family.

“Things,” he continued, “are going to get better.”

Places to Improve

The areas for on-court improvement are obvious for Antetokounmpo even as he stuffs box score after box score. His outside shot still needs copious amounts of work — he is not close to trusting it in times of need — and there is room for growth in reading the game at both ends, consistently making his teammates better and refining his decision-making.

Yet it’s also ridiculous, and rather cold, to nitpick what is missing from Antetokounmpo’s blossoming game given the level he is consistently hitting with that 7-foot-3 wingspan of his. Doubly so at a time of profound grief.

“He’s like a plane that just started taking off,” Kidd said. “He’s at 10,000 feet.”

When he arrived in Wisconsin, via the 15th overall pick in the 2013 N.B.A. draft, Antetokounmpo was measured at 6 feet 9 inches and weighed less than 200 pounds. A half-decade later, he is closing in on 240 pounds, and coaches and teammates routinely refer to him as a 7-footer.

The Milwaukee assistant coach Frank Johnson, noting Antetokounmpo’s bulked-up body and added strength, said, “He gets bumped now and he loves it.”

As for his perimeter game, Johnson preaches patience, pointing to the countless nights of extra shooting he is getting alongside the mentoring “Coach Sweeney” — the Bucks assistant coach Sean Sweeney. The way Johnson talks about the work-in-progress jumper is reminiscent of what league observers said for years about Shaquille O’Neal’s persistent free-throw woes.

“If he had that already,” Johnson said, “it wouldn’t be fair.”

Terry, the Bucks guard, said: “Of course he has to keep working on his outside game. But Giannis just has a peaceful confidence about himself. You can see it. Last year, he didn’t have that.”

The legendary Kobe Bryant, now in his second season of retirement, had seen enough coming into training camp to challenge Antetokounmpo via Twitter in late August to make a bid for the league’s Most Valuable Player Award.

Asked why he set such a high target, as part of his #MambaMentality campaign, Bryant said last week via email that he was moved by Antetokounmpo’s “rare physical gifts that are matched by a rare inner passion.”",The Unspeakable Greatness of Giannis Antetokounmpo,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/sports/basketball/giannis-milwaukee-bucks.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“I wish him nothing but the best success,” Mr. Gillespie said.
A native of Virginia’s rural Eastern Shore, Mr. Northam, 58, was perhaps an unlikely vessel for the resistance-era Democratic Party.
In his concession speech, Mr. Gillespie made no mention of Mr. Trump, and declined to answer questions about the president’s criticism on Tuesday night.
But Virginia Democrats were in little mood to offer any olive branches to Mr. Trump on Tuesday.","“Virginia has told us to end the divisiveness, that we will not condone hatred and bigotry — and to end the politics that have torn this country apart,” he said, adding that in this state, “It’s going to take a doctor to heal our differences.”

The Democrats’ electoral validation, though, took place well beyond the Virginia governor’s race: They wrested the governorship of New Jersey away from Republicans, swept two other statewide offices in Virginia, made gains in the Virginia State Legislature, and won a contested mayoral race in New Hampshire.

In New Jersey, Philip D. Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive, won the governorship, according to The Associated Press, by a vast margin that brought an unceremonious end to Gov. Chris Christie’s tumultuous tenure.

In both Virginia and New Jersey, voters rebuffed a wave of provocative ads linking immigration and crime, hinting at the limitations of hard-edge tactics in the sort of affluent and heavily suburban states that are pivotal in next year’s midterm elections.

Even though Republicans in the two states mirrored Mr. Trump’s grievance-oriented politics, they kept him at arm’s length: He became the first president not to appear on behalf of candidates for governor in either state since 2001, when George W. Bush shunned the trail after the Sept. 11 attacks.

Since then, four of the five governors Virginia has elected have been Democrats. The party was also in contention late Tuesday to seize control of the state House of Delegates, an unexpected show of strength that, along with Mr. Northam’s victory, offered Democrats a stronger hand to block any Republican attempts at gerrymandering after the next census.

Representative Scott Taylor, a Republican from Virginia Beach, said he considered the Democratic sweep in Virginia a repudiation of the White House. He faulted Mr. Trump’s “divisive rhetoric” for propelling the party to defeat, and said he believed traditionally Republican-leaning voters contributed to Mr. Northam’s margin of victory.

“I do believe that this is a referendum on this administration,” Mr. Taylor said of the elections. “Democrats turned out tonight, but I’m pretty sure there were some Republicans who spoke loudly and clearly tonight as well.”

Channeling the shock of Republicans across the state, Mr. Taylor voiced disbelief at the party’s rout down ballot. “I know folks that lost tonight who were going against candidates I’d never even heard of,” he said.

Mr. Trump was quick to fault Mr. Gillespie for keeping his distance, writing on Twitter while traveling in South Korea that the Republican candidate “did not embrace me or what I stand for.”

Mr. Gillespie made no mention of Mr. Trump in his concession speech, and alluded only in passing to the explosive themes he wielded as a candidate. Ticking off issues he campaigned on, Mr. Gillespie noted his supporters were worried about “safety for themselves and their families and their businesses.”

Addressing supporters in a hotel ballroom, Mr. Gillespie tried to tack a courteous finale on to a rough-and-tumble race, offering his assistance to Mr. Northam going forward. “I wish him nothing but the best success,” Mr. Gillespie said.

Mr. Northam’s victory was a tonic to an anxious national party that has been reeling since Mr. Trump’s win last year and was demoralized by losses in special House elections in Montana and Georgia.

A native of Virginia’s rural Eastern Shore, Mr. Northam, 58, was perhaps an unlikely vessel for the resistance-era Democratic Party. But the left overlooked the two votes he cast for George W. Bush before he entered politics, and his résumé — he is a pediatric neurologist and Gulf War veteran — proved far more appealing to the state’s broad middle than Mr. Gillespie’s background as a corporate lobbyist.

The Democrats’ success here came as Mr. Gillespie, trailing in the polls, turned to a scorched-earth campaign against Mr. Northam in the race’s final weeks. Mr. Gillespie, a fixture of his party’s establishment who had once warned against the “siren song” of anti-immigrant politics, unleashed a multimillion-dollar onslaught linking his rival to a gang with Central American ties and a convicted pedophile who had his rights restored, while also assailing Mr. Northam for wanting to remove Virginia’s Confederate statues.

The strategy appeared to help Mr. Gillespie narrow the gap in the wake of the Charlottesville protests this summer, but it was not enough to overcome the anti-Trump energy in an increasingly diverse state that has not elected a Republican to statewide office since 2009.

Mr. Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman, found it difficult to balance appeals to the president’s unflagging supporters in rural Virginia while simultaneously attempting to win over Mr. Trump’s skeptics in the state’s population centers. He often would not say the president’s name, referring instead to “the administration” or last year’s Republican “ticket.”

In his concession speech, Mr. Gillespie made no mention of Mr. Trump, and declined to answer questions about the president’s criticism on Tuesday night.

Mr. Northam did not have to concern himself with any such political contortions running in a state that has backed the Democratic nominee for president in the last three elections, a striking reversal from an earlier day here when Virginia Democrats had to distinguish themselves from their more liberal national party.

Indeed, support for Mr. Northam represented a vote for continuity. Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat barred by state law from seeking re-election, is broadly popular, as are the state’s two Democratic senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner. Mr. McAuliffe, who was elected in 2013 during President Barack Obama’s second term, was the first person in 40 years to win a Virginia governor’s race who was in the same party as the president’s.

In New Jersey, the Democratic ticket established a decisive advantage early in the campaign season, and that lead never flagged. Mr. Murphy, a wealthy Democratic donor who served as ambassador to Germany under Mr. Obama, ran on a message of rejecting both Mr. Trump and Mr. Christie, who is a politically toxic figure in the state.

National Republicans virtually ignored the race, viewing their nominee, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, as doomed by a deeply hostile political environment and her association with Mr. Christie. In Utah’s Third Congressional District, John Curtis, the Republican nominee, emerged as the winner Tuesday night, according to The Associated Press.

After blanketing Virginia’s airwaves before the primary with an ad in which he savaged the president as “a narcissistic maniac,” Mr. Northam struck a more sober-minded tone during the general election with another widely aired commercial in which he vowed to “work with” Mr. Trump when it is in the state’s interest.

But Virginia Democrats were in little mood to offer any olive branches to Mr. Trump on Tuesday.

Mr. Kaine, who a year ago was left achingly short of becoming vice president, was especially triumphant in speaking to supporters.

Chinese and American officials offered a taste on Wednesday, when they disclosed a series of deals they valued at $9 billion ahead of an event planned for Thursday with the two presidents. One, the sale of 50 Bell helicopters to a Chinese buyer, represented the kind of industrial export that Mr. Trump called for during his campaign. But several others were food sales that might do little to strengthen the United States’ industrial base. Many of the details were not disclosed.

The lack of progress on trade issues has led to grumbling among business types.

Several financial firms were interested in joining the trip to discuss Chinese restrictions on bank ownership, but they decided to pull back when they learned that the Trump administration was focused on making deals rather than pushing for structural reform, said an industry source who is familiar with the negotiations, who declined to be identified while discussing internal deliberations.

Trump administration officials say there was more preparation on trade issues than meets the eye for the current trip, and they add that they have been laying the groundwork to do more in the coming months. These efforts include an investigation into Chinese infringement of American intellectual property, which could lead the administration to impose tariffs or other significant limits on Chinese goods. They also include an effort to tighten restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States, complemented by congressional legislation that is expected to be introduced soon. There are also investigations into limiting imports of solar panels, steel, aluminum foil and other goods mainly from China that the administration contends are subsidized by the Chinese government.

Those efforts have been proceeding slowly. As a result, the preparatory work for the summit meeting has been led by Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross, whose agency focuses more on corporate transactions.

Some companies declined to join the trip, afraid of provoking reprisals by the Chinese government or of being perceived as too close to the Trump administration and its controversies. But more than two dozen were planning to attend, including smaller firms like Stine Seed, the solar project developer SolarReserve and the wastewater treatment company Drylet.

Critics say these commercial deals will do little to address the bigger economic imbalances between the countries.

“There are a lot of deals in the works,” David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said at a conference in Washington on Oct. 31. “They do not reflect a change in policy.”

China has nonetheless been considering opening some narrowly targeted sectors to greater international competition. Beijing ministries have particularly looked at whether to allow greater investment in Chinese service industries. In a briefing on Oct. 31, a senior administration official said improving trade competitiveness in services would be one of the White House’s top priorities for the trip. Chinese officials said they were open to that.

“Our manufacturing industries opened up relatively early with relatively wide areas,” said Gao Feng, a Commerce Ministry spokesman. “In contrast, service industries opened up relatively late. We need to expand the opening up of services while we deepen the opening up of manufacturing.”

More American investment in the Chinese service sectors may not do much to help the heavily blue-collar workers in Rust Belt states who helped propel Mr. Trump to the presidency a year ago. These workers have absorbed the brunt of job losses from Chinese competition and technological change.

One service sector that may be ripe for opening is banking. China has begun reviewing how it has hamstrung foreign banks with a long list of regulations that limit the services they can offer and cap their ownership stakes in Chinese banks. Those rules have left foreign banks with a combined market share of just 1.5 percent of the Chinese banking system’s assets.

Guo Shuqing, the chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, said during a news conference on the sidelines of the recent Communist Party congress that he saw room for changes. “We will further open up and give more space to foreign banks in the types of establishments, the credentials of stakeholders, the percentage of stakes they hold, and the range of businesses,” he said.

China has already made it a little easier for international asset managers to operate investment funds in China and allowed big institutions like Citibank to establish toeholds in China’s bond market by granting them narrowly defined trading licenses.

But a separate issue has cropped up this year: China’s ever-tightening cybersecurity rules. These regulations have dimmed considerably the American banking sector’s enthusiasm to start making large investments in China, particularly in commercial banking.

China has issued new rules — although they have been paused because of bitter complaints from bankers — that would require banks to buy most of the telecommunications equipment they use in China from Chinese suppliers and to store their Chinese data in China.

“It’s still very much on the minds of our bankers,” said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. “That is not something they are eager to do.”",Trump’s Visit to China: More Business Deals Than Trade Pacts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/business/trump-china-trade.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

He takes over a state where many are disillusioned and angry at the way the outgoing Republican governor, Chris Christie, has left New Jersey, riddled with debt, schools bereft of funding, exorbitant property taxes and a dismal public transit system.

Politically inexperienced (his only other foray into elected office was a failed attempt at a seat on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange) and irrepressibly social (his tenure as the American ambassador to Germany was chronicled as much by the local tabloids as by Foreign Policy magazine), Mr. Murphy was able to take himself from banking executive to the doorstep of Drumthwacket, as the governor’s mansion is called, thanks in part to a family finely attuned to Democratic politics.

Mr. Murphy, 60, grew up in a modest Irish home in Newton, Mass., raised on Catholic values of social justice that were reinforced with trips to church every Sunday. Part of a family of four, he occasionally had to share a bedroom, and he got his first job washing dishes when he was 13. His family revered the Kennedys — any speech by John F. Kennedy or Robert F. Kennedy was cause to huddle around the television.

Though he never ran for student government in grade school or high school, politics were a constant in his early life, from dinner table discussions to time spent with his grandfather — “Honest John” — the chairman of the Newton Board of Assessors.

“I think there’s a continual thread of progressive Democratic principles that the family always stood by,” his sister, Dorothy Murphy Egan, 70, recalled. “I think that’s the absolute truth.”

Mr. Murphy’s father never graduated from high school, and throughout his childhood his mother stressed the need for a good education. Despite his family’s love of politics, Mr. Murphy felt a stronger pull toward the stage during college. At Harvard, he quickly rose to become president of the Hasty Pudding Club, a famed theatrical club where he shared sketches and dance numbers with two future politicians, Charlie Baker, the current Republican governor of Massachusetts, and Deval Patrick, a former Democratic governor.

His love for showmanship would blend into his professional life — from performing karaoke with Goldman Sachs colleagues to singing “Touch Me’’ by The Doors at a recent campaign rally — but rather than pursue a career in theater, Mr. Murphy opted for the more lucrative world of finance, where he amassed a personal fortune during a more than 20-year career at Goldman Sachs.

It was during his time at Goldman that he met his wife, Tammy. They had known each other through shared social circles for years. But after a whirlwind first date in London, they were engaged just 18 days later. They now have four children, three boys and one girl, and live in a $9.5 million home in Red Bank, near the Jersey Shore.

After stints as head of Goldman Sachs Germany and Goldman Sachs Asia that were considered largely successful, Mr. Murphy moved with his wife to New Jersey in 2000. They immediately took an interest in the local political scene, nurturing and financially supporting candidates who aligned with their center-left positions, leading them to a rising political star in Essex County: Cory Booker.

“It was sometime in 2002 where he really just came to my aid,” Mr. Booker said in an interview. Mr. Booker had just lost his upstart bid to unseat the mayor of Newark, Sharp James, a powerful incumbent hampered by controversy, and the defeat, combined with a documentary that was made about the rough-and-tumble race, led him to question whether politics was for him. He spent time at the Murphys’ home, licking his wounds while they tried to buoy his spirits.

“He was one of those guys who just really encouraged me at that time to just not give up,” Mr. Booker said.

Donald Trump remains the most powerful person in the country, if not the world. But the election results show that he also remains the weakest first-year president in modern history.

In The Times. Frank Bruni and the editorial board offered their takes.

Elsewhere. “Enthusiasm matters,” writes The Atlantic’s Ronald Brownstein, noting that Ralph Northam, Virginia’s governor-elect, earned about 330,000 more votes than his predecessor had in 2013.

It wasn’t just that Democrats won up and down the ticket but which Democrats won, notes Time’s Charlotte Alter. “A trans woman beat the guy who introduced the bathroom bill. A gun victim’s boyfriend beat a delegate with an ‘A’ grade from the NRA. A civil rights lawyer who sued the police department just became the top prosecutor in Philadelphia,” she tweeted.

White, rural areas of Virginia largely backed Ed Gillespie, the Republican, but were swamped by suburban and urban turnout for Northam. “The data out of SW VA suggest maybe you can turn your campaign into a McTrump franchise,” noted the pollster Kristen Anderson, “but that’s of limited value in a state Trump lost.”

Mr. Buys would book our theoretical big-spender on a private helicopter tour of Cape Town and some of the city’s grandest neighborhoods and seemingly endless coastline. A mere 6,450 rand will get you on the Three Bays Tour, a helicopter ride with unhindered panoramas of the city, some of its vineyards and imposing Table Mountain.

The tour starts by curving around Green Point, home to Cape Town Stadium, and then following the west side of the Atlantic seaboard to Camps Bay. Passing the Twelve Apostles (the mountains, as well as the hotel), our guest would swing up into Hout Bay before cutting over to Muizenberg, a beach community on False Bay, and pass Constantia, a suburb known for its wine production and wealthy residents (including, at one point, Charles Spencer, Princess Diana’s brother), on their way home.

I also wanted a survey of Cape Town’s natural wonders. Instead of booking a chopper, I tackled two of the city’s most recognizable natural monuments: Lion’s Head and Table Mountain. The first spot, so named because of its head-shaped outcropping, which gazes out majestically over the city, isn’t nearly as tough to conquer as its name might imply.

The hike, which takes around two hours round trip, is easy for the first two-thirds and moderate near the end, when the climb becomes distinctly more vertical. All the same, it is a good warm-up for the day for those who are in moderately decent shape — I saw people of all ages and sizes making their way up and down the 2,195-foot mountain.

Table Mountain is a different story. It is a longer and tougher hike, but you can still conquer it and Lion’s Head and be back in the city before lunchtime — provided you cheat a little and take the cable car. After descending Lion’s Head, it was just a five-minute Uber ride over to the Table Mountain cable car station. A round-trip ticket on the aerial tram, is just 290 rand and a fun ride that gives a great vantage point on the city. Once at the top, I particularly appreciated the beautiful view of Lion’s Head — the top of which I had just come from. Outside of the week or two the tram closes in the (austral) winter for maintenance, the back-to-back ascent of Lion’s Head and Table Mountain can be accomplished any time of day, morning or afternoon.

They like to keep you guessing at Chefs Warehouse, the Liam Tomlin restaurant that constantly revamps its menu — you could go multiple days in a row and not have the same meal twice. The diversity has made the restaurant a favorite in the Mother City, and even nabbed it a mention in the Discovery Series category on the World’s 50 Best Restaurants website.

Influences on the 8-dish tapas menu will vary wildly, from China to the Middle East to India and back again. Diners might be served lamb kofta with marinated eggplant and yogurt alongside fried squid with caramelized pineapple and sriracha dressing one night, charred cauliflower risotto and duck pot stickers the next. Dinner for two runs 700 rand, not including drinks.

After (sort of) climbing two mountains I had worked up a considerable appetite. Having already explored the popular, Saturdays-only Neighbourgoods Market in Woodstock, I made my way to the newer Mojo Market, a food- and clothing-focused indoor hall in Sea Point with dozens of stalls offering everything from burgers and beer to denim and jewelry. Roughly six months old, the market had plenty of cheap lunch offerings.

I ultimately opted for a soup and sandwich at Raclette, a stall that lured me over with the tempting smell of grilled cheese. The sandwich, Klein River Gruberg and Schärdinger cheeses between two slices of sourdough rye, was outstanding, and came with a decent cup of minestrone-like vegetable soup (75 rand for both). While I waited, I picked up a local Alpha dry cider from Jo’s Bar (35 rand) and listened to a couple songs from Paige Mac, a woman with an impressive, emotive voice and equally good guitar skills.

In the afternoon, Mr. Buys proposes booking our well-to-do guest on a tour of one the region’s greatest claims to fame: its wineries and vineyards. A leisurely tour with stops in Stellenbosch, Franschhoek, and Paarl can be tailored to the tastes of the guest, and may include visits to Haute Cabrière, located on a farm founded in the late 17th century by Huguenot Pierre Jourdan, or Fairview Wine Estate, which places a focus on environmental sustainability and ethical treatment of farmworkers. The series of wine and cheese pairings at different vineyards costs, including guide and transportation, about 4,200 rand, or $300.

I was slightly apprehensive about leaving the manicured bubble of central Cape Town for the township of Khayelitsha, but I’m glad I did. I booked the trip, which revolved around a few hours with Boxgirls South Africa, a nonprofit that provides basic self-defense training, support and education for young girls in the township, one of the most violent neighborhoods in Cape Town, as an Airbnb experience for $29 (The price is currently $26). It was one of the more enlightening and inspiring things I did in the country, and provided real insight into how most nonwhite South Africans live.

The trip, which did not include transportation to the township (I car-pooled with another participant and we each paid about 260 rand) was uneven at times: Our host, Nwabisa, had little experience leading tours and occasionally seemed at a loss for what to do next. Nevertheless, walking around the neighborhood and getting to know the organization and its mission was elucidating. The tour, which lasted from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., included a filling lunch of chicken, veggies and pap, a local maize porridge.

After a long day of sightseeing, Mr. Buys recommended dinner at Azure Restaurant, located in the Twelve Apostles hotel, with pristine ocean views. The tasting menu from the chef Christo Pretorius, at 735 rand, may include a chicken and ham terrine with pickled shimeji mushrooms, a hen’s egg with smoked hake, fish velouté, cured lemon peel, and bacon, followed by springbok (antelope) loin with venison osso bucco. Vegetarians and vegans can be accommodated.

I had my own feast at Thali, a small-plates Indian restaurant off popular Kloof Street. For 325 rand, the kitchen sends you a seemingly endless assortment of food, most of which is excellent: Chicken and lamb kebabs, tandoori cauliflower with coconut and cashew, fried fish tacos in papadum, seafood curry with panch phoron (Indian five-spice blend with cumin and fennel). The parade seemed to never end — not that I was in any hurry for the meal to be over.

An evening out on the waterfront and in downtown Cape Town may very well end at Bascule Bar, where a high roller can truly indulge his or her inner Gatsby with whiskey and cigars alongside high-priced yachts bobbing in the marina. Located in the Cape Grace hotel, Bascule has an impressive variety of whiskies to choose from, as well as a number of choice cigars. A pour of single malt whisky distilled at St. Magdalene (shuttered in 1983) from independent bottler Dun Bheagan will run you 925 rand. Fire up a Montecristo No. 2 Cuban cigar for an additional 435 rand and relax in an extravagant, malted barley- and tobacco-induced haze.

I strongly favor the modest, local pub — the lymphatic system of any good city — over fancy hotel bars. Perseverance Tavern may not be the hippest or hottest bar in Cape Town, but it may have the richest history: It opened as a tavern and boardinghouse in 1808 and claims to be the oldest pub in the city. According to the bar’s website, famous figures in South Africa’s history — sports stars, dignitaries, even the controversial diamond baron Cecil Rhodes — trod the floorboards of the old Persies, as it iss known.

That past is palpable at Persies, with old photos and mementos adorning the walls, but that matters little to a thirsty visitor. Fortunately, the house beer, a pale ale, was cold and refreshing.

Mr. Northam pointed to at least one way.","“I usually resist the temptation to nationalize these races in Virginia, but Trump has been an overbearing presence in this election, and Ed Gillespie chose to run a campaign modeled after the kind of campaign Trump ran last year,” said Mark J. Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. “This was the first big test in the Trump era of the appeal of Trump-style politics at the state level. The president injected himself in this campaign, so he owns some of it.”

Indeed, the president suggested that Mr. Gillespie’s biggest problem was not embracing him enough. “Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter Tuesday night.

Democrats who were worried about low turnout and a lack of energy can breathe easier. The profile of the electorate in Virginia, where Democrats have started to dominate the counties across the Potomac from Washington, was heavily in their favor, and that advantage has been steadily growing with an influx of immigrants who were repelled by Mr. Gillespie’s message, and by a durable foundation of black voters.

Photo

In that sense, the pressure for Mr. Northam and the Democrats to win masked the frictions in the party between his more centrist posture and some liberals who criticized his campaign and refused to endorse him.

Democrats showed that they could generate energy, even for a low-key candidate like Mr. Northam, but they can draw little from his campaign in terms of a message other than opposing the harshest edges of Trumpism.

The president’s approval rating in Virginia was 38 percent in a recent poll, and Mr. Gillespie was grudgingly yoked to him. Mr. Trump posted Twitter messages promoting Mr. Gillespie, including on Election Day, but did not campaign with the candidate, an explicit, extraordinary recognition from Mr. Gillespie that appearing with the president of his own party would hurt more than help, something that has rarely happened since Richard Nixon was engulfed by Watergate.

Mr. Gillespie tried at times to focus on the economy by talking down the state’s prospects under Democrats, but that message did not break through. The state’s unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, and the Northern Virginia region that helped propel Mr. Northam includes some of the wealthiest counties in the country. It did work in rural areas where voters, many without a four-year degree, who once worked in coal mines or in the tobacco industry have not shared in the state’s prosperity.

Though each candidate emphasized issues that played to their base supporters, Mr. Gillespie won the Republican nomination by defeating a far more pure Trumpian candidate, Corey Stewart, and Mr. Northam prevailed over the favorite of progressives, former Representative Tom Perriello. So neither party’s voters were inclined toward the candidate who drew the brightest line distinctions.

But during the campaign, Mr. Gillespie draped himself in Mr. Trump’s clothes, particularly his tough talk on cracking down on illegal immigration. As a national party leader, Mr. Gillespie had been known for his efforts to expand the Republican tent and find a way to connect with immigrant voters, particularly Hispanics.

“I think Ed Gillespie did everything he thought he needed to do to fire up the Trump base, and if the Democrats are fired up and feel united around a cause — whether a good policy or the politics of Donald Trump and others as too anti-women — the Trump coalition is not big enough,” said Steve Jarding, a lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and a Democratic campaign consultant.

Democrats needed a victory in Virginia more than Republicans did. Mr. Northam pointed to at least one way. His election showed the limits of Trumpism, and now Republicans will have a choice about how clearly to embrace it.",Trumpism Without Trump: A Losing Formula in Swing-State Virginia,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/us/politics/gillespie-northam-trump-virginia-governor-election.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

So far, 10 states and the District of Columbia have joined, representing 165 electoral votes.
Yes, they’re three reliably blue states representing 17 electoral votes among them, but every vote counts.","Defenders of the Electoral College argue that it was created to protect the interests of smaller states, whose voters would otherwise be overwhelmed by the much larger populations living in urban areas along the coasts. That’s wrong as a matter of history: The framers of the Constitution were concerned primarily with ensuring that the president wasn’t selected by uneducated commoners. The electors were meant to be a deliberative body of intelligent, well-informed men who would be immune to corruption. (The arrangement was also a gift to the Southern states, with their large, unenfranchised populations of slaves.)

But regardless of its original intent, the Electoral College today is, as Mr. Trump said, a disaster for a democracy. Modern presidential campaigns ignore almost all states, large and small alike, in favor of a handful that are closely divided between Republicans and Democrats — and even within those states, they focus on a few key regions. In 2016, two-thirds of all public campaign events were held in just six states: Michigan, Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, Virginia and North Carolina; toss in six more and you’ve got 94 percent of all campaign events.

This may be smart campaigning, but it’s terrible for the rest of the country, which is rendered effectively invisible, distorting our politics, our policy debates and even the distribution of federal funds. Candidates focus their platforms on the concerns of battleground states, and presidents who want to stay in office make sure to lavish attention, and money, on the same places. The emphasis on a small number of states also increases the risk to our national security, by creating an easy target for hackers who want to influence the outcome of an election. Perhaps most important, voters outside of swing states know their votes are devalued, if not worthless, and they behave accordingly. In 2012, 64 percent of swing-state voters showed up, compared with 57 percent everywhere else, a pattern that persisted in 2016. What better way to get more voters to register and go to the polls than to ensure that everyone’s vote is weighed equally?

The Electoral College has been the subject of more amendment efforts — 595 as of 2004 — than any other part of the Constitution. But amending the Constitution is a heavy lift. A quicker and more realistic fix is the National Popular Vote interstate compact, under which states agree to award all of their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote. The agreement kicks in as soon as states representing a total of 270 electoral votes sign on, ensuring that the popular vote will always pick the president. So far, 10 states and the District of Columbia have joined, representing 165 electoral votes. The problem is that they are all solidly Democratic, which only adds to the suspicion that this is no more than a partisan game. It’s not: When Mr. Trump is not making up stories about millions of illegal voters, he has argued that if the presidency were decided by popular vote, he would have campaigned differently and still would have won. He may well be right.

How can red states be persuaded to sign on and give all their citizens a voice? Some, like Georgia and Arizona, may not stay red for much longer. But even deep-red states would benefit from the infusion of attention and cash from campaigns seeking to rustle up every vote they can find.

This problem isn’t going away; if anything it’s going to get worse as Americans continue to cluster. Half the population now lives in just nine states.

In Detroit, Mayor Mike Duggan Easily Wins Re-Election

Mike Duggan, the mayor who oversaw Detroit’s emergence from bankruptcy protection, was re-elected on Tuesday, local election results showed, defeating Coleman A. Young II, the son of a storied politician who was the city’s first black mayor.

The election was seen as a referendum on Detroit’s progress. Four years ago, the city had fallen so deeply into debt and was so plagued by failing services that it found itself in federal court, the largest American city ever to seek bankruptcy protection. Mr. Duggan, who was elected the city’s first white mayor in 40 years amid the legal proceedings, has pointed to signs of change since: Detroit has 65,000 new streetlights that actually turn on; emergency medical service response times have dropped; and thousands of empty, blighted houses have been torn down and hauled away.

But serious challenges remain, including thousands more crumbling buildings and a growing sense of inequity over improvements to some parts of the city over others. In a city that is 82 percent black, there were efforts to portray the election along racial lines, as a choice between a black-run Detroit, as it was during the tenure of Mr. Young’s father, and a white-run Detroit. One ad that criticized Mr. Duggan, issued by backers of Mr. Young, ended this way: “It’s as simple as black and white.”

Vi Lyles Will Be First Black Woman to Lead Charlotte, N.C.

Vi Lyles, a Democratic councilwoman, was elected mayor of Charlotte, N.C., on Tuesday, local election authorities reported, becoming the first African-American woman to win the office since the city’s incorporation in 1768.

Ms. Lyles defeated Kenny Smith, a Republican, in the race to choose a successor for Mayor Jennifer Roberts, whom Ms. Lyles had defeated in a Democratic primary.

Ms. Roberts had been buffeted, from both the left and the right, for her handling of two issues: the fallout from the fatal police shooting of an African-American man, Keith Lamont Scott, in September 2016; and a debate over which bathrooms transgender people should be able to use in public buildings.

In February 2016, the Charlotte City Council passed a nondiscrimination ordinance — supported by Ms. Lyles and Ms. Roberts — that prompted the Republican-dominated state Legislature to pass a law that required people in publicly owned buildings to use the restroom that corresponded with the gender listed on their birth certificates. The law set off a roaring culture debate across the state, and the Charlotte council eventually rescinded its ordinance as part of an effort to roll back the state law.

The bathroom issue played a role in the election, with a conservative group promulgating ads that attacked Ms. Lyles for supporting a “radical” gay-rights agenda.

Mr. Smith portrayed himself as a figure who could unite a divided city, while Ms. Lyles promised to increase resident involvement in police matters.

Flint Mayor Survives Recall Attempt

Mayor Karen Weaver of Flint, Mich., survived a recall attempt on Tuesday, local election officials reported, and will continue serving for the next two years. She emerged with the most votes in a field of 18 candidates that included Scott Kincaid, a city councilman.

Photo

Ms. Weaver took office in 2015 as Flint was grappling with lead-tainted drinking water, the result of decisions by emergency managers appointed by the state to oversee the fiscally struggling city. She gained national prominence by calling attention to the city’s water woes and pushing for assistance from federal and state agencies.

But Ms. Weaver, a psychologist who had never before held political office, quickly found herself at odds with the Flint City Council. Mr. Kincaid and others on the council pushed back against her proposal for a long-term drinking water source for Flint and criticized her attempt to do business with a trash-hauling company that has been accused of corruption elsewhere.

Ms. Weaver, who is black and Flint’s first woman mayor, said she believed the recall effort was motivated by sexism and racism. Mr. Kincaid, who is white, said that race was irrelevant and that the recall was rooted in concerns about policy.

No Candidate Gets a Majority for Mayor of Minneapolis

No candidate for mayor of Minneapolis received a majority of votes on Tuesday, local election officials reported, meaning that the city’s complex ranked-choice voting process will be used starting Wednesday to determine a winner.

Jacob Frey, a Minneapolis City Council member, had a lead after Tuesday night. Mayor Betsy Hodges remains in the running for a second term despite a large field of opponents and criticism over how she has handled police shootings in the city.

In the Democratic-leaning city, the election featured several candidates who saw themselves as progressive Democrats, many of whom emphasized racial equity and police accountability in their campaigns.

The local affiliate of the Democratic Party did not endorse a candidate, leaving a wide field of challengers.

The race was upended in July by the fatal shooting of Justine Damond, an unarmed Australian woman, by a Minneapolis police officer. Afterward, Ms. Hodges replaced the police chief but still faced protests and calls to change the culture of the police department. Demonstrators also criticized Ms. Hodges and camped outside the police station for days in 2015 when an officer fatally shot an unarmed black man.

Minneapolis is one of a handful of cities that uses ranked-choice voting, which allows voters to select and rank up to three preferred candidates. If nobody gets a majority in the first-round votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is dropped, and their votes are reallocated. Ms. Hodges won her first term in 2013 on the 33rd round of counting.

Jenny Durkan Holds Lead In Seattle Race

Jenny Durkan, a former prosecutor, held a lead in the race for mayor of Seattle early Wednesday, The Associated Press reported, against Cary Moon, an urban planner.

One of them was to be the first woman to hold the job since 1928. Officials said they planned to continue counting ballots later Wednesday.

Ms. Durkan, 59, and Ms. Moon, 54, agreed on many issues, especially that rapid economic and population growth was testing the city as rents and home prices soar and as homelessness has challenged neighborhoods.

Neither woman had ever held elected office. Ms. Durkan argued that her experience as a United States attorney, appointed by President Barack Obama, gave her a depth of experience that Ms. Moon lacked. Ms. Moon appealed to voters who were suspicious of establishment politicians, and she won endorsements of several groups that had backed Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential race.

The race was overshadowed, at times, by events at City Hall. Ed Murray, Seattle’s first openly gay mayor, endorsed Ms. Durkan in June, then resigned in September after several men accused him of sexually abusing them decades ago when they were minors.

Mayor of Boston Wins Second Term

Mayor Martin J. Walsh, a Democrat of Boston, cruised to re-election on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported, beating a city councilor, Tito Jackson, who tried to turn the race into a referendum on development, displacement and disparity.

Mr. Walsh’s first term as mayor was not without controversy. He faced criticism after he initially embraced the city’s flashy but doomed 2024 Olympic bid and blamed “10 people on Twitter” for deep-seated opposition to hosting the games. Two of his aides were indicted on charges of extortion. And amid a burst of economic growth, discontent has simmered over Boston’s rising cost of living, continuing problems in its public schools and a multi-million-dollar tax break for General Electric to bring its corporate headquarters to Boston.

Photo

But Mr. Jackson, a fellow Democrat and Boston’s first black mayoral finalist in decades, struggled to compete with Mr. Walsh’s campaign war chest and with his endorsements from popular Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Mr. Walsh pledged to tackle what he described as generational issues, like racial tensions and lagging schools, and burnished his progressive credentials by highlighting his differences with President Trump.

Ohio Voters Reject Limits to State Drug Prices

Voters in Ohio defeated a measure on Tuesday that would have limited the price of prescription drugs purchased by the state.

The referendum would have required that the state pay no more for drugs than what the federal Department of Veterans Affairs pays for those same drugs. The provision would have applied to state-purchased drugs bought as part of the Medicaid program for low-income people.

The Veterans Affairs Department buys drugs at 24 percent below typical prices, in addition to other discounts.

The measure drew strong resistance from drug makers, which spent more than $49 million to try to defeat it, and the loss underscored the formidable influence of the pharmaceutical industry, which typically spends millions of dollars a year on lobbying and campaign contributions. Last year, the industry successfully beat a measure in California that was similar to Ohio’s, after spending more than $100 million to do so.

The drug industry has come under fire for the skyrocketing price of prescription drugs, and politicians in both parties have recently taken up the populist issue. While Congress has so far done little to address the issue, several states have taken up the cause. California, Nevada and Vermont have passed laws that require companies to disclose and justify certain price increases.

Larry Krasner Elected Top Prosecutor in Philadelphia

Larry Krasner, a veteran civil rights lawyer who ran on a platform of reforming the criminal justice system, was elected on Tuesday as the district attorney of Philadelphia, The Associated Press reported.

Mr. Krasner, a Democrat, defeated his opponent, Beth Grossman, a career local prosecutor and a longtime Democrat who switched parties to run against him as a Republican. After beating six opponents in a primary in May, Mr. Krasner was heavily favored to win the general election in the heavily Democratic city.

Photo

At 56, Mr. Krasner has never held public office and spent much of his career representing liberal activists in Philadelphia. As a private lawyer, he sued the Philadelphia Police Department 75 times, repeatedly accusing its officers of lying and using excessive force — a remarkable record for a man who will now have to work with the police as the city’s top law enforcement officer.

Though crime in Philadelphia has dropped significantly in recent months, the city still has one of the highest incarceration rates of any urban center in the country. Mr. Krasner made that issue a focal point of his campaign, promising to cut down on prosecutions of minor offenses, to divert drug addicts into treatment and to ignore, where appropriate, what he described as draconian sentencing guidelines.","Elections Roundup: Incumbents Fare Well in Boston, Detroit and Flint",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/us/mayor-atlanta-boston-detroit.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

On Tuesday, Mr. Boies issued a statement saying he believed the investigators had been hired solely to determine the facts related to the allegations against Mr. Weinstein, which he believed would be to The Times’s benefit. He denied there was any conflict of interest with his work for the paper.

But late in the day, the paper said it was ending its relationship with his firm.

“We never contemplated that the law firm would contract with an intelligence firm to conduct a secret spying operation aimed at our reporting and our reporters,” The Times said in a statement. “Such an operation is reprehensible.”

Mr. Boies said neither he nor his firm had any role in initially hiring the private investigative firm, Black Cube. But he said he had made a mistake in helping out Mr. Weinstein, whom Mr. Boies described as a longtime client and who has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex, in forging a new contract with the firm.

“It was not thought through, and that was my mistake,” he said in the statement. He pointed out that he had never been disciplined for his work.

“In retrospect, we should not have gotten involved in the billing dispute,” Mr. Boies said. “In the case of Harvey Weinstein, there is a lot of information that I didn’t have.”

The episode may deepen the perception that Mr. Boies pushes the boundaries on potential conflicts, while raising questions about why he didn’t seek to learn more about Mr. Weinstein’s team of hired-gun investigators.

“From Boies’s perspective, this is no good deed goes unpunished,” said Laurie L. Levenson, the David W. Burcham chair in ethical advocacy at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. “From what I heard, he should have had more information as to what it was about. He is leaving a thumbprint on it, and whether he wants it or not, this now belongs to him.”

The rules of professional conduct in New York, where Mr. Boies practices, prohibit lawyers who have not gotten consent to a conflict from representing clients “if a reasonable lawyer would conclude” that “the representation will involve the lawyer in representing differing interests.”

Stephen Gillers, who teaches legal ethics at New York University School of Law, said there were several ways to view Mr. Boies’s decision to execute the contract.

“If all he did, as he seems to claim, was help Weinstein unearth facts about his accusers that affected their credibility and might have persuaded the paper not to run the story, that would not be seen as adversely affecting his ‘loyalty’ to The Times,” Mr. Gillers said. “The paper has an interest in the credibility of its sources.”

“On the other hand, if Boies assisted Weinstein in targeting the integrity of Times journalists as a way to prevent the story from running or, failing that, to discredit the reporting if it did run, that would certainly be disloyal to his client,” he said.

Lawyers usually deal with potential conflicts by giving clients the option of switching to another law firm, legal experts said. In many instances, if the matters are not related, the clients will give the lawyer permission to keep representing them.

Sometimes broad waivers are included in the initial retention agreement. The agreement between Mr. Boies’s firm and The Times acknowledged that the firm would from time to time do work for clients whose interest may be adverse to the newspaper’s — a fact that Mr. Boies cited Tuesday.

But The Times’s statement on Tuesday made clear that it believed Mr. Boies’s firm had gone too far by handling a contract for a company that sought to undermine a major reporting effort.

Actual conflict or not, legal experts said Mr. Boies would most likely pay little penalty for his dual work for Mr. Weinstein and The Times. They said disciplinary action was unlikely because it usually required a formal complaint. Moreover, they said, some clients may find Mr. Boies’s aggressiveness appealing.

“I don’t think this will hurt from a business perspective,” said Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School and a former prosecutor who specializes in legal ethics. “It is not going to harm his reputation with most clients. When you hire Boies, you are hiring an aggressive lawyer.”

That assertive, sometimes belligerent, style has made Mr. Boies a favorite in the business world. Steven A. Cohen, the billionaire investor, hired him to do battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission when it was deciding how long to bar him from the securities industry for failing to adequately monitor employees charged with insider trading. Maurice R. Greenberg, the former head of American International Group, tapped Mr. Boies and his team to deal with a long-running civil fraud case filed against him.

And Mr. Boies is no stranger to controversy. His decision in 1997 to leave Cravath, Swaine & Moore, a longtime legal powerhouse, came about because he wanted to represent George Steinbrenner, who owned the New York Yankees, in a suit against Major League Baseball. Lawyers at Cravath objected because the firm also represented Time Warner, which owned the Atlanta Braves.

So Mr. Boies started his own firm, which grew quickly. Some critics said his affinity for high-profile cases led him to take on more work than he could handle.

“My wife says I have a hard time saying no,” Mr. Boies said in a 2002 interview.

Occasionally, he worked for little or no money. He charged a reduced fee, for instance, to represent the federal government in its failed attempt to break up Microsoft on antitrust grounds. His videotaped deposition of Bill Gates, one of the company’s founders, is remembered as a classic example of the art of cross-examination.

And a casual follower of his career might take Mr. Boies for a champion of progressive causes. He represented Al Gore in the 2000 recount litigation that culminated in the Supreme Court decision that handed the presidency to George W. Bush.

And he may be best known to the general public for joining with Theodore B. Olson, his adversary in Bush v. Gore, to challenge California’s ban on same-sex marriage.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.","When Annalisa Marchionna was a child, she and her parents vacationed in the Italian coastal town of Casalbordino Lido. One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

The election of Mr. Murphy was yet another low-water mark in a long fall from grace for Mr. Christie, who once saw his approval ratings soar into the 70s and whose re-election margin in 2013 was so high that it instantly vaulted him into the presidential conversation.

And Mr. Murphy’s victory was further rejection of the politics of Mr. Trump, who was roundly defeated by Hillary Clinton in New Jersey last November. Mr. Murphy enjoyed the support of a parade of Democratic luminaries — Barack Obama, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Al Gore, to name a few — who trekked to New Jersey to rally voters and remind them that this was one of their first opportunities to send a message to the White House. The president suffered another setback on Tuesday in the only other statewide election when Lt. Gov. Ralph S. Northam, a Democrat, was elected governor of Virginia, defeating the Republican candidate, Ed Gillespie.

In the final weeks in New Jersey, Ms. Guadagno, perhaps sensing that she was not gaining any traction, veered toward a style of politics more akin to Mr. Trump’s, campaigning against undocumented immigrants and running caustic ads that twisted Mr. Murphy’s words about cities that offer them sanctuary.

But support from Mr. Trump, who had been frantically tweeting about the Virginia governor’s race for weeks, was nowhere to be found for Ms. Guadagno, nor did any Republican Party luminaries travel to the state to offer their support.

From a campaign that began with a sharp focus on property taxes — she made a promise on primary night not to run for re-election if she failed to lower property taxes — Ms. Guadagno changed course and warned repeatedly that Mr. Murphy would turn New Jersey into a sanctuary state, hoping to energize the base of the Republican Party.

But the strategy fell flat, particularly in a state where the successful Republican Party playbook, which guided Mr. Christie and former governors Christine Todd Whitman and Thomas Kean to victory in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, has relied on winning over the large swath of New Jersey’s independent voters with a message focused on pocketbook issues.","Phil Murphy Is Elected Governor of New Jersey, in a Lift for Democrats",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/nyregion/phil-murphy-governor.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

That message was reinforced during meetings in Pyongyang after Mr. Trump’s inauguration. North Korean officials acknowledged that the new administration offered the opportunity for a fresh start, and raised the idea of beginning talks without preconditions. In a session in Oslo a few months later, the North Koreans recognized the need to defuse tensions while reiterating their interest in an unconditional dialogue.

For the North Koreans, who point to the fates of Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi and Iraq’s Saddam Hussein as cautionary tales, demonstrating that they can build a nuclear missile able to reach the continental United States is the highest priority. This was confirmed in Moscow a few weeks ago, when Ms. Choe said that North Korea would continue to develop these weapons until it reached a “balance of power” with the United States.

This dark cloud may have a silver lining.

In our talks, the North Koreans have maintained that they are not striving to be a nuclear state with a big arsenal, but rather to have enough weapons to defend themselves. Since early last summer, North Korean officials have publicly said that they have entered the last stage in the development of their nuclear force, implying that they have an endpoint in mind. A senior North Korean official privately told us: “If we feel we have enough, the primary emphasis will be on economic growth.”

This potential opening for dialogue needs to be explored. We believe the best way to proceed would be to first hold bilateral “talks about talks” without preconditions. The objective of these talks would be to clarify the policies of each country, discuss where there might be potential compromises and what each side considers nonnegotiable, and prepare the groundwork to move on to negotiations.

Ideally, this would be done through under-the-radar meetings by diplomats, similar to the initial contacts between American and Iranian officials that took months and eventually led to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. In the current atmosphere of crisis, we should accelerate this process by appointing a senior presidential envoy to work with the State Department and with top-ranking North Koreans.

A nuclear-free Korean Peninsula should remain the United States’ main priority. The Trump administration wants this to happen immediately, while some experts argue this objective should be dropped since it will be impossible to achieve.

We don’t agree with either position. The United States has to be realistic. Denuclearization cannot happen overnight. It must be framed as a long-term objective of any diplomacy, an approach the North Koreans have hinted they would accept.

In view of the mounting confrontation and the lack of mutual trust, the United States must pursue a step-by-step approach to reduce tensions and secure a path to formal negotiations.

An essential first step is an immediate moratorium on North Korea’s nuclear and missile testing, which aggravate tensions. In exchange, the United States and South Korea could meet North Korean concerns by adjusting the scale of their joint military exercises or perhaps offer some relief from economic sanctions. Other steps — such as assurances by North Korea that it will not transfer nuclear, chemical or biological weapons technology overseas — could follow.

But none of this can be achieved without the right political atmosphere. The North Koreans are bewildered by the lack of coherence in American policy. President Trump’s threatening tweets and personal attacks on Kim Jong-un have only added to the risks of misinterpretation. Even his recent statements in Tokyo and Seoul, hinting at a willingness to talk, are at risk of being drowned out by his bluster, which reinforces the North Koreans’ mind-set that they made the right decision by choosing a nuclear path.

Mr. Trump could begin reducing tensions by stating clearly that diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang is his administration’s first choice and that the United States is ready to proceed down this road, working with its allies and partners. Such a statement offers the best way to sway the Chinese to better enforce sanctions against Pyongyang and would serve him well in his coming meeting with President Xi Jinping of China.

The United States should understand that growing talk of military options will only strengthen Pyongyang’s resolve, not undermine it.

In Detroit, Mayor Mike Duggan Easily Wins Re-Election

Mike Duggan, the mayor who oversaw Detroit’s emergence from bankruptcy protection, was re-elected on Tuesday, local election results showed, defeating Coleman A. Young II, the son of a storied politician who was the city’s first black mayor.

Photo

The election was seen as a referendum on Detroit’s progress. Four years ago, the city had fallen so deeply into debt and was so plagued by failing services that it found itself in federal court, the largest American city ever to seek bankruptcy protection. Mr. Duggan, who was elected the city’s first white mayor in 40 years amid the legal proceedings, has pointed to signs of change since: Detroit has 65,000 new streetlights that actually turn on; emergency medical service response times have dropped; and thousands of empty, blighted houses have been torn down and hauled away.

But serious challenges remain, including thousands more crumbling buildings and a growing sense of inequity over improvements to some parts of the city over others. In a city that is 82 percent black, there were efforts to portray the election along racial lines, as a choice between a black-run Detroit, as it was during the tenure of Mr. Young’s father, and a white-run Detroit. One ad that criticized Mr. Duggan, issued by backers of Mr. Young, ended this way: “It’s as simple as black and white.”

Vi Lyles Will Be First Black Woman to Lead Charlotte, N.C.

Vi Lyles, a Democratic councilwoman, was elected mayor of Charlotte, N.C., on Tuesday, local election authorities reported, becoming the first African-American woman to win the office since the city’s incorporation in 1768.

Ms. Lyles defeated Kenny Smith, a Republican, in the race to choose a successor for Mayor Jennifer Roberts, whom Ms. Lyles had defeated in a Democratic primary.

Ms. Roberts had been buffeted, from both the left and the right, for her handling of two issues: the fallout from the fatal police shooting of an African-American man, Keith Lamont Scott, in September 2016; and a debate over which bathrooms transgender people should be able to use in public buildings.

In February 2016, the Charlotte City Council passed a nondiscrimination ordinance — supported by Ms. Lyles and Ms. Roberts — that prompted the Republican-dominated state Legislature to pass a law that required people in publicly owned buildings to use the restroom that corresponded with the gender listed on their birth certificates. The law set off a roaring culture debate across the state, and the Charlotte council eventually rescinded its ordinance as part of an effort to roll back the state law.

The bathroom issue played a role in the election, with a conservative group promulgating ads that attacked Ms. Lyles for supporting a “radical” gay-rights agenda.

Mr. Smith portrayed himself as a figure who could unite a divided city, while Ms. Lyles promised to increase resident involvement in police matters.

Flint Mayor Survives Recall Attempt

Mayor Karen Weaver of Flint, Mich., survived a recall attempt on Tuesday, local election officials reported, and will continue serving for the next two years. She emerged with the most votes in a field of 18 candidates that included Scott Kincaid, a city councilman.

Photo

Ms. Weaver took office in 2015 as Flint was grappling with lead-tainted drinking water, the result of decisions by emergency managers appointed by the state to oversee the fiscally struggling city. She gained national prominence by calling attention to the city’s water woes and pushing for assistance from federal and state agencies.

But Ms. Weaver, a psychologist who had never before held political office, quickly found herself at odds with the Flint City Council. Mr. Kincaid and others on the council pushed back against her proposal for a long-term drinking water source for Flint and criticized her attempt to do business with a trash-hauling company that has been accused of corruption elsewhere.

Ms. Weaver, who is black and Flint’s first woman mayor, said she believed the recall effort was motivated by sexism and racism. Mr. Kincaid, who is white, said that race was irrelevant and that the recall was rooted in concerns about policy.

No Candidate Gets a Majority for Mayor of Minneapolis

No candidate for mayor of Minneapolis received a majority of votes on Tuesday, local election officials reported, meaning that the city’s complex ranked-choice voting process will be used starting Wednesday to determine a winner.

Jacob Frey, a Minneapolis City Council member, had a lead after Tuesday night. Mayor Betsy Hodges remains in the running for a second term despite a large field of opponents and criticism over how she has handled police shootings in the city.

In the Democratic-leaning city, the election featured several candidates who saw themselves as progressive Democrats, many of whom emphasized racial equity and police accountability in their campaigns.

The local affiliate of the Democratic Party did not endorse a candidate, leaving a wide field of challengers.

The race was upended in July by the fatal shooting of Justine Damond, an unarmed Australian woman, by a Minneapolis police officer. Afterward, Ms. Hodges replaced the police chief but still faced protests and calls to change the culture of the police department. Demonstrators also criticized Ms. Hodges and camped outside the police station for days in 2015 when an officer fatally shot an unarmed black man.

Minneapolis is one of a handful of cities that uses ranked-choice voting, which allows voters to select and rank up to three preferred candidates. If nobody gets a majority in the first-round votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is dropped, and their votes are reallocated. Ms. Hodges won her first term in 2013 on the 33rd round of counting.

Jenny Durkan Holds Lead In Seattle Race

Jenny Durkan, a former prosecutor, held a lead in the race for mayor of Seattle early Wednesday, The Associated Press reported, against Cary Moon, an urban planner.

One of them was to be the first woman to hold the job since 1928. Officials said they planned to continue counting ballots later Wednesday.

Ms. Durkan, 59, and Ms. Moon, 54, agreed on many issues, especially that rapid economic and population growth was testing the city as rents and home prices soar and as homelessness has challenged neighborhoods.

Neither woman had ever held elected office. Ms. Durkan argued that her experience as a United States attorney, appointed by President Barack Obama, gave her a depth of experience that Ms. Moon lacked. Ms. Moon appealed to voters who were suspicious of establishment politicians, and she won endorsements of several groups that had backed Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential race.

The race was overshadowed, at times, by events at City Hall. Ed Murray, Seattle’s first openly gay mayor, endorsed Ms. Durkan in June, then resigned in September after several men accused him of sexually abusing them decades ago when they were minors.

Mayor of Boston Wins Second Term

Mayor Martin J. Walsh, a Democrat of Boston, cruised to re-election on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported, beating a city councilor, Tito Jackson, who tried to turn the race into a referendum on development, displacement and disparity.

Mr. Walsh’s first term as mayor was not without controversy. He faced criticism after he initially embraced the city’s flashy but doomed 2024 Olympic bid and blamed “10 people on Twitter” for deep-seated opposition to hosting the games. Two of his aides were indicted on charges of extortion. And amid a burst of economic growth, discontent has simmered over Boston’s rising cost of living, continuing problems in its public schools and a multi-million-dollar tax break for General Electric to bring its corporate headquarters to Boston.

But Mr. Jackson, a fellow Democrat and Boston’s first black mayoral finalist in decades, struggled to compete with Mr. Walsh’s campaign war chest and with his endorsements from popular Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Mr. Walsh pledged to tackle what he described as generational issues, like racial tensions and lagging schools, and burnished his progressive credentials by highlighting his differences with President Trump.

Ohio Voters Reject Limits to State Drug Prices

Voters in Ohio defeated a measure on Tuesday that would have limited the price of prescription drugs purchased by the state.

The referendum would have required that the state pay no more for drugs than what the federal Department of Veterans Affairs pays for those same drugs. The provision would have applied to state-purchased drugs bought as part of the Medicaid program for low-income people.

The Veterans Affairs Department buys drugs at 24 percent below typical prices, in addition to other discounts.

The measure drew strong resistance from drug makers, which spent more than $49 million to try to defeat it, and the loss underscored the formidable influence of the pharmaceutical industry, which typically spends millions of dollars a year on lobbying and campaign contributions. Last year, the industry successfully beat a measure in California that was similar to Ohio’s, after spending more than $100 million to do so.

The drug industry has come under fire for the skyrocketing price of prescription drugs, and politicians in both parties have recently taken up the populist issue. While Congress has so far done little to address the issue, several states have taken up the cause. California, Nevada and Vermont have passed laws that require companies to disclose and justify certain price increases.

Larry Krasner Elected Top Prosecutor in Philadelphia

Larry Krasner, a veteran civil rights lawyer who ran on a platform of reforming the criminal justice system, was elected on Tuesday as the district attorney of Philadelphia, The Associated Press reported.

Mr. Krasner, a Democrat, defeated his opponent, Beth Grossman, a career local prosecutor and a longtime Democrat who switched parties to run against him as a Republican. After beating six opponents in a primary in May, Mr. Krasner was heavily favored to win the general election in the heavily Democratic city.

At 56, Mr. Krasner has never held public office and spent much of his career representing liberal activists in Philadelphia. As a private lawyer, he sued the Philadelphia Police Department 75 times, repeatedly accusing its officers of lying and using excessive force — a remarkable record for a man who will now have to work with the police as the city’s top law enforcement officer.

Though crime in Philadelphia has dropped significantly in recent months, the city still has one of the highest incarceration rates of any urban center in the country. Mr. Krasner made that issue a focal point of his campaign, promising to cut down on prosecutions of minor offenses, to divert drug addicts into treatment and to ignore, where appropriate, what he described as draconian sentencing guidelines.","Elections Roundup: Incumbents Fare Well in Boston, Detroit and Flint",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/us/mayor-atlanta-boston-detroit.html

“He had not done that since he was a little boy,” said Mr. Wong, 53, a former computer professional who now trades online.

The youngest of the three jailed activists, his son emerged as the international face of the opposition, even being featured in a Netflix documentary, “Joshua: Teenager vs. Superpower.”

But Mr. Wong said he wakes each day prepared to see headlines blaring more bad news. To avoid the sidelong glances or adulation of strangers, he and his wife, Grace Ng, a homemaker, no longer say their son’s name in public, even when speaking about him with each other.

Mr. Wong, who identifies as a devout Christian, said the worst kind of attention came from fellow believers. “The greatest pressure has come from Christians who out of nowhere offered to pray for my son to ‘repent of his sin,’” he said, adding that such remarks came from friends dear to him.

He said he supports his son’s pro-democracy activism, saying Joshua Wong learned his sense of mission from his religious upbringing.

In fact, Mr. Wong said, his son was once an outspoken Christian, too, but now keeps his religious views out of the public eye. And differences over the role of faith in public policy have become a source of tension between them.

The two clashed over same-sex marriage, which Hong Kong does not allow. His son supports it, but Mr. Wong has organized protests against it and called for removing rainbow-colored lion statues that were erected in Hong Kong in support of LGBT rights.

Even now, the feelings may be a bit raw. Asked about their dispute, Mr. Wong threatened to cut short the interview.

He prefers to talk about another moment. After his son kissed him and his wife goodbye, he apologized. “I am sorry that I put so much pressure on you,” Mr. Wong recalled his son saying.

‘Selfish People Like You’

Helen Ngai had different hopes for her son, Alex Chow. Having helped build a prospering family business, she wanted her children to enjoy a life of comfort and status. She urged Alex Chow, the older of her two sons, to become a university professor.

This fall, he was supposed to go to the University of California, Berkeley, to pursue a doctorate in geography.

Instead, he went to prison.

“I wish my son had not taken this path,” Ms. Ngai, 58, said in an interview in a stylishly furnished apartment in Hong Kong, one of many properties that she and her husband own around the world, including in Queens.

“I’m just a selfish person. All I care about is making money,” she said. “Many in Hong Kong are selfish people. Why do so much for them?”

She said she was puzzled when her son volunteered in high school to counsel underperforming students. She could not understand the guilt that he confessed to her over living in a big apartment. She ridiculed him for considering a job at Greenpeace that would have paid $38,000 per year.

“Is that even enough for food and housing?” she recalled challenging him.

The Umbrella Revolution exposed such generation gaps among Hong Kong’s 7.2 million people. While those under age 40 overwhelmingly supported the protesters, people above that age were more critical, according to a Chinese University survey.

“I always tell my son, we must not oppose the country or the party because, at the end of the day, we are Chinese people,” Ms. Ngai said.

She and her husband are the sort of success story that has helped make Hong Kong one of the world’s wealthiest cities. Their garment business has factories across South Asia. The two travel so often that Ms. Ngai said her son was essentially “raised by maids.”

Ms. Ngai also cashed in on Hong Kong’s supercharged housing market, flipping apartments for profits. This put her at odds with her son, who accused her of driving up rents for working families.

“It’s selfish people like you who are holding back society,” she recalled her son accusing her.

“If I hadn’t, would you have such a big apartment?” Ms. Ngai retorted.

“I would rather live in subsidized housing,” her son replied.

“We never had to worry too much about money,” she said. “That’s why for him it’s all about justice and other people’s misfortunes.”

The first time she visited her son in prison, she cried so hard she could hardly speak. In an attempt to cheer her up, Alex Chow said prison had given him a new cause: advocating better conditions for inmates and prison employees.

‘They Always Go for the Leaders’

On the night when protesters stormed government headquarters, Lam So-lan was across Hong Kong’s picturesque harbor attending a relative’s wedding.

She thought her son, Nathan Law, then 21, was back in his college dormitory.

She was stunned when someone switched on a television, and there he was rallying demonstrators.

“I knew he was in big trouble the moment he picked up the microphone,” said Ms. Lam, who had warned her son against getting involved in politics. “They always go for the leaders.”

Ms. Lam, 55, said she just wanted Mr. Law to focus on his studies. Born poor in China’s southeastern province of Guangdong, she had moved to Hong Kong with her three sons in 1999 in hopes of providing them a better life. She raised them almost entirely as a single mother, living in public housing and working as a janitor and in other jobs to put her sons through school.

She divorced her husband when Mr. Law, the youngest, was still in high school. In an interview, he described his upbringing as “working class.”

Despite that, she said she always tried to give her sons a lot of freedom.

“My only expectations are that he studies, doesn’t do heroin or gamble — the minimum requirements,” she said.

However, she said she objected when she first learned that Mr. Law had become a leader of a pro-democracy group at his university.

“I just wanted stability,” she said.

“If everyone is selfish, society will not change,” she recalled her son responding.

She said she had another reason for feeling dread. Growing up in China, she had seen the political violence of the Cultural Revolution. She feared that challenging power would only bring retribution.

On the first night of the Umbrella Revolution, she said she huddled in a hotel room with relatives, worried sick.

“He’s young. He’s inexperienced. He has not been through the kind of purge that happened on the mainland,” Ms. Lam said.

Now, she said, her fears have been borne out.

Much of the special was simply Mr. O’Brien unscripted, making a connection with game strangers and turning that into an amusing scene. But he didn’t only stay light. When he traveled to the West Bank barrier, he bumped into pro-Palestinian activists, who criticized Zionism, describing a Palestinian girl killed by an Israeli settler. He spent most of this awkward but compelling exchange listening, without defensiveness, and then posted the entire 24-minute segment online. Inevitably, his show was criticized for bias, but wading into this dispute, even clumsily, displayed an admirable willingness to take risks.

The increasing politicization of late-night comedy has been great for ratings, and has helped certain hosts find their voices, but it’s worth examining if it comes at a cost.

The fires, combined with car exhaust, smokestack emissions and the burning of garbage, contribute to pollution levels that often hover in the “severe” category, the highest level designated by the Central Pollution Control Board.

An article last month in the medical journal The Lancet found that pollution was responsible for up to 2.5 million deaths in India in 2015, more than in any other country.

Manish Sisodia, the deputy chief minister of Delhi, said on Tuesday that “all options” for reducing pollution were being considered. The government has suggested reintroducing an alternate-days limit on the use of private cars, and to using helicopters to sprinkle water to help clear the air.

At a news conference late Tuesday, Mr. Sisodia announced that classes at primary schools would be suspended on Wednesday, and possibly longer. Last year, the government temporarily closed more than 1,800 schools after a string of especially polluted days.

Dr. Sarath K. Guttikunda, an air pollution specialist and the director of the independent research group Urban Emissions, said that keeping children at home could reduce their exposure to air pollution, especially in areas where vehicles emissions are high.

But Dr. Kumar, the chest surgeon, said he was unconvinced by the government’s approach to curbing pollution. The problem would continue, he added, unless the city’s residents put greater collective pressure on politicians to devise sustainable solutions.

Fewer than one in three adults identified alcohol as a risk factor for cancer. (Most also failed to mention obesity as a risk factor.)

The doctors’ group is also calling for new public health initiatives to curb alcohol use, from taxes to restrictions on ads targeting minors, like the new ban on alcohol advertising on New York City’s subways and buses slated to go into effect in January. The group likewise opposes “pink washing,” in which alcohol companies drape their products in pink ribbon to enhance sales, a practice it opposes “given the consistent evidence that shows the link between alcohol consumption and an increased risk of breast cancer.”

For the statement, ASCO researchers reviewed earlier published studies and concluded that 5.5 percent of all new cancers and 5.8 percent of all cancer deaths worldwide could be attributed to alcohol. The paper stated clearly that alcohol plays a causal role in cancers of the throat and neck, voice box, liver and colon, as well as esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and, in women, breast cancer.

For women, just one alcoholic drink a day can increase breast cancer risk, according to a report released in May from the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund that was cited by ASCO. That report analyzed 119 studies, including data on 12 million women and over a quarter of a million breast cancer cases, and concluded there was strong evidence that alcohol consumption increases the risk of both pre- and postmenopausal cancer, and that drinking a small glass of wine or beer every day — about 10 grams of alcohol — increases premenopausal breast cancer risk by 5 percent and postmenopausal risk by 9 percent.

“The more you drink, the higher the risk,” said Dr. Clifford A. Hudis, the chief executive of ASCO. “It’s a pretty linear dose-response.”

Even those who drink moderately, defined by the Centers for Disease Control as one daily drink for women and two for men, face nearly a doubling of the risk for mouth and throat cancer and more than double the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, compared to nondrinkers. Moderate drinkers also face elevated risks for cancers of the voice box, female breast cancer and colorectal cancers.

The risk for heavy drinkers — defined as eight or more drinks a week for women and 15 or more a week for men, including binge drinkers — are multiples higher. Heavy drinkers face roughly five times the risk of mouth and throat cancers and squamous cell esophageal cancers than nondrinkers, nearly three times the risk of cancers of the voice box or larynx, double the risk of liver cancer, as well as increased risks for female breast cancer and colorectal cancer.

“If you look at these figures, you see alcohol is a contributing factor; certainly it has a causal role,” Dr. Hudis said.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the World Health Organization, first classified the consumption of alcoholic beverages as carcinogenic to humans in 1987, tying consumption to cancers of the mouth, throat, voice box, esophagus and liver, said Susan Gapstur, vice president for epidemiology at the American Cancer Society.

Since then, she said, more and more evidence has accumulated tying alcohol to a broader group of cancers, including colorectal cancer and, in women, breast cancer. A more recent I.A.R.C. report concluded that alcohol “is a cause of cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, colorectum, liver and female breast.” (The esophageal cancer is largely specific to squamous cell carcinoma.)

“The story of alcohol has been quite consistent and has been peeled away like an onion over time, and we’re continuing to learn more about the mechanisms involved,” Dr. Gapstur said. “We don’t have randomized trials, but sometimes when you start looking at the coherence of all the evidence, including the observational epidemiology, the lab studies, the mechanistic studies, you begin to see a picture and get more clarity.”

One way alcohol may lead to cancer is because the body metabolizes it into acetaldehyde, which causes changes and mutations in DNA, Dr. Gapstur said. The formation of acetaldehyde starts when alcohol comes in contact with bacteria in the mouth, which may explain the link between alcohol and cancers of the throat, voice box and esophagus, she suggested.

Dr. Anne McTiernan, a scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who was an author of one of the earlier reports on alcohol and breast cancer, said she was pleased that oncologists were focusing on alcohol.

“That puts some weight behind this,” she said. It “shows they’re serious about it and willing to put their name on the line for changes in policy, and willing to say that even small amounts of alcohol can increase the risks of some cancers to a small degree.”",Cancer Doctors Cite Risks of Drinking Alcohol,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/well/live/cancer-doctors-cite-risks-of-drinking-alcohol.html

The couple collaborated on screenplays. Warren Beatty dropped by their Malibu beach house and flirted with her. In public, she hid behind big sunglasses and a little voice. In photographs, the angle of her hips and dangle of her cigarette were just so.

Those volumes include this sentence, about an awakening: “That was the year, my twenty-eighth, when I was discovering that not all of the promises would be kept, that some things are in fact irrevocable and that it had counted after all, every evasion and every procrastination, every mistake, every word, all of it.”

And this sentence, about college in the 1950s: “I suppose I am talking about just that: the ambiguity of belonging to a generation distrustful of political highs, the historical irrelevancy of growing up convinced that the heart of darkness lay not in some error of social organization but in man’s own blood.”

Last year, the release of the Panama Papers caused a huge sensation across the globe, exposing a hidden world of wealth held offshore. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists brought together hundreds of reporters from around the world to examine the millions of documents that were leaked to two reporters at the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. For their work, the I.C.I.J. won the Pulitzer Prize for explanatory reporting.

The New York Times was not part of that team. Like many reporters here, I spent a lot of time scrambling to make sense of what the I.C.I.J. had uncovered, writing follow-on stories. Breathing fumes.

This year, with the publication of the Paradise Papers — an extensive leak of documents primarily from a Bermudan law firm — we were on the inside. Working under Rebecca Corbett, The Times’s investigations editor, Mike McIntire, Jesse Drucker, Scott Shane and I joined up with close to 400 reporters around the world, spending much of this year sifting through some of the more than 13 million files.

It was exciting. But it was also unnerving.

The conversation we’re not having in this country is: How do we fund colleges and universities?”However the admissions process might evolve, it surely will continue to serve the interests of colleges first and foremost.","Whatever happens, age-old questions about fairness in admissions will surely endure. For one thing, the nation can’t come to terms with a tricky five-letter word: merit. Michael Young, a British sociologist, coined the pejorative term “meritocracy” over a half-century ago to describe a future in which standardized intelligence tests would crown a new elite. Yet as Rebecca Zwick explains in her new book “Who Gets In?” the meaning has shifted. The word “merit,” she writes, has come to mean “academic excellence, narrowly defined” as grades and test scores.

But that’s just one way to think of an applicant’s worthiness. Dr. Zwick, professor emeritus at the University of California at Santa Barbara, has long been a researcher at the Educational Testing Service, which develops and administers the SAT. She disputes the notion that testing prowess — or any other attribute, for that matter — entitles a student to a spot at his chosen college. “There is, in fact, no absolute definition of merit,” she writes.

That brings us to you, the anxious applicant, the frazzled parent, the confused citizen, all wondering what colleges want. It’s worth taking a deep breath and noting that only 13 percent of four-year colleges accept fewer than half of their applicants. That said, colleges where seats are scarce stir up the nation’s emotions. Each year, the world-famous institutions reject thousands and thousands of students who could thrive there.

Yes, rejection stings. But say these words aloud: The admissions process isn’t fair. Like it or not, colleges aren’t looking to reel in the greatest number of straight-A students who’ve taken seven or more Advanced Placement courses. A rejection isn’t really about you; it’s about a maddening mishmash of competing objectives.

Just as parents give teenagers a set of chores, colleges hand their admissions leaders a list of things to accomplish. When they fail, they often get fired.

“We don’t live in a cloud — the reality is, there’s a bottom line,” said Angel B. Pérez, vice president for enrollment and student success at Trinity College, in Hartford. “We’re an institution, but we’re also a business.”

On many campuses, financial concerns affect decisions about whom to admit. A recent report by the National Association for College Admission Counseling found that about half of institutions said an applicant’s “ability to pay” was of at least “some importance” in admissions decisions. Among other targets is geographic diversity, which is now seen as an indicator of institutional strength and popularity. (Some presidents have been known to gripe if the freshman class doesn’t represent all 50 states.) A campus might also need a particular number of engineering majors or goalies.

Indeed, a college could accept 33 percent of all applicants, but that doesn’t mean each applicant has a one-in-three chance. Success depends on what a student brings to the table.

Generally, nothing carries more weight in admissions than grades (plus strength of the high school curriculum) and ACT/SAT scores. With limited time and resources, those metrics offer a relatively quick way to predict who will succeed. But the measures have drawbacks. Grade inflation has complicated the task of evaluating achievements, and so has the variance in high school grading policies. Standardized test scores correlate with family income; white and Asian-American students fare better than black and Hispanic students do. Also, when colleges talk about predicting “success,” they usually mean first-year grades — a limited definition.

And so, many colleges rely on “holistic” evaluations, allowing colleges to contextualize applicants’ academic records and to identify disadvantaged students who might lack the sparkling credentials of their affluent peers. Did they attend low-performing high schools or well-resourced ones? Did they participate in extracurricular activities? Do they have leadership experience?

What colleges look for sends a powerful message about what matters, not just to admissions officers but in life, and students often respond accordingly.

Dr. Pérez, a first-generation college student who grew up in a low-income family, recently revamped Trinity’s process to better identify promising students, particularly the disadvantaged. While reading applications, its admissions officers now look for evidence of 13 characteristics — including curiosity, empathy, openness to change and ability to overcome adversity — that researchers associate with successful students. These are also qualities that the liberal-arts college values, inside and outside the classroom.

Trinity’s officers can check as many qualities as apply using a drop-down box labeled “Predictors of Success.” They must note where they saw evidence of each quality in the application. “It can’t be just a hint,” Dr. Pérez said. He recalls a teacher recommendation describing how an applicant had taken a stand on a controversial social issue in class, even though other students vocally disagreed with him. Impressed, Dr. Pérez checked the box for “Comfort in Minority of 1,” a sign, perhaps, that the student would contribute to campus dialogues. Also on the drop-down: “Delayed Gratification” and “Risk Taking.”

While Trinity still values conventional measures, the new model has expanded the staff’s understanding of merit. “We’re trying to give students more credit for these characteristics, especially those who’ve had some challenges,” Dr. Pérez said. The new approach, along with the college’s recent decision to stop requiring ACT/SAT scores, has helped it diversify its classes. Low-income and first-generation students represent 15 percent of this fall’s freshman class, up from 8 percent three years ago.

“I’m trying to increase the tools we have, and get beyond a system that is absolutely antiquated,” Dr. Pérez said. “As the country becomes more diverse, as we learn more about the correlation between standardized test scores and wealth, we have to be a lot more creative in predicting for success in college.”

What most colleges ask for from applicants doesn’t reveal much about the many skills and talents a student might possess. But what if colleges asked for more?

The admissions process at Olin College of Engineering includes a live audition. After completing a traditional application, selected students visit the campus, in Needham, Mass., for an intense two-day tryout. In addition to sitting for interviews, they work in small groups to complete a tabletop design challenge, such as building a tower that can hold a specific weight. On the second day, they are given another task, like designing a campus building. This time, evaluators observe each student, noting how well they communicate with others and adapt on the fly.

The experience is meant to help prospective students understand Olin’s collaborative culture, while giving the college a better glimpse of each applicant before finalizing acceptance. “It’s hard to nail down a student’s mind-set from the traditional elements of the application,” said Emily Roper-Doten, the dean of admission and financial aid. “This allows us to see them in motion, in an educational moment.”

A desire to see what students can do with their hands inspired a recent change at one of the world’s most renowned campuses. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (motto: “Mens et manus,” Latin for “Mind and hand”) now gives applicants the option of submitting a Maker Portfolio to show their “technical creativity.”

Applicants can send images, a short video and a PDF that shed light on a project they’ve undertaken — clothing they’ve made, apps they’ve designed, cakes they’ve baked, furniture they’ve built, chain mail they’ve woven. M.I.T. also asks students to explain what the project meant to them, as well as how much help they got. A panel of faculty members and alumni reviews the portfolios.

Last year, about 5 percent of applicants submitted a Makers Portfolio. “It gives us a fuller picture of the student,” said Stuart Schmill, dean of admissions and student financial services. “Without this, some applicants might not be able to fully get across how good a fit they are for us.”

M.I.T.’s experiment has sparked discussions among admissions deans, some of whom say they plan to offer similar opportunities for applicants to send evidence of project-based learning. They describe the Makers Portfolio as an intriguing glimpse of how a college might better align its process with its culture and values. The catch: Reviewing all those portfolios takes time, something admissions offices lack. Even a small college like Olin, which welcomed fewer than 100 new students this fall, must scramble to pull off its elaborate evaluations. Larger campuses couldn’t even consider such an approach.

Thorough review has become more challenging over the last decade, with waves of applicants overwhelming big-name colleges, victims of their own popularity. The University of California at Los Angeles received more than 100,000 applications for about 6,000 spots this fall. Stanford got 44,000 for just over 1,700 spots, and M.I.T. juggled more than 20,000 for 1,450 seats.

Most colleges are considering more incremental ways to enhance evaluations. The Coalition for Access, Affordability and Success, with more than 130 prominent campuses as members, recently established an application platform with a feature called a virtual college locker, a private space where students can upload materials, such as videos and written work, that they could later add to their applications. Among its stated goals: to make admissions more personal.

So far, most of its members aren’t asking applicants to send anything different than before. But that could change. A handful of colleges are planning experiments using alternative ways to measure student potential. One hopes to enable applicants to demonstrate their “emotional intelligence,” or E.Q., to showcase their ability to work with others, according to Annie Reznik, the coalition’s executive director. Another seeks a way for prospective students to display their “fire” for learning.

“We want better inputs,” said Jeremiah Quinlan, dean of undergraduate admissions and financial aid at Yale. “The inputs we have predict success academically. Now, we have the ability to get to know a student better, from a different type of submission.”

Like many deans, Mr. Quinlan has grown wary of polished personal essays in which applicants describe their achievements. “They feel like they have to show off, because we’re so selective,” he said, “and it’s completely understandable.” Technology, he believes, can help colleges get to know the student beneath the surface of a résumé, to gain a better sense of their passions, the kind of community member the applicant might be.

Last year, Yale allowed students using the coalition’s application to submit a document, image, audio file or video in response to a prompt (they also had to reflect, in 250 words or less, on their submission). When Justin Aubin heard about that option last fall, he thought, “Cool!”

Mr. Aubin, from Oak Lawn, Ill., was then a high school senior hoping to attend Yale. The following prompt caught his eye: “A community to which you belong and the footprint you have left.” He submitted a short video documenting his Eagle Scout project, for which he oversaw the construction of a monument honoring veterans. Even a well-written essay, he figured, couldn’t capture his experience as well as four minutes of footage, shot by his older brother.

The content of the video impressed Yale’s admissions committee. “People sat up in their chairs,” Mr. Quinlan said. “You could see how he handled his leadership role, and we felt like we got a good sense of him in a way that we didn’t get from recommendations.”

Mr. Aubin is now a freshman at Yale.

Did the video tip the scales? “That was a difference-maker,” Mr. Quinlan said.

•

Even as colleges consider innovation, it’s worth asking which fixtures of the admissions process, if any, they are willing to discard. Some prevalent practices seem to stand in the way of meaningful change.

Giving an advantage to the sons and daughters of alumni is one such practice. Some colleges admit legacies (and the children of potential donors) at a much greater rate than non-legacies. Legacies make up nearly a third of Harvard’s current freshman class, The Harvard Crimson has reported. Princeton’s class of 2021 is 13 percent legacy, according to the university’s website.

While a handful of prominent institutions, including the University of Georgia and Texas A&M University, stopped considering legacy status more than a decade ago, most colleges seem unlikely to remove that variable from the admissions equation anytime soon. “I don’t think an applicant’s legacy status is a crazy thing to look at, especially in the financial climate some colleges are in,” said Rick Clark, director of undergraduate admission at Georgia Tech, where nearly a fifth of freshmen are legacies. “Colleges have to think about their longevity.”

The benefits of legacies go beyond maintaining good will with alumni who might open their wallets, Mr. Clark said. In his experience, they tend to be enthusiastic students who help foster community on campus, the kind of relationships that help other students feel at home and succeed. “Multigenerational ties to a place add value, creating this passionate, magnetic source of energy,” he said.

The key, Mr. Clark believes, is not to lower standards, or to enroll so many legacies that other priorities, such as increasing racial and socioeconomic diversity, suffer as a result. “Those two goals aren’t mutually exclusive,” he said.

Other measurements used by selective colleges have nothing to do with a student’s accomplishments or attributes — and everything to do with a college’s agenda.

About one in five institutions allot “considerable importance” to “demonstrated interest,” the degree to which applicants convey their desire to enroll if accepted, according to a survey by the National Association for College Admission Counseling. The strongest expression of demonstrated interest is applying for binding early decision, a policy that favors affluent students who don’t need to compare financial aid offers and one that some colleges use to fill half their seats.

Beyond that, technology has made it easier to track the number of times an applicant engages with a college (by visiting the campus, contacting an admissions officer, responding to an email). This valuable information helps officers gauge who’s most likely to enroll, which can influence who gets admitted in the first place. A higher “yield,” the percentage of accepted students who actually enroll, is widely seen as a measure of status.

The problem is that savvy students who know colleges are watching them can tilt the odds in their favor, said Nancy Leopold, executive director of CollegeTracks, a Maryland nonprofit group that helps low-income and first-generation students get into college: “Demonstrated interest is biased against kids who don’t know the game exists, or who don’t have the time or money to play it.”

What do colleges really cherish? The answer is influenced greatly by the entities they seek to impress. U.S. News & World Report and other college guides, not to mention bond-rating agencies, rely heavily on conventional admissions metrics like ACT/SAT scores and acceptance rates to evaluate institutions. A college president might wish to attract more creative thinkers, but accomplishing that goal won’t help his college’s ranking.

Generally, colleges are risk-averse. Rocking the boat with a newfangled admissions process could hurt their reputations. “The challenge for many admissions offices is to make a change, but not so much change or innovation that you’re risking the position you’re in,” said Ms. Roper-Doten of Olin. Asking students to do more could scare off would-be applicants.

“Colleges seek validation,” said Lloyd Thacker, executive director of the Education Conservancy, a nonprofit group that has sought to reform college admissions. “Without a real external incentive for colleges to care about broadening their understanding of what makes an applicant promising, they don’t seem likely to change the definition on their own.”

A recent campaign called “Turning the Tide,” a project of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, is urging admissions deans to rethink the qualities they consider in applicants. In a report signed by representatives of about 200 campuses, colleges are asked to promote ethical character and service to others through the admissions process.

Although some deans say they have no business assessing the character of still-maturing teenagers, the push has prompted a handful of institutions to tweak their applications. The University of North Carolina now emphasizes contributions to others when asking about extracurricular activities. M.I.T. added an essay question asking students to describe how they’ve helped people.

Richard Weissbourd, a senior lecturer at Harvard, who leads the initiative, recommends that colleges define service in ways that might resonate with disadvantaged students. “Many students don’t have opportunities to do community service,” he said. “They’re taking care of their siblings, or they’re working part-time jobs to help their families. Colleges need to say, ‘That matters to us.’ ”

•

In the end, increasing racial and socioeconomic diversity in higher education is a matter of will. A college can prioritize it or not, said Shaun R. Harper, a professor at the University of Southern California’s Rossier School of Education who studies race and student success.

In September, Dr. Harper gave a keynote speech at the annual conference of the National Association for College Admission Counseling, in Boston. He urged his audience to think hard about racial inequality and “things you perhaps inadvertently and unknowingly do to support it.”

He cited as examples high school counselors who discourage promising minority students from applying to highly selective colleges; college leaders who say they “just can’t find enough” qualified black applicants even as their athletics coaches comb the nation for black students who excel at sports; admissions officers who recruit at the same high schools year after year, overlooking those full of underrepresented minorities.

As Dr. Harper spoke, many listeners applauded; a few scowled. He concluded his remarks by criticizing the lack of racial diversity among admissions deans themselves. He received a standing ovation.

In a subsequent interview, Dr. Harper elaborated on his concerns. “When the demographics of the profession have not changed, particularly at the senior level,” he said, “I don’t know that we can expect a major change, especially in terms of diversifying the class.”

Although Dr. Harper believes colleges rely too heavily on ACT/SAT scores, he says that the major barriers arise well before the application process even begins. Colleges, he said, must do more in terms of outreach to encourage underrepresented students to apply.

Dr. Pérez, at Trinity, has similar concerns. Although he is convinced that the selection process can be successfully revamped, he doesn’t think that will solve the No. 1 problem he sees in admissions. “The problem is money,” he said. “If I had more funding, my class would be more diverse. The conversation we’re not having in this country is: How do we fund colleges and universities?”

However the admissions process might evolve, it surely will continue to serve the interests of colleges first and foremost. Even if someone invents a better, more equitable way to gauge applicants’ potential, a college’s many wants and needs wouldn’t change. Deans would still seek to balance their classes by enrolling a diverse mix of majors from many states and countries. Colleges would still need enough oboe players and theater-arts majors.

“What compels institutions to change is deep discontent,” said Marie Bigham, director of college counseling at Isidore Newman School, in New Orleans. “If they’re only making changes on the margins, it indicates that they’re mostly content with the way things are.”

That leads to a big question in an age of widening social inequality. How unhappy are the wealthiest colleges, really, with the status quo? Some of the nation’s most selective institutions enroll more students from the top 1 percent of the income ladder than from the bottom 60 percent. Is that simply because of lack of preparation in the K-12 system? Flaws within the selection process? Or is it evidence, as Dr. Harper suggests, of a systemic lack of will to change those numbers?

Jon Boeckenstedt, associate vice president for enrollment management and marketing at DePaul University, says that it is the high-profile colleges that have the power to redefine the admissions process.

“Unless and until something changes at the top, nothing else is going to change,” he said. “That’s because, at a lot of colleges, people will go to their graves trying to imitate the Ivy League.”",What Colleges Want in an Applicant (Everything),https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/education/edlife/what-college-admissions-wants.html

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Everyone have a glass of milk ready? Thanks to Herre Schouwerwou, we have a tasty snack in our puzzle today. We’re just going to have to find it.

Today’s Theme

This isn’t going to be as simple as taking your snack out of a cardboard box. It’s midweek, so you’re going to have to do a little detective work.

As it happens, our snack today is on both sides of a black square, as the revealer clues at 54- and 56A say. We are told that the lunchbox items we are looking for are ANIMAL CRACKERS, and the four that we are given are “cracked” by that black square.

Still don’t see them? Here’s one: 17A is MCGREGOR and 18A is I’LL ASK, and the two entries are separated by a single black square. If you look closely and even scratch and sniff the entries, which have been scented to smell like the aforementioned ANIMAL CRACKERS so you can easily track them down [Don’t listen to her. And for the love of all that is holy, do not scratch your screens. Or your newspapers. — Ed.], the last letters of MCGREGOR and the first letters of I’LL ASK spell out the cracked GORILLA:

MCGREGOR / I’LL ASK

Now you find the other CRACKERS, and don’t forget to drink your milk.

Tricky Clues

24D: I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that this is more of a West Coast thing, but the portmanteau of “smoke” and “haze” is SMAZE.

35D: BOATS take you from riverbank to riverbank, so they are the “Connection between banks?”

Constructor Notes

DISCLAIMER: No animals were harmed in the making of this puzzle. I don’t recall the exact inspiration for this puzzle, but I was probably hungry and noticed an animal split between two entries in another crossword. To limit the theme choices, I decided to use only animals in the current Barnum’s box (according to Wikipedia) that were five letters or longer. The other decision was where to place the revealer. I’m not a fan of center placement and that would mean changing the grid to 14 or 16 squares wide or just having ANIMAL CRACKER, which wasn’t great. You can’t eat just one! So I went with the “cracked” revealer that fortunately echoed the theme. Will liked the concept, but asked to remove some iffy fill and to replace HIPPO, which was the only shortened entry. Of two revised submissions, the one that had the longest split entries was chosen over the one that had VEGANS crossing ANIMAL. Kudos to Will and Joel for the double “parked” clues for 49- and 50-Across. Hope this satisfies your crossword snacking pleasure!

Ralph Northam’s election as Virginia governor amid reportedly high turnout on Tuesday is a stinging and welcome rebuke to President Trump and white nationalism.

Mr. Northam’s Republican rival, Ed Gillespie, an establishment operative, chose to dog-whistle himself breathless in pursuit of the state’s pro-Trump white voters, and the president attested to his make-America-great-again credentials. By late Tuesday, though, Mr. Trump was trying to sidle away from Mr. Gillespie, claiming that a candidate who sacrificed his own reputation to adopt the president’s style and positions in fact “did not embrace me or what I stand for.” Mr. Gillespie did, and he lost.

Virginia and New Jersey, where Democrat Phil Murphy easily won the governor’s race, were the first statewide general elections since Donald Trump won the presidency a year ago, and Virginia, the only southern state Hillary Clinton won in 2016, was by far the more consequential of the two. Late Tuesday Democrats were also registering gains in the Virginia House of Delegates, suggesting strong disapproval of Mr. Trump at the grass roots.

Having been nearly vanquished in the primary by Corey Stewart, an anti-immigrant conspiracy theorist who played on issues like preserving Confederate monuments, Mr. Gillespie, at the advice of Republican leaders, took up race-baiting. His ads, featuring menacing tattooed men, accused Mr. Northam of being “weak on MS-13,” the gang formed by Central American immigrants in Los Angeles that now threatens Virginia suburbs. They contained some of the darkest appeals in Tuesday’s off-year contests — and that’s saying something, given the Republican candidate ads that aired in places like Nassau County, N.Y., and New Jersey.

On Tuesday, water and electricity to the camp were shut off, and detainees were supposed to move to temporary housing in Lorengau, a city close by on the island.

Many of the men refused, citing previous attacks by residents in Lorengau. Instead the migrants barricaded themselves inside, using solar power for their phones and digging wells for water as police cars circled.

“It’s very surprising to see it come to this level,” said Jonathan Pryke, Pacific Islands program director for the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. “It just seems like a complete mess.”

By Thursday, conditions in the camp appeared to have declined.

One detainee, Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist from Iran, said the men were experiencing dehydration, hunger, anxiety and the fear of attack and disease.

“Heat, humidity, hunger and incessant mosquitoes are taking their toll,” Mr. Boochani wrote on Facebook. “This is not a hunger strike. It is a situation that the Australian government has created, forcing people into starvation and these harsh conditions by refusing to offer a safe place for resettlement.”

By Friday, detainees said conditions were leading to illness. One asylum seeker, Imran Mohammad, said in a text message that three diabetic men had fallen ill because they were unable to get insulin, and the camp was strewn with garbage.

Who is responsible?

The governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea each claim the other is responsible for relocating the men until a permanent solution can be found.

Australia has pledged 250 million Australian dollars, or $193 million, for the men’s food and security at the facilities in Lorengau for the next year.

Julie Bishop, Australia’s foreign minister, said on Thursday that it made “no sense” for the detainees to remain at the camp. But Nat Jit Lam, the regional representative of the United Nations’ refugee agency, said the temporary housing was incomplete and unsafe.

“I will not be bringing any refugee there to stay — not in that state,” Mr. Lam told ABC Radio of Australia.

In a statement issued Thursday, the agency said: “Australia remains responsible for the well-being of all those moved to Papua New Guinea until adequate, long-term solutions outside the country are found.”

What will happen to the detainees?

Australia has consistently said it will not accept the men for resettlement.

They have all been given the option of permanent residency in Papua New Guinea, or applying to resettle in Cambodia or Nauru, the location of a second offshore facility run by the Australian government. None of the men still on Manus have accepted the offer, according to reports.

American officials said dozens if not hundreds of refugees from Manus and Nauru would be accepted in the coming weeks and months. About 50 men already moved to the United States in September under a deal brokered by former President Barack Obama.

Jacinda Ardern, the new prime minister of New Zealand, also said this week she would an honor a predecessor’s pledge to accept 150 refugees. The Australian government has been reluctant to allow New Zealand to accept the men, fearing it would open a legal backdoor to Australia.

The staff changed its technique, re-vasectomized about 75 chimps with the new method, and hasn’t had a pregnancy since.

The sanctuary also has learned to care for frail chimps. Many animals from labs have been infected with H.I.V. and hepatitis for vaccine experiments, and some have diabetes (not related to experiments).

They are often old: Some arrive near 50 years of age, and the lifespan of chimps in captivity runs from 50 to 60 years. Occasionally chimps are deemed too old even to handle the stress of being sent to the sanctuary.

The sanctuaries hope eventually to put themselves out of business. If all goes as planned, in another 50 years or so, there will be no more lab retirees.

Chimps will still be in zoos and, as the laws now stand, private owners could still breed them. But since the demand for their use in research is now zero, that is unlikely to happen on a large scale.

Most privately owned laboratory chimpanzees are also headed for retirement centers. New Iberia has shipped 22 animals to Project Chimps, where Bo and his cohort now live, but still has nearly 200.

The Project Chimps facility, which formerly housed gorillas, is still being renovated for chimps. They will get to play in eight acres of walled-in open space, with trees, a stream and an open meadow — once the walls are fixed. (Unlike gorillas, chimps are agile climbers.)

Those left at New Iberia aren’t isolated. They live in groups in large, dome-shaped outdoor cages. The domes have a bit less than a 1,000 square feet of floor space.

Although chimps in research were once housed in smaller cages, and in isolation for experiments, practices have changed; labs and sanctuaries have recognized that it is cruel to house chimps alone.

The only other private chimps still at research institutions include 46 owned by the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta, and one at Georgia State University. Yerkes is looking for retirement facilities for its chimps and has sent seven to the Chattanooga Zoo.

Yerkes also sent eight chimpanzees to an unaccredited zoo in England, prompting an outcry from animal welfare advocates in this country and in Europe. The move prompted a lawsuit, because the Fish and Wildlife Service approved it even though advocates insisted there were better options in the United States.

She said companies could choose not to do business with governments whose actions they found troubling, but many of today’s tech companies have lost a moral compass. “There is an elitism that makes it far too easy for them to rationalize their behavior with their belief that they are the smartest guys — and, yes, it’s always guys — in the room,” she said.

Unsurprisingly, this is not a topic many people want to talk about. SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that runs the $100 billion Vision Fund, which is shelling out eye-popping investments in tech companies, declined to comment for this column. Nearly half of the Vision Fund, about $45 billion, comes from the Saudi Public Investment Fund.

WeWork and Slack, two prominent start-ups that have received recent investments from the Vision Fund, also declined to comment. So did Uber, which garnered a $3.5 billion investment from the Public Investment Fund in 2016, and which is in talks to receive a big investment from the SoftBank fund. The Public Investment Fund also did not return a request for comment.

Twitter, which got a $300 million investment from Prince Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding Company in 2011 — around the same time that it was talking up its role in the Arab Spring — declined to comment on his arrest. Lyft, which received $105 million from Prince Alwaleed in 2015, also declined to comment.

Privately, several founders, investors and others at tech companies who have taken money from the Saudi government or prominent members of the royal family did offer insight into their thinking. Prince Alwaleed, some pointed out, was not aligned with the Saudi government — his arrest by the government underscores this — and he has advocated for some progressive reforms, including giving women the right to drive, a restriction that the kingdom says will be lifted next year.

The founders and investors also brought up the Saudi government’s supposed push for modernization. The Saudis have outlined a long-term plan, Vision 2030, that calls for a reduction in the state’s dependence on oil and a gradual loosening on economic and social restrictions, including a call for greater numbers of women to enter the work force. The gauzy vision allows tech companies to claim to be part of the solution in Saudi Arabia rather than part the problem: Sure, they are taking money from one of the world’s least transparent and most undemocratic regimes, but it’s the part of the government that wants to do better.

Another mitigating factor, for some, is the sometimes indirect nature of the Saudi investments. When the SoftBank Vision Fund invests tens of millions or billions into a tech company, it’s true that half of that money is coming from Saudi Arabia. But it’s SoftBank that has control over the course of the investment and communicates with founders. The passive nature of the Saudi investment in SoftBank’s fund thus allows founders to sleep better at night.

On the other hand, it also has a tendency to sweep the Saudi money under the rug. When SoftBank invests in a company, the Saudi connection is not always made clear to employees and customers. You get to enjoy the convenience of your WeWork without having to confront its place in the Saudi government’s portfolio.

Then, finally, there’s the justification of desperation. Some companies don’t have any choice but to take money that’s offered to them. (In 2009, The New York Times Company took a loan from the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, who has been criticized for gaining his wealth through close connections with government officials.)

But the tech companies that the Saudis are itching to invest in often do have a choice; they are some of the most highly valued companies of our era, and many of them have no immediate need for more money. For instance: Slack, which raised $250 million from SoftBank last month, said it had no plans for spending the money and instead had raised it to preserve long-term “operational flexibility.”

But why take it from the Saudis? I suspect it’s the most obvious reason: because the money is there, and no one is making too big a fuss about it.

It used to be that most of the money in tech came from more vaunted sources — universities, philanthropies, pension plans and other nonprofits, which made up the bulk of funders to venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.

Now we’re in a new era, when giant pools of money splash through sleek-sounding Vision Funds and come out seeming squeaky clean — and ready to fund the next great thing to make the world so much better, we promise.",Saudi Money Fuels the Tech Industry.

“Church may be one of our last places of refuge. Now it’s as if that is even being challenged,” said Joey Spann, the pastor of Burnette Chapel Church of Christ near Nashville, on Tuesday. Mr. Spann was shot in the hand and chest on Sept. 24. That Sunday, a 25-year-old former congregant waited in the parking lot for people to leave the morning service then opened fire, killing a mother of two and injuring seven others.

Such violence, Mr. Spann said, “won’t overcome the church, the Bible promises us that. But it seems like even that place of refuge is being taken from us.”

Violent attacks at houses of worship are not new. White Southerners opposed to racial integration bombed a number of African-American churches in the Deep South in the 1950s and ’60s. Most infamous was the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963, which killed four young girls.

But violence has escalated in recent years. The suspect in the attack at Mr. Spann’s church in Nashville, who as a child came here as a refugee from Sudan, left a note in his car referring to Dylann S. Roof, the white man who killed nine black people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.

In the five years since the attack on the Sikh temple, by an Army veteran with ties to white supremacist groups, its worshipers have done their best to move forward. They forgave the assailant, Wade M. Page, “that very day,” Mr. Singh said. They have strengthened their bonds with members of the community, a mostly white, working-class town of 36,000 along the shore of Lake Michigan.

Willi Glee, 77, a member of Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, believes that for some attackers, religious spaces offer an added attraction, because defiling them is the ultimate taboo.

“The killer thinks he gets the most dramatic effect from that,” Mr. Glee said. “Because everybody expects that a house of worship is a safe place.”

At Emanuel A.M.E. Church, a bedrock of black Charleston that was founded in 1791, doors once left open are now locked. Visitors are allowed in after they announce their presence over an intercom system. Strangers’ bags are checked before services. A cast of retired military and on- and off-duty police officers remain vigilant.

Something similar happened at the Al-Furqan Jame Masjid, a mosque in Queens, N.Y. A little more than a year ago, the imam, Alauddin Akonjee, 55, and his assistant, Thara Miah, 64, were shot dead after leaving afternoon prayers on a busy street close to the mosque.

A suspect, Oscar Morel, was later brought into custody, before pleading not guilty to murder charges. Since the shooting, surveillance cameras have been set up around the mosque’s perimeter, and the local police precinct has been made aware of prayer times. Inside, vigilance is encouraged.

“We tell the people: ‘When you come inside, turn right and turn left,’” said Bazlur Rahman, 51, an official of the mosque, after afternoon prayers on Tuesday. “‘If you see someone suspicious — someone who is unknown to the community — tell us.’”

Inside the Sikh temple, there is another struggle. Family members of the people who were killed still come to worship, despite the lingering trauma. Of the nearly 500 people at the Sikh temple who regularly arrive for Sunday services, many still worry that they are vulnerable to another attack.

“If it happens one time, people are afraid that it will happen again,” Mr. Singh said.

In Charleston, the fear also lingers. In court testimony in January, Felicia Sanders, who witnessed the massacre there, described in aching terms how the shooting had haunted her.

“I can’t hear something as small as an acorn drop from out of a tree,” Ms. Sanders, the mother of one of the victims, said during the sentencing hearing for Mr. Roof, the gunman. “Most importantly, I cannot shut my eye to pray. I cannot shut my eye to pray. Even when I try, I cannot because I have to keep my eye on everyone that is around me. That is a sad day.”

There have also been good days — and stories of adaptation, transformation, healing and hope. Emanuel A.M.E. has become a site of pilgrimage for people around the world, including white Americans seeking communion with and forgiveness from their black neighbors.

At St. Peters Missionary Baptist Church in Dayton, Ohio, the Rev. William B. Schooler was fatally shot by his brother in February 2016 during a service. On Tuesday, Alberta Blayth, the church secretary, said that the incident had bound the congregants more tightly. “We are closer,” she said. “Let’s keep praying these things stop.”

In Tennessee, Mr. Spann said that his little church has in many ways been rejuvenated since the shooting. Sunday morning is now a celebration, a gathering of people who understand each other.

“A lot of good has come out of this,” he said. “The church is tighter, expresses love easier.”

He acknowledged the differences between what happened at Burnette Chapel and in Sutherland Springs. The sheer scale of death at the church in Texas, the murder of so many children and the smallness of the community will make it harder for them, and will perhaps be a stronger test of faith.

But both congregations have learned firsthand that there is darkness in the world, as much as people may want to deny it.

“It’s always going to be in front of you,” he said, referring to the memory of such shootings. “It’s always going to be discussed, it’s always going to be on your mind.

The conversation we’re not having in this country is: How do we fund colleges and universities?”However the admissions process might evolve, it surely will continue to serve the interests of colleges first and foremost.","Whatever happens, age-old questions about fairness in admissions will surely endure. For one thing, the nation can’t come to terms with a tricky five-letter word: merit. Michael Young, a British sociologist, coined the pejorative term “meritocracy” over a half-century ago to describe a future in which standardized intelligence tests would crown a new elite. Yet as Rebecca Zwick explains in her new book “Who Gets In?” the meaning has shifted. The word “merit,” she writes, has come to mean “academic excellence, narrowly defined” as grades and test scores.

But that’s just one way to think of an applicant’s worthiness. Dr. Zwick, professor emeritus at the University of California at Santa Barbara, has long been a researcher at the Educational Testing Service, which develops and administers the SAT. She disputes the notion that testing prowess — or any other attribute, for that matter — entitles a student to a spot at his chosen college. “There is, in fact, no absolute definition of merit,” she writes.

That brings us to you, the anxious applicant, the frazzled parent, the confused citizen, all wondering what colleges want. It’s worth taking a deep breath and noting that only 13 percent of four-year colleges accept fewer than half of their applicants. That said, colleges where seats are scarce stir up the nation’s emotions. Each year, the world-famous institutions reject thousands and thousands of students who could thrive there.

Yes, rejection stings. But say these words aloud: The admissions process isn’t fair. Like it or not, colleges aren’t looking to reel in the greatest number of straight-A students who’ve taken seven or more Advanced Placement courses. A rejection isn’t really about you; it’s about a maddening mishmash of competing objectives.

Just as parents give teenagers a set of chores, colleges hand their admissions leaders a list of things to accomplish. When they fail, they often get fired.

“We don’t live in a cloud — the reality is, there’s a bottom line,” said Angel B. Pérez, vice president for enrollment and student success at Trinity College, in Hartford. “We’re an institution, but we’re also a business.”

On many campuses, financial concerns affect decisions about whom to admit. A recent report by the National Association for College Admission Counseling found that about half of institutions said an applicant’s “ability to pay” was of at least “some importance” in admissions decisions. Among other targets is geographic diversity, which is now seen as an indicator of institutional strength and popularity. (Some presidents have been known to gripe if the freshman class doesn’t represent all 50 states.) A campus might also need a particular number of engineering majors or goalies.

Indeed, a college could accept 33 percent of all applicants, but that doesn’t mean each applicant has a one-in-three chance. Success depends on what a student brings to the table.

Generally, nothing carries more weight in admissions than grades (plus strength of the high school curriculum) and ACT/SAT scores. With limited time and resources, those metrics offer a relatively quick way to predict who will succeed. But the measures have drawbacks. Grade inflation has complicated the task of evaluating achievements, and so has the variance in high school grading policies. Standardized test scores correlate with family income; white and Asian-American students fare better than black and Hispanic students do. Also, when colleges talk about predicting “success,” they usually mean first-year grades — a limited definition.

And so, many colleges rely on “holistic” evaluations, allowing colleges to contextualize applicants’ academic records and to identify disadvantaged students who might lack the sparkling credentials of their affluent peers. Did they attend low-performing high schools or well-resourced ones? Did they participate in extracurricular activities? Do they have leadership experience?

What colleges look for sends a powerful message about what matters, not just to admissions officers but in life, and students often respond accordingly.

Dr. Pérez, a first-generation college student who grew up in a low-income family, recently revamped Trinity’s process to better identify promising students, particularly the disadvantaged. While reading applications, its admissions officers now look for evidence of 13 characteristics — including curiosity, empathy, openness to change and ability to overcome adversity — that researchers associate with successful students. These are also qualities that the liberal-arts college values, inside and outside the classroom.

Trinity’s officers can check as many qualities as apply using a drop-down box labeled “Predictors of Success.” They must note where they saw evidence of each quality in the application. “It can’t be just a hint,” Dr. Pérez said. He recalls a teacher recommendation describing how an applicant had taken a stand on a controversial social issue in class, even though other students vocally disagreed with him. Impressed, Dr. Pérez checked the box for “Comfort in Minority of 1,” a sign, perhaps, that the student would contribute to campus dialogues. Also on the drop-down: “Delayed Gratification” and “Risk Taking.”

While Trinity still values conventional measures, the new model has expanded the staff’s understanding of merit. “We’re trying to give students more credit for these characteristics, especially those who’ve had some challenges,” Dr. Pérez said. The new approach, along with the college’s recent decision to stop requiring ACT/SAT scores, has helped it diversify its classes. Low-income and first-generation students represent 15 percent of this fall’s freshman class, up from 8 percent three years ago.

“I’m trying to increase the tools we have, and get beyond a system that is absolutely antiquated,” Dr. Pérez said. “As the country becomes more diverse, as we learn more about the correlation between standardized test scores and wealth, we have to be a lot more creative in predicting for success in college.”

What most colleges ask for from applicants doesn’t reveal much about the many skills and talents a student might possess. But what if colleges asked for more?

The admissions process at Olin College of Engineering includes a live audition. After completing a traditional application, selected students visit the campus, in Needham, Mass., for an intense two-day tryout. In addition to sitting for interviews, they work in small groups to complete a tabletop design challenge, such as building a tower that can hold a specific weight. On the second day, they are given another task, like designing a campus building. This time, evaluators observe each student, noting how well they communicate with others and adapt on the fly.

The experience is meant to help prospective students understand Olin’s collaborative culture, while giving the college a better glimpse of each applicant before finalizing acceptance. “It’s hard to nail down a student’s mind-set from the traditional elements of the application,” said Emily Roper-Doten, the dean of admission and financial aid. “This allows us to see them in motion, in an educational moment.”

A desire to see what students can do with their hands inspired a recent change at one of the world’s most renowned campuses. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (motto: “Mens et manus,” Latin for “Mind and hand”) now gives applicants the option of submitting a Maker Portfolio to show their “technical creativity.”

Applicants can send images, a short video and a PDF that shed light on a project they’ve undertaken — clothing they’ve made, apps they’ve designed, cakes they’ve baked, furniture they’ve built, chain mail they’ve woven. M.I.T. also asks students to explain what the project meant to them, as well as how much help they got. A panel of faculty members and alumni reviews the portfolios.

Last year, about 5 percent of applicants submitted a Makers Portfolio. “It gives us a fuller picture of the student,” said Stuart Schmill, dean of admissions and student financial services. “Without this, some applicants might not be able to fully get across how good a fit they are for us.”

M.I.T.’s experiment has sparked discussions among admissions deans, some of whom say they plan to offer similar opportunities for applicants to send evidence of project-based learning. They describe the Makers Portfolio as an intriguing glimpse of how a college might better align its process with its culture and values. The catch: Reviewing all those portfolios takes time, something admissions offices lack. Even a small college like Olin, which welcomed fewer than 100 new students this fall, must scramble to pull off its elaborate evaluations. Larger campuses couldn’t even consider such an approach.

Thorough review has become more challenging over the last decade, with waves of applicants overwhelming big-name colleges, victims of their own popularity. The University of California at Los Angeles received more than 100,000 applications for about 6,000 spots this fall. Stanford got 44,000 for just over 1,700 spots, and M.I.T. juggled more than 20,000 for 1,450 seats.

Most colleges are considering more incremental ways to enhance evaluations. The Coalition for Access, Affordability and Success, with more than 130 prominent campuses as members, recently established an application platform with a feature called a virtual college locker, a private space where students can upload materials, such as videos and written work, that they could later add to their applications. Among its stated goals: to make admissions more personal.

So far, most of its members aren’t asking applicants to send anything different than before. But that could change. A handful of colleges are planning experiments using alternative ways to measure student potential. One hopes to enable applicants to demonstrate their “emotional intelligence,” or E.Q., to showcase their ability to work with others, according to Annie Reznik, the coalition’s executive director. Another seeks a way for prospective students to display their “fire” for learning.

“We want better inputs,” said Jeremiah Quinlan, dean of undergraduate admissions and financial aid at Yale. “The inputs we have predict success academically. Now, we have the ability to get to know a student better, from a different type of submission.”

Like many deans, Mr. Quinlan has grown wary of polished personal essays in which applicants describe their achievements. “They feel like they have to show off, because we’re so selective,” he said, “and it’s completely understandable.” Technology, he believes, can help colleges get to know the student beneath the surface of a résumé, to gain a better sense of their passions, the kind of community member the applicant might be.

Last year, Yale allowed students using the coalition’s application to submit a document, image, audio file or video in response to a prompt (they also had to reflect, in 250 words or less, on their submission). When Justin Aubin heard about that option last fall, he thought, “Cool!”

Mr. Aubin, from Oak Lawn, Ill., was then a high school senior hoping to attend Yale. The following prompt caught his eye: “A community to which you belong and the footprint you have left.” He submitted a short video documenting his Eagle Scout project, for which he oversaw the construction of a monument honoring veterans. Even a well-written essay, he figured, couldn’t capture his experience as well as four minutes of footage, shot by his older brother.

The content of the video impressed Yale’s admissions committee. “People sat up in their chairs,” Mr. Quinlan said. “You could see how he handled his leadership role, and we felt like we got a good sense of him in a way that we didn’t get from recommendations.”

Mr. Aubin is now a freshman at Yale.

Did the video tip the scales? “That was a difference-maker,” Mr. Quinlan said.

•

Even as colleges consider innovation, it’s worth asking which fixtures of the admissions process, if any, they are willing to discard. Some prevalent practices seem to stand in the way of meaningful change.

Giving an advantage to the sons and daughters of alumni is one such practice. Some colleges admit legacies (and the children of potential donors) at a much greater rate than non-legacies. Legacies make up nearly a third of Harvard’s current freshman class, The Harvard Crimson has reported. Princeton’s class of 2021 is 13 percent legacy, according to the university’s website.

While a handful of prominent institutions, including the University of Georgia and Texas A&M University, stopped considering legacy status more than a decade ago, most colleges seem unlikely to remove that variable from the admissions equation anytime soon. “I don’t think an applicant’s legacy status is a crazy thing to look at, especially in the financial climate some colleges are in,” said Rick Clark, director of undergraduate admission at Georgia Tech, where nearly a fifth of freshmen are legacies. “Colleges have to think about their longevity.”

The benefits of legacies go beyond maintaining good will with alumni who might open their wallets, Mr. Clark said. In his experience, they tend to be enthusiastic students who help foster community on campus, the kind of relationships that help other students feel at home and succeed. “Multigenerational ties to a place add value, creating this passionate, magnetic source of energy,” he said.

The key, Mr. Clark believes, is not to lower standards, or to enroll so many legacies that other priorities, such as increasing racial and socioeconomic diversity, suffer as a result. “Those two goals aren’t mutually exclusive,” he said.

Other measurements used by selective colleges have nothing to do with a student’s accomplishments or attributes — and everything to do with a college’s agenda.

About one in five institutions allot “considerable importance” to “demonstrated interest,” the degree to which applicants convey their desire to enroll if accepted, according to a survey by the National Association for College Admission Counseling. The strongest expression of demonstrated interest is applying for binding early decision, a policy that favors affluent students who don’t need to compare financial aid offers and one that some colleges use to fill half their seats.

Beyond that, technology has made it easier to track the number of times an applicant engages with a college (by visiting the campus, contacting an admissions officer, responding to an email). This valuable information helps officers gauge who’s most likely to enroll, which can influence who gets admitted in the first place. A higher “yield,” the percentage of accepted students who actually enroll, is widely seen as a measure of status.

The problem is that savvy students who know colleges are watching them can tilt the odds in their favor, said Nancy Leopold, executive director of CollegeTracks, a Maryland nonprofit group that helps low-income and first-generation students get into college: “Demonstrated interest is biased against kids who don’t know the game exists, or who don’t have the time or money to play it.”

What do colleges really cherish? The answer is influenced greatly by the entities they seek to impress. U.S. News & World Report and other college guides, not to mention bond-rating agencies, rely heavily on conventional admissions metrics like ACT/SAT scores and acceptance rates to evaluate institutions. A college president might wish to attract more creative thinkers, but accomplishing that goal won’t help his college’s ranking.

Generally, colleges are risk-averse. Rocking the boat with a newfangled admissions process could hurt their reputations. “The challenge for many admissions offices is to make a change, but not so much change or innovation that you’re risking the position you’re in,” said Ms. Roper-Doten of Olin. Asking students to do more could scare off would-be applicants.

“Colleges seek validation,” said Lloyd Thacker, executive director of the Education Conservancy, a nonprofit group that has sought to reform college admissions. “Without a real external incentive for colleges to care about broadening their understanding of what makes an applicant promising, they don’t seem likely to change the definition on their own.”

A recent campaign called “Turning the Tide,” a project of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, is urging admissions deans to rethink the qualities they consider in applicants. In a report signed by representatives of about 200 campuses, colleges are asked to promote ethical character and service to others through the admissions process.

Although some deans say they have no business assessing the character of still-maturing teenagers, the push has prompted a handful of institutions to tweak their applications. The University of North Carolina now emphasizes contributions to others when asking about extracurricular activities. M.I.T. added an essay question asking students to describe how they’ve helped people.

Richard Weissbourd, a senior lecturer at Harvard, who leads the initiative, recommends that colleges define service in ways that might resonate with disadvantaged students. “Many students don’t have opportunities to do community service,” he said. “They’re taking care of their siblings, or they’re working part-time jobs to help their families. Colleges need to say, ‘That matters to us.’ ”

•

In the end, increasing racial and socioeconomic diversity in higher education is a matter of will. A college can prioritize it or not, said Shaun R. Harper, a professor at the University of Southern California’s Rossier School of Education who studies race and student success.

In September, Dr. Harper gave a keynote speech at the annual conference of the National Association for College Admission Counseling, in Boston. He urged his audience to think hard about racial inequality and “things you perhaps inadvertently and unknowingly do to support it.”

He cited as examples high school counselors who discourage promising minority students from applying to highly selective colleges; college leaders who say they “just can’t find enough” qualified black applicants even as their athletics coaches comb the nation for black students who excel at sports; admissions officers who recruit at the same high schools year after year, overlooking those full of underrepresented minorities.

As Dr. Harper spoke, many listeners applauded; a few scowled. He concluded his remarks by criticizing the lack of racial diversity among admissions deans themselves. He received a standing ovation.

In a subsequent interview, Dr. Harper elaborated on his concerns. “When the demographics of the profession have not changed, particularly at the senior level,” he said, “I don’t know that we can expect a major change, especially in terms of diversifying the class.”

Although Dr. Harper believes colleges rely too heavily on ACT/SAT scores, he says that the major barriers arise well before the application process even begins. Colleges, he said, must do more in terms of outreach to encourage underrepresented students to apply.

Dr. Pérez, at Trinity, has similar concerns. Although he is convinced that the selection process can be successfully revamped, he doesn’t think that will solve the No. 1 problem he sees in admissions. “The problem is money,” he said. “If I had more funding, my class would be more diverse. The conversation we’re not having in this country is: How do we fund colleges and universities?”

However the admissions process might evolve, it surely will continue to serve the interests of colleges first and foremost. Even if someone invents a better, more equitable way to gauge applicants’ potential, a college’s many wants and needs wouldn’t change. Deans would still seek to balance their classes by enrolling a diverse mix of majors from many states and countries. Colleges would still need enough oboe players and theater-arts majors.

“What compels institutions to change is deep discontent,” said Marie Bigham, director of college counseling at Isidore Newman School, in New Orleans. “If they’re only making changes on the margins, it indicates that they’re mostly content with the way things are.”

That leads to a big question in an age of widening social inequality. How unhappy are the wealthiest colleges, really, with the status quo? Some of the nation’s most selective institutions enroll more students from the top 1 percent of the income ladder than from the bottom 60 percent. Is that simply because of lack of preparation in the K-12 system? Flaws within the selection process? Or is it evidence, as Dr. Harper suggests, of a systemic lack of will to change those numbers?

Jon Boeckenstedt, associate vice president for enrollment management and marketing at DePaul University, says that it is the high-profile colleges that have the power to redefine the admissions process.

“Unless and until something changes at the top, nothing else is going to change,” he said. “That’s because, at a lot of colleges, people will go to their graves trying to imitate the Ivy League.”",What Colleges Want in an Applicant (Everything),https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/education/edlife/what-college-admissions-wants.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Hearing that Saudi princes were arrested for “corruption” is like reading that Donald Trump fired seven cabinet secretaries “for lying.” You know it has to be something else. Trump obviously missed the story last year that M.B.S. impulsively bought a yacht while on vacation in the south of France — it just caught his fancy in the harbor — from its Russian owner for $550 million. Did that money come out of his piggy bank? Savings from his Riyadh lemonade stand? From his Saudi government 401(k)?

I raise this point because when you’re making as many radical changes at once, and making as many enemies at once, as M.B.S. is, your robes need to be very clean. People have to believe that you mean what you say and that you have no hidden agendas, because change is going to be painful. Look at what M.B.S. is doing all at once:

To speed up decision-making, he is reshaping the Saudi state — from a broad family coalition where power is shared and alternated among seven major families and decisions taken by consensus — to a state governed by a single family line. This is no longer “Saudi Arabia.” It is becoming “Salman Arabia.” In the latest series of arrests, M.B.S. basically eliminated the “young old guard” — the key sons and his natural rivals from the other main Saudi royal lines. He also arrested the owners of the three main quasi-independent private television networks, MBC, ART and Rotana.

At the same time, M.B.S. is shifting the basis of legitimacy of the regime, ending “the 1979 era.” In 1979, in the wake of the takeover of Islam’s most holy site in Mecca by an ultra-fundamentalist Saudi preacher who claimed that the al-Saud family was not Islamic enough, the Saudi ruling family — to shore up its religious legitimacy — made a sharp religious turn at home and began exporting its puritanical Wahhabi Sunni Islam abroad, building mosques and schools from London to Indonesia.

It has been a disaster for the Arab/Muslim world, spawning offshoots like Al Qaeda and ISIS and retarding Arab education and women’s advancement.

M.B.S. has vowed to give birth to a more moderate Saudi Islam, starting by curbing his religious police and permitting women to drive. This is hugely important. He is daring people to judge his government not on piety but on performance, not on Quran but on KPIs — key performance indicators on unemployment, economic growth, housing and health care.

But he is replacing Wahhabism as a source of solidarity with a more secular Saudi nationalism, one that has a strong anti-Iran/Persian/Shiite tenor. And that is taking him to some dangerous places. To confront Iran, M.B.S. got the Sunni Prime Minister of Lebanon, Saad al-Hariri, to quit his office on Saturday while on a visit to Riyadh, and blamed Iran and its Shiite allies for making Lebanon ungovernable — and for a missile attack from Yemen. Lebanon, which had forged a relatively stable balance among Sunnis, Christians and Shiites, is now shaking. M.B.S. also led a Gulf effort to isolate Qatar for being too close to Iran and to crush Iran’s influence in Yemen — and crush Yemen in the process. It’s overreach, and there seems to be no one around to tell him that.

As a veteran Saudi journalist remarked to me of M.B.S.: “This guy saved Saudi Arabia from a slow death, but he needs to broaden his base. It is good that he is freeing the house of Saud of the influence of the clergy, but he is also not allowing any second opinion of his political and economic decisions.”

I worry that those urging M.B.S. to be more aggressive in confronting Iran (whose malign regional influence does need counterbalancing) — like the U.A.E., Trump, Jared Kushner and Bibi Netanyahu — will push M.B.S. into a war abroad and at home at the same time, and we could see Saudi Arabia and the whole region spin out of control at the same time.

He began conversations with the Vatican in 2015; the loan came from the Sistine Chapel sacristy Office for the Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff, as opposed to the Vatican Museums, since it involves garments still in active use. (They date from the mid-18th-century to the papacy of John Paul II.) Mr. Bolton said the church was immediately receptive to the idea of working together, though he had to make eight visits to Rome to discuss the show. And because of concerns about display and security, the loan contract was not signed until last week.

Asked if he had met the pope or knew whether he had approved the show, Mr. Bolton said he had had no contact with him, and did not have any idea if he was involved.

Greg Burke, the director of the Holy See press office, said: “The Roman Catholic Church has been producing and promoting beautiful works of art for centuries. Most people have experienced that through religious paintings and architecture. This is another way of sharing some of that beauty that rarely gets seen.”

The Vatican garments will be separated from the rest of the fashion in the exhibition, out of respect for the fact that they are still working garments and, presumably, to defray criticisms that could incur if a visitor were to see, for example, a sacristy robe next to a Jean Paul Gaultier dress with a chalice embroidered over the breasts.

Less has been done, seemingly, to defray the idea that Mr. Bolton’s definition of “fashion” is definitively Western. Save Isabel Toledo, who is Cuban-American, there are no South American or Latin American designers in the show, for example, though it is hard to imagine that no one else from that continent engaged with Catholic iconography. Challenged on the subject, he said he hoped to expand his purview in a future exhibition.

In any case, Mr. Bolton has been here before: In 2015, his show, “China Through the Looking Glass,” became the fifth-most-visited exhibition, despite accusations of skating over the surface of the issues it raised, underscoring for him the importance of tapping into the broader conversation. He followed it up with “Manus x Machina,” which examined the role of technology in fashion (and which became the Met’s seventh-most-visited show); and then “Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between,” the Costume Institute’s first retrospective of a living designer since 1983. Though it was widely praised, Ms. Kawakubo is a less obviously buzzy choice, and the show and the attendance were smaller.

Which may partly explain why the museum decided to roll the dice with this show.

“The Antlered Ship” aims for a dreamier, artier style of sea-faring fantasy. It features a splendid age-of-sail tall ship sporting an impressive antler-themed prow, and a surreal all-animal crew captained by a doe named Sylvia. In port, other creatures sign on as crewmembers, including some venturesome pigeons and a philosopher fox named Marco who is seeking answers to life’s big questions, or rather to pretty big ones like, “Why don’t trees ever talk?” and “Why is water so wet?” Oh dear—or perhaps, oh deer! As the ship and narrative drift in tandem, readers can only pray that Marco will not redirect his musings to more mundane matters, such as the odds of enjoying a pigeon repast.

More down to earth is “Robinson,” a dream adventure propelled by a schoolchild’s decision to attend a costume party dressed as his favorite storybook hero, Robinson Crusoe. Things go badly wrong when young Peter’s schoolmates mercilessly mock the elaborate faux-fur costume his mother prepared for him. Surely it would have been better to go in standard-issue pirate gear, as Peter knew the others were all planning to do. Or not: with a gentle nudge from his mother, he opted instead to make a more personal statement, and is repaid for his efforts with a jolt of group rejection that leaves him feeling as alone as any shipwrecked traveler on a desert island.

Photo

What began as a parent’s well-meaning intervention in her child’s social affairs morphs for Peter into a developmental flash point. Turning feverish, the shaken boy escapes into a dream that in some respects mimics Crusoe’s island exile (although happily not the part about Friday!). In this dream, Peter forages for food, makes his own clothing and shelter, and keeps an eye out for pesky pirates. Readers can see that on awakening Peter is more his own person than before, and is ready to re-connect on his own terms with school chums who, as children do, have also moved on and are keen for his company.

Peter Sís, who grew up in Soviet-Bloc Czechoslovakia and has lived in the United States since 1982, has made a specialty of chronicling the lives of maverick outsiders from Galileo to Darwin. He first told bits and pieces of his own coming-of-age story in “The Wall,” but the autobiographical “Robinson” is a more intimate, child’s-eye view of a schoolboy’s struggles to navigate the treacherous crosscurrents of self and society. It is hard not to feel for this child.

In his illustrations for “Robinson,” Sís reprises long-time favorite graphic maneuvers—arresting bird’s eye perspectives, imaginary landscapes that double as maps of themselves—while also showing a new interest in color that mirrors the story’s heightened emotional urgency. Growing up, these evocative images imply, can feel a lot like being lost at sea, but the imagination is a good map to steer by.

Do you have favorite restaurants when you’re on the road?

I’m a pizza nut. If I go to New York all I eat is pizza. The first job I ever had was making pizza as a kid. I don’t eat it much around here, but when I go to New York I’ll have it for breakfast and dinner. In Oklahoma City, I go to Ted’s Escondido. It’s about my favorite Mexican meal.

You travel a lot for your tours. What’s the best and worst part of working the road?

The best part is that you’re knocking around on a bus with your friends. You’re laughing a lot. You’re playing music every night. It’s completely intoxicating. There’s nothing better. The downside is your family life. You don’t get to have as much time with them as you’d like. But no whining allowed.

Where are your favorite places to perform?

There’s Red Rocks in Colorado. It’s one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever played music. The Gorge in Washington State is a magnificent place. I’ve gotten to play Carnegie Hall, Royal Albert Hall. I’ve played a few ballparks over the years: Wrigley Field, Comiskey Park and Dodger Stadium. The Troubadour in Los Angeles is a historic place where a lot of people got started — James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt. It was neat to play there 30 or 40 years later. It’s nice when something holds a great memory for you — a place, a friend.

Every Monday night I play in a 10-piece band, the Time Jumpers, at 3rd and Lindsley [in Nashville]. It’s fun when you can be part of a place that’s a destination. But our Ryman Auditorium is probably my favorite place to play. There’s something magical about how music sounds in that place. It’s a tabernacle.

BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon is used to affronts to its sovereignty. Israel occupied part of the country for years. Syrian troops stayed even longer. Then the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah fought a war with Israel, and waged another in Syria, as the Lebanese government watched. The United States, France and Britain have, over the past century, done their share of meddling.

But no one has seen anything quite like the spectacle that has played out over the past few days. Saad Hariri, the prime minister, who had previously shown no signs of planning to quit, unexpectedly flew to Saudi Arabia and announced his resignation from there, to the shock of his own close advisers. He has not been back since, and no one is sure when, or if, he is returning.

Hours after Mr. Hariri’s announcement — televised Saturday on a Saudi-controlled channel — Saudi Arabia’s assertive new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, presided over the roundup of some 500 people, including 11 princes, on corruption charges.

Lebanon broke out the popcorn.

In a country where political analysis is a near-universal hobby, and where political power is — to oversimplify a bit — divided between Mr. Hariri’s Sunni, Saudi-backed party and the Shiite, Iran-backed Hezbollah, speculation was immediate that Mr. Hariri was also being held against his will. He holds dual Lebanese and Saudi citizenship and has extensive business dealings in the Persian Gulf kingdom.

Like Nishiyama, she has no formal training in ikebana, and yet her work, like his, can’t be understood without it.
“How can [a floral artist] not have a relationship to ikebana?” Thompson says.","The story that best illustrates the tension and interconnectedness of the two approaches is one that involves Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the ruler of Japan, and the Zen tea master Sen no Rikyu in the 16th century. Hideyoshi was known for his lavish, gaudy excess, and under his rule, tatehana, which he adored for its grandeur, had become increasingly more relaxed — libertine really — in its expressions of extravagance. (Hideyoshi once commissioned 40-foot-tall arrangements in 7-foot vases — for him, size definitely counted.) In response, Rikyu developed the wabi form of the tea ceremony, one that prioritized simplicity and slowness over polish, and along with it, advanced the humble nageire style of arrangements for the teahouse interior. Rikyu tried to refine nageire to its essence, evolving the style from an arrangement of several flowers to just one, housed in the most humble and common of containers, like a rice bowl or an earthenware jar. One day, upon hearing that morning glories were in glorious bloom in the garden of Rikyu’s teahouse, Hideyoshi made an appointment to see them. But when he arrived, they had all been cut down. He entered the teahouse and found there a composition of a single morning glory of such exquisiteness that he saw within it the beauty of the entire natural world. Hideyoshi was awed and affronted that his rival had achieved such transcendence, and later, he ordered Rikyu to commit ritual suicide.

FOR TOSHIRO KAWASE, the creative tension inherent in this duality is what creates the artistry in ikebana. Hayato Nishiyama might say the same. The florist lives and works from a small townhouse, which houses his shop, Mitate, in a quiet corner of Kyoto with his wife, Mika. When Nishiyama, bespectacled and monklike in his movements, grew interested in flower arranging while an art school student, he joined an ikebana club. He soon realized, however, that he wanted to study the plants themselves, and so became a gardener. While he has never studied formally, he has read many books on ikebana, including Kawase’s. His work follows in the nageire tradition: He uses exclusively seasonal plants that change form and color throughout the year — bulbs and wildflowers, ferns and grasses, camellias and cherry blossoms that grow in the surrounding hills — and eschews traditional porcelain or bronze vases for everyday objects that he transforms into vessels, like woven bamboo baskets, old wooden well buckets or bits of roofing tile. Traditional ikebana, like the traditional tea ceremony, has many tools — saws and wire and kenzans (spiky flower frogs that hold a plant upright) — but Nishiyama uses only a pair of scissors and works on the floor; he is inspired not just by the seasons, but by the constant change and movement within them. When we visited, it was early fall and he was making an arrangement with red-leaved rowan branches sent from a friend farther north, where autumn was already in full swing, and the last purple asters of Kyoto’s summer — a conversation between what was passing and what was to come. A work Nishiyama has posted on his Instagram feed shows three tiny flowers planted in moss, one in bud, one flowering and one beginning to fade — a tribute to how we are always living in three tenses at once, whether we recognize it or not, and a nod to both the fleetingness and constancy of nature’s cycles.

This emphasis on the brevity of life is one of the fundamental differences between ikebana and Western arrangements, but another is the particular recessiveness of the flower itself. Western arrangements prioritize full-frontal blooms, ripe and bold and staring straight at the viewer. In ikebana, there might not even be a flower in the composition, and if there is, it rarely looks you in the eye: It is more likely bent or turned to the side. Stems or leaves or branches are often emphasized over flowers, and those might very well be crooked or yellowing or covered with moss.

Highlighting overlooked forms of beauty, or revealing something ordinary in a new way, is central to Nishiyama’s vision. This is also true of Emily Thompson, who works out of a corner storefront in Manhattan’s old downtown seaport district. Well-known in the fashion world for her wild, wind-tossed bouquets, she too studied art and is a self-taught florist. Like Nishiyama, she has no formal training in ikebana, and yet her work, like his, can’t be understood without it. Thompson also forages and buys her plants from local farms, but where Nishiyama’s approach is purist, and his work gentle, Thompson’s can be voracious and bold, even aggressive. She culls anything from the natural world that can serve her: exotics, weeds, hairy seed pods, flower leis, dangling clumps of moss, even animal and vegetable matter. (Recent compositions have included a tiered topiary of asparagus spears and a bouquet of purple artichoke with phormium and geranium leaves.)

Whether she is creating a simple arrangement of just a few iris buds in a low bowl or a massive installation of dangling roots, twisted branches and an explosion of milkweed fuzz for a client like the Pool, the new restaurant in New York City, Thompson is always attempting “to build worlds made of the infinite wealth of nature.” As she explains, “I don’t follow any master except for my own powerful sense of responsibility that the flowers should be afforded their own identities.” Her compositions do reflect the seasons — there is a delicacy to her work in spring, a lushness in summer, a decay in fall and a barrenness in winter — and yet they also challenge us to re-see what an arrangement can look like. Thompson’s pieces might at first glance appear chaotic, but eventually, one begins to see the logic that informs them: A grouping of wild greenbrier with branches of white oak seems to blow to one side, as if buffeted by the wind. “My insistence on incorporating flawed materials,” she says, “showing a diseased branch, a rose in all stages or a chrysalis hanging off it, shows that this is not just a product but a living organism.”

This, too, is ikebana, practiced many centuries and miles away from when and where it began. “How can [a floral artist] not have a relationship to ikebana?” Thompson says. “Much as asymmetry is defined by symmetry; ikebana is always in the room when one works with flowers.”

Her work, like Nishiyama’s, is a reminder that like all living arts, ikebana changes and is informed by the culture and the times; what makes ikebana especially poignant and potent in this moment is its direct and personal connection to nature, its awareness of and emphasis on decay in an era in which our own ecological and environmental ruin feels more vivid than ever. A cherry blossom in bloom will soon be gone. But for this instant, it’s ours — and while it is, who among us can turn away from it?",The Rise of Modern Ikebana,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/t-magazine/ikebana-japanese-flower-art.html

But it’s really the seat of anticipation. The amygdala primes you to react — your pulse quickens, your muscles tense and your pupils dilate — even before other parts of your brain can figure out if you need to be scared or not. We are particularly sensitive to anything new, other people’s fearful facial expressions, or anything that resembles something that harmed us in the past.

It’s why you jump when you sense rustling in the bushes before realizing it’s just your neighbor’s cat. That reflex can save your life in certain circumstances such as leaping out of the way of an oncoming car. Trouble starts when you can’t tamp down your amygdala’s response, which makes you obsess and perhaps do counterproductive things when faced with concerning but not life-threatening events like the Equifax hack or a vulnerable social situation like asking someone out on a date.

Consciously activating the more measured, analytical part of your brain is the key to controlling runaway fear and anxiety.

But it’s not so easy in an era when social media and cable news make us aware of every actual or potential disaster occurring anywhere in the world (and in a repeating loop). It’s even more difficult if you have lots of stress or instability at home or work.

To your primitive mind, it’s as if there are lions and tigers lurking around every corner.

The result is often a juiced-up amygdala more apt to flip you into fight, flight or freeze mode in response to even the slightest concern, and keep you there, rather than return you to a state of calm in the absence of clear and present danger.

Remaining in this state of wary hypervigilance can contribute to issues like social anxiety, hypochondria, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia and all manner of phobias. It also plays a role in racial and religious intolerance because fearful people are more inclined to cling to the familiar and denigrate the unfamiliar. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, roughly 18 percent of the United States population is afflicted with persistent, outsized fear responses to seemingly ordinary stimuli.

Arresting an overactive amygdala requires first realizing and then admitting you’re feeling uneasy and scared.

“Our culture valorizes strength and power and showing fear is considered weakness,” said Leon Hoffman, co-director of the Pacella Research Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Society & Institute in Manhattan. “But you are actually stronger if you can acknowledge fear.”

That’s how it was for Sean Tucker, a pilot who for 40 years has performed heart-stopping aerobatic stunts at air shows despite an almost paralyzing fear of crashing.

“I never told anyone how scared I was when I started flying,” Mr. Tucker said. “But what I learned was that fear turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy and if you have the courage to admit it, you’ll be able to focus and prepare and rise above it.”

If you can sense and appreciate your fear — be it of flying, illness or social rejection — as merely your amygdala’s request for more information rather than a signal of impending doom, then you are on your way to calming down and engaging more conscious, logic-dominated parts of your brain. At that point, you can assess the rationality of your fear and take steps to deal with it.

“The more you try to suppress fear, either by ignoring it or doing something else to displace it, the more you will actually experience it,” said Kristy Dalrymple, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Alpert Medical School of Brown University.

Dr. Dalrymple is a proponent of acceptance and commitment therapy for managing fear, which has recently been gaining clinical validation. It encourages people not only to accept that they are feeling fearful and examine the causes but also to think about their values and how committing to overcoming their fears would be consistent with who they want to be. The approach forces higher-order thinking, which theoretically disables or diminishes the amygdala response.

The classical pianist Emanuel Ax, whose career demands that he perform in front of thousands of people, has long struggled with stage fright. He didn’t go to a psychotherapist, but it seems that the strategies of acceptance and commitment are how he manages his fear.

“I’m still scared, but I’ve learned to accept that I’m going to be nervous,” Mr. Ax said. “Aside from being what I love to do, playing the piano is my employment and gives people pleasure. I wouldn’t be doing my job if I gave in.”

Psychologists and neuroscientists are also finding that the amygdala is less apt to freak out if you are reminded that you are loved or could be loved. For example, seeing images of people with frightened expressions is usually a huge trigger for the amygdala, but that response is greatly diminished when subjects are first shown pictures of people being cared for or hugged.

Just as fear can be contagious, so can courage, caring and calm.",Outsmarting Our Primitive Responses to Fear,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/well/live/fear-anxiety-therapy.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. “This was the first big test in the Trump era of the appeal of Trump-style politics at the state level. The president injected himself in this campaign, so he owns some of it.”

Indeed, the president suggested that Mr. Gillespie’s biggest problem was not embracing him enough. “Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter Tuesday night.

Democrats who were worried about low turnout and a lack of energy can breathe easier. The profile of the electorate in Virginia, where Democrats have started to dominate the counties across the Potomac from Washington, was heavily in their favor, and that advantage has been steadily growing with an influx of immigrants who were repelled by Mr. Gillespie’s message, and by a durable foundation of black voters.

In that sense, the pressure for Mr. Northam and the Democrats to win masked the frictions in the party between his more centrist posture and some liberals who criticized his campaign and refused to endorse him.

Democrats showed that they could generate energy, even for a low-key candidate like Mr. Northam, but they can draw little from his campaign in terms of a message other than opposing the harshest edges of Trumpism.

The president’s approval rating in Virginia was 38 percent in a recent poll, and Mr. Gillespie was grudgingly yoked to him. Mr. Trump posted Twitter messages promoting Mr. Gillespie, including on Election Day, but did not campaign with the candidate, an explicit, extraordinary recognition from Mr. Gillespie that appearing with the president of his own party would hurt more than help, something that has rarely happened since Richard Nixon was engulfed by Watergate.

Mr. Gillespie tried at times to focus on the economy by talking down the state’s prospects under Democrats, but that message did not break through. The state’s unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, and the Northern Virginia region that helped propel Mr. Northam includes some of the wealthiest counties in the country. It did work in rural areas where voters, many without a four-year degree, who once worked in coal mines or in the tobacco industry have not shared in the state’s prosperity.

Though each candidate emphasized issues that played to their base supporters, Mr. Gillespie won the Republican nomination by defeating a far more pure Trumpian candidate, Corey Stewart, and Mr. Northam prevailed over the favorite of progressives, former Representative Tom Perriello. So neither party’s voters were inclined toward the candidate who drew the brightest line distinctions.

But during the campaign, Mr. Gillespie draped himself in Mr. Trump’s clothes, particularly his tough talk on cracking down on illegal immigration. As a national party leader, Mr. Gillespie had been known for his efforts to expand the Republican tent and find a way to connect with immigrant voters, particularly Hispanics.

“I think Ed Gillespie did everything he thought he needed to do to fire up the Trump base, and if the Democrats are fired up and feel united around a cause — whether a good policy or the politics of Donald Trump and others as too anti-women — the Trump coalition is not big enough,” said Steve Jarding, a lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and a Democratic campaign consultant.

Unveiled in late October, these are the prototypes for the border wall President Trump has vowed to erect on the southern border. Later this year, the federal government will test the panels for strength and effectiveness.

These prototypes make clear that a border wall is not simple: It can vary considerably in material, shape and cost. And while it is far from clear that Congress will pay for a wall or that any of these designs will be built at wider scale, they are real-life renderings of a promise that fueled much of Mr. Trump’s campaign.

Six contractors have made bids on the wall, and the specific details of their plans are not public. But they allowed us to visit the prototypes, and we asked border security experts and engineers what they saw in each design and what challenges each wall may face.

Every expert agreed on one thing: Finding a design that would work for the entire length of the border would be extremely hard, if not impossible. And many caution that such a wall may never happen.

Concrete or No Concrete?

Concrete Not concrete

The prototypes include plain concrete walls and ones made of a combination of materials, what the government described as “other than concrete.” The term is intentionally vague, a signal to contractors to be creative and bring a design that U.S. Customs and Border Protection had not considered.

Any barrier must be able to withstand at least 30 minutes of force from a “sledgehammer, car jack, pick axe, chisel, battery-operated impact tools, battery-operated cutting tools, oxy/acetylene torch or other similar hand-held tools,” according to the instructions for the prototypes.

Some “other than concrete” prototypes incorporate steel, which can be relatively easy to cut with a torch, while pure concrete is not. A hollow steel pipe whose walls are half an inch thick could easily be cut in less than an hour, according to Michael D. Engelhardt, professor of structural engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.

Steel is also malleable. Mr. Engelhardt said that a small hydraulic arm (similar to the “Jaws of Life” used to pry open a crumpled car) could easily be used to make an opening in such a wall: “The equipment is small (could likely fit in a backpack), inexpensive, widely available and can generate many tons of force.”

“Steel can rust really quickly,” said Curtis Patterson, a structural engineer based in San Diego who visited the prototypes with a team of Times journalists. He pointed to several rust spots that had already appeared on one of the prototypes, less than a month after construction.

But some envision the mixed-material walls as having more technological capabilities. They might be called smart walls: walls that incorporate radar, acoustics and other types of surveillance embedded in the infrastructure. One of the contractors bidding on the wall is ELTA North America, an Israeli defense contractor that specializes in radar and communication equipment.

“My sense is they will select multiple awards for these types of infrastructure,” said Jayson Ahern, a former acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection who was involved in the construction of a border fence during the George W. Bush administration. “Some will be for technology, some for when they just need a wall.”

Opaque or Transparent?

Opaque Transparent

David Aguilar, a former deputy commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said that with concerns over officer safety, it is critical that border patrol agents have good situational awareness: “It can be done visually or it could be done with technology, but in a high-activity area, it is difficult to discern legal activity versus illegal. In urban areas, you’re going to need that transparency. In terms of attempted intrusion, you want to see people coming toward the border so that they can respond.”

Michael Evangelista-Ysasaga, the chief executive of Penna Group, which has contracted with the government before but whose prototype bid was rejected, said: “A see-through border wall allows them to know when they are facing threats on the other side, which Border Patrol has long preferred on their wish list. They didn’t want a solid wall. Going through was never the real threat. The real threat is going over or under.”

“Big” and “Beautiful”?

More aesthetics Fewer aesthetics

Mr. Trump campaigned on a “big, fat, beautiful wall,” so it’s unsurprising that looks play a role in the border wall guidelines. The official proposal request says that the U.S.-facing side of the wall should be “aesthetically pleasing.”

But standing in front of the prototypes, Mr. Patterson winced when he considered the aesthetics of a potential wall. “I don’t know if there’s a way to make these beautiful — unless you get murals painted on them,” he said with a chuckle. “You want something that blends in, that you wouldn’t be offended to look at from your backyard. Some of the steel looks like something you’d find in a prison. The brick facade is more like something you’d see on a freeway.”

The only wall that actually has a brick facade is the prototype from Texas Sterling Construction. But in keeping with the guidelines, the pattern appears only on the U.S.-facing side. What Mexico gets to see is a bare concrete wall lined with barbed wire.

Facing the United States Facing Mexico

It turns out that barbed wire presents its own problems. Mr. Evangelista-Ysasaga said that his company often uses razor wire in prisons and that animals routinely get stuck. For humans, hair and clothing could get tangled in it. Having such wire along the border would be “really inhumane,” he said. “You’re going to read about a whole family dead on a Sunday morning. It’s going to be a human rights nightmare in the international world.”

Precast or Filled On-Site?

Precast Filled-in

The engineers and contractors agree that concrete walls aren’t the most complicated of structures to deal with. For them, the big question is: Do you make walls on-site or precast them?

Lengthy wall segments in very remote regions can make pouring concrete on-site expensive and logistically difficult.

Most experts thought that precasting — making the concrete panels elsewhere and then shipping them to the border — was the most practical choice. “Rather than build from Point A to Point B, the wall route could be divided into segments, say 100 miles apart,” said Daniel Abrams, a professor of structural engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Tube or No Tube?

Tube No tube

Border patrol officials have repeatedly said that they want to construct a wall that would be effectively impossible to scale — that it should be “physically imposing,” measure between 18 and 30 feet high and include “anti-climbing features.”

Many of the contractors added a rounded tube at the top of their prototypes; they believe it will make it far less likely that anyone could reach the top. “It makes it impossible to straddle or use to get a rope ladder across because there is nothing to hook onto,” Deputy Chief Patrol Agent Roy D. Villareal said.",Eight Ways to Build a Border Wall,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/08/upshot/eight-ways-to-build-a-border-wall-prototypes-mexico.html

He began conversations with the Vatican in 2015; the loan came from the Sistine Chapel sacristy Office for the Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff, as opposed to the Vatican Museums, since it involves garments still in active use.

Mr. Bolton said the church was immediately receptive to the idea of working together, though he had to make eight visits to Rome to discuss the show. And because of concerns about display and security, the loan contract was not signed until last week.

Asked if he had met the pope or knew whether he had approved the show, Mr. Bolton said he had had no contact with him, and did not have any idea if he was involved.

Greg Burke, the director of the Holy See press office, said: “The Roman Catholic Church has been producing and promoting beautiful works of art for centuries. Most people have experienced that through religious paintings and architecture. This is another way of sharing some of that beauty that rarely gets seen.”

The Vatican garments will be separated from the rest of the fashion in the exhibition, out of respect for the fact that they are still working garments and, presumably, to defray criticisms that could incur if a visitor were to see, for example, a sacristy robe next to a Jean Paul Gaultier dress with a chalice embroidered over the breasts.

Less has been done, seemingly, to defray the idea that Mr. Bolton’s definition of “fashion” is definitively Western. Save Isabel Toledo, who is Cuban-American, there are no South American or Latin American designers in the show, for example, though it is hard to imagine that no one else from that continent engaged with Catholic iconography. Challenged on the subject, he said he hoped to expand his purview in a future exhibition.

In any case, Mr. Bolton has been here before: In 2015, his show, “China Through the Looking Glass,” became the fifth-most-visited exhibition, despite accusations of skating over the surface of the issues it raised, underscoring for him the importance of tapping into the broader conversation. He followed it up with “Manus x Machina,” which examined the role of technology in fashion (and which became the Met’s seventh-most-visited show); and then “Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between,” the Costume Institute’s first retrospective of a living designer since 1983. Though it was widely praised, Ms. Kawakubo is a less obviously buzzy choice, and the show and the attendance were smaller.

Which may partly explain why the museum decided to roll the dice with this show.

That message was reinforced during meetings in Pyongyang after Mr. Trump’s inauguration. North Korean officials acknowledged that the new administration offered the opportunity for a fresh start, and raised the idea of beginning talks without preconditions. In a session in Oslo a few months later, the North Koreans recognized the need to defuse tensions while reiterating their interest in an unconditional dialogue.

For the North Koreans, who point to the fates of Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi and Iraq’s Saddam Hussein as cautionary tales, demonstrating that they can build a nuclear missile able to reach the continental United States is the highest priority. This was confirmed in Moscow a few weeks ago, when Ms. Choe said that North Korea would continue to develop these weapons until it reached a “balance of power” with the United States.

This dark cloud may have a silver lining.

In our talks, the North Koreans have maintained that they are not striving to be a nuclear state with a big arsenal, but rather to have enough weapons to defend themselves. Since early last summer, North Korean officials have publicly said that they have entered the last stage in the development of their nuclear force, implying that they have an endpoint in mind. A senior North Korean official privately told us: “If we feel we have enough, the primary emphasis will be on economic growth.”

This potential opening for dialogue needs to be explored. We believe the best way to proceed would be to first hold bilateral “talks about talks” without preconditions. The objective of these talks would be to clarify the policies of each country, discuss where there might be potential compromises and what each side considers nonnegotiable, and prepare the groundwork to move on to negotiations.

Ideally, this would be done through under-the-radar meetings by diplomats, similar to the initial contacts between American and Iranian officials that took months and eventually led to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. In the current atmosphere of crisis, we should accelerate this process by appointing a senior presidential envoy to work with the State Department and with top-ranking North Koreans.

A nuclear-free Korean Peninsula should remain the United States’ main priority. The Trump administration wants this to happen immediately, while some experts argue this objective should be dropped since it will be impossible to achieve.

We don’t agree with either position. The United States has to be realistic. Denuclearization cannot happen overnight. It must be framed as a long-term objective of any diplomacy, an approach the North Koreans have hinted they would accept.

In view of the mounting confrontation and the lack of mutual trust, the United States must pursue a step-by-step approach to reduce tensions and secure a path to formal negotiations.

An essential first step is an immediate moratorium on North Korea’s nuclear and missile testing, which aggravate tensions. In exchange, the United States and South Korea could meet North Korean concerns by adjusting the scale of their joint military exercises or perhaps offer some relief from economic sanctions. Other steps — such as assurances by North Korea that it will not transfer nuclear, chemical or biological weapons technology overseas — could follow.

But none of this can be achieved without the right political atmosphere. The North Koreans are bewildered by the lack of coherence in American policy. President Trump’s threatening tweets and personal attacks on Kim Jong-un have only added to the risks of misinterpretation. Even his recent statements in Tokyo and Seoul, hinting at a willingness to talk, are at risk of being drowned out by his bluster, which reinforces the North Koreans’ mind-set that they made the right decision by choosing a nuclear path.

Mr. Trump could begin reducing tensions by stating clearly that diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang is his administration’s first choice and that the United States is ready to proceed down this road, working with its allies and partners. Such a statement offers the best way to sway the Chinese to better enforce sanctions against Pyongyang and would serve him well in his coming meeting with President Xi Jinping of China.

One is that Northam outperformed Clinton without being a particularly energetic, forceful candidate.

Someone smoother? In the race’s final days, he flip-flopped on sanctuary cities and made other blunders that cast him as unsteady and uncertain. Didn’t matter. He prevailed, handily.

Republicans should also worry that they’ve oversold themselves on the moderate-progressive divide in the Democratic Party and how severely Democrats would be hobbled by it. In the days leading up to Tuesday, a book by Donna Brazile, the former head of the Democratic National Committee, reignited the enmity between Clinton’s backers and supporters of Bernie Sanders, and that became one of several reasons to wonder if progressives would fail to turn out for Northam, a milquetoast moderate. In the end, enough of them did, not just to guarantee his victory but to jeopardize Virginia Republicans’ 66-to-34 majority in the state’s House of Delegates. On Wednesday morning, unofficial returns showed that Democrats would pick up at least 14 seats, and they could, after recounts, even wind up with control of the House.

“If the Virginia results showed anything, it’s that ideological purity isn’t necessary to win in the Age of Trump,” Lis Smith, a Democratic operative who worked for McAuliffe, told me Tuesday night. “Northam came out as a two-time George W. Bush voter, and he failed some key liberal litmus tests. Still he won.”

In rooting for a Gillespie victory, the G.O.P. was looking for something larger: an assurance that a Republican in a swing state or swing district could find the right recipe for energizing Trump supporters without alienating Trump skeptics. Gillespie’s answer was to keep Trump at arm’s length physically but not spiritually. So while he never — not once — had Trump stump for him in Virginia, he parroted the president’s tough talk about criminals and immigrants and denounced professional football players who didn’t stand for the national anthem.

Trump didn’t cry foul during the campaign, but he did on Twitter on Tuesday night, griping that Gillespie “worked hard but did not embrace me” and showing again that he’s all too content to spar publicly with lawmakers and candidates in his own party. Republicans should be afraid for that reason as well.

Beyond the returns, this was a governor’s race that made the skin crawl, which is to say that it was a sufficiently accurate mirror and microcosm of American political culture in the Age of Trump. Partisan groups and panicked candidates trafficked in overblown fears, appealed to the worst in voters and debased themselves in pursuit of their prize — reasoning, I suppose, that dignity could be recovered on the far side of brutal victory. I’m not sure that’s ever wholly true.

And I’m not drawing any equivalence. Northam didn’t sell out his principles nearly as thoroughly as Gillespie did, and Democrats didn’t sink to Republicans’ level. In fact one of the most audacious tricks that Republicans sought to pull off was ginning up as much outrage over a loathsome Latino Victory Fund ad that ran on television just a handful of times — it showed a truck with a Confederate flag hunting down children of color — as there was over viciously negative commercials of Gillespie’s that blanketed the airwaves. These attacks essentially branded Northam, a mild-mannered pediatrician who served in the Army, as some unhinged leftie eager to give guns to pedophiles.

Gillespie’s campaign “has not been just a dog whistle to the intolerant, racially resentful parts of the Republican base; it’s been a mating call,” wrote The Washington Post in a blistering — and wholly warranted — editorial that noted what many other observers were also fascinated by: how radically Trump’s ascendance and omnipresence changed the way Gillespie comported himself, a transformation with dark implications for the G.O.P. and scary ones for America.

Before this race, Gillespie was as establishment as an establishment Republican could be, aligned closely with George W. Bush, who has made his distaste for Trump’s floridly divisive politics clear. He typified a coolheaded, practical approach to politics. He was more tradesman than ideologue.

Until the last few months. The impression he left on voters was an ugly one, and he and the G.O.P. have nothing to show for it. That should scare Republicans most of all.

LA VERNIA, Tex. — It’s important to know that in Wilson County in Texas, site of the horrific shooting that killed 26 people at the First Baptist Church on Sunday, life revolves around the schools and the churches. It’s a rural county of five small towns, and the biggest industry is cattle ranching. It is also a place where schools don’t plan anything on Wednesday nights because that is a church night.

I am the pastor at La Vernia United Methodist Church, seven miles west of Sutherland Springs, where the shooting occurred. Everyone here knew someone associated with the First Baptist Church. One of the dead was a parent whose child was in the 4-H club with a child in our program. Another victim was a lifelong friend of one of my parishioners; they graduated from La Vernia High 38 years ago. People from my congregation had attended Bible study at First Baptist or worked with its members on a mission project.

The idea that such a thing would happen in a sacred space, a place where families are supposed to be safe, has angered many people. Churches are places where the spirit of God is felt, where the presence of God is very real, where manners are expected and vulgarity is shunned. The church is where we, with all our faults and failures, come into the presence of the divine to find grace, to find peace, to rest in the arms of the Lord. The church is a sanctuary in the literal sense of the word, set apart, safe, protecting. All this was shattered.

Things like this don’t happen in small towns like ours. Those who moved to the country to protect their family from the perceived dangers of the city were especially shaken.

Almost every family here identifies with a church. In some cases, it’s more a matter of a family tradition than active participation. But for weddings and funerals, it is usually the “family church” that’s called. Even so, families go to different churches as they find activities that fit their needs.

SPECIAL POST — A team from Japan won the 26th World Puzzle Championship, which ended Saturday in Bangalore, India. The U.S.A. and Germany finished second and third.

The three-day competition — a companion to the World Sudoku Championship, held earlier in the week — drew 169 contestants from 27 countries. Over three days, the competitors tackled more than 300 pencil-and-paper puzzles involving logic, numbers and pictures. There were no crosswords or other puzzles testing vocabulary or knowledge, so everyone could compete on an equal basis irrespective of language or nationality.

In some rounds, lasting up to 60 minutes, the puzzles were so challenging that many contestants scored zero points. Three example puzzles from the competition, not the hardest ones, appear below.

Among individual solvers, Japan’s Ken Endo was first, scoring 7,655 points, far ahead of Germany’s Ulrich Voigt (previous 11-time W.P.C. champion), in second place, with 6,782; and Kota Morinishi, also of Japan, in third, with 6,724. Each puzzle was worth 5 to 250 points depending on difficulty.

Palmer Mebane, 27, a web developer in San Diego, was the top American solver, finishing in fourth place with 6,384 points. The other members of the U.S. team were Walker Anderson, 16, a high school junior in Doylestown, Pa., in seventh place; Thomas Snyder, 37, a professional in computational biology in San Bruno, Calif., in 10th; and Will Blatt, 32, a software engineer in Atlanta, in 12th.

On our table, he placed a sheaf of papers face down — scripted notes it made him feel better to have, which he consulted if I asked a question he wanted to be careful answering. His vocal tone, timid at first, soon had the resonance of an actor’s voice.

“This is easy-ish for me because you’re a reporter; I’m the interviewee,” he said when we’d been talking awhile. “We have specific roles. If we met on the street, that would be more scary.”

That’s how he’s felt about performing, too, ever since he was little: perfectly comfortable as long as he knows the part he’s meant to play.

Whether Mr. Rowe is the first autistic actor to play Christopher is hard to pin down, given the number of “Curious Incident” productions around the world. Even Mr. Stephens, the playwright, said that while Mr. Rowe is the first he’s heard of, he can’t be sure.

Casting Mr. Rowe was the result of a deliberate effort by two professional regional theaters, Syracuse Stage and its co-producer, Indiana Repertory Theater (where the show opened this fall), to audition actors both with and without autism for the role. At a time when theaters are discussing diversity, there is a heightened pressure to include performers with disabilities. “Uncommon Sense,” Tectonic Theater Project’s new Off Broadway play about people with autism and their families, has an actor on the spectrum, Andrew Duff, in its ensemble.

Robert Hupp, the artistic director of Syracuse Stage, said that seeking out actors on the spectrum “made logical and irrefutable sense” for “Curious Incident.” To him, Mr. Rowe’s performance is clear validation.

“To anyone who ever had any concerns or doubts or wondered, ‘Could an actor with autism play this role? Would an actor who falls on the spectrum be overwhelmed by this production?’ the answer is definitively no,” he said. “Not if you’re Mickey Rowe.”

Mr. Rowe, who earned a bachelor’s degree in drama from the University of Washington, found out when he was a senior there that he had autism. Legally blind, he struggles to read print smaller than 18-point type (he wears contacts onstage and glasses “in real life,” he says), and was in special education classes for his vision throughout childhood — years he spent friendless, obsessed with magic tricks and circus skills: stilt-walking, juggling, unicycling.

It strikes him as telling that he got speech and occupational therapy, too. He suspects his parents knew he had autism but didn’t want to label him, and if so, he understands. He hasn’t asked them, though; he said they don’t have that kind of relationship.

It was his girlfriend — now his wife and the mother of their two small children — who urged him to get help with issues like interpreting social cues. At the university’s Adult Autism Clinic, his diagnosis came as “a big relief, because you know your whole life that something is different,” Mr. Rowe said. “You don’t know why or what it is or if you’re stupid or what’s going on.”

Still, he didn’t tell people about his autism. So it was unsettling when, in an acting class he took around the time “Curious Incident” opened on Broadway in 2014, the teacher handed him one of Christopher’s speeches and said, “You need to do this monologue. This is you.”

“I remember thinking to myself afterwards: Does she know I’m on the spectrum?” Mr. Rowe said. “Like, do people just know?”

He is not Christopher, though, and he and Christopher occupy very different spots on the spectrum. Even so, he recognized enough pieces of himself in that monologue that he went home and listened to the novel, by Mark Haddon, that Mr. Stephens adapted into the play.

Not long afterward, struggling to get work, Mr. Rowe threw in the towel on trying to pass as neurotypical. In an essay on the theater industry website HowlRound, he wrote about being an actor with autism, noting the “tension between everything that I am and everything that might be conventional for an actor.” He hoped his disclosure would change the way people looked at him, just enough to give him a chance.

The piece raised his profile and put him on the radar of anyone searching for an actor with autism, but in practice nothing changed. Going out for roles, he still faced immediate roadblocks: the small talk, the eye contact, the instant connection an actor is supposed to make with the director.

“Just how you walk into the room and shake hands with the person when you first meet them is a huge part of the audition, and people on the spectrum aren’t very good at that,” he said.

So his résumé was comparatively slender when the Indiana/Syracuse production asked him to submit a video audition. Soon the show’s California-based director, Risa Brainin, flew to Seattle to see if he had the chops. If he didn’t, they weren’t going to compromise.

“We couldn’t,” she said. “It’s too major of a role, and too difficult of a role. What we wanted to do was give the opportunity.”

In Syracuse, where the production runs through Nov. 12, Mr. Rowe plays Christopher with an agile grace, an impish humor and a humanizing restraint that seems directly connected to his experience of autism. When the stage directions say that Christopher barks like a dog, for example, Mr. Rowe chooses to underplay it.

The attention the show has gotten has been positive for him. For one thing, Lincoln Center asked him to speak at its autism-focused Big Umbrella Festival next spring. And the ripples extend farther. Marissa Wolf, who is directing “Curious Incident” this winter at Kansas City Repertory Theater, in Missouri, said Mr. Rowe’s casting inspired her to choose an actor with Tourette’s syndrome, a condition often associated with autism spectrum disorder, to play Christopher in her production.

Mr. Rowe worries a little about being pigeonholed, because he also wants to play roles that have nothing to do with autism. At the same time, he sees characters in the canon who he thinks could be on the spectrum — like Bobby, the young misfit in David Mamet’s “American Buffalo,” and Jason, the awkward adolescent in David Lindsay-Abaire’s “Rabbit Hole.”

Eager to work with Mr. Rowe again, Mr. Hupp and Ms. Brainin have been scheming about future projects, pondering which roles — maybe something in Shakespeare? — would be a great fit for him.

What Mr. Rowe wants is a life in the American theater, probably with a stint in graduate school on the way. He can envision himself as the leader of a regional theater, and he is undaunted by the socializing that would require. Mingling may not be in his skill set, but to him, an artistic director is simply playing a role. And knowing that takes the fear away.","The World Really Is a Stage, Scripts and All, to an Actor With Autism",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/theater/actor-with-autism-curious-incident-of-the-dog-in-the-night-time.html

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at the Leica store in New York. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

Over that period, his work became more political — as in the 1982 photo of four black nannies pushing white toddlers in strollers. But there is also a crazy, funny beauty too, which is no accident.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

Previous studies have already found differences in the gut microbiota of lean and obese adults.
A diet more heavily based on plants — that is, fruits and vegetables — may result in a microbiome containing a wider range of healthful organisms.
In studies, mice that had a microbiota preconditioned by the typical American diet did not respond as healthfully to a plant-based diet.
Similarly, studies have suggested a role of the gut microbiota in the risk of developing neuropsychiatric illnesses like schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and even chronic fatigue syndrome.","Depending on the body site, anywhere from 20 percent to 60 percent of the organisms that make up the microbiota cannot be cultured and identified with the older, traditional techniques used by microbiologists.

If the institutes’ five-year project succeeds in defining changes in the microbiome that are associated with disease, it has the potential to transform medicine, assuming ways can be found to correct microbial distortions in the affected tissues.

Here are some of the demonstration projects already underway:

Skin: Dr. Martin J. Blaser, microbiologist and director of the human microbiome program at New York University School of Medicine, is directing examination of the organisms on the skin of 75 people with and without psoriasis, checking whether agents used to treat the condition adversely alter the microbiome.

Vagina: Jacques Ravel at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and Larry J. Forney at the University of Idaho are studying 200 women to determine the microbial changes that may result in a common and difficult-to-control infection called bacterial vaginosis, which afflicts more than 20 million American women of childbearing age.

Blood: At Washington University in St. Louis, Dr. Gregory A. Storch, a specialist in pediatric infectious disease, and colleagues are examining the role of viruses and the immune system in the blood and respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of children who develop serious fevers that result in some 20 million visits a year to hospital emergency rooms.

Gastrointestinal tract: Claire M. Fraser-Liggett, a microbiologist, and Dr. Alan R. Shuldiner, a geneticist, both at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, are exploring how the microbiome affects the body’s use of energy and the development of obesity.

Previous studies have already found differences in the gut microbiota of lean and obese adults. There is also evidence that the typical high-calorie American diet rich in sugar, meats and processed foods may adversely affect the balance of microbes in the gut and foster the extraction and absorption of excess calories from food.

Compared to lean mice, obese mice have a 50 percent reduction in organisms called Bacteroidetes and a proportional increase in Firmicutes, and lean mice get fat when given fecal transplants from obese mice. A similar shift has been observed in people, and the distorted ratio of organisms was shown to reverse in people who lose weight following bariatric surgery.

There is also evidence that microbes residing in the gut can affect distant sites through their influence on a person’s immune responses. This indirect action has been suggested as a possible mechanism behind rheumatoid arthritis. In mice, certain bacteria in the gut have been shown to foster production of antibodies that attack the joints, resulting in the joint destruction typical of rheumatoid arthritis.

Similarly, studies have suggested a role of the gut microbiota in the risk of developing neuropsychiatric illnesses like schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and even chronic fatigue syndrome. Researchers have suggested that in genetically susceptible people, altered microbes in the gut may disrupt the blood-brain barrier, leading to the production of antibodies that adversely affect normal brain development.

Among the challenges in elucidating the microbiome’s role in health and disease is determining whether changes found in the microorganisms inhabiting various organs are a cause or an effect. Most of what is already known about the microbiota in people with various health problems is based on observation, making it difficult to say which came first: the disease or the disrupted microbiota.

Animal studies like those mentioned above are a clue but not proof of a similar effect in people. Until therapeutic studies now underway are completed, people with conditions thought to be influenced by the microbiome have no choice currently but to rely on possible treatments suggested by animal research and some preliminary human studies.

For example, people with irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, allergic disorders and infections with drug-resistant organisms may benefit from taking probiotics, though some probiotics sold in health food and drugstores may be ineffective. It may be necessary to tailor-make the remedy for each condition or even each patient.

Meanwhile, people interested in fostering a health-promoting array of gut microorganisms should consider shifting from a diet heavily based on meats, carbohydrates and processed foods to one that emphasizes plants. As Dr. Jeffrey Gordon, a genomics specialist at Washington University School of Medicine, told The Times last year, “The nutritional value of food is influenced in part by the microbial community that encounters that food.”",Unlocking the Secrets of the Microbiome,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/well/live/unlocking-the-secrets-of-the-microbiome.html

For the makers of “Babylon Berlin,” it was crucial that the audience experience the past through the eyes of the protagonists.","The complicated plot encompasses a Russian freight train carrying poison gas and gold; secret military maneuvers; and a brutal May Day confrontation between police and Communists. There are Soviet agents and Trotskyist agitators, a cross-dressing jazz singer, an Armenian mafia boss and a rich industrialist in cahoots with a group of army officers.

The star of the show, however, is Berlin. The lavish production lovingly recreates the city’s 1920s streets, cafes and nightclubs. Around 70 percent of the series was shot on location, with the rest filmed on a massive set at the historic Babelsberg studios.

Costing 38 million euros (about $44 million) to produce, the 180-day shoot involved three crews and three writer/directors: Tom Tykwer (of “Perfume” and “Run Lola Run” fame), Achim von Borries and Henk Handloegten, who had all long sought to work together on a project based on this period.

“The three of us had the idea to do a big panoramic view of the society at the end of the 1920s, the Weimar Republic, before we actually knew the novels,” Mr. Handloegten said.

Paul Cooke, professor of world cinemas at the University of Leeds, said TV depictions of this period have been rare. “Most obviously, Fassbinder’s ‘Berlin Alexanderplatz,’ which was a big hit in the 1970s,” he said. “It’s touched on in Edgar Reitz’s ‘Heimat,’ which was a huge international hit. But it’s later periods of history that tend to be the focus of German productions that do well internationally.”

The makers of “Babylon Berlin,” however, were interested in exploring the prelude to the Third Reich. “All these people didn’t fall from the sky as Nazis,” Mr. Handloegten said. “They had to become Nazis.”

In writing the screenplay, the creators made some key changes to the books. As well as expanding the political elements, they turned Gereon Rath into a more sympathetic character, traumatized by his experiences in World War I, prone to fits of shaking and addicted to morphine.

Charlotte Ritter is no longer a bourgeois law student but a street-smart working-class woman. “We felt very strongly that we should have a main character from this proletarian background, because Berlin was always a poor city,” Mr. Handloegten explained.

Work has already begun on Season 3, and there’s plenty more source material to draw on. Mr. Kutscher has already written six Gereon Rath novels and plans another three, culminating with Kristallnacht in 1938.

The TV adaptation is already a commercial and critical hit at home. Within a week of its German premiere on Oct. 13, the first episode had been watched by 1.2 million people — a German viewing figure bested only by “Game of Thrones.”

“The show is epic, the story is complex,” the Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel wrote. “The TV version gives the material what it requires while never taking away the striking images, ambiguous characters and exciting story: everything needed to suck you in.”

The weekly magazine Der Spiegel described the show as a “masterpiece” and a “great, dizzying panorama,” and predicted that it could be “the first big German TV production since ‘Das Boot’ to have really relevant success abroad.”

The praise, however, has not been universal. The Munich-based daily Süddeutsche Zeitung said: “The period it depicts may have been sensuous, but the show is not. The world of ‘Babylon Berlin’ remains behind glass.”

In Britain, the reception has been positive so far. “It’s all wonderfully gripping, and Bruch has the most pained, expressive eyes you’ll see all year,” the critic for The Financial Times wrote. “With the arrival of Charlotte … drab secretary by day, jazz baby by night, we enter the youthful Berlin of dance crazes and desperate excess.”

Some critics have also drawn parallels to current political events, like the American election of Donald J. Trump, the Brexit vote, and the arrival of the far-right Alternative for Germany in the Bundestag.

“The echoes of the ‘populism’ of the 1930s with what is going on right now is certainly a link that is being made,” Professor Cooke said. “How far this is played out in the show itself remains to be seen. But it is fair to say that these kinds of historical dramas always tend to use the past as a cipher for the present.”

But Hajo Funke, professor of political science at the Free University Berlin, cautions against making too many comparisons. “Economically, socially and politically, it was a totally different situation,” he said.

“In 1929, there was a brief phase of stability after the terrible shock at the end of World War I, the inflation crisis, the economic restrictions,” Professor Funke added. “It was not at all clear if it would be possible to overcome the next crisis.”

At the same time, he agrees that the show taps into the current mood. “It could serve to point to the dangers, to the destructive forces in society and politics,” he said.

For the makers of “Babylon Berlin,” it was crucial that the audience experience the past through the eyes of the protagonists.

In the first season, for example, Hitler is only mentioned once in passing. After all, Berlin was a left-wing bastion, and in the 1928 election, the Nazis got only 1.6 percent of the city’s votes.

“In 1929, there were no Nazis in Berlin,” said the producer Stefan Arndt. “You cannot see or even smell that there’s danger coming.”","Sex, Drugs and Crime in the Gritty Drama ‘Babylon Berlin’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/arts/television/sex-drugs-and-crime-in-the-gritty-drama-babylon-berlin.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“I look around and see people retiring, and that is something I hate,” Mr. Toledano continued. “I was never bored at Dior, but it was time for a new direction. I believe in the luxury market — I don’t need to see analysis from consulting firms — and think we can catch more market share.”

Dior holds a special significance in both the group and the overall sector as the first luxury brand acquired by Mr. Arnault in 1985, and is the cornerstone of his empire.

Along with Mr. Arnault, Mr. Toledano, who joined Dior in 1994 as director of leather goods and was named chief executive in 1998, masterminded the transformation of the elite French fashion house into a worldwide phenomenon that became something of a strategic model for other luxury brands on how to bridge haute couture and haute pop culture.

During his tenure, Mr. Toledano oversaw the opening of almost 200 international stores, the growth of celebrity partnerships, the rise of the star designer, and the evolution of the fashion show into a major marketing initiative.

Widely respected, his influence has reached far beyond LVMH, through the ascension of a group of chief executives who once worked for him at Dior, including Michael Burke, the chief executive of Louis Vuitton; Claus-Dietrich Lahrs, the head of Bottega Veneta; Valérie Hermann, the president of global brands at Ralph Lauren, and Pierre Denis, the chief executive of Jimmy Choo.

Mr. Toledano also steered the Paris-based Dior through the transition from John Galliano to a new creative director. Mr. Galliano’s flamboyance and dramatic vision had helped to propel Dior out of fustiness and into relevance, but he was fired in 2011 after a drug and alcohol-fueled anti-Semitic outburst. He was replaced by Raf Simons but Mr. Simons stayed only three years, and was succeeded by Maria Grazia Chiuri, the brand’s first female designer.

The executive change comes at a crucial point for Dior: LVMH announced the purchase of Dior, which had previously been a sister brand under a shared holding company last April, and after a comprehensive retrospective of the fashion house opened at the Musée des Art Décoratifs in Paris this past summer to mark its 70th birthday. The Dior merger, in particular, created a giant fashion and leather goods group with combined annual sales of more than 5 billion euros, or $5.8 billion, according to Exane BNP Paribas analyst Luca Solca.

LVMH has consistently posted strong sales in what has proved to be a volatile global luxury goods market in recent years. Last month it reported higher-than-expected revenue growth for the third quarter, with like-for-like revenues, which strip out currency swings and acquisitions or disposals, growing 12 percent from a year earlier to €30.1 billion.

With Mr. Beccari, who helped build Fendi into the third-largest brand in the LVMH fashion and leather goods division, after Louis Vuitton and Dior, LVMH will be keeping its leadership in the family, while ensuring that smaller brands, many of which have been in flux, are given renewed attention.

Mr. Beccari’s appointment “signals a new era,” Mr. Arnault said in a statement.

“Sidney Toledano is the driving force behind the huge success of Christian Dior Couture around the world,” Mr. Arnault said. “I want to offer my profound gratitude and am delighted that we will continue to work together and benefit from his expertise.”

Mr. Toledano will have his hands full in his new role: Emilio Pucci is searching for a designer; there are questions about whether Phoebe Philo, the feted creative director of Céline, will stay for much longer; and Marc Jacobs, which in 2013 was thought to be a possible candidate for an initial public offering, has struggled with a brand reorganization and management change.

“What I have learned from 20 years at Dior is you have to be pragmatic, concrete, listen to people a lot, and give guidance,” Mr. Toledano said of how he will approach his new role. “People want leadership.”

Mr. Beccari and Mr. Toledano are to assume their new posts next year. A replacement for Mr. Beccari has not been announced.","LVMH Reshuffles Management, Shifting Sidney Toledano From Dior",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/business/dior-sidney-toledano-pietro-beccari.html

The oppressively hot afternoons in the Delta and the cool, quiet country nights of the rural woodlands inspired many of the greatest American storytellers, including William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty and Shelby Foote, and the blues musicians Robert Johnson and Son House.

This year, to honor the bicentennial of Mississippi’s statehood, residents throughout the state are following that tradition, telling the stories of their own communities with photographs employing the 21st-century technology of smartphones. The project, “Celebrating Storytellers,” was created by Chandler Griffin and Alison Fast, partners in Blue Magnolia Films and Barefoot Workshops, and will culminate next month with an exhibit of 200 five-foot-wide images in storefront windows in Jackson, Miss. Similar exhibits have already been held in five other cities.

“We didn’t want to just have big parties for the bicentennial with nothing that’s lasting afterwards,” Mr. Griffin said. “We really wanted to engage with communities. We wanted to go from town to town, and create spaces where people could have conversation about their community and what revitalization means.”

He and Ms. Fast went to a dozen towns and cities in Mississippi asking community leaders to help identify people who understood the fabric of their communities and invited them to a free, weeklong workshop and to begin documenting where they live with iPhones. The stories were chosen by the participants, who received guidance from the workshop team that included Aaron Phillips, a photographer who started out as a student at the Barefoot Workshops, and Natalie Irby, the executive producer.

There will be 100 participants in all ranging in age from 14 to 91.

In Mound Bayou, a small economically-depressed Delta city that was founded by former slaves in 1887, Myrna Smith-Thompson documented the rundown home of Isaiah Montgomery, a former slave of Jefferson Davis, who helped found the community. Ms. Smith-Thompson, who was born and raised in Mound Bayou, leads the Knights of Tabor, a benevolent community organization that is restoring local historic sites. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather led the organization before her.

“It’s not just a house,” she wrote for the project. “It’s the home of a man who in 1887 had a dream of turning a swampy piece of land filled with wild animals and mosquitoes and unimaginable obstacles into a negro self-governing community in Mississippi, for the people. He had the audacity to ask newly freed slaves to clear this land and make a nice place to live with all the amenities afforded to others. He had the nerve to attempt to influence free slaves to become self sufficient to create a safe haven for blacks amidst a climate of fear and hostility.”

At the start of the project last year, the emphasis was on Mississippi’s revitalization, not “race and reconciliation,” Mr. Griffin said. But the subject came up in every single workshop they held. In Clarksdale, an group of high school students from the mostly-black public school and an almost all-white private school made race the focus of their projects. Before meeting at the workshop they had rarely mixed, but they got together afterward for dinners and attended each other’s graduations. These experiences, Mr. Griffin said, “lead to change in communities.”

Mr. Griffin is a fifth-generation Mississippian, and attended Jackson Prep, a private institution that was started as a segregated school in 1970 in response to the federally mandated integration of the public schools. When he graduated in year 1994 he felt like he “had blinders on and was not exposed to anything.”

He attended art school in Savannah, Ga. and taught photography at the Maine Workshop in Rockport, M.E. before moving to New York City to “make his mark.” He rarely told anyone he was from Mississippi.

Photo

After a while, he realized that he didn’t really know Mississippi outside of where he grew up, so he returned to start Barefoot Workshops in Clarksdale and to learn more about his home.

“I fell in love with Mississippi in 2005 when I ran that first workshop, and ever since then I’ve just been trying to figure out ways to help tell the story and talk about the awesome things in Mississippi, as well as the problems, and look at the people working on solutions.”

Looking back at the experience, Ms. Smith-Thompson said the project taught her “to see things differently and how to tell stories with pictures” and made her “feel like a younger person.” For Christmas, she is buying a new iPhone to continue documenting her community.

“Storytelling helps us to share our different perspectives of our community with someone else, in a non-threatening way,” she explained. “The harsher the situation, the more impactful storytelling may be.”

It’s hard to have Trumpism if you don’t have Trump.

Ed Gillespie, the Republican candidate for governor in Virginia, tried his best to sound the call of Mr. Trump’s followers in stoking the nation’s culture wars. He was harsh on immigration, supportive of Confederate monuments and opposed to those N.F.L. players who have taken a knee.

But his public record before, as a national party chairman, White House counselor and Washington lobbyist, had few of those harsh edges. And like a lot of Republicans, he only grudgingly supported Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Most notably, Mr. Gillespie did not seek to campaign with the president in Virginia, settling for support via Twitter.

That left him with almost all of Mr. Trump’s baggage and few potential benefits.

Trump is allergic to accepting blame.

Mr. Trump, traveling in Asia, said that Mr. Gillespie’s problem may well have been not embracing him enough. The president’s approval rating in Virginia was 38 percent in one recent poll, and he lost the state to Hillary Clinton by more than five percentage points. Mr. Trump posted a message on Twitter endorsing Mr. Gillespie several weeks ago, then added a few more on Election Day. But with the stain of losing, Mr. Trump quickly cut ties.

Northern Virginia is the clear epicenter of the state’s political power.

The suburbs of Northern Virginia outside Washington, D.C., are now undeniably the most important region of the state politically. Wealthy and well-educated, the counties have rapidly become strongly Democratic, and population projections for the state indicate the areas will continue to far outpace more rural and Republican areas in growth.

The counties in Northern Virginia are broadly diverse. Prince William County now has more minorities than it does whites. The white population in Loudoun County has dropped almost 30 percentage points since 2000, and Asians are now the largest minority group, at 17 percent.

Hard-line Republican policies on immigration have helped drive immigrant voters to Democrats. Couple that with suburban women gravitating to the party, and it is a coalition so large in number that it is difficult to beat.

Republicans have not won statewide in Virginia since 2009. The next major test will be the Senate race in 2018, when Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat who was Hillary Clinton’s running mate last year, will seek a second term. His prospects now look much better.

Pragmatism wins over purity.

Progressives who did not enthusiastically back Lt. Gov. Ralph S. Northam, the Democratic candidate for Virginia governor, will be rethinking their theory of the race. Mr. Northam had a résumé that fit the profile of his state. He is an Army veteran, a physician and a moderate politically. He was, in a word, electable.

That does not mean the friction between the institutional party Democrats and those in the Bernie Sanders wing will fade. But the lesson from Virginia is that those fights in the primary are fine as long as each side coalesces behind the nominee. Mr. Northam defeated former Representative Tom Perriello, who was favored by progressives. But Mr. Perriello worked energetically for Mr. Northam’s election.

Red counties stay red.

Photo

Mr. Northam’s voice may have gone down easy in the vast southwestern part of Virginia, but there was no political affinity. While many Democrats have argued that their party needs to work to regain the support of rural white voters, the results in Virginia, at least, show that those efforts may be futile.

But there was a notable exception. Mr. Northam won in Virginia Beach, a traditionally Republican area, showing perhaps that the backlash against Trumpism could extend to parts of the military population that dominates that region.

An end to Chris Christie’s smash-mouth politics.

With a convincing, if expected, victory for governor of New Jersey, Philip D. Murphy, a former Wall Street banker, brought an emphatic end to the Chris Christie era. The Garden State now joins six other states that have Democrats in control of the legislative and executive branches.

Mr. Murphy managed to persuade voters of his transformation from wealthy deal maker to progressive Democrat, and he has vowed to make his state a firewall against the policies of Mr. Trump.

Now comes the hard part for Mr. Murphy, a relative political novice. Will he be able to deliver on his promises?

She and others compared Prince Mohammed’s campaign to anti-corruption drives by President Xi Jinping in China or President Vladimir V. Putin in Russia, where prosecutions are often politically motivated.

As many as 500 people have now been detained on allegations of corruption as part of the crackdown. Many are being held at Riyadh Ritz-Carlton in what may be the world’s most luxurious prison.

The Saudi Council of Ministers said Tuesday that all arrests were “based on specific evidence of criminality and acts that were intended criminal transgressions and resulted in unlawful gain.”

“The rights of the accused and the facts relating to the offenses are protected by law at all stages during the investigation and judicial process,” the council added.

Photo

But the government had not disclosed any specific charges or evidence, or even the names of those arrested. The first wave began just hours after a royal decree created an investigating committee under Prince Mohammed, leaving little time for inquiry. The courts are under the effective control of the king and crown prince. And it was unclear which branch of the court system might hear the cases — the main Shariah court system or the more specialized board of grievance courts that handle administrative complaints.

“This is a Pandora’s box to start having anti-corruption trials,” said David Ottaway, a Middle East fellow at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan research center. “Where does it stop within the royal family? Are there any princes that can show clean hands?”

“The law is not meant to govern the ruling family in any meaningful way, or to govern the relations between the ruling family and the state,” said Nathan J. Brown, a scholar at George Washington University who studies Arab legal systems.

“Ultimately, the king and some high members of the royal family can do what they want and make it legal later,” he said, and the lack of regulation over royal self-dealing “opens the door wide to what would be considered corruption in other systems.”

Many Saudis appear to have applauded the crackdown. Two-thirds are under 30, many are frustrated by high unemployment, and some may take a certain satisfaction at even an arbitrary comeuppance for so many of the rich and powerful.

“It’s going to be popular with the commoners who see important parts of the al-Saud family as a rent-seeking, unaccountable caste,” Steffen Hertog, an associate professor at the London School of Economics and the author of a book on the Saudi bureaucracy. “Saudi businesses have been complaining about royal encroachment for decades.”

Some cases may be clear-cut.

One area that the official Saudi media say Prince Mohammed intends to investigate is flooding in the city of Jidda that killed more than 100 people in 2009. In that case, a Saudi businessman was accused of absconding with millions of dollars allocated for a Jidda sewage system and never installing any pipes.

“We all knew, and we never reported on it,” Jamal Khashoggi, then the editor of a major Saudi newspaper and now living in exile, wrote this week in The Washington Post.

Beyond that case, only a few anonymously sourced reports of the potential charges have emerged. A professionally coordinated social media campaign, which appears to be organized by the government, has accused the most important prisoner, Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, the former chief of the national guard and a son of the previous king, of enriching himself at public expense by diverting funds from the national guard. Citing unnamed sources, news reports have suggested that he would be accused of hiring ghost employees and paying inflated contracts to companies he owned for equipment like walkie-talkies and bulletproof military gear.

His brother, Prince Turki bin Abdullah, the former governor of Riyadh, will reportedly be accused of paying inflated contracts to companies he owned for a subway under construction in the capital.

But in a country named for its ruling family, the line between public and private money can be hard to discern.

Prince Mohammed’s corruption committee “can basically detain anyone for anything they choose to call corruption,” said Robert Jordan, the former United States ambassador to Saudi Arabia. “That’s part of how this web was spun.”

The most famous detainee, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, had no apparent need for graft. He was well known as an investor in international stock markets and as one of the world’s richest people; the sources of his wealth were more transparent than most princes.

Prince Alwaleed had been a critic of the kingdom’s closed economy and pervasive corruption. A secret 1996 diplomatic memorandum said that Prince Alwaleed told the American ambassador how a handful of senior princes controlled billions of dollars in off-budget programs, revenue roughly equal to one million barrels of the country’s oil per day. According to the memo, the Two Holy Mosques project and the Ministry of Defense’s strategic storage project, were “highly secretive, subject to no ministry of finance oversight or controls.”

The memo, disclosed in the trove of State Department documents released by WikiLeaks seven years ago, provided a detailed blueprint of the varied ways that money flows to members of the royal family either from state coffers or through private business in an otherwise opaque system.

An embassy official received an unprecedented glimpse into royal finances when he visited the Ministry of Finance Office of Decisions and Rules in 1996, where servants came to pick up stipends for their royal masters. Sons of the founding king received as much as $270,000 a month, while a great-great-grandchild collected $8,000 a month. On top of those payments, bonuses of $1 million to $3 million were handed out to, say, construct a palace.

Princes were known for borrowing money and simply never paying it back, which nearly led to the collapse of the National Commercial Bank. Royals were also known to act as the exclusive agents for foreign companies in the kingdom. When they founded their own businesses, they often relied on either government spending or state subsidies.

“The government, specifically the Ministries of Finance and Municipal and Rural Affairs, often transfers public land to princes, who in turn sell it at huge profit to real estate developers,” another diplomat wrote in a 2007 memorandum, noting that Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the longtime ambassador to the United States, and Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahd, the favorite son of King Fahd, profited to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars by selling land for a centrally planned megacity north of Jidda.

Perhaps the most famous statement on corruption in Saudi Arabia was made by Prince Bandar. In an interview with PBS in 2001, he said: “If you tell me that building this whole country, and spending $350 billion out of $400 billion, that we had misused or got corrupted with $50 billion, I’ll tell you, yes. But I’ll take that anytime.”

Weapons contracts have long been a source of wealth. British media reported that Prince Bandar received well over $1 billion in secret payments from BAE Systems, the leading British military contractor, over the course of a decade. The son of founding King Abdulaziz’s personal doctor, Adnan Khashoggi, became a billionaire as an arms dealer and go-between for weapons makers and members of the royal family.

No matter where you lived in New York, sooner or later all roads led to 116th Street and Lexington Avenue, the commercial and cultural heart of East Harlem.

Joseph Rodriguez was no exception: Though born and raised in Brooklyn — with detours at Rikers and a life-changing encounter with photography — he, as a teenager, liked to hang out at his uncle’s candy store and numbers spot where the streets were abuzz with music and life. Those early encounters led to a May 1990 National Geographic cover story and the most important project of his life after he spent the latter half of the 1980’s photographing El Barrio’s streets and residents in their homes and on the block.

Now, a revised version of that body of work will be on display at the Bronx Documentary Center, as well as in the new book, “Spanish Harlem: El Barrio in the ’80s.”

While it is “easy to make gritty pictures of poverty,” Mr. Rodriguez was looking to go deeper and connect with people whose struggles he knew intimately as the son of a single mother.

“I carried this story for a long time before I could go out and make the work,” he said. “That was an important path for me to understand patience and waiting, connecting and trust.”

His images reflect an intimacy — and long-term commitment — that marks his later work in East Los Angeles, Romania and Puerto Rico. For him, this project was deeply personal, and still is.

“We’re not garbage people, we have a presence,” he said. “One thing that was extremely important was to show our children with some dignity. You see their strength. We’ve gone through hell and back, just like now in Puerto Rico. But we get up, and we fight back.”

Trump’s Visit to China: More Business Deals Than Trade Pacts Image An auto parts factory in Huaibei, China.

Credit Chinatopix, via Associated Press

BEIJING — President Trump arrived in China on Wednesday backed by campaign-trail promises to get tough against the United States’ largest trading partner. He is accompanied by the chiefs of some of the most ambitious and influential American companies: Boeing, Goldman Sachs, Westinghouse Electric and Qualcomm, among others.

The expected outcome? Not much, to the frustration of some American business executives.

Mr. Trump’s meetings this week with Xi Jinping, China’s president, and other Chinese leaders come at a difficult time for both countries. Each has been consumed with domestic issues, from West Wing infighting and a special counsel investigation in Washington to a sensitive leadership transition in Beijing.

The Trump administration in particular has been stretched thin on trade. It has been slow to fill important trade-related positions, because of distractions and the lengthy congressional confirmation process. The administration has been preoccupied with rewriting the North American Free Trade Agreement and a United States trade deal with South Korea .

Trade has also been supplanted by North Korea as the most talked-about issue in Northeast Asia for President Trump, and an issue on which he wants Chinese cooperation, not confrontation. With the administration also trying to push tax policy changes through Congress, two top economic officials are not even joining the trip , but staying in Washington — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council.

As a result, planning for Mr. Trump’s Beijing trip focused largely on finding deals he could announce, like high-profile orders for Boeing jets and other American goods. By contrast, the two sides have engaged in little of the back-and-forth shuttle diplomacy by lower-ranking officials that can pave the way for new trade agreements.

“From what I understand, there really hasn’t been much of that for this visit,” said William Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, a group that has worked closely with American trade negotiators for decades, “which makes us a bit concerned that there may not be much discussion on the structural issues.”

Video Since his election, President Trump has gone from hammering China on trade policy to praising President Xi Jinping for his country’s response to North Korea.

Chinese and American officials offered a taste on Wednesday, when they disclosed a series of deals they valued at $9 billion ahead of an event planned for Thursday with the two presidents. One, the sale of 50 Bell helicopters to a Chinese buyer, represented the kind of industrial export that Mr. Trump called for during his campaign. But several others were food sales that might do little to strengthen the United States’ industrial base. Many of the details were not disclosed.

The lack of progress on trade issues has led to grumbling among business types.

Several financial firms were interested in joining the trip to discuss Chinese restrictions on bank ownership, but they decided to pull back when they learned that the Trump administration was focused on making deals rather than pushing for structural reform, said an industry source who is familiar with the negotiations, who declined to be identified while discussing internal deliberations.

Trump administration officials say there was more preparation on trade issues than meets the eye for the current trip, and they add that they have been laying the groundwork to do more in the coming months. These efforts include an investigation into Chinese infringement of American intellectual property , which could lead the administration to impose tariffs or other significant limits on Chinese goods. They also include an effort to tighten restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States , complemented by congressional legislation that is expected to be introduced soon. There are also investigations into limiting imports of solar panels , steel, aluminum foil and other goods mainly from China that the administration contends are subsidized by the Chinese government.

Those efforts have been proceeding slowly. As a result, the preparatory work for the summit meeting has been led by Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross, whose agency focuses more on corporate transactions.

Some companies declined to join the trip, afraid of provoking reprisals by the Chinese government or of being perceived as too close to the Trump administration and its controversies. But more than two dozen were planning to attend, including smaller firms like Stine Seed, the solar project developer SolarReserve and the wastewater treatment company Drylet.

Critics say these commercial deals will do little to address the bigger economic imbalances between the countries.

“There are a lot of deals in the works,” David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said at a conference in Washington on Oct. 31. “They do not reflect a change in policy.”

China has nonetheless been considering opening some narrowly targeted sectors to greater international competition. Beijing ministries have particularly looked at whether to allow greater investment in Chinese service industries. In a briefing on Oct. 31, a senior administration official said improving trade competitiveness in services would be one of the White House’s top priorities for the trip. Chinese officials said they were open to that.

“Our manufacturing industries opened up relatively early with relatively wide areas,” said Gao Feng, a Commerce Ministry spokesman. “In contrast, service industries opened up relatively late. We need to expand the opening up of services while we deepen the opening up of manufacturing.”

More American investment in the Chinese service sectors may not do much to help the heavily blue-collar workers in Rust Belt states who helped propel Mr. Trump to the presidency a year ago. These workers have absorbed the brunt of job losses from Chinese competition and technological change.

One service sector that may be ripe for opening is banking. China has begun reviewing how it has hamstrung foreign banks with a long list of regulations that limit the services they can offer and cap their ownership stakes in Chinese banks. Those rules have left foreign banks with a combined market share of just 1.5 percent of the Chinese banking system’s assets.

Guo Shuqing , the chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, said during a news conference on the sidelines of the recent Communist Party congress that he saw room for changes. “We will further open up and give more space to foreign banks in the types of establishments, the credentials of stakeholders, the percentage of stakes they hold, and the range of businesses,” he said.

China has already made it a little easier for international asset managers to operate investment funds in China and allowed big institutions like Citibank to establish toeholds in China’s bond market by granting them narrowly defined trading licenses.

But a separate issue has cropped up this year: China’s ever-tightening cybersecurity rules. These regulations have dimmed considerably the American banking sector’s enthusiasm to start making large investments in China, particularly in commercial banking.

China has issued new rules — although they have been paused because of bitter complaints from bankers — that would require banks to buy most of the telecommunications equipment they use in China from Chinese suppliers and to store their Chinese data in China.

“It’s still very much on the minds of our bankers,” said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. “That is not something they are eager to do.”

It reminded me of the nasty playground lady at elementary school who teased me mercilessly by calling me “Pampers.” Not the best thing to call a very short person. I hated her.

I went swimming and when I came out of the water, it felt like half of the ocean had been absorbed into my pad. I realized that maybe those ladies in the commercials were having me on.

Later, I realized that I was actually seeing ads for tampons, which were not “offered” to me by my mother. She had told me I shouldn’t use them. Not until I was older. We didn’t discuss them. These were not an option for me.

A few years later my friend Sherry invited me to join her and her mom in Palm Springs. Before we got to her place we went to the supermarket and loaded up on all kinds of goodies and junk food. This was a first. I never got to buy stuff like that. I’m guessing her mom was … around? But I felt like it was just the two of us heading to our own place in the desert.

Sherry had a pool. I had my period. I was 16 and had been having it for four years. (I mean once a month, not constantly). Of course, we had been planning to spend the whole day in the pool. So when I told her I wasn’t going to swim — and why — she looked at me like I was crazy. Sherry grabbed me by the hand and took me into the womb of this beautiful, white, creamy chic apartment in the desert, held up a tampon, and said: “Pammy. Are you serious?!!! You put this in. Right now. Are you kidding me? This will help you. I’m about to change your life. This is the end and the beginning.” (I do believe I’m paraphrasing here — but it’s my memory and it’s special and I am grateful to Sherry forever for it).

I was afraid to put the tampon in. In fact, I was convinced it wouldn’t go in. That I was the one woman on the planet who didn’t have the right equipment.

But it worked. We went swimming. And my life was better after that. Now, I had a new feeling. That it was kind of cool that I had a period at all. My body had an ability to work like this. To go through cycles. And do a thing that women get to do. I felt like I was a part of something bigger. In life. And I didn’t have to suffer. And I could go swimming … without leaving a trail of chum for the sharks … anytime I wanted. (Update: Now I never swim, and I think I have about four periods left.)

Addendum:

O.K. So now. I’m a mother to three girls. And here I go in the opposite direction of my own childhood experience.

“Hey, girls. Grab a mirror and explore yourself.”

“Want to have a talk about sex? Anything?”

“What kind of razors do you want? Mach3? That’s the kind Mommy uses.”

“You have a boyfriend now … so … I’m not … saying … you are sexually active … but … regardless, I made you an appointment … at the lady-parts doctor.”

All to be met with a pillow or hand held up in front of their faces followed by an, “Ew. Stop, Mom! I got this! I’ll ask my sister.”

And now I realize that if my mom had ever said anything to me about my vagina, I would have thrown her out the window. I mean, I can’t even take it if she touches my hair.

Three internationally renowned choreographers provide quite dissimilar answers in the Royal Ballet’s new triple bill at Covent Garden.

Ballet is about sensuous dancing to music (says Twyla Tharp, in “The Illustrated ‘Farewell,’” a world premiere to Haydn’s “Farewell” Symphony, No. 45 in F sharp minor, which incorporates her “As Time Goes By,” first made in 1973 for the Joffrey Ballet). Ballet is about telling an exciting story (says Arthur Pita, in “The Wind,” the world premiere of a staging of Dorothy Scarborough’s 1925 novel — later memorably adapted as a 1928 silent film directed by Victor Sjöström and starring Lilian Gish — here set to a commissioned score by Frank Moon). Ballet is about moody atmosphere, theatrical effects and quasi-military regimentation (says Hofesh Shechter, in “Untouchable,” created for the Royal in 2015 to a score composed by Mr. Shechter and Nell Catchpole).

Each of those three answers has proved perfectly valid in other ballets. These three works, however, are all problematic at best. The evening not only grows worse as it proceeds, it grows more tiresome and foolish.

But it starts with “The Illustrated ‘Farewell,’” which has several sequences — some extended, some fleeting — in which Ms. Tharp reminds the London audience that she is as sophisticated a choreographer as any alive today. Her vocabulary is eclectic and large, her grammar arrestingly idiosyncratic, her skill at group organization often superlative.

Ms. Tharp here turns the first two movements of the “Farewell” Symphony into a long, demanding, complex pas de deux for Sarah Lamb and Steven McRae. This looks entirely Tharpian; the traditional lexicon of ballet is seamlessly extended — with slides on flat feet, boogying moves, through-the-body shimmies and vertiginous plunges. Dancing occurs to both silence and music, as if the dancers were attuned to a larger score than the one we hear. When Mr. McRae, back turned to us, does a sideways ripple passing left to right through arms and torso, he’s showing us how Ms. Tharp can even include the style of the Royal Ballet’s founder-choreographer Frederick Ashton and make that look Tharpian too.",Review: A Triple Bill at the Royal Ballet Comes Up Two-Thirds Short,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/arts/dance/twyla-tharp-royal-ballet-review.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Assessing the grim toll of the massacre in Sutherland Springs, Tex., sheriff’s deputies found 22 of the bodies inside the First Baptist Church, but by their reasoning, one more victim died there — inside the womb of Crystal Holcombe, who was killed in the pews along with three of her five children.

Texas is one of at least 38 states with a law that recognizes a fetus in utero as a potential crime victim separate from the mother, or where stiffer penalties apply when crimes are committed against pregnant women. Federal law recognizes unborn fetuses as separate victims of federal and military crimes.

The laws, some recent and others decades old, are another battle front in the long, passionate political war over abortion and the question of when life begins. Anti-abortion groups have lobbied for fetal homicide laws as part of a broader campaign for “personhood,” hoping to persuade the public to regard prenatal life at any stage of development as a human being deserving of legal rights and protection.

The federal Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004 took five years to get through Congress. It gained momentum after the killing in California of Laci Peterson, who was eight months pregnant.

Mel instantly liked what I was shooting, and it was fitting that we met at that time. While I was photographing the Longwood section of South Bronx, Mel was out making pictures on the streets of his youth a few miles north in the Bathgate neighborhood for images that would later be published as “In the South Bronx of America.”

Mel let me into his life, and I was alongside him when he took many of the pictures in his book. We made the connections between his youth as a Jewish man who returned to where he had grown up on the streets of the South Bronx and seeing how its current residents – my family and friends – had been disenfranchised. Mel introduced me to politics and taught me who the players were and how they were being exposed. There was the catalyst that got me thinking how I could use photography to change and document that.

Mel’s approach to documentary photography was shaped by his own strong belief in social justice, which led him back to his old neighborhood to document how its beleaguered residents confronted its decline, the impact of city policies of official neglect, or the guerilla ingenuity of Puerto Rico’s Villa Sin Miedo, a land rescue effort to provide affordable housing.

What was central in his work – and what he taught us – was that when people let you into their lives, your photographs can amplify their voices on the issues that mattered to them, despite the silence and indifference of the rest of the city and its power brokers. Under his guidance, I started making those connections between my neighborhood’s decline and the larger forces buffeting it, from political neglect and corruption to the greed of landlords who cut services and then abandoned their properties or hired people to torch them for insurance.

My work from that era was influenced by Mel’s lessons and his own example as a compassionate photographer on a mission. Sure, I took pictures of the fires, the abandoned buildings or skeletal cars dumped on the streets. But I also caught early B-Boys dancing at the Hunts Point Palace, kids playing on the streets and the other rhythms of life. And, sadly, I also have portraits of friends who would not survive much past their teenage years, their lives cut short by drugs, AIDS or guns.

I am but one of many young, socially aware photographers fortunate to have attended Mel’s seminal workshops where he introduced us to the world of documentary photography and photojournalism. The summer workshops were a six-week intensive course where some of the best photojournalists in the world shared their images of the issues of the time, from covering the wars in Central America to poverty in the middle America and around the world.

The students who attended those workshops fanned out throughout New York City covering the rise of AIDS and the birth of political activism in the gay and lesbian community, as well as protests against racism and police brutality that turned the streets of black and Latino communities into raging battlegrounds. There wasn’t a single week where there wasn’t a demonstration taking place and that was the real classroom where Mel’s students learned their craft.

Mel came into his own as a photographer during the social unrest of the 1960s. Maybe it’s not a coincidence that his former students are now photojournalists documenting very similar deep divisions that are consuming our country.

Mel died last week from the effects of Alzheimer’s, a disease that slowly and painfully took him from us. The best memorial we can give him is to continue the practice as he taught it.

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

It was not clear whether that was a good thing or a bad one.

For first-time homeowners like Anthony and Melissa Campagna, who moved from an apartment in Long Island City, Queens, to a four-bedroom house in West Orange, N.J., in March, preparing for the first winter is a daunting task. What is a boiler, anyway? And what do you do with it other than crank up the thermostat?

Buying a house “was very exciting, but somewhat overwhelming,” said Mr. Campagna, 31, who works in finance. “Having lived in a condo association, I didn’t have to take care of stuff much.”

There are tools that can help. Mr. Campagna organizes projects on Google Drive spreadsheets that he shares with his wife. Smartphone apps like HomeZada and BrightNest can also help you keep tabs on a to-do list that never ends.

Still, you need to know what to do — from the roof down to the basement, and out to the backyard. Here is how to get started.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

CHECK THE EXTERIOR

Start by giving the outside of your house a checkup. Walk around the perimeter and look for cracks in the siding or peeling paint. Are the windowsills in good condition? Check the roof for missing or broken tiles. Fix problems while the days are still relatively warm. After a rainstorm, walk around the house and look for any signs that water might not be draining properly, like pooling water or damaged gutters or downspouts.

“The objective is to get as much of the water away from your house as possible,” said Scott Johnson, the director of operations for WIN Home Inspection, a network of more than 190 home inspection firms in 33 states.

THE GUTTERS

Of all the fall chores, cleaning the gutters and downspouts is among the most critical. Your gutters direct water away from your roof and siding, and down into the drainage system. Clogged gutters can cause your roof to leak and lead to ice dams in cold weather. So clean them or hire someone to do the job after the leaves fall. “When the gutters aren’t kept clean, the moisture just sits on the rooftop,” said Dina Dwyer-Owens, a co-chair of the board of directors of the Dwyer Group, a parent company of home-repair franchises including Mr. Handyman and Mr. Rooter.

Just don’t do the work too soon. Clean the gutters before the last of the leaves fall, and you could find yourself back up on that ladder a few weeks later. “I think I did it a little too early,” said Mr. Campagna of West Orange, N.J., who rushed to clean his gutters before Mrs. Campagna, 30, gave birth to their first child in October. “That was a rookie mistake.” And a wasted Saturday afternoon.

If you plan to do the work yourself, be careful on that ladder. Ladder mishaps sent nearly 176,000 people to the hospital in 2013, according to the National Safety Council. If your ladder has seen better days, consider an upgrade. (These fiberglass models are recommended by Wirecutter, the New York Times’s product review site.)

If you hire a professional, expect to spend around $150 for the job, according to HomeAdvisor.

THE WINDOWS AND DOORS

If you have window air-conditioning units, take them out and store them until next summer. But handle those unwieldy appliances with care to avoid injury.

Or you could leave them in place. Ms. Levy of Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, covers the outside of her window units with an insulated sheath and wedges towels between the sill and the unit to keep drafts out.

Next, swap out screens for storm doors and windows. “It’s something that we automatically do when it starts getting cold out,” Ms. Levy said. While you’re changing out the screens for glass, check your windows and doors for drafts. Add weather stripping or caulk wherever cold air seeps in.

SMOKE ALARMS

Three out of five home-fire deaths happen in properties without working smoke alarms, according to the United States Fire Administration. So make sure yours work. Change the batteries in all your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors once a year; the day you set the clocks back is a good one to do it.

Check the manufacturing date, too, and replace any detectors that are more than 10 years old. Any reliable model will do, but if you’re interested in one that will alert you to problems when you’re away, a smart smoke alarm like the Nest Protect is sensitive to slow- and fast-burning fires, and has apps that will alert you anywhere in the world if something’s amiss.

Laundry dryers cause 2,900 home fires a year nationally and failing to clean them is the leading culprit, according to the United States Fire Administration. So call a professional once a year to service your dryer vent and help remove lint, debris and other hazards that could spark a fire.

THE CHIMNEY

Heat, smoke and dangerous gases from your fireplace and heating system travel up your chimney and out of your house, keeping the air inside breathable. A dirty chimney could affect air quality and also pose a fire hazard.

So keep your chimney clean. The Chimney Safety Institute of America recommends having it inspected annually and cleaned as needed. “In general, with chimneys and fireplaces, the more you use it, the more likely you need it to be swept,” said Mr. Johnson, of WIN Home Inspection. Expect to spend between $125 and $200 on a chimney sweep, according to Angie’s List.

THE HEATING SYSTEM

If you were going on a long road trip, you would get your car tuned up before you started your journey, not afterward. The same goes for your heating system. Call a plumber or a furnace repair company to prepare your boiler or furnace for winter before the cold weather arrives.

Your contractor should clean the equipment, make sure it is working properly and let you know if it needs any repairs. “The heating system ain’t going to break down when it’s 80 degrees out,” said Kerry O’Brien, the president of T.F. O’Brien Cooling and Heating in New Hyde Park, N.Y. “You don’t want to be stuck when it’s five degrees in the middle of the night” with a heating system that won’t turn on.

THE PIPES

No one wants a frozen pipe, so keep an eye on yours. Drain the outside water faucets and shut them off before the first freeze. On very cold nights, open cabinets beneath the sink to let warm air in and, if you are especially worried about freezing pipes, let a slow drip of water run through them. Resist the urge to turn down the thermostat to save money – you want to keep the pipes warm. Extreme weather “is not a time to start trying to save on your energy bill,” Mr. O’Brien said. “Crank your heat up during those weeks.”

PUT THE GARDEN TO BED

By November, you may not be thinking much about your hydrangeas, but they still need you. Prune your shrubs and hedges now. Cut foliage away from the house so that ice or snow on the branches won’t damage your siding or let water into your home.

But use restraint, so as not to cut off next spring’s bloom. “Try to contain yourself. Cut back half of what you want to cut back,” said Jan Johnsen, a landscape designer in Mount Kisco, N.Y.

If you have trees on your property, the battle of the leaves may feel endless, but ignore the pile on your lawn and it could mold and suffocate your grass. But before you succumb to the mighty leaf blower and start blasting away, consider a more measured approach. Rake up most of the leaves and use them as mulch for your flower beds. Mow the rest in place with your lawn mower. By mowing over the leaves, you help break them down so they can decompose and feed the grass. All that foliage “is not garbage, it’s black gold,” Ms. Johnsen said. “There’s a reason the leaves fall to the earth.”

THE PATIO

Empty ceramic pots of soil and store them in your garage or basement for the winter so they do not crack in freezing temperatures. Drain the hoses and store them, too. Shut down the sprinkler system and call the pool maintenance company to close up your pool, if you have one. But wait for a crisp sunny to day to cover patio furniture — you don’t want to trap any moisture under the tarp.

STOCK UP ON FIREWOOD

If you plan to build a fire this winter, order seasoned firewood in the fall. Stack it loosely on pallets to keep moisture at bay. Cover the pile with a plastic tarp. You can store wood in an unheated garage, but do not store more than a week’s supply in the house, as the wood could attract insects, according to Michigan State University Extension.

BRACE FOR WINTER WEATHER

If you have a snowblower, check it. You may need to have it serviced, and many local repair companies will pick up and drop off a blower as part of the service. “Start it up, run it for a couple of minutes and make sure it’s O.K.,” said Rich Janow, 74, who has lived in a six-bedroom house in South Orange, N.J., for 32 years with his wife, Nancy Chiller Janow, 64. “Do it now so that if you have a problem and you need the repair people to fix it, you have enough time before the really bad weather sets in.”

If you don’t have a snowblower, now is the best time to buy one, when it’s early in the season. (Wirecutter has some suggestions.)

If you have a portable generator, check that, too. If you don’t have one, now is a good time to consider investing in one. Update your emergency supply kit with flashlights, fresh batteries, a first-aid kit, food, water and a portable radio.

Stock up on Snow Melt and make sure your shovels are in good condition before the weatherman tells you snow is imminent. Make sure the supplies are accessible (and you remember where you put them) before the snow starts falling. Otherwise, you may find yourself digging your way to that shovel.

If the winter is a snowy one, use a roof rake to remove excess snow from your roof, and stay on the lookout for ice dams, accumulations of ice and snow along your eaves that could damage your gutters, roof and siding.

STAY ON TRACK

Learn how your house works and you may find that maintenance is something you actually – gasp — enjoy. “For me, it’s been such a great love affair,” said Judy E. Mendoza, 69, a saleswoman for Halstead who has lived in a three-bedroom house in East Hampton for 27 years and starts preparing for winter in July. “I’ve enjoyed taking care of the house, and the house has taken care of me.”

“I thought if you’re writing hateful comment towards Hillary or Trump that are really, really angry and horrible, I thought that person is going to be horrible in person as well,” Mr. Lien said.
Many of them are trolls, but many of them are just really strongly opinionated people,” Mr. Lien said.
“Just to see their homes, their decorations around them, their computers — all of those things give quite a lot of personality to the photo,” Mr. Lien said.
Mr. Lien spent weeks researching and studying commenters.","Nick Haynes didn’t seem so bad.

Sure, online he had promised civil war if Hillary Clinton were elected, but Mr. Haynes was first and foremost a family man. He’d given up his days of motorcycles and drinking to live a sober life in a sleepy Pennsylvania town with his four children, where he had a full-time job as a truck driver.

But his family life contrasted sharply with his other full-time job, that of a prolific online commenter. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he tweeted an average of 57 times a day about a corrupt system, biased media and “Killary.” He compared voting for Mrs. Clinton to killing your own children.

It was this disconnect between “normal life” and intense online debate that drove Kyrre Lien, a photographer based in Oslo, to look into the lives of the online commenting community. For a project called “The Internet Warriors,” Mr. Lien combed through tens of thousands of online comments to put together a group of 27 internet debaters from around the world, representing all sides of the political spectrum.

“They had steady jobs, they had family, they had friends and lived quite a normal life, but at the same time, you saw they had these hateful comments,” he said. “That was part of what drove me to dig into this.”

In the case of Mr. Haynes, Mr. Lien assumed that he would personify his comments.

“I thought if you’re writing hateful comment towards Hillary or Trump that are really, really angry and horrible, I thought that person is going to be horrible in person as well,” Mr. Lien said. “But many of the people were actually quite nice, made me coffee and tea and, until politics came up, it was like flipping the switch on a different personality.”

Still, Mr. Lien is hesitant to categorize them as internet trolls.

“Labeling them all as internet trolls would be too harsh. Many of them are trolls, but many of them are just really strongly opinionated people,” Mr. Lien said. “All of the people I met are really dedicated in the cause they’re fighting.”

They have full-time jobs and families, they are men and women of all ages, who feel marginalized in some way or another. Take, for example, Ashleigh Jones, 22, a psychology student in Cardiff, Wales. She’s amassed more than 180,000 tweets on various subjects including entertainment, L.G.B.T. issues and “hot guys.”

Photo

“Some people have also called me a troll, like when I said that ISIS should kill David Cameron,” Ms. Jones told Mr. Lien, referring to the former British prime minister. “I don’t think I’m a troll. I might have strong opinions, but they are just that — opinions. For me, a troll is someone who is ruining the discussion, and that’s not me.”

The photographs feature portraits of the commenters, many of them in their natural commenting habitat inside their homes. Video interviews accompany the subjects online, as well as a book.

“Just to see their homes, their decorations around them, their computers — all of those things give quite a lot of personality to the photo,” Mr. Lien said.

Mr. Lien spent weeks researching and studying commenters. One thread took him down a dark path on Kim Kardashian’s Facebook account. He spent three or four days going through all the comments on her account looking for frequent commenters with a consistent message. But in the end, that was one type of opinion he wasn’t able to capture on camera — misogynists.

Mr. Lien found that the motivation behind commenters depends on their political affiliation. On the right, it’s “because they feel threatened and society is letting them down, they’re being left by themselves,” Mr. Lien said, whereas people on the left “feel that we need to stand up for what we believe in.”

Sofia Srour, 23 and Muslim, defends her religion daily.

“There is so much ignorance and hate directed towards my religion in the comment section that I quickly become irritated. Anger drives me,” she told Mr. Lien. “I have spent more than three hours every day sharing my views on Islam. It’s a bit scary to engage in these discussions, but I feel that it’s important to balance out all the negativity that is posted.”

Mr. Lien may have spent four years trailing the lives of what he calls internet warriors, but the photographer is far from calling himself a troll.

“I’d like to be more of an internet peacekeeping force than an internet warrior,” he said.

And yet, scientists estimate that when the supereruption occurred, the magma was at 785 degrees Celsius. To explain the discrepancy, the team suspects that heat infiltrated the system so quickly that the argon didn’t have time to escape. This heat is likely what awoke the cool supervolcano, pushing it toward eruption in less than a few hundred years — perhaps within decades.

That’s a far cry from the lethargic time scales that often define the field of geology. And yet, recent research at the Yellowstone supervolcano in Wyoming and the Taupo supervolcano in New Zealand has also suggested that the events leading up to supereruptions can occur on human time scales.

The findings suggest that the supervolcano had to wake up from an extremely cold state, raising questions about how a solid ocean of magma could melt and mobilize so rapidly.

“The physics of how this all works is still being worked on and debated,” Dr. Andersen says. But many think that an injection of fresh magma further below the volcano likely did the trick.

And given that Long Valley’s magma sits a mere five kilometers below the surface, such an event wouldn’t have gone unnoticed, Dr. Gualda says. Waters circulating in the crust would have started to heat up, generating new hydrothermal features like geysers, hot springs and mud pots as the landscape started to boil over. The ground, too, would have swelled upward as the supervolcano’s magma reservoir grew.

Should other supervolcanoes play by the same rules as Long Valley, the results could help scientists read the signals of unrest preceding future supereruptions or even smaller eruptions.",The Cool Beginnings of a Volcano’s Supereruption,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/science/the-cool-beginnings-of-a-volcanos-supereruption.html

Last month, an Access Hollywood correspondent asked the actress Uma Thurman to comment on abuse of power in Hollywood, presumably in light of the sexual assault allegations against the producer Harvey Weinstein. Speaking slowly and deliberately, through gritted teeth, Thurman responded, “I don’t have a tidy soundbite for you, because I’ve learned — I am not a child — and I have learned that when I’ve spoken in anger I usually regret the way I express myself. So I’ve been waiting to feel less angry. And when I’m ready, I’ll say what I have to say.”

Thurman is seething, like we have all been seething, in our various states of breaking open or, as Thurman chooses, waiting. We are seething at how long we have been ignored, seething for the ones who were long ago punished for telling the truth, seething for being told all of our lives that we have no right to seethe. Thurman’s rage is palpable yet contained, conveying not just the tempestuous depths of #MeToo but a profound understanding of the ways that female anger is received and weaponized against women.

In the past few months alone we’ve seen Carmen Yulín Cruz, mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, pilloried by the far right for criticizing Donald Trump’s anemic response to Hurricane Maria (“We are dying here,” Cruz told the news media, “I am mad as hell.”) and the Florida congresswoman Frederica Wilson deluged with abuse after she characterized Trump’s call to the military widow Myeshia Johnson as “insensitive” and “an insult.” Both Cruz and Wilson were directly targeted by the president on Twitter, then incessantly memed and regurgitated and redigested and rememed by his obedient online horde.

China’s influence on North Korea may have been further eroded by Mr. Xi’s decision last month to restore relations with South Korea, a move that deepened the North’s suspicions.
Officials in Beijing and Washington point out that China has taken some measurable steps on North Korea.
It has agreed to sever banking ties, end joint-venture companies with North Korea and limit the export of diesel fuel.","Speaking in South Korea earlier Wednesday, Mr. Trump made an impassioned call for China and other countries to pull together to confront the North, which he described as a sinister regime that starved and terrorized its people — a tragic failed experiment in the “laboratory of history.”

“It is our responsibility and our duty to confront this danger together because the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows, and the fewer the options become,” he said to the National Assembly, South Korea’s parliament.

“To those nations that choose to ignore this threat or, worse still, to enable it, the weight of this crisis is on your conscience,” said Mr. Trump, who tried to travel to the heavily fortified demilitarized zone between the North and South but had to turn back after fog grounded his helicopter.

Since Mr. Trump first played host to Mr. Xi at his Florida estate last April, he has said he is counting on Mr. Xi to do the right thing with North Korea, alternately praising and prodding the Chinese leader about enforcing tougher United Nations sanctions.

To his frustration, however, Mr. Xi has stopped short of targeting Mr. Kim with unilateral sanctions that would threaten his regime, send refugees into China and raise the possibility of a Korean Peninsula under control of the South, a close American ally.

China supplies much of North Korea’s energy; almost all of its crude oil flows in an 18-mile pipeline from the port city of Dandong, under the Yalu River, into the North Korean town of Sinuiju.

“Trump somewhat naïvely calculated that China would be more helpful on North Korea if he was ‘magnanimous’ on trade; I doubt Beijing sees it that way,” said Matthew P. Goodman, a political economist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and an adviser on Asian economics in the administrations of Barack Obama and George W. Bush.

At the start of this trip, Trump administration officials denied the president was willing to make concessions on trade in the hope of extracting what was needed on North Korea. But the president is also not calling on China to make any significant moves to open its markets, preferring to put the spotlight on big-ticket deals for American companies.

Some China experts said Mr. Trump failed to understand the limits of Chinese influence on the North. Although China fought alongside the North against the United States in the 1950-53 Korean War and remains its chief economic patron, the two countries are barely friends.

Some Chinese call the relationship a “fake alliance.” The two militaries have no working relationship. Early in his rule, Mr. Kim executed his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who had served as the primary conduit between the North and China’s senior leadership.

China’s influence on North Korea may have been further eroded by Mr. Xi’s decision last month to restore relations with South Korea, a move that deepened the North’s suspicions.

For more than a year, China had encouraged a boycott of South Korean goods and downgraded relations in protest over the deployment of an American-made missile defense system. But China relented last month, as the countries agreed to end the dispute even though South Korea is keeping the system.

Officials in Beijing and Washington point out that China has taken some measurable steps on North Korea. After the North’s accelerating nuclear tests and intercontinental ballistic missile launches, China approved tougher sanctions at the United Nations.

It has agreed to sever banking ties, end joint-venture companies with North Korea and limit the export of diesel fuel. China shut down North Korea’s coal imports earlier this year.

As Beijing has agreed to harsher penalties against North Korea, the cutting off of crude oil has become one of its last remaining, and most devastating, economic weapons. Some experts doubt that China would go that far because of its potentially destabilizing effect on Pyongyang.

“I don’t see China being complicit in regime change, which is what totally cutting off North Korea’s energy will seriously risk,” said Bilahari Kausikan, an ambassador at large for Singapore.

“How can it, when in his 19th Party Congress speech, Xi stressed insistently China’s Leninist state identity?” he said. “And to do so, moreover, by being complicit with China’s main competitor, the United States.”

For China, North Korea remains a valuable buffer against the possibility of a united Korean Peninsula that would probably be capitalist, democratic and allied with the United States, said Evans J. R. Revere, a former State Department official who dealt with Northeast Asia.

“China’s newly invigorated Communist Party and its ambitious leader, Xi Jinping, see nothing positive in any of these outcomes,” he said.

Mr. Trump’s military threats against North Korea have caught Beijing’s attention, Mr. Revere said. But he added, “It is not clear that Beijing takes these threats any more seriously than does Pyongyang, which seems convinced that the United States is bluffing.”

On Wednesday, Mr. Xi sought to make up for his differences with Mr. Trump by showering him with hospitality. He welcomed him to the Forbidden City, where the leaders and their wives sipped tea, listened to Chinese opera and toured the Ming and Qing-era treasures in a shrine to China’s imperial past, which the hosts had cleared of tourists for their guests.

It was the third pomp-filled Asian stop, after Japan and South Korea, where the leaders competed to woo and flatter Mr. Trump with golf games, honor guards and fulsome references to his election victory and campaign promise to “Make America Great Again.”

There is a fundamental difference between those countries and China in terms of their relationship with the United States, said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former China adviser to Mr. Obama. “They need us in an existential way; the Chinese don’t need us in an existential way.”","Trump, in China, Seeks Help Over a Nuclear North Korea",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/world/asia/trump-china-xi-jinping-north-korea.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“The laws we have right now on the books say a person like this should not have gotten a gun,” Mr. Ryan said.
Gun-control advocates said Mr. Kelley should not have had that kind of firepower in the first place.
Mr. Pomeroy told the sheriff that Mr. Kelley had attended the church in the past, the sheriff said on Tuesday.
“You’re gonna die!” Mr. Kelley yelled out, followed by an expletive, Mr. Ramírez said.","But Mr. Kelley had clearly been troubled for years. His public school records released on Tuesday showed he had been suspended at least seven times, and a classmate said he had complained about medication he was taking.

Months after his escape from the psychiatric hospital, Mr. Kelley pleaded guilty in a military court to repeated assaults on his first wife and her son, a toddler, including one that left the boy with a fractured skull. He was sentenced to a year in confinement.

That conviction should have barred him from buying firearms, but instead, he was able to buy several, passing a background check each time. Federal law prohibits gun purchases by people who have been convicted of domestic violence, but the Air Force admitted on Monday that it had failed to report Mr. Kelley’s case to the federal databases used for such background checks. The Air Force said it was investigating whether other convictions had also been left unreported.

There were other signs of trouble for Mr. Kelley, who received a “bad conduct” discharge from the Air Force after finishing his sentence. In 2013, he was investigated by the Comal County Sheriff’s Office on a complaint of rape and sexual assault in New Braunfels, Tex., his hometown, but no charges were filed. A statement from the sheriff’s office said on Tuesday that the investigation had “stalled sometime in October 2013 for reasons yet to be determined.”

Mr. Kelley then moved to a recreational vehicle park in Colorado Springs, where four witnesses told the police that they had seen Mr. Kelley chase down his white-and-brown Siberian husky and punch the dog four or five times, yelling at it, before dragging it into his camper, according to a report from the sheriff’s office in El Paso County, Colo. Mr. Kelley was charged with animal cruelty, pleaded guilty and received a deferred sentence, records show.

Brent Moody, a neighbor who called the police, said in an interview that he and his wife moved out sooner than they would have liked because they were scared of Mr. Kelley. “In his eyes, he looked like there was intense anger,” Mr. Moody said. “Something didn’t seem right with him.”

Last Sunday morning, Mr. Kelley took a Ruger AR-556 assault rifle to the First Baptist Church and opened fire, killing 26 people and wounding at least 20 others. After a shootout outside the church with a bystander, in which he was hit twice, Mr. Kelley raced away in his car, chased by the bystander and another man, and soon crashed. He was found dead, having shot himself in the head.

Officials have said that the massacre may have stemmed from acrimony between Mr. Kelley and the family of his estranged second wife. His mother-in-law, who attended the church, was not there on Sunday, but his wife’s grandmother was among those killed.

But as they try to delve deeper into what might have motivated the rampage, investigators said, they have hit a roadblock: They have not been able to unlock the killer’s cellphone, reviving an issue that received national attention after another mass shooting two years ago.

“Unfortunately, at this point in time, we are unable to get into that phone,” Christopher H. Combs, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.’s San Antonio office, said. He refused to name the brand of the phone, saying that it would encourage other criminals to get the same kind.

After 14 people were shot to death in a conference room in San Bernardino, Calif., the F.B.I. was unable to unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the attackers. The bureau went to court to try to force Apple to build a software “back door” allowing law enforcement agencies to get into phones, but the company refused.

Before the issue could come to a head, the F.B.I. hired hackers who were able to unlock the phone.

On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, the debate over the Texas shooting fell predictably along party lines, with Democrats calling for more gun safety legislation and Republicans resisting. But there was one notable exception: The No. 2 Republican in the Senate, John Cornyn of Texas, said he had begun work on a measure that would improve reporting to the background check system used for gun purchases.

“Obviously if things like this can happen in spite of the law then we need to look at that and try to fix it the best we can,” Mr. Cornyn told reporters, adding, “This is one of those areas of consensus on a very contentious topic.”

But on the other side of the Capitol, House Speaker Paul Ryan said no new legislation was needed. “The laws we have right now on the books say a person like this should not have gotten a gun,” Mr. Ryan said. “So this speaks to making sure that we actually enforce our laws that we have on the books.”

Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, were scheduled to visit Sutherland Springs on Wednesday. President Trump, on his Asian trip Tuesday, said that stricter gun laws would not have prevented the shooting. In fact, he said, they could have driven the death toll into the hundreds, since the gunman had been shot by an armed bystander.

Gun-control advocates said Mr. Kelley should not have had that kind of firepower in the first place. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, said that she had been monitoring mass shootings since the 1966 massacre at the University of Texas — and that she had never felt more dispirited.

“Never did I believe there would be children killed, babies killed, 6-year-olds killed,” Ms. Feinstein said.

While no one who knew Mr. Kelley said they believed was capable of such an atrocity, his troubles were not hidden.

Public school administrators in New Braunfels suspended him at least seven times. Mr. Kelley’s disciplinary record showed a variety of offenses, including insubordination, profanity, dishonesty and drugs.

His high school health records said that he had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and had a vision disorder. His academic record was lackluster, with a grade-point average of 2.32. He finished 260th in his class of 393.

Reid Mosis, a classmate from the sixth through ninth grades, said Mr. Kelley often griped about his parents and how they were insistent that he undergo drug treatments, apparently for emotional issues.

“He complained a lot about his parents and the medications he was taking,” he recalled. “He said that his parents were trying to fix him. But he didn’t say what for, specifically.”

Mr. Mosis noted that Mr. Kelley “got irritated easily and always seemed angry.”

Even the pastor of First Baptist, Frank Pomeroy, sensed trouble, according to Sheriff Joe Tackitt of Wilson County, which includes Sutherland Springs.

Mr. Pomeroy told the sheriff that Mr. Kelley had attended the church in the past, the sheriff said on Tuesday. Mr. Pomeroy “didn’t like the guy,” the sheriff said, but did not feel he could turn Mr. Kelley away.

Mr. Pomeroy was not at church on Sunday, but his 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle, was among those killed. The dead included at least a dozen children, the youngest 18 months old.

Joaquín Ramírez, a parishioner who was standing near Annabelle, recalled how Mr. Kelley, dressed in all black and wearing a skull-face mask, had methodically fired as he walked among the pews.

“You’re gonna die!” Mr. Kelley yelled out, followed by an expletive, Mr. Ramírez said. Mr. Ramírez, whose girlfriend was shot and survived, was still shivering on Tuesday as he recalled the horror, and how Mr. Kelley, it seemed, “aimed specifically at the little children.”",Texas Gunman Once Escaped From Mental Health Facility,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/us/texas-shooting-church.html

“I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay.
In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.
The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat.
“The humidity of Key West made a lot of things a little ripe, but the photos are beautiful,” Scott DeWolfe said.","It seems fitting that during Walker Evans’s one-month stay in Havana in 1933 he would befriend Ernest Hemingway. The two shared an appreciation of a spare style that would influence countless others in photography and literature. In fact, Evans entrusted Hemingway with a trove of original prints to ensure they would not be confiscated by the authorities who were violently suppressing popular outrage against the dictator Gerardo Machado.

Now, 46 of those vintage prints are being sold by DeWolfe and Wood Rare Books of Alfred, Me., and Michael Brown Rare Books of Philadelphia, and are featured in a catalog whose comprehensive introductory essay was written by Mr. Brown. The collection is owned by Benjamin Bruce, known as Dink. His father, Telly Otto Bruce, known as Toby, was Hemingway’s friend and factotum and had safeguarded the images for decades in Key West, Fla., where Hemingway had lived.

Evans had gone to Cuba to make pictures for “The Crime of Cuba,” a book by Carleton Beals that was a fierce critique of American adventurism. “The Beals book is an expose of our misgovernment in Cuba, and the disgraceful part we have played in her tragic history past and present, economic, social, political,” read the review in Kirkus. “Sins of omission perhaps even more than sins of commission. The story of Cuba is the story of tyranny-Spain, the United States, Wall Street, and now, closely linked with the immediate past, the dictatorship of Machado, which makes Mussolini look like a Sunday School picnic.”

Evans got a taste of that supercharged political climate in his earliest days there, according to Mr. Brown’s essay, where a bus ride could turn into a journey of intrigue as who-knows-who was tailing him as he tried to meet with opposition figures. At the same time, the city thrilled him.

“When you are still bewildered,” Evans wrote in his diary, “you notice more things, as in a drunk. I was drunk with a new city for days.”

That feeling became literal when he met Hemingway, likely through an introduction by one of Beals’s newspaper contacts on the island. “I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay. “Drinking every night. He was at loose ends … and he needed a drinking companion, and I filled that role for two weeks.”

Photo

But as the essay also noted, Hemingway’s prose style may have had an influence on Evans, whose vision had been influenced earlier by a stay in Paris, where he came to appreciate the work of Eugène Atget. The images — out of a total of 400 taken during his one-month sojourn, betray that influence in photos of facades and streets. Some of them show more isolated, intimate scenes in public, from a haggard looking country family to beggars. In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.

The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat. Once there, the images ended up in storage either behind, or next to, Sloppy Joe’s, the famous Key West saloon.

“The humidity of Key West made a lot of things a little ripe, but the photos are beautiful,” Scott DeWolfe said. “What is fascinating is I think Evans was printing these where he was able to. Unlike later prints, most of these are uncropped, and slightly different. One print has Evans’s thumbprint. It’s as close to a first generation print you could possibly find.”

Does it mean that Democrats can wrest one chamber of Congress from Republican control in 2018? Impossible to say. Politically speaking, there are eons between now and then, and the Virginia governor’s race had facets all its own. But there are reasons for Republicans to be very afraid.

One is that Northam outperformed Clinton without being a particularly energetic, forceful candidate. Through Tuesday morning and afternoon, I heard from pessimistic Democrats who were already ruing the fact that he’d been the party’s nominee. Couldn’t they have found someone with more fire? Someone smoother? In the race’s final days, he flip-flopped on sanctuary cities and made other blunders that cast him as unsteady and uncertain. Didn’t matter. He prevailed, handily.

Republicans should also worry that they’ve oversold themselves on the moderate-progressive divide in the Democratic Party and how severely Democrats would be hobbled by it. In the days leading up to Tuesday, a book by Donna Brazile, the former head of the Democratic National Committee, reignited the enmity between Clinton’s backers and supporters of Bernie Sanders, and that became one of several reasons to wonder if progressives would fail to turn out for Northam, a milquetoast moderate. In the end, enough of them did, not just to guarantee his victory but to jeopardize Virginia Republicans’ 66-to-34 majority in the state’s House of Delegates. On Wednesday morning, unofficial returns showed that Democrats would pick up at least 14 seats, and they could, after recounts, even wind up with control of the House.

“If the Virginia results showed anything, it’s that ideological purity isn’t necessary to win in the Age of Trump,” Lis Smith, a Democratic operative who worked for McAuliffe, told me Tuesday night. “Northam came out as a two-time George W. Bush voter, and he failed some key liberal litmus tests. Still he won.”

In rooting for a Gillespie victory, the G.O.P. was looking for something larger: an assurance that a Republican in a swing state or swing district could find the right recipe for energizing Trump supporters without alienating Trump skeptics. Gillespie’s answer was to keep Trump at arm’s length physically but not spiritually. So while he never — not once — had Trump stump for him in Virginia, he parroted the president’s tough talk about criminals and immigrants and denounced professional football players who didn’t stand for the national anthem.

Trump didn’t cry foul during the campaign, but he did on Twitter on Tuesday night, griping that Gillespie “worked hard but did not embrace me” and showing again that he’s all too content to spar publicly with lawmakers and candidates in his own party. Republicans should be afraid for that reason as well.

Beyond the returns, this was a governor’s race that made the skin crawl, which is to say that it was a sufficiently accurate mirror and microcosm of American political culture in the Age of Trump. Partisan groups and panicked candidates trafficked in overblown fears, appealed to the worst in voters and debased themselves in pursuit of their prize — reasoning, I suppose, that dignity could be recovered on the far side of brutal victory. I’m not sure that’s ever wholly true.

And I’m not drawing any equivalence. Northam didn’t sell out his principles nearly as thoroughly as Gillespie did, and Democrats didn’t sink to Republicans’ level. In fact one of the most audacious tricks that Republicans sought to pull off was ginning up as much outrage over a loathsome Latino Victory Fund ad that ran on television just a handful of times — it showed a truck with a Confederate flag hunting down children of color — as there was over viciously negative commercials of Gillespie’s that blanketed the airwaves. These attacks essentially branded Northam, a mild-mannered pediatrician who served in the Army, as some unhinged leftie eager to give guns to pedophiles.

Gillespie’s campaign “has not been just a dog whistle to the intolerant, racially resentful parts of the Republican base; it’s been a mating call,” wrote The Washington Post in a blistering — and wholly warranted — editorial that noted what many other observers were also fascinated by: how radically Trump’s ascendance and omnipresence changed the way Gillespie comported himself, a transformation with dark implications for the G.O.P. and scary ones for America.

Before this race, Gillespie was as establishment as an establishment Republican could be, aligned closely with George W. Bush, who has made his distaste for Trump’s floridly divisive politics clear. He typified a coolheaded, practical approach to politics. He was more tradesman than ideologue.

Until the last few months. The impression he left on voters was an ugly one, and he and the G.O.P. have nothing to show for it. That should scare Republicans most of all.

Two veteran House Republicans announced on Tuesday that they would not seek re-election next year, the latest conservative lawmakers to commit to leaving office under President Trump.

The representatives, Frank A. LoBiondo of New Jersey and Ted Poe of Texas, made their announcements within hours of each other and added their names to a growing list of Republicans bowing out before the midterm elections. The rush of retirements has led some, particularly eager Democrats, to believe that the House of Representatives could look very different in 2019.

Mr. LoBiondo, 71, who first took office in 1995, did not mention Mr. Trump in his announcement though he delivered a searing indictment on a decline in political civility, action and collegiality during his time in Congress. He bemoaned a constant polarization that discouraged opposing sides to engage in honest debates about legislation.

“As some of my closest colleagues have also come to realize, those of us who came to Congress to change Washington for the better through good governance are now the outliers,” Mr. LoBiondo, who represents South Jersey, said in his retirement statement. He added, “A vocal and obstinate minority within both parties has hijacked good legislation in pursuit of no legislation.”

After 12 terms in office, Mr. LoBiondo said he decided to leave now in part because of term limits on his service on the Intelligence Committee and as chairman of the Transportation Committee’s subcommittee on aviation. But Democrats have also targeted the seat held by Mr. LoBiondo, a moderate who has opposed major Republican legislation like a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, as a possible priority in trying to take back the majority in the House.

“There’s a reason traditional car companies have an established decentralized business model,” Mr. Thibault said.
Mr. Musk said on the webcast that the company was looking to hire new employees with skills better suited to its production goals.
Workers have said that Tesla’s production systems can cause injuries linked to repetitive stress.","The company attributed its slow pace so far to difficulties in producing battery packs at its Nevada plant, called the Gigafactory. It also said that welding processes and final assembly tasks in the Fremont factory were moving more slowly than other parts of the manufacturing system.

“We are adding robots at the choke points and making the lines go really fast,” Mr. Musk told analysts during a webcast on Wednesday. “Speed is the ultimate weapon.”

Getting to market with the Model 3, which will carry a base price of about $35,000, has been a humbling experience so far. Tesla built just 260 Model 3 sedans in its most recent quarter — considerably short of its target of 1,500.

And the sluggish pace has coincided with a rash of job cuts and allegations of lax safety standards on the assembly line from its workers.

While Wall Street analysts and media coverage have focused on the shortfall in Model 3 production, Mr. Musk concentrated Wednesday on the fact that Tesla expected to deliver record numbers of its higher-priced Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles in the last three months of the year.

But the company also reported wider losses than expected for the quarter that ended Sept. 30. Revenue from auto sales increased 8 percent to $2.08 billion, compared with the same period a year ago, but the company lost $619.4 million, versus posting a profit of $21.9 million in the third quarter of 2016.

Tesla shares were off nearly 5 percent in extended trading after the earnings report and the production update, falling below $306, more than 20 percent lower than their midyear peak.

And even as the company is making plans for a factory in China and possibly more plants in the United States, some analysts are questioning Tesla’s overall competence in the intricate processes of mass vehicle production.

One analyst, Clement Thibault of Investing.com, said Wednesday that Tesla’s vertically integrated manufacturing system — which includes building many of its own major components, like batteries and seats — is out of step with tried-and-true industry practices.

“There’s a reason traditional car companies have an established decentralized business model,” Mr. Thibault said. “Tesla believes it can centralize the process, but lacks any real world evidence to back up its claim.”

Since it began production in late summer, Tesla has sold the new Model 3 only to its employees, rather than begin filling the hundreds of thousands of orders from buyers who have put down $1,000 deposits.

While Mr. Musk has said the employee-only sales strategy was meant to reward Tesla’s work force, analysts have surmised that it was also a way to discover and correct quality problems before the vehicle is made available to the public.

The bottom line, however, is that Tesla has yet to prove that it can meet the huge demand it has created for the new Model 3, and that it is capable of joining the big leagues of auto manufacturing.

Further delays will most likely benefit competitors such as General Motors and Nissan, which offer electric vehicles in the Model 3’s price range. And new electrified models are in the works from automakers like Volkswagen, Daimler and Toyota.

“At this point in the game, all eyes are on the Model 3,” said Akshay Anand, an analyst with the auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book. “Tesla needs to ensure its production volume is achieved. But perhaps more importantly, Tesla needs to ensure the vehicle is being produced in a quality manner.”

Tesla is experiencing a number of labor-related issues as it works to increase its annual production output to 500,000 vehicles a year from about 100,000.

Last month, the company fired hundreds of workers for what it described as subpar performance. Mr. Musk said on the webcast that the company was looking to hire new employees with skills better suited to its production goals.

But some workers have said that they were dismissed because they supported a union organizing drive conducted with the help of the powerful United Automobile Workers, which represents hourly employees at the three big Detroit automakers.

One worker, Daniel Grant, said he had supported the union effort because of unsafe conditions in the Tesla factory — and he believed he had been fired for it.

“Management pushed us hard, and it created very real risks for us working on the line,” Mr. Grant said in an email. “That’s why I wore a union T-shirt, and that’s why I handed out fliers.”

The U.A.W. has joined workers to file complaints against Tesla with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the company of harassing and dismissing employees for their organizing activities.

“I don’t believe I was fired for performance,” said Mr. Grant, who said he had been injured on the job and fired a few days later.

Workers have said that Tesla’s production systems can cause injuries linked to repetitive stress. Other employees say that they were not properly trained to handle some hazardous chemicals, and have experienced burns, rashes and eye injuries.

Tesla has said that the dismissals were based only on performance reviews and that it would never act against employees based on their union views. It will not discuss individual cases.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

“The struggle is always to address the function of the space while not sacrificing beauty,” said Donna Mondi, an interior designer in Chicago. “Assuming the home office is connected to the main living space, it needs to flow aesthetically and complement the overall design scheme.”

Ms. Mondi, for example, made space in a client’s living room for an office nook by placing a stylish writing desk with metallic legs and a black faux-crocodile top in a corner near the window. “This particular spot had lots of natural light, calm and peaceful colors,” she said. “And rich textures made this the perfect place to escape to.”

When your home office is “in a more formal part of the home,” she added, “the furnishings need to reflect that level of formality, so everything blends in seamlessly.”

MAKE FURNITURE DO DOUBLE-DUTY Look at the furniture you already have and consider whether you could use it for storage in your home office, suggested Ms. Kanarek, the author and work-from-home blogger. She uses an antique dresser in a spare bedroom to store her printer and office supplies, she said, and a coffee table with shelves below or storage inside could be used to store files or supplies while you work on the sofa.

“One of my clients uses her dining room as a home office during the day and stores all of her equipment and supplies in a large sideboard,” she said. “When she entertains, no one knows that along one wall is a fully functioning home office.”

DON’T SIT WITH YOUR BACK TO THE DOOR “You want your desk to feel like it has a commanding view of the room,” said Anita Rosenberg, a space consultant and practitioner of feng shui in Los Angeles. “People do the built-ins because they don’t have the space, and then they are staring up against the wall. That’s not a great place to be for 12 hours a day.”

What you want to aim for is the “command position,” which enables you to see the front door without being in direct line with it, said Judith Wendell, a Manhattan-based feng shui consultant, and confers a feeling of empowerment. If the only option is to have your back to the front door, she added, place a mirror on the wall in front of you so you can see the front door in the mirror.

KEEP YOUR OFFICE OUT OF THE BEDROOM “Obviously, you don’t want to take your work to bed with you,” Ms. Wendell said. “Perhaps less obvious is that we don’t want our work to have sleepy or lazy chi.”

Another reason for separating the two, Ms. Rosenburg said: “You don’t want to go to sleep thinking about the work you have to do or be stressed out by the electronics in your bedroom.”

PUT IT IN THE CLOSET If the only space available is in your bedroom, a bureau with doors that hide your computer, books, papers and printer at night is a good workaround. “Many times we can steal a small closet and create an office nook that’s perfectly appointed,” said Ms. Mondi, the interior designer. “Built-in cabinets will make the most efficient use of space and are the best way to incorporate as much function as possible.”

Just keep in mind that you’ll need extra lighting and power for computers, printers, and chargers. And “for an unexpected touch add wall covering” to the inside of the cabinet or bureau, she said, “to give your office its own personality and make it feel less like a closet.”

Photo

HIDE IT BEHIND CABINETRY If you don’t have a spare closet, you can still conceal your workspace. “With some of our new home projects, we’re incorporating hidden offices into the kitchen,” Ms. Mondi said. “They are concealed by cabinet fronts, so it disappears into the kitchen when not in use.”

Another design trick, she said, is to add paneling and create a hidden wall of storage that essentially disappears: “It’s a great way to camouflage necessary evils.”

ACCESSORIZE Ms. Mondi also uses art, light fixtures and other decorative elements to ensure that any home office she designs isn’t “all business,” she said.

“The best office spaces tell a story of the person” they belong to, she added. “Be creative when choosing colors, materials, lighting, accessories, and you can easily turn it into your favorite room in the house.”

UPGRADE YOUR DESK “I’m a big fan of the writing desk, rather than the clunky, functional desks of the past,” Ms. Mondi said. “If you’re even the least bit tech-savvy, you won’t need much in the way of file storage. A small drawer or two gives you enough space for small accessories. What you gain is a lighter piece of furniture that is typically far more beautiful.”

OR DO AWAY WITH IT ALTOGETHER “The idea that you have to have a desk, file cabinet, bookcase and storage cabinets to work from home no longer applies, especially if your main piece of home-office equipment is a laptop,” Ms. Kanarek said. “I use a closet in a spare bedroom to store supplies and files, but most of the time I work on my porch, on the family room sofa, at a nearby coffee shop or wherever I feel inspired to work that day.

“Probably that he has to deal with you guys on a daily basis,” she said.

She needs a vocabulary lesson. The bloat of Trump’s ego is a flaw. The plunge of his necktie: also a flaw. Being answerable to a skeptical news media may be an inconvenience — or, for someone as thin-skinned as he is, an absolute torment — but it’s not a flaw. It also happens to be a vital component of democracy, should she and her boss care to reacquaint themselves with that.

When her boss does something execrable, she validates it at greater length and with more passion than most paid sycophants would muster. She chalked up that tweet of his about Mika Brzezinski (“bleeding badly from a face-lift”) to a laudably bold retaliation against a merciless adversary, and she used it as a springboard to swoon over him anew. “I think the American people elected somebody who’s tough, who’s smart and who’s a fighter,” she said. “And that’s Donald Trump.”

She zealously parrots his contention that there’s no evidence of anything untoward between his campaign and Russia, dismissing his hapless namesake’s infamous meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian emissary as “pretty standard campaign operating procedure.”

She edits out the revelation that George Papadopoulos — once named by Trump himself as an important adviser to the campaign — was trying to coordinate with Moscow. When that news broke on Monday, she said that it had “nothing to do with the president.”

So began an audacious week when she came into her mendacious own. She asserted that Trump had not politicized the deaths of eight people in Lower Manhattan because the immigration complaints that he almost instantly raised were ones that he had bellowed about before. So he was — what — grandfathered in? Well, then, so are gun-control advocates who react to yet another mass shooting by repeating their observation that this nation is drowning in firearms.

Jim Acosta of CNN asked her why, at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump called the American justice system “a joke” and “a laughingstock.”

“That’s not what he said,” she shot back — it’s like a reflex with her — and later added, “He said the process has people calling us a joke and calling us a laughingstock.” Wow. Huge difference. Small problem: Acosta’s description of Trump’s remarks came closer to his verbatim words than her tortured, wishful version did.

She’s awful at this, but that makes her an excellent fit for an administration in which mediocrity, inadequate experience and nepotism run rampant.

Besides, she’s serving a function other than communication, which turns out not to be her forte. (To listen to her pronounce “priorities” is akin to hearing the air seep out of a flat tire, and she leaves half of the consonants on the curb.)

She’s a bogus message to Middle America that Trump’s White House is really a homespun, family-values kind of place. Hence her repeated references to being a working mom and managing a boisterous brood at home. Hence her invocation of religion — she’s the daughter of a rather well-known pastor — when asked during one briefing how she’d explain Trump’s worst behavior to her own children.

“When it comes to role models, as a person of faith, I think we all have one perfect role model,” she answered, characteristically using a non sequitur as an evasion. “I point to God. I point to my faith. And that’s where I would tell my kids to look.”

Your character in “Mother!” was meant to be Eve. Did you think of her that way?

[Darren Aronofsky] was very careful not to make those references to us. I was just a woman who was still, after all these years, madly in love with my husband, and who is having a lot of family difficulties. A very real, very human place. And every now and then I would give Jen a really weird look [laughs loudly], just because.

Do you have to like your characters?

I have to find a way to like them. The character I found the most difficult was [the murderous mother in] “White Oleander.” She was evil. I couldn’t find anything to relate to. I remember counting the days that I didn’t have to be in [her] skin.

Ruth [Madoff] is very heroic in her own way. She’s a survivor. I understood completely her love for her family and devotion to those children, to her husband. That was really the crux of that character. We weren’t able to tell her story because it’s the Bernie Madoff story, but I actually encouraged her one day to tell it. But I understand why she wouldn’t want to.

Photo

Are there physical qualities about characters that you find difficult?

Absolutely, I never wanted to see that cat suit again. [After the 2007 fantasy film] “Stardust,” it’s like, never prosthetics to my face. My face was completely encapsulated; it was just so claustrophobic. It was maybe the most uncomfortable I’ve ever been.

Would you have done a Catwoman movie?

Are you kidding me? In a heartbeat. I loved that part. I felt like I was just getting comfortable and getting used to the claws and the mask, just figuring out how to move in all of that. There was a little bit of talk about that, then that kind of faded away.

Does it feel natural to get back to acting after time off, or do you have to warm up those muscles?

I had been off maybe five years, and I did “I Could Never Be Your Woman” with Paul Rudd, and I really felt rusty. I was surprised because I never felt like that. So I haven’t actually taken that much time off since then. I’m enjoying [acting] now more than I ever have, actually. Maybe because I don’t watch dailies anymore. I’m not really eager to look at my films. I’ll look at them once and not usually ever again. It’s better for me because I’m very critical and scrutinizing.

Photo

Some actors believe they should withhold a little bit on screen, so that the audience wants more of them.

Maybe I should try that. I don’t feel like I withhold, but I may not know that because I’m a little withholding as a person, so my gauge might be a bit off. I feel like I’m exuding all kinds of things. My husband has such an active inner world, the writer in him, that I think a lot of times he feels like he’s communicating to me when it’s just in his head. It makes me nuts. [Laughs]

You’ve said that you’re happiest when you’re working, so how did you find balance when you weren’t?

I tinker. I’m an oil painter — usually figure and portrait. I like to build things. I get out my tools, my hammer and my electric drill. When the kids were young I built them a playhouse. I redid the front of one of my fireplaces. I got this idea, I went into Home Depot or something, like, ‘Hey, I want to redo my fireplace, can you guys tell me how to do that?’ They looked at me like, what?

When you took a pause from acting, was it also because the roles were thin?

It seemed like it was harder and harder to say yes, and the roles didn’t warrant leaving my family. I didn’t want to disrupt their routine over and over again, so I started being very picky about when I worked, where, how long I was away, so it limited my choices. It may be that I just also didn’t want to work on a subliminal level. After five years I started to really yearn for the work and even my kids were saying, ‘Mom, aren’t you going to go back to work?’ Which kind of hurt my feelings.

Around the time we started looking at colleges, I realized how it was going to hit me really hard [to have an empty nest] and that I better get something going. I really need to feel like I’m creating something and that my life has meaning. I’m not just going to start playing bridge.

Early on, you said you had the guts to act because you weren’t afraid to fail. Do you still feel that way? Some people think failure is a building block.

It is for sure. And I’m always afraid of failing. Every new part I do I’m afraid I’m going to fail. I’m afraid I’m disappointing my director and you should have gotten someone else. I said to Steve Kloves [the writer-director of “The Fabulous Baker Boys”] when I started “Murder,” I said, “I’m ruining the film.” He laughed.

Why did you think that?

It’s challenging doing a period piece like that. The character is much more extroverted than I am, and so you have to really push yourself outside your comfort zone. It just takes jumping into the deep end, but it’s hard to trust that in the beginning. And so I was at that stage and I’m acting in front of Judi Dench, and I’m thinking O.K., you cannot bomb in front of Judi Dench. This just can’t happen.

[She’s] salty but salt-of-the-earth. She exudes this warmth; she’s lovely. When I met her, I just cried.

In front of her?

Yeah, tears coming down my face. Wah. I was just completely star-struck and moved by meeting her.

Did they have to cajole you to sing?

They didn’t, but they didn’t give me a lot of time to prepare. I got an email from Ken, and he was like, ‘I have this wacky idea, how would you like to sing this song?’ I haven’t sung since “Hairspray,” my vocal cords are rusted shut. I said, ‘I’ll give it a try, but you better have a backup.’ I don’t really consider myself a singer. I consider myself an actor who can sing just good enough in movies. If I really trained, I could be much better.

Do you feel an artist should reflect society or push ideas forward — or both? Do you feel any responsibility to do that?

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

I do. It’s because of owning that responsibility that I’ve actually passed on a number of projects that were very hard to turn down. I certainly don’t want to be putting out any more toxicity. I wouldn’t want to do anything, for instance, that was misogynistic.

When I did Elvira for “Scarface,” that was a very misogynistic relationship and that character obviously was pathetic. She was just an armpiece for her man.

The oppressively hot afternoons in the Delta and the cool, quiet country nights of the rural woodlands inspired many of the greatest American storytellers, including William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty and Shelby Foote, and the blues musicians Robert Johnson and Son House.

This year, to honor the bicentennial of Mississippi’s statehood, residents throughout the state are following that tradition, telling the stories of their own communities with photographs employing the 21st-century technology of smartphones. The project, “Celebrating Storytellers,” was created by Chandler Griffin and Alison Fast, partners in Blue Magnolia Films and Barefoot Workshops, and will culminate next month with an exhibit of 200 five-foot-wide images in storefront windows in Jackson, Miss. Similar exhibits have already been held in five other cities.

“We didn’t want to just have big parties for the bicentennial with nothing that’s lasting afterwards,” Mr. Griffin said. “We really wanted to engage with communities. We wanted to go from town to town, and create spaces where people could have conversation about their community and what revitalization means.”

He and Ms. Fast went to a dozen towns and cities in Mississippi asking community leaders to help identify people who understood the fabric of their communities and invited them to a free, weeklong workshop and to begin documenting where they live with iPhones. The stories were chosen by the participants, who received guidance from the workshop team that included Aaron Phillips, a photographer who started out as a student at the Barefoot Workshops, and Natalie Irby, the executive producer.

There will be 100 participants in all ranging in age from 14 to 91.

In Mound Bayou, a small economically-depressed Delta city that was founded by former slaves in 1887, Myrna Smith-Thompson documented the rundown home of Isaiah Montgomery, a former slave of Jefferson Davis, who helped found the community. Ms. Smith-Thompson, who was born and raised in Mound Bayou, leads the Knights of Tabor, a benevolent community organization that is restoring local historic sites. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather led the organization before her.

“It’s not just a house,” she wrote for the project. “It’s the home of a man who in 1887 had a dream of turning a swampy piece of land filled with wild animals and mosquitoes and unimaginable obstacles into a negro self-governing community in Mississippi, for the people. He had the audacity to ask newly freed slaves to clear this land and make a nice place to live with all the amenities afforded to others. He had the nerve to attempt to influence free slaves to become self sufficient to create a safe haven for blacks amidst a climate of fear and hostility.”

At the start of the project last year, the emphasis was on Mississippi’s revitalization, not “race and reconciliation,” Mr. Griffin said. But the subject came up in every single workshop they held. In Clarksdale, an group of high school students from the mostly-black public school and an almost all-white private school made race the focus of their projects. Before meeting at the workshop they had rarely mixed, but they got together afterward for dinners and attended each other’s graduations. These experiences, Mr. Griffin said, “lead to change in communities.”

Mr. Griffin is a fifth-generation Mississippian, and attended Jackson Prep, a private institution that was started as a segregated school in 1970 in response to the federally mandated integration of the public schools. When he graduated in year 1994 he felt like he “had blinders on and was not exposed to anything.”

He attended art school in Savannah, Ga. and taught photography at the Maine Workshop in Rockport, M.E. before moving to New York City to “make his mark.” He rarely told anyone he was from Mississippi.

After a while, he realized that he didn’t really know Mississippi outside of where he grew up, so he returned to start Barefoot Workshops in Clarksdale and to learn more about his home.

“I fell in love with Mississippi in 2005 when I ran that first workshop, and ever since then I’ve just been trying to figure out ways to help tell the story and talk about the awesome things in Mississippi, as well as the problems, and look at the people working on solutions.”

Looking back at the experience, Ms. Smith-Thompson said the project taught her “to see things differently and how to tell stories with pictures” and made her “feel like a younger person.” For Christmas, she is buying a new iPhone to continue documenting her community.

“Storytelling helps us to share our different perspectives of our community with someone else, in a non-threatening way,” she explained. “The harsher the situation, the more impactful storytelling may be.”

“It’s physical de-escalation on an oppositional line,” Ms. Thurman explained with typical hyperarticulacy.","Plays, however, were Ms. Thurman’s first taste of acting. As a sophomore at her Massachusetts boarding school, she played the female lead in “The Crucible.” More than 30 years later, there was swagger in her throaty voice when she said, “It was an achievement for a sophomore to get the role that usually a senior gets.”

Some agents she’d met while modeling the summer before came to see the play. Their interest helped persuade her parents, Robert Thurman, a professor of Buddhist Studies at Columbia University, and Nena von Schlebrügge, a former fashion model who now helps to run Menla, a retreat in the Catskill Mountains, to let her transfer to Manhattan’s Professional Children’s School. By 17, she had booked her first four film roles, including a clamshell-born Venus in “The Adventures of Baron Munchausen” and the convent girl Cécile in “Dangerous Liaisons.”

“It wasn’t very difficult to cast her,” said Stephen Frears, the director of “Dangerous Liaisons,” speaking by telephone. “She was so striking, so beautiful and so fresh.”

She was also, as Mr. Frears said, “very formidable.” That’s a hallmark of her career and also maybe a clue to why that career has been so eclectic. Ms. Thurman isn’t a delicate actress or a melting one or the kind who comes right to the front of a movie screen and invites you in. There’s a remove in a lot of her best work (“Henry & June,” “Kill Bill”), a sense that she has emotions and ideas that are hers alone.

She has refused to be typecast as a siren or a femme fatale and has struggled to find roles that attract her. It isn’t that she won’t play wives and girlfriends — she will, she has. But these are women as likely to steal a scene as to yield to it.

Quentin Tarantino, who directed her as a gangster’s wife in “Pulp Fiction” and wrote the “Kill Bill” movies for her, compared Ms. Thurman to golden-age luminaries like Greta Garbo and Bette Davis. “There’s this year’s blonde and there’s last year’s blonde. Interchangeable. But to me, Uma has a quality that could rank with a Marlene Dietrich,” he said in a phone interview. He also called her, with affection, “a big, tall willow.”

Will Ms. Thurman’s old-Hollywood style play on Broadway? Her 1999 outing, as the film star Jennifer in Martin Crimp’s version of Molière’s “The Misanthrope,” didn’t dazzle critics. “She brings to mind a beautiful, sheltered girl at her first grown-up dance, putting on airs and hoping against hope she’ll get away with it,” Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times.

Did the tone of the responses surprise her? “I don’t expect anyone to pat me on the back,” she said. That script, a series of rhymed couplets barnacled with topical quips, “was so impenetrably difficult,” she said. “It was madness.”

Photo

Since then, the closest Ms. Thurman has come to a stage role was a guest-star arc on the first season of the NBC show “Smash,” in which she played Rebecca, a movie star trying to conquer Broadway, felled at an out-of-town tryout by a tainted smoothie.

Nothing so dramatic has affected “The Parisian Woman,” but Ms. Thurman and Mr. Willimon have both found themselves in the news for reasons unrelated to the play. As rehearsals began, accusations against Mr. Weinstein broke wide. As to whether she had personally been subject to abuse, Ms. Thurman gave the clipped response, “I’ll discuss it when I want to discuss it.” (In an “Access Hollywood” interview, which has since gone viral, she offered a similar answer, though in more obviously indignant tones.)

In late October, the allegations against Mr. Spacey also surfaced and production on “House of Cards,” was halted. (Mr. Willimon left the series in 2016.)

Though “The Parisian Woman” traffics in questions of sex and power, any discussion of these real-world events “never made its way into the rehearsal room,” Ms. MacKinnon said firmly.

Inside that room, a few days before the actors were to move into the theater for technical rehearsals, Ms. Thurman clacked onto the temporary set in teal heels, prop phone in her hand, gemstone glint in her eye. With mischief and languor, she subdued her lover (Marton Csokas) and teased her husband (Josh Lucas). (Mischief extended to her downtime, too. When this reporter slunk into the room, Ms. Thurman called brightly, “Write some fake news for us today!”)

The blocking for the scene wasn’t set yet; the pacing juddered. But when Ms. Thurman lobbed a line like, “I can’t control who falls in love with me,” it landed.

Ms. MacKinnon occasionally stopped the action to offer a suggestion. Sometimes the suggestions were Ms. Thurman’s. Maybe she could speak an early line more lightly. Maybe she should cross the stage later. She asked Ms. MacKinnon if she could sit during an argument with Mr. Csokas’s character, the better to soothe him. “It’s physical de-escalation on an oppositional line,” Ms. Thurman explained with typical hyperarticulacy.

She and others compared Prince Mohammed’s campaign to anti-corruption drives by President Xi Jinping in China or President Vladimir V. Putin in Russia, where prosecutions are often politically motivated.

As many as 500 people have now been detained on allegations of corruption as part of the crackdown. Many are being held at Riyadh Ritz-Carlton in what may be the world’s most luxurious prison.

The Saudi Council of Ministers said Tuesday that all arrests were “based on specific evidence of criminality and acts that were intended criminal transgressions and resulted in unlawful gain.”

“The rights of the accused and the facts relating to the offenses are protected by law at all stages during the investigation and judicial process,” the council added.

But the government had not disclosed any specific charges or evidence, or even the names of those arrested. The first wave began just hours after a royal decree created an investigating committee under Prince Mohammed, leaving little time for inquiry. The courts are under the effective control of the king and crown prince. And it was unclear which branch of the court system might hear the cases — the main Shariah court system or the more specialized board of grievance courts that handle administrative complaints.

“This is a Pandora’s box to start having anti-corruption trials,” said David Ottaway, a Middle East fellow at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan research center. “Where does it stop within the royal family? Are there any princes that can show clean hands?”

“The law is not meant to govern the ruling family in any meaningful way, or to govern the relations between the ruling family and the state,” said Nathan J. Brown, a scholar at George Washington University who studies Arab legal systems.

“Ultimately, the king and some high members of the royal family can do what they want and make it legal later,” he said, and the lack of regulation over royal self-dealing “opens the door wide to what would be considered corruption in other systems.”

Many Saudis appear to have applauded the crackdown. Two-thirds are under 30, many are frustrated by high unemployment, and some may take a certain satisfaction at even an arbitrary comeuppance for so many of the rich and powerful.

“It’s going to be popular with the commoners who see important parts of the al-Saud family as a rent-seeking, unaccountable caste,” Steffen Hertog, an associate professor at the London School of Economics and the author of a book on the Saudi bureaucracy. “Saudi businesses have been complaining about royal encroachment for decades.”

Some cases may be clear-cut.

One area that the official Saudi media say Prince Mohammed intends to investigate is flooding in the city of Jidda that killed more than 100 people in 2009. In that case, a Saudi businessman was accused of absconding with millions of dollars allocated for a Jidda sewage system and never installing any pipes.

“We all knew, and we never reported on it,” Jamal Khashoggi, then the editor of a major Saudi newspaper and now living in exile, wrote this week in The Washington Post.

Beyond that case, only a few anonymously sourced reports of the potential charges have emerged. A professionally coordinated social media campaign, which appears to be organized by the government, has accused the most important prisoner, Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, the former chief of the national guard and a son of the previous king, of enriching himself at public expense by diverting funds from the national guard. Citing unnamed sources, news reports have suggested that he would be accused of hiring ghost employees and paying inflated contracts to companies he owned for equipment like walkie-talkies and bulletproof military gear.

His brother, Prince Turki bin Abdullah, the former governor of Riyadh, will reportedly be accused of paying inflated contracts to companies he owned for a subway under construction in the capital.

But in a country named for its ruling family, the line between public and private money can be hard to discern.

Prince Mohammed’s corruption committee “can basically detain anyone for anything they choose to call corruption,” said Robert Jordan, the former United States ambassador to Saudi Arabia. “That’s part of how this web was spun.”

The most famous detainee, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, had no apparent need for graft. He was well known as an investor in international stock markets and as one of the world’s richest people; the sources of his wealth were more transparent than most princes.

Prince Alwaleed had been a critic of the kingdom’s closed economy and pervasive corruption. A secret 1996 diplomatic memorandum said that Prince Alwaleed told the American ambassador how a handful of senior princes controlled billions of dollars in off-budget programs, revenue roughly equal to one million barrels of the country’s oil per day. According to the memo, the Two Holy Mosques project and the Ministry of Defense’s strategic storage project, were “highly secretive, subject to no ministry of finance oversight or controls.”

The memo, disclosed in the trove of State Department documents released by WikiLeaks seven years ago, provided a detailed blueprint of the varied ways that money flows to members of the royal family either from state coffers or through private business in an otherwise opaque system.

An embassy official received an unprecedented glimpse into royal finances when he visited the Ministry of Finance Office of Decisions and Rules in 1996, where servants came to pick up stipends for their royal masters. Sons of the founding king received as much as $270,000 a month, while a great-great-grandchild collected $8,000 a month. On top of those payments, bonuses of $1 million to $3 million were handed out to, say, construct a palace.

Princes were known for borrowing money and simply never paying it back, which nearly led to the collapse of the National Commercial Bank. Royals were also known to act as the exclusive agents for foreign companies in the kingdom. When they founded their own businesses, they often relied on either government spending or state subsidies.

“The government, specifically the Ministries of Finance and Municipal and Rural Affairs, often transfers public land to princes, who in turn sell it at huge profit to real estate developers,” another diplomat wrote in a 2007 memorandum, noting that Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the longtime ambassador to the United States, and Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahd, the favorite son of King Fahd, profited to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars by selling land for a centrally planned megacity north of Jidda.

Perhaps the most famous statement on corruption in Saudi Arabia was made by Prince Bandar. In an interview with PBS in 2001, he said: “If you tell me that building this whole country, and spending $350 billion out of $400 billion, that we had misused or got corrupted with $50 billion, I’ll tell you, yes. But I’ll take that anytime.”

Weapons contracts have long been a source of wealth. British media reported that Prince Bandar received well over $1 billion in secret payments from BAE Systems, the leading British military contractor, over the course of a decade. The son of founding King Abdulaziz’s personal doctor, Adnan Khashoggi, became a billionaire as an arms dealer and go-between for weapons makers and members of the royal family.

Contrary to how South Korean conservatives and some Americans frame it, the protection, while something to be thankful for, has not been free.

Housewives haven’t been the only South Korean women to toil for the pleasure of American soldiers in the ensuing decades. As detailed by Katharine Moon in her authoritative study “Sex Among Allies: Military Prostitution in U.S.-Korea Relations,” the South Korean military dictatorship coerced women into sex work for American soldiers.

Then there is the Status of Forces Agreement, signed between the two nations in 1966 and renewed twice. It has been understood to grant the United States military nearly exclusive jurisdiction over its personnel, such that even high-profile offenses committed by American soldiers against South Korean citizens go unpunished.

One of the most heinous examples happened in 2002 when an American military vehicle ran over two middle-school students, crushing them to death. The perpetrators were shielded from South Korean authorities and a United States military court dismissed the case.

More recently, the United States military has refused to take responsibility for its environmental degradation of its base in central Seoul.

Being an ally has also meant deploying soldiers for America’s wars — to Vietnam, where some 5,000 South Koreans died and many suffered from exposure to the United States-made chemical weapon known as Agent Orange; and to Iraq in the 2000s, despite enormous local protests. Government officials from that time have explained that the Iraq deployment came in response to the Bush administration’s threat to reduce the number of Americans stationed in South Korea.

But the biggest cost of the alliance has been the erosion of South Korea’s sovereign spirit. There is enormous support among South Koreans for the United States military presence, and it isn’t simply a reflection of national goodwill toward America. It speaks volumes about just how much South Korea has become psychologically dependent on a foreign army as a potential barrier against North Korea, despite an annual national defense budget amounting to about 2.7 percent of its G.D.P. and a nearly 650,000-strong military.

Washington knows full well that stationing its soldiers on South Korean soil isn’t an act of charity. America offers protection, but only in return for influence over its lesser allies’ affairs.

Still, many South Korean conservatives consider any critique of the alliance blasphemous, even as Seoul finds itself being called a freeloader by President Trump. He has also demanded that South Korea pay for the American-made missile-defense system deployed here, which has had the effect of provoking Chinese outrage and economic retaliation against South Korea. (In a gesture at damage control, a senior White House official later took back the freeloader statement, admitting South Korea is a “model ally” that spends sufficiently on its own defense, and the administration had to reiterate that Seoul wasn’t being asked to pay for the missile shield, at least for now.)

South Korea has pulled out all the stops to prepare for Mr. Trump’s state visit on Tuesday. Domestic news outlets have been fixated on every detail, fretting over whether his single-night stay means he isn’t invested in South Korea. (He is spending two nights in both Tokyo and Beijing.)

That obsessiveness itself is tragic. Consider Mr. Trump’s repeated threats to incite war here, and the majority of the American public’s indifference to Korean lives — a poll from September found 58 percent of Americans support military action against Pyongyang if peaceful means cannot put a stop to its weapons program, even as a congressional report recently concluded that a military conflict on the Korean Peninsula could leave up to 300,000 people dead in the early days of fighting.

In the age of Trump, South Korea should look to an example set by another longtime American ally. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany didn’t hesitate to say in May that Europe can no longer “completely depend” on the United States. “We Europeans have to take our destiny into our own hands,” she said.

Other problems that the company has grappled with include overestimating demand for its Spectacles camera-equipped sunglasses, a once-hot product whose sales cooled rapidly.

During a call with analysts on Tuesday, Evan Spiegel, Snap’s co-founder and chief executive, said that the company was focused on issues like simplifying the ad-purchase process on its platform and making its core app easier to use, a longstanding complaint. He also promoted the company’s efforts to grow its content and augmented reality offerings.

“I guess we’re just not afraid to make changes in the long-term interest of the business,” Mr. Spiegel said on the call. “So I would expect us to continue learning as we grow the business and making changes that we think are in the best interest of growing the user base, growing revenue and, ultimately, providing our customers with a great product experience.”

That he spoke openly about his priorities marked a change for the Mr. Spiegel, who is normally tight-lipped about his strategy. Such an approach has frustrated investors who have sought a better sense of where the company was headed.

But now, Snap has the support of Tencent. The Chinese company has had a history of taking stakes in chat apps, such as Snap, in order to learn more about how they work and how they perform from a business perspective. It has long held a stake, for example, in South Korea’s Kakao.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Snap said that Tencent and its affiliates had “recently acquired” 145.8 million nonvoting shares through purchases in the open market.

That represents nearly 17 percent of Snap’s class A shares, which hold no voting power, and about 12 percent of its total shares.

“We have long been inspired by the creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of Tencent, and we are grateful to continue our longstanding and productive relationship that began over four years ago,” Snap said in the regulatory filing. “For its part, Martin Lau, Tencent’s president, informed us that Tencent is excited to deepen its shareholding relationship with us, and that it looks forward to sharing ideas and experiences.”

A spokesman for Tencent said at a company conference in Chengdu, China, that it viewed the Snap stake as a strategic investment.

“We saw Snap as an innovative company with a huge user base that is mostly focused on Western, developed markets,” he said.

Snap described Tencent as a long-term shareholder, but it did not disclose the Chinese company’s total holdings. It said it had no obligation to disclose changes in Tencent’s holdings of nonvoting shares because of Snap’s ownership structure.

Tencent had the option to raise its stake in Snap in a fund-raising round before the company’s initial public offering earlier this year, but declined.

So far, stock market investors do not appear heartened by Tencent’s move. Shares in Snap were down nearly 12 percent in premarket trading on Wednesday, at $13.26 — well below the company’s initial offering price of $17 a share.",Tencent of China Raises Its Stake in Struggling Snap,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/business/dealbook/snap-snapchat-tencent.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“Probably that he has to deal with you guys on a daily basis,” she said.

She needs a vocabulary lesson. The bloat of Trump’s ego is a flaw. The plunge of his necktie: also a flaw. Being answerable to a skeptical news media may be an inconvenience — or, for someone as thin-skinned as he is, an absolute torment — but it’s not a flaw. It also happens to be a vital component of democracy, should she and her boss care to reacquaint themselves with that.

When her boss does something execrable, she validates it at greater length and with more passion than most paid sycophants would muster. She chalked up that tweet of his about Mika Brzezinski (“bleeding badly from a face-lift”) to a laudably bold retaliation against a merciless adversary, and she used it as a springboard to swoon over him anew. “I think the American people elected somebody who’s tough, who’s smart and who’s a fighter,” she said. “And that’s Donald Trump.”

She zealously parrots his contention that there’s no evidence of anything untoward between his campaign and Russia, dismissing his hapless namesake’s infamous meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian emissary as “pretty standard campaign operating procedure.”

She edits out the revelation that George Papadopoulos — once named by Trump himself as an important adviser to the campaign — was trying to coordinate with Moscow. When that news broke on Monday, she said that it had “nothing to do with the president.”

So began an audacious week when she came into her mendacious own. She asserted that Trump had not politicized the deaths of eight people in Lower Manhattan because the immigration complaints that he almost instantly raised were ones that he had bellowed about before. So he was — what — grandfathered in? Well, then, so are gun-control advocates who react to yet another mass shooting by repeating their observation that this nation is drowning in firearms.

Jim Acosta of CNN asked her why, at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump called the American justice system “a joke” and “a laughingstock.”

“That’s not what he said,” she shot back — it’s like a reflex with her — and later added, “He said the process has people calling us a joke and calling us a laughingstock.” Wow. Huge difference. Small problem: Acosta’s description of Trump’s remarks came closer to his verbatim words than her tortured, wishful version did.

She’s awful at this, but that makes her an excellent fit for an administration in which mediocrity, inadequate experience and nepotism run rampant.

Besides, she’s serving a function other than communication, which turns out not to be her forte. (To listen to her pronounce “priorities” is akin to hearing the air seep out of a flat tire, and she leaves half of the consonants on the curb.)

She’s a bogus message to Middle America that Trump’s White House is really a homespun, family-values kind of place. Hence her repeated references to being a working mom and managing a boisterous brood at home. Hence her invocation of religion — she’s the daughter of a rather well-known pastor — when asked during one briefing how she’d explain Trump’s worst behavior to her own children.

“When it comes to role models, as a person of faith, I think we all have one perfect role model,” she answered, characteristically using a non sequitur as an evasion. “I point to God. I point to my faith. And that’s where I would tell my kids to look.”

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off.","The Parisian sun casting a warm glow on a balcony overlooking narrow streets, laundry drying overhead. The bustle of a market. Sprawling Provençal vineyards.

Julia Child’s time in France inspired her to capture the country through its cuisine, introducing French cooking to kitchens around the world. But it was that same French magic — and Ms. Child herself — that inspired her husband, Paul, to also capture the country, albeit through a different medium, photography. A new book lets him offer a personal glimpse into the world beyond the kitchen.

“There is this combination of intimacy and formal, rigorous design,” said Alex Prud’homme, the couple’s grandnephew and a co-author of “France Is a Feast: The Photographic Journey of Paul and Julia Child.”

The Childs met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, leading them to various postings around Europe. But it was Paris, where they arrived in 1948, that captured their hearts.

“Apart from our official lives — cooking and government — the other things we do fall into fairly repetitive categories whose two main divisions are, being entertained and entertaining others,” Mr. Child wrote to his twin brother, Charlie. “Sometimes when we’re being entertained it isn’t people, but just Paris herself who acts as hostess.”

Photo

While Ms. Child took French cooking classes, and eventually began work on “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck, Mr. Child was engaged in diplomatic duties as a cultural attaché for the United States government. And he was rarely without a camera.

The photographs, taken between 1948 and 1954, focus on the beauty of postwar France. The perfectly-landscaped parks, the bustling waterfront in Marseille, the glow of Place de la Concorde at night, a cold fog settling over the Sacré-Coeur basilica. The shadow play on the grand entryways and the underpasses along the Seine.

But Mr. Child’s main subject was always his wife. Ms. Child in the kitchen; changing her clothes on the side of the road; legs propped up in a telephone booth; sunbathing in Cassis.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

The detail and expansive catalog of Mr. Child’s work raise the question: Did he have a sense that their lives would have a bigger impact than their immediate Parisian universe?

“He was an obsessive photographer and note taker, it’s almost like he knew back then that their lives were worth preserving for posterity,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “It’s like they were leaving breadcrumbs.”

Mr. Prud’homme helped Ms. Child write her memoir, “My Life in France” (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006), but he felt it wasn’t complete. That’s when Katie Pratt, a longtime family friend of the Childs and the book’s co-author, discovered a “Pandora’s box” of hundreds of black and white and color photographs, everything from surrealistic street documentary to formal portraits and landscapes.

Negatives were clearly labeled. Log books and letters provided a time frame, and were often accompanied by long letters detailing their routine: embassy comings and goings during the Cold War, their meals, the price of wine or the performance they saw the evening before. Everything was for the taking.

Mr. Child had a “distinct style,” Ms. Pratt said.

“His style as a visual artist, whether it was photography or other mediums, it was very important for him to have strong, well-organized, well-balanced compositions, often with perspective and depth,” she said. “There’s often a story going on.”

Mr. Child’s style was heavily influenced by artists living in France at the time. And as a cultural attaché, he quickly gravitated to the top artists of the day: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Edward Steichen were all friends of his. They even shared the same printer, using Pictorial Service owned by Pierre Gassmann in Paris.

“My interpretation was that Paul was a very independent-minded guy who really developed his own aesthetic, but he was swimming in the waters of these masters of 20th-century photography,” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off. But he always remained behind the camera.

“Paul and Julia, in their own ways, were really good teachers,” Ms. Pratt said. “They really cared about not only perfecting their craft and communicating it clearly with others. They put it to operational proof and shared it with others.”

“That’s something they learned while in the O.S.S.,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “Don’t trust common wisdom, find out for yourself whether something works or doesn’t. That’s something they both did in their art, and cooking.”

The data — which Tiffany Rivera, a geologist at Westminster College in Utah who was not involved in the study, calls “exquisite” — have surprising implications.

And yet, scientists estimate that when the supereruption occurred, the magma was at 785 degrees Celsius. To explain the discrepancy, the team suspects that heat infiltrated the system so quickly that the argon didn’t have time to escape. This heat is likely what awoke the cool supervolcano, pushing it toward eruption in less than a few hundred years — perhaps within decades.

That’s a far cry from the lethargic time scales that often define the field of geology. And yet, recent research at the Yellowstone supervolcano in Wyoming and the Taupo supervolcano in New Zealand has also suggested that the events leading up to supereruptions can occur on human time scales.

The findings suggest that the supervolcano had to wake up from an extremely cold state, raising questions about how a solid ocean of magma could melt and mobilize so rapidly.

“The physics of how this all works is still being worked on and debated,” Dr. Andersen says. But many think that an injection of fresh magma further below the volcano likely did the trick.

And given that Long Valley’s magma sits a mere five kilometers below the surface, such an event wouldn’t have gone unnoticed, Dr. Gualda says. Waters circulating in the crust would have started to heat up, generating new hydrothermal features like geysers, hot springs and mud pots as the landscape started to boil over. The ground, too, would have swelled upward as the supervolcano’s magma reservoir grew.

Should other supervolcanoes play by the same rules as Long Valley, the results could help scientists read the signals of unrest preceding future supereruptions or even smaller eruptions.",The Cool Beginnings of a Volcano’s Supereruption,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/science/the-cool-beginnings-of-a-volcanos-supereruption.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

I had chased Halladay for two years, through his agency and his former teams, with no luck.
Halladay was a little bigger than I remembered, as many players are when their training stops.
“If I threw 120 pitches in a game, I would throw a 20-pitch bullpen,” Halladay explained.
After our tour, he asked for a framed Halladay photo collage from a store on Main Street.","He left behind a wife and two sons. He coached youth teams and seemed to be enjoying a blissful retirement — “in the air or on the water” as he wrote on his Twitter page, where he posted this right under his handle: “Courage is not being fearless but rather acting in spite of the existence of fear!”

That playoff debut, the one he had wondered so much about, will stand as Halladay’s signature performance. He threw a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds, the first in the postseason since Don Larsen’s perfect game in the 1956 World Series. And that was as good as it got.

In Halladay’s final playoff game, the next fall, he lost by 1-0 to the St. Louis Cardinals and Chris Carpenter, an old teammate who had taught Halladay his curveball while playing catch in the minors. Somebody had to win that day, and it was his friend, not him. Halladay had given his best, and lost. It happens, and he was rational enough to understand that.

I was in the Phillies’ clubhouse after that loss, when Halladay expressed a version of the comment above. It has struck me ever since as the essence of the competitor: All you really want is a chance to test yourself, to see how it all turns out with everything at stake.

Halladay had gotten his opportunities. He was proud of how he had handled them.

We spoke this spring as part of my research for a book I am writing on pitching. I had chased Halladay for two years, through his agency and his former teams, with no luck. On my visit to Clearwater, Greg Casterioto, the Phillies’ director of baseball communications, told me Halladay was there, working with prospects on the minor league side. He met me at the picnic tables while the major leaguers played on the main field.

Halladay was a little bigger than I remembered, as many players are when their training stops. He had been a fitness fanatic when he played, and said the work — the way it flowed into the competition — was what he missed most since retiring in 2013, at age 36.

Durability was Halladay’s hallmark. He pitched 63 complete games from 2002 through 2011, 30 more than any other pitcher in that decade. His back gave out, but he said his arm always felt strong. The workload never caught up to him because he measured it precisely.

“If I threw 120 pitches in a game, I would throw a 20-pitch bullpen,” Halladay explained. “If I threw 100 pitches in a game, I would throw a 40-pitch bullpen. If I only threw 80, I’d throw a 60-pitch bullpen. So I was always getting the same amount of pitches in a five-day period.”

We talked a bit about the modern state of pitching. Halladay had eight seasons of at least 220 innings, a total no pitcher reached in 2017. He said today’s pitchers, with their turbo fastballs, tried too hard to strike hitters out.

“I felt like with two strikes — 0-2, 1-2 — if they didn’t swing at it, it was going to be strike three,” he said. “I wanted something that they had either had to swing at and put in play, or was going to be a strike on 0-2. Now it’s two extra pitches, and we’re getting back to 2-2 and the count goes on. So I think it’s just changed a lot in the way people think about pitching. They want to stay just off the plate to where they’re avoiding contact.”

Halladay induced weak contact — and so many awkward swings — using the Greg Maddux model of moving the ball in or away on either side of the plate. Hitters knew that Halladay could carve an X in the air, down by their hands or out by their handle, with his sinkers and cutters. He could also lock them up with a curve in the zone, or a split-change — a pitch he learned from Rich Dubee, a Phillies coach — in the dirt.

“I wanted them to swing at every pitch,” he said. And with an arsenal like that, why not?

Halladay’s success was hard-earned. After parts of three seasons in the majors, the Blue Jays sent him to Class A to rebuild his psyche and master a lower arm slot. He appreciated how fleeting success could be, and approached his work with a serious demeanor that evoked Steve Carlton, an earlier Phillies ace.

Carlton was my baseball hero when I was young. My son now roots for the Phillies — his grandparents have tickets — and Halladay was his favorite. When I took him to the Hall of Fame two years ago, he took a picture with the cap Halladay wore for his perfect game in 2010. After our tour, he asked for a framed Halladay photo collage from a store on Main Street.

On Tuesday, my son took inventory of the shrine to Halladay in his bedroom: two framed wall-hangings, two bobbleheads, a pennant and a baseball card. He didn’t cry at the news of the crash; he is 15, too busy for that. He asked if he could go to the Y to practice jump shots. Basketball tryouts are coming up.

I told him I’d have to pick him up in the middle of writing this column, and he said not to bother; he wanted me to write a good story. I insisted he go, because Halladay would have wanted that. He laughed — it’s a trite thing to say, and I barely knew the man. But I meant it.

I learned a lot from Halladay in our interview this spring — how he mastered each of his pitches, how he held them, how he used them to very likely earn a plaque in the Hall. But mostly I learned again that what truly drove him was not the achievement, but earning the opportunity to have it. If he could do that perfectly, he could live with the rest.

Halladay did not live long enough. But his legacy, to me, is powerful and instructive in any field: The purity of the effort matters most.","Mourning Roy Halladay, a Master Who Craved the Big Moments",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/sports/baseball/halladay-death-plane-crash.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Two veteran House Republicans announced on Tuesday that they would not seek re-election next year, the latest conservative lawmakers to commit to leaving office under President Trump.

The representatives, Frank A. LoBiondo of New Jersey and Ted Poe of Texas, made their announcements within hours of each other and added their names to a growing list of Republicans bowing out before the midterm elections. The rush of retirements has led some, particularly eager Democrats, to believe that the House of Representatives could look very different in 2019.

Mr. LoBiondo, 71, who first took office in 1995, did not mention Mr. Trump in his announcement though he delivered a searing indictment on a decline in political civility, action and collegiality during his time in Congress. He bemoaned a constant polarization that discouraged opposing sides to engage in honest debates about legislation.

“As some of my closest colleagues have also come to realize, those of us who came to Congress to change Washington for the better through good governance are now the outliers,” Mr. LoBiondo, who represents South Jersey, said in his retirement statement. He added, “A vocal and obstinate minority within both parties has hijacked good legislation in pursuit of no legislation.”

FRIDAY PUZZLE — This is a perfect puzzle for a Friday. It’s a puzzle by Kameron Austin Collins and Brendan Emmett Quigley and, if I can make a recommendation, it is best done curled up on the couch with a fine beverage, and the knowledge that the weekend is at hand. Maybe there’s some music playing in the background, and some good chocolate nearby. All I know is that I smiled all the way through this puzzle, and I hope you did, too.

The reason I smiled is because this was the most satisfying tug-of-war I’ve been a part of in a long time. I didn’t know all the answers. Well, my brain did, mostly, but the answers weren’t always at the surface. I had to dig for some of them, and work the grid for others.

I loved SPARE ME, TOE NAIL, NUT MEAT, BANK VAULT, BEAT A DEAD HORSE, GOOGLE HANGOUTS, PLUS ONE and UGLY CRY. Meaty, lively entries (I was actually surprised that there were only two debuts today), and a mostly clean grid. Sneaky clues that are just out of reach, but which fall upon second look. Maybe a third look. But that’s the Friday for me.

Tricky Clues

16A: They’re not wrong. If you think of your digits — your fingers and toes — exactly half of them will have a TOE NAIL, hopefully.

22A: The trick to a clue like “You, overseas” is to know that it is asking you for the word “You” in a foreign language (hence the clue word “overseas”). Got that? Good. Now your job is to figure out which language. There are a lot to choose from. TOI, for example, means “you” in French, but that’s not the answer. Now, if you know about the lean and hungry CASSIUS, who went on to be one of the recipients of Julius Caesar’s famous “Et tu”’s, you can fill that in, and that gives you the S. The only language I know that has a word meaning “you” that begins with an S is German, and the word is SIE. UPDATE: I have since been informed by an alert commenter that the Turkish words for “you” are SIZ and SEN, so I sit corrected. SIE was the only word I knew at the time, but I’m always learning.

25A: I had forgotten about “ ABIE the Agent ,” but I was able to make an educated guess by filling in the crossings for the last two letter. “ABIE the Agent” was an early 20th century cartoon created by Harry Hershfield.

36A: Welcome to The New York Times Crossword, GOOGLE HANGOUTS.

57A: ETON CAP was new to me, and it returns to The New York Times Crossword after a nap of 58 years .

1D: SAND DAB was the last entry to go in for me. I need to brush up on my Pacific flatfish.

4D: “DVD attachment?” doesn’t necessarily mean something attached to the DVD, but to the word. ROM is attached to “DVD” by a hyphen.

2D: Clever wordplay! You can see a lot of things in your bathroom shower, but that’s not where we’re going with this clue. Today, ""Things seen in a shower” refers to METEORS.

41D: This is a great debut, and must have been intensely difficult to clue accurately without grossing people out. An UGLY CRY is when you really fall apart and “sob intensely,” but body fluids are sometimes involved, as well as facial contortions.

42D: One of my favorite clues. “Willful?” typically means something different, but today it refers to having a will, or being TESTATE.

Constructor Notes

Brendan Emmett Quigley : Whatever Kameron says, I totally stand by it. Unless it’s blatantly false, then I’ll probably stand by it. Kameron Austin Collins : We started working on this puzzle this year. I don’t know how other collaborators work out the division of grid labor, but our grid is pretty straightforward and nicely segmented. I handled the bottom half, he handled the top. If I’m not mistaken, GOOGLE HANGOUTS was our seed. I’m proud of us for sneaking in a rich mix of things, from UGLY CRY and BEAT A DEAD HORSE to NUT MEAT, SAND DAB, ROB REINER, GO GREEN. Modern and fun — a nice overlap of our styles, I think!

Definitely an overlap I’d like to see again, Mr. Collins.

You can read the title of the USA drama “Damnation” a couple of ways — damn nation, damned nation — that both work. It’s hard to figure out what this odd, bordering on bizarre historical something or other is trying to do, but it’s firmly focused on the sick soul of America.

“Damnation,” whose first season begins Tuesday, appears to be very loosely based on some obscure chapters of American history: the Farmers’ Holiday Association, a 1930s agricultural protest movement, and the Black Legion, a Ku Klux Klan splinter group active in the Midwest at the same time.

Those associations are intriguing, as is the notion of a major television drama set in the unlikely surroundings of Depression-era rural Iowa. Real life is incidental, though, in a show that’s a not very coherent fever dream. Tony Tost, whose previous TV experience was on the crime-western “Longmire,” combines a Bernie-bro fantasy of economic populism with a violent frontier melodrama owing a heavy debt to “Deadwood,” and wraps the whole thing in a Cain-and-Abel religious allegory. (Four episodes were available for review.)

SUNDAY PUZZLE — Do you like movie trivia? Ross Trudeau returns to test our mettle.

Today’s Theme

Four famous lines from well-known movies are offered in the grid, clued with just the titles: Your job is to match them to the actors who said them. Those entries are also part of the theme: CRUISE LINE (59A), for example, is the answer to the SHOW ME THE MONEY (42A) line from “Jerry Maguire.” It’s also a real phrase in its own right, and is clued as “Carnival, say, or a further hint to 42-Across.”

Tricky Clues

Constructor Notes

A couple thoughts: 1. ""Going Off Script” includes four white actors. Moreover, the SHOW ME THE MONEY line was also spoken by Cuba Gooding Jr., a black actor who goes uncredited in this puzzle (despite upstaging Tom Cruise). 2. “Going Off Script” also comprises four male actors. The original version did include WOODLINE/I FEEL PRETTY OH SO PRETTY, which got axed because it yielded asymmetric themers. But then again, Natalie Wood, an American with Russian parents, was cast to play Maria, a Puerto Rican. Dios. Aside from Ms. Wood, I only found revealers that referenced white males (PENNLINE, CRYSTALLINE, SHORTLINE), let alone ones that matched with legitimately iconic movie quotes. So, open question: If Hollywood’s gender/race representation problem means that, after an honest effort, you only can find white male actors for your ___LINE puzzle, do you scrap it? Is doing otherwise cynical and opportunistic? Is the choice mitigated if you subsequently construct an UZI GAL GODOT puzzle? (Very interested in collaborating on that puzzle. Let’s chat.)

Last winter, a Detroit woman seeking financial stability walked into a local job-readiness center, supported by a national community development nonprofit called LISC. She enrolled in an eight-week job-preparedness program that taught her the skills needed to land an apprenticeship in the building trades. Seven months, four certifications and a union card later, the woman, Tiffany, is working full-time — with benefits — as a millwright apprentice, installing and repairing factory machinery. She finds the work fulfilling and is up for a raise in a few months.

The need to help people like Tiffany, who did not want her last name used, will grow only more acute: Job dislocation and wage pressure caused by rapid technological development and globalization are likely to persist for a long time. These forces can contribute powerfully to productivity and growth, but they have worsened problems in our economy, from stagnant wages to the lack of opportunities for those with less education.

Too many people lack access to entry-level jobs with good wages, especially in industries like manufacturing, where activity is actually near a high. The reason is that technology has enabled this work to be done by far fewer employees — or it’s not being done at all, because workers don’t have the specialized skills certain jobs demand.

That’s where a robust federal jobs program could help. Millions of Americans could work in high-need areas rebuilding and repairing crumbling roads and bridges or taking care of the elderly. The jobs should pay a living wage (even during the training phase), come with good benefits and be widely available, including to the formerly incarcerated. The program could include both public jobs and subsidized private employment, either temporary or longer-term. The jobs would provide credentials and hard and soft skills through on-the-job training, which could then facilitate a transition into unsubsidized private-sector employment. We should also invest in more vocational training and apprenticeships, like the one Tiffany landed.

Though public jobs programs are associated with Democrats, Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Trump administration’s Council of Economic Advisers, recently backed the idea, creating the possibility of bipartisan support.

Public employment should be viewed not as a social program but as a public investment with a high rate of return. The return is increased economic output, coupled with the development of human capital — which increases productivity and the size of the effective labor force — in a population and economy that badly need it. That human capital, in turn, could catalyze more business investment and activity in low-income neighborhoods, which would further promote economic growth.","Why the U.S. Needs a Federal Jobs Program, Not Payouts",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/opinion/federal-jobs-program-payouts.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

WASHINGTON — A congressional committee investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election released a transcript late Monday of a seven-hour interview lawmakers conducted last week behind closed doors with Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign.

Some details from the interview were previously known, including the fact that Mr. Page traveled to Russia in summer 2016, when he was part of the campaign.

But the interview revealed new information about who in the campaign knew about the trip, what Mr. Page reported to the campaign and other trips he took last year.

Below are excerpts and key takeaways from the transcript.

It was widely known in the Trump campaign that Mr. Page was going to visit Russia in July 2016.

Mr. Page testified that he told at least four members of the campaign about his trip. Among the officials were the president’s first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski; Jeff Sessions, who served as a senior campaign official at the time and is now the attorney general; Hope Hicks, a campaign spokeswoman who now serves as the White House communications director; and J. D. Gordon, a foreign policy adviser.

MR. PAGE: I had just mentioned that — I forget the exact specifics, but I had mentioned to them, it was Corey Lewandowski and I believe Hope Hicks and J. D., just that I had received this invitation, you know, just wanted to let you know. And I forget the exact terminology. MR. PAGE: So Corey said, if you have interest, you know, if it’s — I forget the exact terms, but, you know, if you have — I’ll add that to the record. But essentially he said, we can — if you’re not going to — you know, it has nothing — REPRESENTATIVE TREY GOWDY, REPUBLICAN OF SOUTH CAROLINA: I don’t know. That’s why I’m asking. MR. PAGE: No, not — not — if — you know, if you’d like to go on your own, not affiliated with the campaign, you know, that’s fine.

Mr. Page contradicted his previous public statements that he never met with Russian government officials during his trip.

REPRESENTATIVE ADAM B. SCHIFF, DEMOCRAT OF CALIFORNIA: So, Dr. Page, two days ago, you told the public on television you had no meetings with anyone except essentially the man on the street, correct? MR. PAGE: Yes. MR. SCHIFF: Two minutes ago, you said you had no private meeting with Arkadiy. Is that correct? MR. PAGE: Yes. MR. SCHIFF: And now you say you did have a private conversation with him on the subject of U.S.-Russia relations.

After meeting with government officials in Russia, Mr. Page reported to the campaign about his contacts.

MR. SCHIFF: Following your meeting, your trip to Russia, did you send a memo back to the campaign that conveyed the results of your trip to Russia? MR. PAGE: I did offer some thoughts about some of my takeaways and experiences there, yes. MR. SCHIFF: And in that document, Dr. Page, didn’t you state, on Thursday and Friday, July 7 and 8, 2016: “Campaign Adviser Carter Page” — you’re referring to yourself in the third person — “presented before gatherings at the New Economic School, N.E.S., in Moscow, including their 2006 commencement ceremony. Russian Deputy Prime Minister and N.E.S. board member Arkadiy Dvorkovich also spoke before the event. In a private conversation, Dvorkovich expressed strong support for Mr. Trump and a desire to work together toward devising better solutions in response to the vast range of current international problems”? This is a document Bates stamped Dr. Page, did you write that? MR. PAGE: I did. It was a general sentiment of, you know, hope for the future. That’s all he expressed in that brief hello.

Mr. Page had difficulty recalling why he went to Budapest for the meetings and whom he met with.

Along with traveling to Russia last summer, Mr. Page went to Budapest, where he met with Hungarian government officials, including the Hungarian ambassador to the United States at the time, whom he had met that July at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.

MR. SCHIFF: And was the purpose of your trip to Budapest in the late summer to visit with the ambassador? MR. PAGE: It was — I’ve actually been working on a renewable energy project. Or it’s one of the projects we’ve been looking at. And so there’s an energy entrepreneur — there’s geothermal springs and developments going on in Hungary, and they’ve been pitching that for quite some time to me. And so, when she mentioned she might be there that time and, you know, it’d be interesting to — just offered to meet up and maybe meet with a few people, I figured that might be a good opportunity to do something which I had been hoping to do for some time. MR. SCHIFF: So this conversation you had with the Hungarian ambassador at the Republican convention, you discussed a potential energy-related project with her? MR. PAGE: I can’t remember if I — we were talking more just foreign policy things.

Mr. Page raised the possibility with campaign officials of Mr. Trump traveling to Russia to take Mr. Page’s place at the graduation where Mr. Page was scheduled to deliver a speech.

“I got another idea,” Mr. Page said in an email to Mr. Gordon and Walid Phares, also a campaign adviser. “If he’d like to take my place and raise the temperature a little bit, of course I’d be more than happy to yield this honor to him.”

Mr. Page told lawmakers that for Mr. Trump, the trip would be similar to the one that Barack Obama made to Germany during the 2008 presidential campaign. Around the time that Mr. Page proposed the idea, George Papadopoulos, another foreign policy aide, was also pushing for Mr. Trump to travel to Russia to meet President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Page told lawmakers that he did not know that Mr. Papadopoulos was pushing a similar idea.",Major Takeaways From Carter Page’s Congressional Interview on Russian Election Meddling,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/us/politics/trump-adviser-carter-page-transcript-meeting-2016-campaign-russia.html

Ms. Whelan said that Real ID enforcement has been implemented in phases over the last two years in some states. If you show up to a federal facility such as a military base, for example, and you live in a state that’s not Real ID complaint, you will need alternative identification to a driver’s license. Currently, 28 states are Real ID compliant, including California, Maine, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. For a complete list, visit dhs.gov/real-id.

But what does the Real ID Act mean for air travelers?

Starting Jan. 22, 2018, the T.S.A. will ask all travelers who don’t have a driver’s license from a compliant state or a state that has been granted an extension to the compliance deadline (this means that residents can continue using their noncompliant license for federal purposes while the state continues working to be in compliance) to provide an alternative form of acceptable identification. Travelers won’t be able to pass through security without this acceptable identification.

And, as of Oct. 1, 2020, all air travelers will be required to have a Real ID-compliant driver’s license or alternate acceptable identification to fly domestically.

What exactly qualifies as acceptable identification?

The D.H.S. has designated more than a dozen forms of acceptable ID including a passport; a border ID card; a trusted traveler card, such as Global Entry; a Real ID compliant driver’s license; and a permanent resident card.

View all New York Times newsletters.

Is one form of acceptable identification better than another?

Ms. Whelan said that the D.H.S. does not advocate any particular form of acceptable identification, but Brenda Sprague, who oversees passport services for the U.S. Department of State, said that, with the implementation of Real ID fast approaching, residents who live in states that aren’t Real ID compliant should apply for a passport before the end of the year.

November and December are the best months to apply for or renew your current passport, Ms. Sprague said, because the turnaround time to get a new passport now is usually around four weeks. In the summer, when passport applications peak, the wait for a new passport could be up to eight weeks.

Around 136 million Americans have passports in circulation, according to State Department — that’s only around 40 percent of the population in the United States.

O.K., you’ve convinced me, and I’m ready to apply for a new passport. What’s the best way?

Ms. Sprague said that there are more than 8,000 passport application locations around the country. Around 60 percent are post offices while the rest are courthouses and libraries. Visit the Department of State’s Where to Apply link for more details. In addition, there are 27 passport agencies, where travelers can apply for rush passports. “These agencies are for people who are traveling within two weeks,” Ms. Sprague said.

This link has a list of these agencies; applicants need an appointment for a visit and can make one online at passportappointment.travel.state.gov.

Also, the State Department is collaborating with Hilton Hotels & Resorts on the Hilton Passport Project, an initiative meant to encourage more Americans to apply for passports. Every few weeks, a Hilton location in the United States will have a Passport Concierge booth, where guests and the general public can have their passport pictures taken for free and apply for or renew a passport. Between one and three employees from the State Department will be on hand to answer passport-related questions and help fill out applications. The next Passport Concierge will be at Hilton Cleveland Downtown from Nov. 9 to 11. For a list of coming locations, visit facebook.com/Hilton.

How much does it cost to get a new passport?

First-time applicants pay $110 plus a $25 application fee. Passport renewals cost $110 and expedited passports are an additional $60.

Assessing the grim toll of the massacre in Sutherland Springs, Tex., sheriff’s deputies found 22 of the bodies inside the First Baptist Church, but by their reasoning, one more victim died there — inside the womb of Crystal Holcombe, who was killed in the pews along with three of her five children.

Texas is one of at least 38 states with a law that recognizes a fetus in utero as a potential crime victim separate from the mother, or where stiffer penalties apply when crimes are committed against pregnant women. Federal law recognizes unborn fetuses as separate victims of federal and military crimes.

The laws, some recent and others decades old, are another battle front in the long, passionate political war over abortion and the question of when life begins. Anti-abortion groups have lobbied for fetal homicide laws as part of a broader campaign for “personhood,” hoping to persuade the public to regard prenatal life at any stage of development as a human being deserving of legal rights and protection.

The federal Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004 took five years to get through Congress. It gained momentum after the killing in California of Laci Peterson, who was eight months pregnant.

Three internationally renowned choreographers provide quite dissimilar answers in the Royal Ballet’s new triple bill at Covent Garden.

Ballet is about sensuous dancing to music (says Twyla Tharp, in “The Illustrated ‘Farewell,’” a world premiere to Haydn’s “Farewell” Symphony, No. 45 in F sharp minor, which incorporates her “As Time Goes By,” first made in 1973 for the Joffrey Ballet). Ballet is about telling an exciting story (says Arthur Pita, in “The Wind,” the world premiere of a staging of Dorothy Scarborough’s 1925 novel — later memorably adapted as a 1928 silent film directed by Victor Sjöström and starring Lilian Gish — here set to a commissioned score by Frank Moon). Ballet is about moody atmosphere, theatrical effects and quasi-military regimentation (says Hofesh Shechter, in “Untouchable,” created for the Royal in 2015 to a score composed by Mr. Shechter and Nell Catchpole).

Each of those three answers has proved perfectly valid in other ballets. These three works, however, are all problematic at best. The evening not only grows worse as it proceeds, it grows more tiresome and foolish.

But it starts with “The Illustrated ‘Farewell,’” which has several sequences — some extended, some fleeting — in which Ms. Tharp reminds the London audience that she is as sophisticated a choreographer as any alive today. Her vocabulary is eclectic and large, her grammar arrestingly idiosyncratic, her skill at group organization often superlative.

Ms. Tharp here turns the first two movements of the “Farewell” Symphony into a long, demanding, complex pas de deux for Sarah Lamb and Steven McRae. This looks entirely Tharpian; the traditional lexicon of ballet is seamlessly extended — with slides on flat feet, boogying moves, through-the-body shimmies and vertiginous plunges.

Voters in Maine approved a ballot measure on Tuesday to allow many more low-income residents to qualify for Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, The Associated Press said. The vote was a rebuke of Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican who has repeatedly vetoed legislation to expand Medicaid.

At least 80,000 additional Maine residents will become eligible for Medicaid as a result of the referendum. Maine will be the 32nd state to expand the program under the health law, but the first where voters, not governors or legislators, decided the issue. Other states whose leaders have resisted expanding the program were closely watching the campaign, particularly Utah and Idaho, where newly formed committees are working to get Medicaid expansion on next year’s ballots.

Supporters, including advocacy groups that collected enough signatures to get the question on the ballot, said the measure would help financially fragile rural hospitals, create jobs and provide care for vulnerable people who have long gone without.

“There are alternative facilities available of a very high quality, with food and all of the facilities,” Mr. Turnbull said on Tuesday.

The Australian Medical Association has called for “independent verification” of the health of the men who remain at the camp.

Mr. Boochani, the Kurdish journalist, said last week that the men were experiencing dehydration, hunger and anxiety. Another detainee said some of the men had fallen ill and were unable to get the necessary medical attention.

Among the men who had already left the camp, many said they felt guilty that they were not able to stand in solidarity with those who had stayed behind.

“I feel guilt whenever I drink or eat,” said Ben Moghimi, a refugee from Iran who had been held on Manus for years, but on Tuesday was receiving medical care in Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea. “I tried to go back to Manus, but they won’t let me. I want to be there with them.”

On Sunday, hundreds of the men holed up in the center signed a letter addressed to the leaders of the United States, Canada and New Zealand, pleading for their help amid the standoff.

The men wrote that they did not have “any other choices except for remaining in here,” and urged t the world leaders “to help us.”

On Sunday, during her first visit to Australia as prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern renewed her country’s offer to take 150 refugees from Manus Island and Nauru, the site of a second Australian detention center. She said New Zealand had an obligation “to make sure that we maintain our obligations to the United Nations to take refugees.”

Mr. Turnbull said Australia would not take up the offer “at this time.”

If you are reading this on a mobile device or tablet, you can listen to the interview here.

All warmed up? Good, let’s see if we can achieve a personal best today.

Today we follow the path the marathoners will run on Sunday, by BOROUGH, and we are starting at the bottom of the grid. For example, the race begins on Staten Island, but that borough is no where to be seen, unless you jump down to 67A’s “Step 1: A passenger ship since 1817” and fill in FERRY. I got that through the crossings, because I wasn’t think about a small FERRY being a ship. However, we’re specifically thinking about the STATEN ISLAND FERRY from that clue, and the borough is implied.

We then lope — sorry, I mean run — into BROOKLYN, with 51A’s “Step 2: An old baseball team,” which is, of course the (BROOKLYN) DODGERS.

17A: Not sure whether the Little Dipper is in URSA MAJOR or URSA MINOR? Fill in URSA M_ _OR, and use the crossings, Luke.

27A: Ha! You thought that was a political clue, didn’t you? “Trump is often involved in these” is a bridge clue today. The answer is BID.

15D: I honestly thought that “Faces With Tears of Joy” was some piece of artwork that I hadn’t learned about, but it turns out that today’s answer is the laugh-til-you-cry EMOJI.

49A: The city of Zagazig is not only in EGYPT, it’s extremely fun to say out loud.

Peter Sagal: In 2016, my friend Greg Pliska asked me to come do the “play-by-play” at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament finals in Stamford, CT. I went and had a great time, including running into some old friends in the puzzle community. That inspired me to start solving the puzzle myself, and I’ve been doing it daily since around that time. In fact, it’s become a daily ritual in the “Wait, Wait ...” offices: we solve the puzzle together after our daily editorial meeting.

So, when Mike Selinker got in touch to ask me if I’d collaborate with him as a “celebrity,” I was thrilled. I had actually begun poking around with practice grids myself, thinking how gratifying it would be to make a puzzle for The Times, and was envious of the other folk who had gotten to work on one for the anniversary project. Mike and I met on a cruise a few years ago, and he helped me create a trivia game for the entertainers.

My first idea for the puzzle was shot down and I was a bit at sea as to what to do. I wanted to do something that related to my career, as many guest constructors had done, but didn’t know how to work the idea of a “quiz show host” into the puzzle. Maybe the clues were riddles with the solution being the answer? That didn’t work. Mike pointed out that I also am known for running marathons (13 so far, and I write a bi-monthly column for Runners World) and maybe that was a theme ... so I suggested in turn a “map” of the New York Marathon, which at that time was a few months off.

Mike responded amazingly. He constructed a grid in which a series of answers suggesting the five boroughs of the race, as a map, with the themed clues indicating their order in the race (Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Bronx, and Manhattan again.) The clues are all phrases that suggest the name of the boroughs without naming them. He also managed to get in the phrase NEW YORK MARATHON and even BOROUGH.

I love the puzzle because it combines two things I enjoy when they happen to appear in the puzzle: first, the unwritten answer (i.e., you have to mentally provide the word BRONX to complete the answer CHEER) and the physical form of the puzzle; that is, it’s relevant where the answers appear in the grid.

As said, the grid was entirely Mike’s work. I contributed to the cluing as best I could, which was both difficult and a delight. As Mike pointed out to me, some words, like AGA, have appeared in the puzzle many times, and its a challenge to come up with new ways of cluing them. Of my clues that made it through the editing process, I’m most happy about 36 Across and 29 Down.

This really was great fun. It makes me want to try to construct one on my own, although it’ll be a huge leap from simply kibbitzing to doing it all myself. At any rate, I hope solving it gives puzzlers the same sense of pleased satisfaction I’ve gotten from doing the puzzle the last year.

One last important note: I couldn’t very well co-author a puzzle about the New York Marathon without running it, so I signed up with Achilles International to be a guide for a blind runner, as I’ve done three times before. I’ll be helping to guide an accomplished para-athlete named Asim Baig, and we’re raising money for Achilles and Mr. Baig.

Mike Selinker: A couple years ago on the JoCo Cruise, I helped Peter Sagal out with the clues for a game show — I know, right? — and so it seemed about time for him to return the favor. Peter was a more-than-willing collaborator, and we fleshed out a lot of ideas that didn’t really go anywhere. Eventually I posed to Peter, who runs a lot of marathons, the obvious question “What about a marathon puzzle?” Peter wanted to run the New York Marathon this week, and so he came up with this insane and stellar idea of drawing a map of the entire marathon route. To which I said, “Uh, yeah, I think I can do that,” and came up with this.

Actually, the first grid also had a 26-letter message — RUN AND RUN TILL THE RACE IS DONE — running from the second R in FERRY to the N and E at the start of NEW YORK MARATHON, with the black squares being the bridges between the boroughs. Which was great except Will went, “Okay, but why?” And he was — stop me if this sounds familiar — completely correct. I ripped that out and made a much better grid with Will and Peter’s guidance.

Once that was done, Peter clued the first pass all by himself, and he’s the best crossword cluer ever. That brain is crammed with so much trivia, he’s probably had to delete the node that tells him how to use a fork. I had no freaking idea about half the stuff he crammed into there. For me though, the best clues of his are the ones that just roll off as effortless comments, like the ones for MOO, IMHO, and ROCK ON. It was a great three-way collaboration with me, Peter, and Will. I hope we get to do it again soon. Now Peter just has to teach me how to be a radio god and we’re even. Meanwhile, I’ll also be doing a marathon of a different kind, playing Dungeons & Dragons all day to benefit children hospitals for [Extra Life].

It begins in the 18th century, with Shakespeare forgers and travel liars; makes its way through the 19th, with P. T. Barnum as a kind of ringmaster/hoaxmaster (among whose incredible acts was Joice Heth, a black woman whom he purported had been George Washington’s nursemaid — which would have made her, in Barnum’s time, 161 years old); and wends through the false memoirs and fake personae of the 20th and 21st. (In Mr. Young’s taxonomy the hoax, unlike a lie, a conspiracy theory or an urban legend, flirts with and delights in the possibility of discovery, at least in its early iterations.)

What the hoax returns to, both underpinning and undermining, Mr. Young found, is race. “I had a hunch that they would often deal with race,” Mr. Young said, but he was struck how often the hoaxes he found came back to the subject.” The hoax lays bare both prejudice (as did Barnum’s exhibiting of a black man as “What Is It?,” the missing link) and pilfering (as in the case of Rachel Dolezal, the former N.A.A.C.P. chapter president who had been living as a black woman until she was outed, in 2015, as white).

Mr. Young’s earlier book, “The Grey Album,” looked at the generative power of storytelling, but “Bunk” takes a bleaker view. The progression of the hoax, as Mr. Young describes it, is one from honor to horror. Early hoaxes validated: a young poet tracing a false genealogy between himself and the greats; Joice Heth providing a direct line between her 19th-century spectators and the father of the country. By the late 20th century, the hoax had turned grim: Mr. Young points to hoaxes like false Holocaust or Benghazi memoirs or even, in his view, Dylann Roof, the Charleston, S.C., shooter, whom Mr. Young sees as acting out in the service of a hoax — the hoax that is racism, in Mr. Young’s view — that perceives blackness, and black people, as a threat.

In its proximity to violence and its ever-more-accessible transmission via the internet, the hoax has metastasized, the stakes raised ever higher in what Mr. Young calls our “Age of Euphemism,” when “fake news” is a rallying cry for any unwelcome report. “In a way, the book is a prehistory to Trump,” said David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker. “Donald Trump didn’t invent —” he used a word he acknowledged would be unpublishable in The Times — “but he has certainly upped the ante.”

The more Mr. Young researched, the more dire today’s hoaxers and hoaxes seem. The modern hoax’s tragic qualities “have overcome whatever triumph the hoax once tried for,” Mr. Young said. “We have more, and worse. They’re worse in their damage and in their intent now. And to see that, and be proven right, or prescient, is a kind of hollow victory.”

The book ends on a raw note: “The half-hoax world seems in no danger of ending — unless it’s to give way to the complete-hoax one.” But asked if he felt any compulsion to begin Volume II, Mr. Young was succinct: “I don’t.”

He has, in any case, other responsibilities at the moment. There is the Schomburg, fresh from a two-year, $22.3 million renovation; he arrived there last fall from Atlanta, where he had been a professor and curator at Emory University. As director, Mr. Young oversees the collections and programming, which include exhibitions and regular community events. There is his next poetry collection, “Brown,” which arrives in April. And now there is The New Yorker, one of the rare mainstream publications that still publishes poetry, where he will be tasked with selecting and editing the poems that appear each week.

The poetry world can be insular, Balkanized and obscure — name three star poets — and The New Yorker is one of the largest conduits between its various inlets and a wider world than most of the poetry journals can hope to attract. “People who are not habitual poetry readers happening to read things that are magical is one of the great happy accidents that can occur reading The New Yorker,” said Mr. Remnick. “Kevin will be a master of those happy accidents.”

As it happens, The New Yorker had some hand in Mr. Young’s development as a poet. As a young teenager in Topeka, Kan., where he spent part of his youth, Mr. Young discovered the yellow-covered paperback “The New Yorker Book of Poems.”

“I carried that thing around with me,” he said. “I recently found my edition — it has little checks next to poems I liked.” (One of them, James Dickey’s “Falling,” introduced Mr. Young to the idea that his own state could have a place in poetry.)

Mr. Young wrote poems of his own from the age of 13, through high school and Harvard, where friends remembered him as an ambitious and driven writer, collecting prizes, the Stegner Fellowship and praise. He published his first book, “Most Way Home,” after it was selected by Lucille Clifton for the National Poetry Series. (He would later edit her collected poems.)

“He always knew what he wanted to do,” said Mr. Whitehead, a friend since college. “When most people were dabbling, he was working. He was well on his way when most of us were listening to Nirvana and wearing dirty clothes.”

Mr. Remnick praised Mr. Young’s “catholic with a small c” taste, something he said he shared with the magazine’s outgoing poetry editor, Paul Muldoon. And Mr. Young, whose first poem in the magazine, “Langston Hughes,” was published in 1999, said he would work to spotlight the wide breadth of American poetry, from its establishment lions to emerging voices. (Of recent note, he said, were Tiana Clark and Kaveh Akbar, both published in the magazine by Mr. Muldoon.)

“It’s an exciting moment, in black poetry and poetry in general,” he said.“I’m really looking forward to that being in the pages.”

O.K., but what kind of poems speak to you?

“I mean, good ones,” Mr. Young said, and chuckled. “I think I go with the Duke Ellington view on music. He said, ‘There’s two kinds of music — there’s good music, and then there’s the other kind.’”

Mr. Young is held to be a champion of the good kind.

“I can’t think of a better person to be the curator of what poetry people should be reading than Kevin,” said Ms. Trethewey, who first met him 20-some years ago as fellow members of the Dark Room Collective, a community of black poets. “I call him ‘The Kevin Young.’ I started calling him that when we first met.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Just when you think you’re in the zone, just when you think you’re on Will Shortz’s wavelength, he throws a curve ball. Once in a while, we get a themed Saturday crossword, and I am sure that some of you who are trying to get their hooks into the Saturdays will join me in saying:

It’s not an easy theme to spot, and heaven knows you might not even realize it’s there until you finish the puzzle, but a theme is a theme, and it might help you solve. So we’ll take it.

The revealer STRETCH THE TRUTH is at 54A; it’s clued as “Exaggerate ... or a hint to five nonconsecutive letters in 20-Across, 36-Across and 7-Down.” Once you have that, you could use those instructions — find three, 15-letter phrases that contain the letters in TRUTH, stretched over the entire phrase, like T H R O U GH TH E YEARS — to gain major real estate in the grid. Or, as some solvers will undoubtedly do, you can solve the entire puzzle, look over the clues, spot the revealer clue and say “Huh. I didn’t even see that.”

And that’s O.K. As former the crossword editor Will Weng said, “It’s your puzzle. Solve it any way you like.” But it’s still a neat thing that the constructor, Michael Shteyman, has found in his theme entries.

So why is a themed puzzle acceptable on a Saturday? Well, the theme is really well hidden, and let’s not forget about the clues:

Tricky Clues

1A: Tough and clever misdirection, right out of the gate: A “Spelling aid?” sounds like it might be a tip for remembering how to spell words, but today it refers to casting spells, and the answer is MOJO.

18A: I love these antonym-type clues, like today’s “Goes on ... and goes off.” The answer to both is RANTS.

23A: Watch out for heteronym clues, where words that mean different things are spelled the same. Did you read “Big tower letters” and think of a tower that rises up out of the ground, like the Leaning Tower of Pisa? I wouldn’t blame you if you did. But today, ""towers” needs to be read as “something that tows.” The answer is AAA, or Triple A.

24A: Get to know POLA Negri , crossword vamp of silent films.

36A: I never thought I would write this sentence, but Wordplay would like to welcome BUTTERNUT SQUASH back to The New York Times Crossword after a respite of 52 years.

61A: This made me laugh. “It’s just not right” is, of course, LEFT.

11D: I was not familiar with AHMAD TEA, especially as a competitor to Twinings, but apparently it is a British company .

Some theme entries that were left on the cutting room floor include AT RISK YOUTH, TRUSTWORTHY, MOTOR MOUTH / MELT IN YOUR MOUTH, CULTURAL OUTREACH and MYSTERY AUTHOR, among others. I got lucky to a) Find a number of crossword-worthy, 15-letter answers that fit the theme and b) Discover that, after some trial and error, they nicely lent themselves to a neat, crisscrossing pattern. Hope this midweek offering in Saturday’s clothes provides both a formidable challenge and a welcome change of pace to start off your weekend.

Thanks for the change of pace, Mr. Shteyman.

She and others compared Prince Mohammed’s campaign to anti-corruption drives by President Xi Jinping in China or President Vladimir V. Putin in Russia, where prosecutions are often politically motivated.

As many as 500 people have now been detained on allegations of corruption as part of the crackdown. Many are being held at Riyadh Ritz-Carlton in what may be the world’s most luxurious prison.

The Saudi Council of Ministers said Tuesday that all arrests were “based on specific evidence of criminality and acts that were intended criminal transgressions and resulted in unlawful gain.”

“The rights of the accused and the facts relating to the offenses are protected by law at all stages during the investigation and judicial process,” the council added.

But the government had not disclosed any specific charges or evidence, or even the names of those arrested. The first wave began just hours after a royal decree created an investigating committee under Prince Mohammed, leaving little time for inquiry. The courts are under the effective control of the king and crown prince. And it was unclear which branch of the court system might hear the cases — the main Shariah court system or the more specialized board of grievance courts that handle administrative complaints.

“This is a Pandora’s box to start having anti-corruption trials,” said David Ottaway, a Middle East fellow at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan research center. “Where does it stop within the royal family? Are there any princes that can show clean hands?”

“The law is not meant to govern the ruling family in any meaningful way, or to govern the relations between the ruling family and the state,” said Nathan J. Brown, a scholar at George Washington University who studies Arab legal systems.

“Ultimately, the king and some high members of the royal family can do what they want and make it legal later,” he said, and the lack of regulation over royal self-dealing “opens the door wide to what would be considered corruption in other systems.”

Many Saudis appear to have applauded the crackdown. Two-thirds are under 30, many are frustrated by high unemployment, and some may take a certain satisfaction at even an arbitrary comeuppance for so many of the rich and powerful.

“It’s going to be popular with the commoners who see important parts of the al-Saud family as a rent-seeking, unaccountable caste,” Steffen Hertog, an associate professor at the London School of Economics and the author of a book on the Saudi bureaucracy. “Saudi businesses have been complaining about royal encroachment for decades.”

Some cases may be clear-cut.

One area that the official Saudi media say Prince Mohammed intends to investigate is flooding in the city of Jidda that killed more than 100 people in 2009. In that case, a Saudi businessman was accused of absconding with millions of dollars allocated for a Jidda sewage system and never installing any pipes.

“We all knew, and we never reported on it,” Jamal Khashoggi, then the editor of a major Saudi newspaper and now living in exile, wrote this week in The Washington Post.

Beyond that case, only a few anonymously sourced reports of the potential charges have emerged. A professionally coordinated social media campaign, which appears to be organized by the government, has accused the most important prisoner, Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, the former chief of the national guard and a son of the previous king, of enriching himself at public expense by diverting funds from the national guard. Citing unnamed sources, news reports have suggested that he would be accused of hiring ghost employees and paying inflated contracts to companies he owned for equipment like walkie-talkies and bulletproof military gear.

His brother, Prince Turki bin Abdullah, the former governor of Riyadh, will reportedly be accused of paying inflated contracts to companies he owned for a subway under construction in the capital.

But in a country named for its ruling family, the line between public and private money can be hard to discern.

Prince Mohammed’s corruption committee “can basically detain anyone for anything they choose to call corruption,” said Robert Jordan, the former United States ambassador to Saudi Arabia. “That’s part of how this web was spun.”

The most famous detainee, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, had no apparent need for graft. He was well known as an investor in international stock markets and as one of the world’s richest people; the sources of his wealth were more transparent than most princes.

Prince Alwaleed had been a critic of the kingdom’s closed economy and pervasive corruption. A secret 1996 diplomatic memorandum said that Prince Alwaleed told the American ambassador how a handful of senior princes controlled billions of dollars in off-budget programs, revenue roughly equal to one million barrels of the country’s oil per day. According to the memo, the Two Holy Mosques project and the Ministry of Defense’s strategic storage project, were “highly secretive, subject to no ministry of finance oversight or controls.”

The memo, disclosed in the trove of State Department documents released by WikiLeaks seven years ago, provided a detailed blueprint of the varied ways that money flows to members of the royal family either from state coffers or through private business in an otherwise opaque system.

An embassy official received an unprecedented glimpse into royal finances when he visited the Ministry of Finance Office of Decisions and Rules in 1996, where servants came to pick up stipends for their royal masters. Sons of the founding king received as much as $270,000 a month, while a great-great-grandchild collected $8,000 a month. On top of those payments, bonuses of $1 million to $3 million were handed out to, say, construct a palace.

Princes were known for borrowing money and simply never paying it back, which nearly led to the collapse of the National Commercial Bank. Royals were also known to act as the exclusive agents for foreign companies in the kingdom. When they founded their own businesses, they often relied on either government spending or state subsidies.

“The government, specifically the Ministries of Finance and Municipal and Rural Affairs, often transfers public land to princes, who in turn sell it at huge profit to real estate developers,” another diplomat wrote in a 2007 memorandum, noting that Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the longtime ambassador to the United States, and Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahd, the favorite son of King Fahd, profited to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars by selling land for a centrally planned megacity north of Jidda.

Perhaps the most famous statement on corruption in Saudi Arabia was made by Prince Bandar. In an interview with PBS in 2001, he said: “If you tell me that building this whole country, and spending $350 billion out of $400 billion, that we had misused or got corrupted with $50 billion, I’ll tell you, yes. But I’ll take that anytime.”

Weapons contracts have long been a source of wealth. British media reported that Prince Bandar received well over $1 billion in secret payments from BAE Systems, the leading British military contractor, over the course of a decade. The son of founding King Abdulaziz’s personal doctor, Adnan Khashoggi, became a billionaire as an arms dealer and go-between for weapons makers and members of the royal family.

“Believing that community engagement requirements do not support or promote the objectives of Medicaid is a tragic example of the soft bigotry of low expectations consistently espoused by the prior administration,” Ms. Verma said. “Those days are over.”

Jason A. Helgerson, the Medicaid director in New York State, said on Twitter that Ms. Verma’s comments were “absolutely awful.” It was absurd for her to suggest that she was ushering in a new day for Medicaid by taking it away from millions of people, he said.

Ms. Verma worked for years as a consultant to state Medicaid officials. With her guidance, her home state of Indiana expanded Medicaid eligibility under the governor at the time, Mike Pence, while emphasizing “personal responsibility” by requiring beneficiaries to pay premiums and contribute to health savings accounts.

In her remarks on Tuesday, Ms. Verma did not renew Republican calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act. But she criticized the law’s expansion of Medicaid, an option that has been taken up by 31 states.

“The thought that a program designed for our most vulnerable citizens should be used as a vehicle to serve working age, able-bodied adults does not make sense,” Ms. Verma said.

Average monthly enrollment in Medicaid, according to the Congressional Budget Office, has climbed by nearly one-third, to 77 million people, since President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in 2010.

The Kaiser Family Foundation reports that at least six states — Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Utah and Wisconsin — have pending waiver requests that would require work as a condition of eligibility for some Medicaid beneficiaries. New Hampshire submitted its own proposal last week.

“Community engagement” is a broad term that states define in various ways. It can include not only paid employment, but also volunteer activities, going to school, job training, searching for jobs, caring for elderly relatives and even treatment for drug or alcohol abuse.

Donna Checkett, a former Medicaid director in Missouri, said Ms. Verma’s position on requiring such activities was “180 degrees different from that of the previous administration.”

Cindy Mann, who was the top federal Medicaid official under Mr. Obama, said Ms. Verma’s objections to Medicaid coverage of working age, able-bodied adults were “upsetting and disturbing.”

The Affordable Care Act gave states the “flexibility and financing” to cover that population in diverse ways, without seeking a federal waiver, Ms. Mann said.

And she noted that the expansion of Medicaid had been defended by Republican governors including Chris Christie of New Jersey, John R. Kasich of Ohio, Rick Snyder of Michigan, Chris Sununu of New Hampshire and Brian Sandoval of Nevada.

Ms. Verma also announced changes to speed the review of state requests for waivers of the federal Medicaid law. She said the Trump administration could approve some waivers for 10 years. Waivers have typically been approved for five years, with the possibility of an extension for three years.

In addition, Ms. Verma said, “if we approve an idea in one state and another state wants to do the same thing, we will expedite those approvals.”

She said the Trump administration would issue a scorecard measuring and comparing states’ performance in improving the health of people on Medicaid. The federal government and the states together spend more than $550 billion a year on Medicaid, and people deserve to know if the money is “producing positive results,” she said.

Matt D. Salo, the executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, said state officials agreed with Ms. Verma that they should focus on Medicaid beneficiaries and the outcomes of the care provided.

But, Mr. Salo said, “we have a lot of disagreement” with the contention that Medicaid should not be serving able-bodied adults of working age. State officials said that many Medicaid beneficiaries had low-wage jobs that did not provide health insurance for them or their family members.

Ms. Verma insisted that the Affordable Care Act had given states perverse financial incentives, paying a higher share of Medicaid costs for newly eligible beneficiaries.

“The A.C.A.,’’ she said, “moved millions of working-age, nondisabled adults into a program that was created to care for seniors in need, pregnant mothers, children and people with disabilities, stretching the safety net for some of our most fragile populations, many of whom are still on waiting lists for critical home-care services while states enroll millions of newly eligible able-bodied adults.’’",Trump Administration Will Support Work Requirements for Medicaid,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/us/politics/trump-work-requirements-medicaid.html

More than 10 percent of those over age 80 have heart failure, and more patients are living longer with advanced disease. Even as the death rate from heart attacks is falling, the figure for heart failure is rising.

Yet there are no widely accepted guidelines for dealing with these patients as they near death. Cancer specialists regularly move their patients to hospice at the end of life, for instance, but few cardiologists even think of it. Heart patients account for just 15 percent of hospice deaths, while cancer patients make up half, according to a recent study.

That paper, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, reviewed a number of ways in which heart patients are let down at the end of life. Implanted defibrillators often remain activated until the very end, for example, even for those in hospice.

A fifth of heart patients with defibrillators get shocked by them in the last few weeks of life, and 8 percent get shocked minutes before dying. Most patients are never told that they can ask that the defibrillators be turned off.

“Getting shocks at the end of life is not really helping patients live longer or better,” said Dr. Larry Allen, a heart failure specialist at the University of Colorado and an author of the study.

“We shouldn’t have a single one of these cases happening,” said Dr. Haider Warraich, a cardiology fellow at Duke University and first author of the study.

Experts often focus on the strides made in preventing and treating heart disease. Its incidence has declined by 70 percent in the past 50 years. People have heart attacks later in life than they used to, are more likely to survive them, and often live for years afterward with few or no symptoms.

“We are very proud” of that progress, said Dr. Patrice Desvigne-Nickens, a medical officer at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

Still, she added, cardiologists and their patients should be discussing end-of-life options and palliative care earlier in the course of heart failure.

“Everyone is uncomfortable with end-of-life discussions,” she said. “The field of cancer may be ahead of us. We should learn from looking at their example.”

But cardiologists thrive on the dramatic saving of lives, said Dr. Michael Bristow, a cardiologist at the University of Colorado Denver. They devote their professional lives to rescuing patients having heart attacks and bringing them back from the brink.

End-of-life care is not typically their focus; neither do they spend much time pondering what some of their patients may experience in the future. “Those who go into cardiology are not necessarily ones who want to deal with death and dying,” Dr. Bristow said.

The very nature of end-stage heart failure makes it all the more difficult to prepare.

“Very few patients understand the trajectory of the disease,” said Dr. Lynne Warner Stevenson, a heart failure specialist at Vanderbilt University. The path has peaks and valleys, but as the patient declines, each peak is a little lower than the one before.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

And often doctors do not tell patients what to expect.

“Unfortunately, when you have patients with a chronic illness like heart failure, everyone thinks someone else will talk about it,” Dr. Stevenson said. “Too often, no one takes ownership of the last stage of the journey with the patient.”

Dr. Ellen Hummel of the University of Michigan, one of a small number of doctors specializing in cardiology palliative care, said the typical patient with cancer will usually experience a “fairly predictable” decline.

“They will be less able to take care of themselves,” she said. “They will be more symptomatic and come back to the hospital more frequently. And once this starts, it will probably continue until they die. Most people can see the end coming.”

But patients with end-stage heart failure are more likely to have wild swings, Dr. Hummel said, veering from feeling better to being terribly ill.

“It is confusing to both the patient and provider. Are they actually dying, or can we rescue them from a particular episode of worsening?”

Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale University, agreed: “The issue is knowing who is really at the end of life.” For patients with heart failure, seesawing between good periods and bad, it can be very difficult to make the call.

Dr. Allen recently discussed all this with a patient, Ed Harvey.

Mr. Harvey, 75, has an implanted defibrillator, and his heart is weakening, pumping progressively less blood. Dr. Allen gave him medications that helped for a while, but, Dr. Allen said, “we have maxed out on what can be done.”

He can’t say with any certainty how long Mr. Harvey has. But now is the time, Dr. Allen told him, to talk about the end of life.

Mr. Harvey still feels pretty good, but “when you have congestive heart failure and it is not getting any better, you know that day is going to come,” he said.

He has been living with heart failure for more than a decade, and fears becoming a burden as his heart gets worse. It is now so weak that the only medical option left is an implantable pump. He knows that soon he will need full-time care.

A diet more heavily based on plants — that is, fruits and vegetables — may result in a microbiome containing a wider range of healthful organisms.
In studies, mice that had a microbiota preconditioned by the typical American diet did not respond as healthfully to a plant-based diet.
Similarly, studies have suggested a role of the gut microbiota in the risk of developing neuropsychiatric illnesses like schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and even chronic fatigue syndrome.","Depending on the body site, anywhere from 20 percent to 60 percent of the organisms that make up the microbiota cannot be cultured and identified with the older, traditional techniques used by microbiologists.

If the institutes’ five-year project succeeds in defining changes in the microbiome that are associated with disease, it has the potential to transform medicine, assuming ways can be found to correct microbial distortions in the affected tissues.

Here are some of the demonstration projects already underway:

Skin: Dr. Martin J. Blaser, microbiologist and director of the human microbiome program at New York University School of Medicine, is directing examination of the organisms on the skin of 75 people with and without psoriasis, checking whether agents used to treat the condition adversely alter the microbiome.

Vagina: Jacques Ravel at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and Larry J. Forney at the University of Idaho are studying 200 women to determine the microbial changes that may result in a common and difficult-to-control infection called bacterial vaginosis, which afflicts more than 20 million American women of childbearing age.

Blood: At Washington University in St. Louis, Dr. Gregory A. Storch, a specialist in pediatric infectious disease, and colleagues are examining the role of viruses and the immune system in the blood and respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of children who develop serious fevers that result in some 20 million visits a year to hospital emergency rooms.

Gastrointestinal tract: Claire M. Fraser-Liggett, a microbiologist, and Dr. Alan R. Shuldiner, a geneticist, both at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, are exploring how the microbiome affects the body’s use of energy and the development of obesity.

Previous studies have already found differences in the gut microbiota of lean and obese adults. There is also evidence that the typical high-calorie American diet rich in sugar, meats and processed foods may adversely affect the balance of microbes in the gut and foster the extraction and absorption of excess calories from food.

A diet more heavily based on plants — that is, fruits and vegetables — may result in a microbiome containing a wider range of healthful organisms. In studies, mice that had a microbiota preconditioned by the typical American diet did not respond as healthfully to a plant-based diet.

Compared to lean mice, obese mice have a 50 percent reduction in organisms called Bacteroidetes and a proportional increase in Firmicutes, and lean mice get fat when given fecal transplants from obese mice. A similar shift has been observed in people, and the distorted ratio of organisms was shown to reverse in people who lose weight following bariatric surgery.

There is also evidence that microbes residing in the gut can affect distant sites through their influence on a person’s immune responses. This indirect action has been suggested as a possible mechanism behind rheumatoid arthritis. In mice, certain bacteria in the gut have been shown to foster production of antibodies that attack the joints, resulting in the joint destruction typical of rheumatoid arthritis.

Similarly, studies have suggested a role of the gut microbiota in the risk of developing neuropsychiatric illnesses like schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and even chronic fatigue syndrome. Researchers have suggested that in genetically susceptible people, altered microbes in the gut may disrupt the blood-brain barrier, leading to the production of antibodies that adversely affect normal brain development.

Among the challenges in elucidating the microbiome’s role in health and disease is determining whether changes found in the microorganisms inhabiting various organs are a cause or an effect. Most of what is already known about the microbiota in people with various health problems is based on observation, making it difficult to say which came first: the disease or the disrupted microbiota.

Animal studies like those mentioned above are a clue but not proof of a similar effect in people. Until therapeutic studies now underway are completed, people with conditions thought to be influenced by the microbiome have no choice currently but to rely on possible treatments suggested by animal research and some preliminary human studies.

For example, people with irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, allergic disorders and infections with drug-resistant organisms may benefit from taking probiotics, though some probiotics sold in health food and drugstores may be ineffective. It may be necessary to tailor-make the remedy for each condition or even each patient.

Meanwhile, people interested in fostering a health-promoting array of gut microorganisms should consider shifting from a diet heavily based on meats, carbohydrates and processed foods to one that emphasizes plants. As Dr. Jeffrey Gordon, a genomics specialist at Washington University School of Medicine, told The Times last year, “The nutritional value of food is influenced in part by the microbial community that encounters that food.”",Unlocking the Secrets of the Microbiome,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/well/live/unlocking-the-secrets-of-the-microbiome.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

In the country’s only bilingual M.F.A. creative writing program , at the University of Texas at El Paso, students on this day are comparing how F.

Ms. Cote-Botero hangs back, periodically interjecting in either language. A student from Mexico City consults another from Las Vegas on a passage in Fitzgerald’s “Great Gatsby,” occasionally glancing at Google Translate on a laptop.

El Paso’s Masters of Fine Arts program, started in 2006, draws mostly local residents from both sides of the border. A dozen of the 20 students are native Spanish speakers, and all speak at least some English and Spanish. They are motivated by the desire to write and read in another tongue, and to study with professors versed in other cultures. One student, a Texan of Palestinian descent, hopes the program will help her better express herself in Arabic.

While El Paso’s program is a unique educational experience, creative writing programs across the country are developing Spanish-based curriculums — a growth reflecting the nation’s changing demographics: Spanish is the primary language of more than 40 million people in the United States, up from 32 million in 2005, according to Census Bureau estimates.

Among the emerging programs, California State University in Los Angeles will offer its own bilingual M.F.A. next year. Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., will start a Spanish-language creative writing degree in 2018, similar to one already in place at New York University. Students in the Spanish-language program and its English counterpart at the University of Iowa are now being encouraged to take each other’s classes.

And while recovering from Hurricane Harvey this semester, the University of Houston started a Ph.D. with a Spanish-language concentration that emphasizes literary scholarship as much as writing (students must include a theoretical analysis with their creative writing dissertation).

“I see all these programs as a unit of sorts,” said Houston’s director, Cristina Rivera-Garza, “a group interested in developing the writers of the 21st century: bilingual, diverse and representative of the communities thriving in the United States.”

The Houston and Cal State programs are also developing activist efforts to support local Hispanic populations (Houston’s has grown by more than 200,000 from 2000 to 2016; Los Angeles County’s by about 600,000). Cal State’s program director, Alex Espinoza, said its students will help residents in largely Spanish-speaking East L.A. write biographical narratives that counter those “too often generalized in the media” — and by the Trump administration.

Indeed, these programs could be seen as something of an artistic challenge to the administration’s stance on Hispanic immigrants, represented by its plans to revoke the DACA program protecting undocumented students from deportation, the proposed Mexican border wall, and the removal this year of the White House Spanish-language website .

Collectively, the programs could play a significant role in developing young writers who publicly voice varied aspects of the Hispanic experience.

The Juárez-El Paso geography — two communities intertwined culturally and economically, separated by a parched Rio Grande barely waist deep — is a topic the students and professors have explored in their literary work. Perhaps the starkest difference between the cities is the drug-related violence on the Juárez side, which they depict with disturbing visceral images and blunt, uncensored vocabulary.

Juárez-El Paso is the largest metropolitan area on the border, with a combined population of more than two million, but the walk from downtown Juárez to downtown El Paso takes less than half an hour.

Alessandra Narváez-Varela used to walk across that border almost every day from Juárez to classes at the University of Texas, and to help out in the restaurant her family owns in El Paso. She has a B.S. in biology and a B.A. in creative writing. She spent a year in medical school, but “it didn’t feel like it was supposed to feel,” she said. Poetry did. Now 31, in El Paso’s bilingual M.F.A. program, she is writing to reconcile her dual identity and to give voice to women’s issues, especially involving female anatomy, that initially drew her to medicine. “Once you have that kind of conversation with the body you can’t let it go,” she said.

Oddly, while Ms. Narváez-Varela’s deepest roots lie in Spanish, she did not feel confident composing poetry in her native language. Her college writing had always been in English. “Maybe the Spanish speaker in me felt relegated to second-class-citizen status after adopting English as the language for my poetry,” she said.

I attended a presentation Ms. Narváez-Varela gave at a national writer’s conference in Los Angeles in which she explained how a workshop in the program had helped her find her Spanish voice.

She had written a poem in Spanish called “Ovarian Cancer,” filled with graphic imagery (she compared cancer to a bleeding fetus). Classmates had told her the beat pattern didn’t flow and criticized her use of rhyme. Ms. Narváez-Varela realized she had been unconsciously translating from English. She projected on a screen a copy of the poem, hand-edited by classmates, and an English translation, pointing out to the audience phrases she had originally conceived in English.

“Spanish, and the way it’s used to create music in poetry, differs radically in terms of syllables and rhyme,” she discovered. “It was a humbling workshop for me, but an enlightening one, too.”

Ms. Narváez-Varela went on to explore Mexican and American identities using Spanglish, the mixing of languages in the same sentences. In her poem “Real Mexican,” she describes, in raw and troubling language, a Mexican-American ex-convict so confused about his Hispanic identity he doesn’t know what name to call himself. In the opening line the character says: “Tony, Toño, Antonio, Anthony, it doesn’t matter, honey....”

“I had never before adopted a persona that explored Spanglish’s complexity and its meaning to me as a Mexican citizen naturalized in the U.S.,” Ms. Narváez-Varela said. “I realized this was a projection of my own anxieties as a Mexican-American. I had unconsciously judged others by the way they spoke Spanglish.” She said she was trying to show how the character’s use of Spanglish “is a vital manifestation of his identity as a marginalized member of both societies.”

Writing the poem helped her see the artistry of “a language as valid and beautiful as English or Spanish, as hybrid as African-American English, and therefore as deserving of a place in poetry.” Huizache , a journal of Latino literature, has just published “Real Mexican.”

Many important Hispanic fiction writers have attended traditional M.F.A. programs. I spoke with three of the masters — Sandra Cisneros, Junot Díaz and Esmeralda Santiago — about how they bridge two languages in their writing and about their graduate school experience. Each said that their M.F.A. programs did not recognize the Spanish-speaking side of their identities, either by assigning Latino authors or by supporting the Spanish element of their work.

Ms. Cisneros, who is Mexican-American, described an interaction with her thesis adviser at the prestigious Iowa Writers’ Workshop when she began writing “The House on Mango Street.”

She had written the novella in English but inflected it with Spanish phrasings. The adviser criticized her for overusing the word “little,” unaware how frequently the suffix “ito” — for little or cute — is used in Spanish.

The incident, she said, impeded her connection to Spanish. “I didn’t realize it until after I’d left Iowa,” Ms. Cisneros said. “I was writing a letter in Spanish and I thought, this is the voice of ‘The House on Mango Street.’”

In her choice of a single word in her native language, Ms. Cisneros was able to greatly affect meaning.

When she named the young narrator of “The House on Mango Street” Esperanza, she wasn’t just giving her a pretty name. “Esperanza” can mean waiting, expectation or hope in English. In the story, the girl poetically expresses a blend of feelings about her name, saying, “In Spanish, it means too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color.”

“I wanted it to be a traditional name that wouldn’t translate well into U.S. culture,” Ms. Cisneros said, “as well as one that would mean wish, desire and hope.”

Image “Some words refuse translations,” said the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Junot Díaz. Credit Alejandro Garcia/European Pressphoto Agency

Mr. Díaz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Dominican-American writer, attended Cornell University’s M.F.A. program and now teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In graduate education, he advocates for “ties to scholars working on the intersections of languages, on Creoles, on multilingualism.”

He explained his own mental translation process this way: “If I’m writing a character who is Spanish dominant, they talk and think within me in Spanish and I translate most of it into English. Some words refuse translations — sometimes it’s the joy of the word, or the energy it pulses with in the original Spanish sentence.” For example, Mr. Diaz freely employs English expletives in his work, but sometimes opts for rough Spanish equivalents.

Ms. Santiago, author of the memoir “When I Was Puerto Rican” and an M.F.A. graduate of Sarah Lawrence College, writes entire drafts bilingually. “I write as fast as I can and don’t worry whether what appears on the page is in English or in Spanish,” she said. “Later, when I’m editing, I will translate almost all of the Spanish into English if it’s for publication in that language. English and Spanish are for me the same language.”

In the El Paso program, faculty members strive to respond effectively to students who write in English, Spanish or both. Professors try to accommodate students in individual conferences by working in their preferred language. “I’ll speak in English and they’ll speak in Spanish,” said Daniel Chacón, one of 10 faculty members. “Then I might reiterate and clarify in Spanish.”

Whatever their level of proficiency, students must grapple with both languages. “They have to make the effort to bridge the gap,” said the director, José de Piérola. “It can be a shock to be stressed in this way, but it makes you grow.”

In one of Mr. de Piérola’s workshops, a student who spoke little Spanish led a group critique of a student’s short story. The story was in English, but he could not understand the group members who spoke in Spanish, and had to turn for explanations to fully bilingual classmates.

Many of the readings are available in translation, but even the students who feel challenged reading in the second language are encouraged to wrestle with the original texts. Some rely on tools like Google Translate, despite its limitations for interpreting literary language.

“When the Spanish speakers read American poets in English and vice versa, it changes their relationship to their own tradition,” Ms. Cote-Botero said.

She described how she might teach students to experiment with their writing by contrasting English and Spanish versions of the sonnet. She explained that Shakespeare standardized the English line using a steady five-beat pattern. “It’s closest to English speech and to the heartbeat,” she said.

One widely quoted example is Shakespeare’s opening line “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” The Spanish form, on the other hand, is based on a 14-syllable line. When students “mix the two, interesting things appear,” she said. By remaining “inside the boundaries of your own tradition you’re more at risk for repeating yourself.”

With a bilingual approach, Mr. Chacón said, “you can play with your own language a little more. James Joyce was able to play with language because he grew up with Gaelic and paid attention to its sound.”

To expose his students to writing styles in other languages, he adds to his reading lists translations of Japanese Zen koans and the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle.

By encouraging students to explore different literary traditions and settings, the El Paso program is about more than just two languages.

Looking back as she approaches graduation next month (her thesis is a book of poetry about women), Ms. Narváez-Varela said that writing bilingually has pushed her beyond her comfort zone. This was a key reason she chose the program, and she hopes to carry that experience into a community college teaching position.

As a Mexican woman exploring life beyond the border, she will continue through her poems, she said, to “ask the hard questions, and expect no answers, or several, as playfully and passionately as possible.”

“Just to see their homes, their decorations around them, their computers — all of those things give quite a lot of personality to the photo,” Mr. Lien said.
Mr. Lien spent weeks researching and studying commenters.","Nick Haynes didn’t seem so bad.

Sure, online he had promised civil war if Hillary Clinton were elected, but Mr. Haynes was first and foremost a family man. He’d given up his days of motorcycles and drinking to live a sober life in a sleepy Pennsylvania town with his four children, where he had a full-time job as a truck driver.

But his family life contrasted sharply with his other full-time job, that of a prolific online commenter. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he tweeted an average of 57 times a day about a corrupt system, biased media and “Killary.” He compared voting for Mrs. Clinton to killing your own children.

It was this disconnect between “normal life” and intense online debate that drove Kyrre Lien, a photographer based in Oslo, to look into the lives of the online commenting community. For a project called “The Internet Warriors,” Mr. Lien combed through tens of thousands of online comments to put together a group of 27 internet debaters from around the world, representing all sides of the political spectrum.

“They had steady jobs, they had family, they had friends and lived quite a normal life, but at the same time, you saw they had these hateful comments,” he said. “That was part of what drove me to dig into this.”

In the case of Mr. Haynes, Mr. Lien assumed that he would personify his comments.

“I thought if you’re writing hateful comment towards Hillary or Trump that are really, really angry and horrible, I thought that person is going to be horrible in person as well,” Mr. Lien said. “But many of the people were actually quite nice, made me coffee and tea and, until politics came up, it was like flipping the switch on a different personality.”

Still, Mr. Lien is hesitant to categorize them as internet trolls.

“Labeling them all as internet trolls would be too harsh. Many of them are trolls, but many of them are just really strongly opinionated people,” Mr. Lien said. “All of the people I met are really dedicated in the cause they’re fighting.”

They have full-time jobs and families, they are men and women of all ages, who feel marginalized in some way or another. Take, for example, Ashleigh Jones, 22, a psychology student in Cardiff, Wales. She’s amassed more than 180,000 tweets on various subjects including entertainment, L.G.B.T. issues and “hot guys.”

“Some people have also called me a troll, like when I said that ISIS should kill David Cameron,” Ms. Jones told Mr. Lien, referring to the former British prime minister. “I don’t think I’m a troll. I might have strong opinions, but they are just that — opinions. For me, a troll is someone who is ruining the discussion, and that’s not me.”

The photographs feature portraits of the commenters, many of them in their natural commenting habitat inside their homes. Video interviews accompany the subjects online, as well as a book.

“Just to see their homes, their decorations around them, their computers — all of those things give quite a lot of personality to the photo,” Mr. Lien said.

Mr. Lien spent weeks researching and studying commenters. One thread took him down a dark path on Kim Kardashian’s Facebook account. He spent three or four days going through all the comments on her account looking for frequent commenters with a consistent message. But in the end, that was one type of opinion he wasn’t able to capture on camera — misogynists.

Mr. Lien found that the motivation behind commenters depends on their political affiliation. On the right, it’s “because they feel threatened and society is letting them down, they’re being left by themselves,” Mr. Lien said, whereas people on the left “feel that we need to stand up for what we believe in.”

Sofia Srour, 23 and Muslim, defends her religion daily.

“There is so much ignorance and hate directed towards my religion in the comment section that I quickly become irritated. Anger drives me,” she told Mr. Lien. “I have spent more than three hours every day sharing my views on Islam. It’s a bit scary to engage in these discussions, but I feel that it’s important to balance out all the negativity that is posted.”

Mr. Lien may have spent four years trailing the lives of what he calls internet warriors, but the photographer is far from calling himself a troll.

“I’d like to be more of an internet peacekeeping force than an internet warrior,” he said.

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

Photo

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

It was not clear whether that was a good thing or a bad one.

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

Texas is one of at least 38 states with a law that recognizes a fetus in utero as a potential crime victim separate from the mother, or where stiffer penalties apply when crimes are committed against pregnant women. Federal law recognizes unborn fetuses as separate victims of federal and military crimes.

The laws, some recent and others decades old, are another battle front in the long, passionate political war over abortion and the question of when life begins. Anti-abortion groups have lobbied for fetal homicide laws as part of a broader campaign for “personhood,” hoping to persuade the public to regard prenatal life at any stage of development as a human being deserving of legal rights and protection.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — Today’s constructor, Natan Last, has taken the road less traveled, at least in his career.

“Two roads diverged in a wood, and I —

I took the one less traveled by,

And that has made all the difference.” — Robert Frost

Mr. Last’s puzzle not only uses the title of Robert Frost’s 1916 poem “THE ROAD NOT TAKEN” as a seed entry, but he shows us how to (almost) effortlessly make that detour when necessary.

Today’s Theme

Five phrases take a masterful detour as we make our way from left to right in today’s puzzle. One of things I liked about today’s theme is that the entire puzzle is solvable even if you don’t take those detours.

For example, Mr. Last’s seed entry, THE ROAD NOT TAKEN is clued as “1916 Frost verse … or, diverged: Start of a saying about meaning well.” It’s a central Across entry, but once you get to the “N” in NOT, the road diverges into shaded/circled squares and becomes THE ROAD TO HELL. That’s the start to the saying, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.”

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — If you were not aware what a Wall Street reformer might want, you will learn it today in Jules Markey’s puzzle. This was a nice midweek theme that kept its secret until the very end for me.

Today’s Theme

Mr. Markey offers us a list theme of phrases that feel fresh: Three of the four make their New York Times Crossword debuts today, as does the revealer. Hidden in each phrase is a word that can be used before the word “BANKS,” and solvers are directed to those words by the circled/shaded squares.

For example, at 17A, the answer to the clue “Weave or tailgate, say” is DRIVE RECKLESSLY. The revealer at 62A, BREAK UP THE BANKS, is a hint that the ultimate answer to 17A is RIVER BANKS.

Tricky Clues

1A/1D: Were you flummoxed by the “Drug referenced in ‘The Joyous Cosmology’ ”? Here’s how to solve that one: First, it’s only three letters, so that narrows things down quite a bit. Second, 1A is fairly easy: The famous LOCH Lomond is in Scotland. With the L in the first square, the answer has to be LSD.

18D: R.V. TRIP is a bit random to my ears, but I know people vacation in Winnebagos.

50D: I didn’t know the director Hal ASHBY, although I know the film “Shampoo” that he directed. I guessed at ASHER, realized it was wrong when I solved 70A’s YMCAS, and guessed again at ASHBY.

Constructor Notes

The idea for this puzzle came during the election season of 2016. The revealer was heard and seen quite often at many campaign rallies, and it’s 15 letters long! It was quite natural then to try to turn it into a puzzle theme. I first thought to use the names of some banks in phrases but found that really wasn’t working, so i quickly settled on types of banks instead. What you see are the theme entries I first came up with, I’m pretty happy with the 4-1; 1-2-1; 1-4; 1-2-1 break patterns. After acceptance, I sent Will a version with all the theme entries spanning the grid, but he felt the fill had been too compromised, so he stayed with this version. Thanks to Will, Joel and team for polishing it up. I hope it was a pleasurable solve.

In all, about a dozen members of Parliament, eight from the Conservative Party and four from Labour, are under investigation.

According to political legend, past whips collected compromising information in a “black book,” to be used as leverage at some future point.","But the Weinstein exposé and its aftermath have unsettled the old system. Last Wednesday at 5:30 p.m., Ms. Merrick called the prime minister’s staff to report the 2003 episode. Ninety minutes later, the lawmaker — Michael Fallon, the defense secretary — stepped down, saying he had “behaved inappropriately in the past.”

“It’s exhausting, challenging something so powerful as a political establishment, that is self-protecting and self-preserving,” Ms. Merrick said. “To try to get a chink in that armor is so exhausting.”

On Tuesday, the crisis apparently encompassed a death: Carl Sargeant, who was dismissed as a minister in the Welsh government last week amid allegations of sexual misconduct, was found in his home, apparently a suicide. He had denied any wrongdoing.

The scandal has hit Prime Minister Theresa May at a difficult time, as she struggles to control warring factions in her party and break free from a deadlock in negotiations for Britain’s exit from the European Union, known as Brexit. On Monday, she promised to create a cross-party body to investigate complaints of misconduct, something some female lawmakers have sought for years.

Hanging over Mrs. May’s head are allegations against her deputy and longtime friend, Damian Green, the first secretary of state. Mrs. May called for an investigation into the case last week after a Conservative Party activist wrote that he had touched her knee and sent her suggestive text messages. Mr. Green has called the allegations by the activist, Kate Maltby, “untrue” and “deeply hurtful.”

Mrs. May has also ordered a Cabinet Office inquiry into Mark Garnier, her international trade minister, who has acknowledged asking his assistant to buy sex toys. In all, about a dozen members of Parliament, eight from the Conservative Party and four from Labour, are under investigation. One Tory, Charlie Elphicke, was suspended after “serious allegations” were referred to the police, the party has said. He has denied any wrongdoing.

“Britain’s political class feels pretty fragile right now,” said Tom McTague, the chief Britain correspondent for Politico and author of “Betting the House,” a new book on this year’s general election, in which the Conservative Party lost its overall majority, although it managed to cling to power.

“When something like this starts to get going, they just feel out of control,” he said. “The M.P.s don’t know where this is going. They don’t know how many allegations are going to come. They don’t know how to get on top of it.”

The episodes have unfolded against the peculiar structure of Britain’s Parliament: The 650 members of the House of Commons hire, employ and manage their staff personally, as if they were small-business owners.

Jess Phillips, 36, a Labour member of Parliament who worked with victims of sexual abuse before entering politics, recalled showing up on her first day in 2015 and asking a senior colleague where her employees should turn with workplace complaints.

“They said, ‘There is no place,’” she said. “I said, ‘Well, what if that was the case?’ I got a shrug in response. I see a lot of young women working here, around very powerful people, and I worry.”

Ms. Phillips began receiving calls from employees with complaints 10 days ago, she said, and has heard from one or two people every day since. Many of the complaints fall well short of a criminal threshold.

“The truth of the matter is, to me, the varying degrees didn’t matter,” she said. “There is a cultural problem where people are using their power for sexual gain, or to hold over women who work in here.”

Party whips, who historically served as a clearinghouse for complaints about officials’ behavior, were also responsible for protecting the party from damage — and for persuading or coercing the members of Parliament to get in line. According to political legend, past whips collected compromising information in a “black book,” to be used as leverage at some future point.

Tim Fortescue, who served as the Tory chief whip in the 1970s, told the BBC that he had often helped lawmakers who feared prosecution.

“It might be debt, it might be a scandal involving small boys, or any kind of scandal,” he said. “We would do everything we can, because we would store up Brownie points. It’s a pretty nasty reason, but it’s one of the reasons. If we could get a chap out of trouble, they’d do as we ask forever.”

Over the weekend, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, herself a former whip, denied that parties had withheld reports of wrongdoing by members of Parliament.

“I don’t recognize some of those more lurid stories that are told about the sort of things whips knew and did,” she said. “I just don’t recognize it.”

But Ms. Merrick, who last week brought forth her complaint from 2003, said she saw no recourse when Mr. Fallon, then a member of Parliament, tried to kiss her after a working lunch, leaving her feeling “so humiliated and so ashamed.”

One of the main reasons she said nothing, she said, was that she was “scared of the whips,” who, if displeased, could prevent her from getting any political news.

“This behavior is reported to whips all the time,” she said. “If there is a new system in place, the whips will still be able to collect information, but staff and journalists will be able to report it openly, rather than it becoming part of the game of snakes and ladders that the whips are controlling.”

On the night last week when Mr. Fallon stepped down, she said, there was no sense of triumph, but instead the sense that she had set right a 14-year-old error.

“These are M.P.s who have gone from public school to Oxford to Commons and have never been challenged, never been questioned,” she said. “I suppose it’s like a muscle that you’re trying to make work.”","In U.K.’s Clubby Parliament, Abuse Complaints May Be Used as Weapons",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/europe/uk-parliament-misconduct.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Boo! Sorry, no Halloween puzzle today. That in itself is spooky, but we’ve solved a couple of Halloween-themed puzzles already, and honestly, how much candy can you eat? Instead, today’s puzzle by Alex Eaton-Salners is a history lesson.

It’s not often that we see a 500th anniversary tribute crossword puzzle, and it happens to be done really well, so I was impressed.

Today’s Theme

History books tell us that a German monk named MARTIN LUTHER nailed a document called the “Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences,” better known as the “Ninety-Five Theses,” to the DOOR of ALL SAINTS CHURCH in WITTENBERG on October 31, 1517, although Mr. Eaton-Salners maintains that this act was actually performed on a later date.

The “Ninety-Five Theses” was a response to the Catholic Church’s practice of selling “INDULGENCES,” where Catholics could purchase absolution from sins, among other forms of corruption that he believed were happening in the church at the time. It was an invitation to debate the church’s practices as a whole, and was later considered to be a foundation for the PROTESTANT REFORMATION (interestingly, the word REFORMATION has appeared in The New York Times Crossword only once before, 50 years ago, and was related to the religious movement.)

“The laws we have right now on the books say a person like this should not have gotten a gun,” Mr. Ryan said.
Gun-control advocates said Mr. Kelley should not have had that kind of firepower in the first place.
Mr. Pomeroy told the sheriff that Mr. Kelley had attended the church in the past, the sheriff said on Tuesday.
“You’re gonna die!” Mr. Kelley yelled out, followed by an expletive, Mr. Ramírez said.","But Mr. Kelley had clearly been troubled for years. His public school records released on Tuesday showed he had been suspended at least seven times, and a classmate said he had complained about medication he was taking.

Months after his escape from the psychiatric hospital, Mr. Kelley pleaded guilty in a military court to repeated assaults on his first wife and her son, a toddler, including one that left the boy with a fractured skull. He was sentenced to a year in confinement.

That conviction should have barred him from buying firearms, but instead, he was able to buy several, passing a background check each time. Federal law prohibits gun purchases by people who have been convicted of domestic violence, but the Air Force admitted on Monday that it had failed to report Mr. Kelley’s case to the federal databases used for such background checks. The Air Force said it was investigating whether other convictions had also been left unreported.

There were other signs of trouble for Mr. Kelley, who received a “bad conduct” discharge from the Air Force after finishing his sentence. In 2013, he was investigated by the Comal County Sheriff’s Office on a complaint of rape and sexual assault in New Braunfels, Tex., his hometown, but no charges were filed. A statement from the sheriff’s office said on Tuesday that the investigation had “stalled sometime in October 2013 for reasons yet to be determined.”

Mr. Kelley then moved to a recreational vehicle park in Colorado Springs, where four witnesses told the police that they had seen Mr. Kelley chase down his white-and-brown Siberian husky and punch the dog four or five times, yelling at it, before dragging it into his camper, according to a report from the sheriff’s office in El Paso County, Colo. Mr. Kelley was charged with animal cruelty, pleaded guilty and received a deferred sentence, records show.

Brent Moody, a neighbor who called the police, said in an interview that he and his wife moved out sooner than they would have liked because they were scared of Mr. Kelley. “In his eyes, he looked like there was intense anger,” Mr. Moody said. “Something didn’t seem right with him.”

Last Sunday morning, Mr. Kelley took a Ruger AR-556 assault rifle to the First Baptist Church and opened fire, killing 26 people and wounding at least 20 others. After a shootout outside the church with a bystander, in which he was hit twice, Mr. Kelley raced away in his car, chased by the bystander and another man, and soon crashed. He was found dead, having shot himself in the head.

Officials have said that the massacre may have stemmed from acrimony between Mr. Kelley and the family of his estranged second wife. His mother-in-law, who attended the church, was not there on Sunday, but his wife’s grandmother was among those killed.

But as they try to delve deeper into what might have motivated the rampage, investigators said, they have hit a roadblock: They have not been able to unlock the killer’s cellphone, reviving an issue that received national attention after another mass shooting two years ago.

“Unfortunately, at this point in time, we are unable to get into that phone,” Christopher H. Combs, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.’s San Antonio office, said. He refused to name the brand of the phone, saying that it would encourage other criminals to get the same kind.

After 14 people were shot to death in a conference room in San Bernardino, Calif., the F.B.I. was unable to unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the attackers.

“Obviously if things like this can happen in spite of the law then we need to look at that and try to fix it the best we can,” Mr. Cornyn told reporters, adding, “This is one of those areas of consensus on a very contentious topic.”

But on the other side of the Capitol, House Speaker Paul Ryan said no new legislation was needed. “The laws we have right now on the books say a person like this should not have gotten a gun,” Mr. Ryan said. “So this speaks to making sure that we actually enforce our laws that we have on the books.”

Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, were scheduled to visit Sutherland Springs on Wednesday. President Trump, on his Asian trip Tuesday, said that stricter gun laws would not have prevented the shooting. In fact, he said, they could have driven the death toll into the hundreds, since the gunman had been shot by an armed bystander.

Gun-control advocates said Mr. Kelley should not have had that kind of firepower in the first place. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, said that she had been monitoring mass shootings since the 1966 massacre at the University of Texas — and that she had never felt more dispirited.

“Never did I believe there would be children killed, babies killed, 6-year-olds killed,” Ms. Feinstein said.

While no one who knew Mr. Kelley said they believed was capable of such an atrocity, his troubles were not hidden.

Public school administrators in New Braunfels suspended him at least seven times. Mr. Kelley’s disciplinary record showed a variety of offenses, including insubordination, profanity, dishonesty and drugs.

His high school health records said that he had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and had a vision disorder. His academic record was lackluster, with a grade-point average of 2.32. He finished 260th in his class of 393.

Reid Mosis, a classmate from the sixth through ninth grades, said Mr. Kelley often griped about his parents and how they were insistent that he undergo drug treatments, apparently for emotional issues.

“He complained a lot about his parents and the medications he was taking,” he recalled. “He said that his parents were trying to fix him. But he didn’t say what for, specifically.”

Mr. Mosis noted that Mr. Kelley “got irritated easily and always seemed angry.”

Even the pastor of First Baptist, Frank Pomeroy, sensed trouble, according to Sheriff Joe Tackitt of Wilson County, which includes Sutherland Springs.

Mr. Pomeroy told the sheriff that Mr. Kelley had attended the church in the past, the sheriff said on Tuesday. Mr. Pomeroy “didn’t like the guy,” the sheriff said, but did not feel he could turn Mr. Kelley away.

Mr. Pomeroy was not at church on Sunday, but his 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle, was among those killed. The dead included at least a dozen children, the youngest 18 months old.

Joaquín Ramírez, a parishioner who was standing near Annabelle, recalled how Mr. Kelley, dressed in all black and wearing a skull-face mask, had methodically fired as he walked among the pews.

“You’re gonna die!” Mr. Kelley yelled out, followed by an expletive, Mr. Ramírez said.

His public school records released on Tuesday showed he had been suspended at least seven times, and a classmate said he had complained about medication he was taking.

Months after his escape from the psychiatric hospital, Mr. Kelley pleaded guilty in a military court to repeated assaults on his first wife and her son, a toddler, including one that left the boy with a fractured skull. He was sentenced to a year in confinement.

That conviction should have barred him from buying firearms, but instead, he was able to buy several, passing a background check each time. Federal law prohibits gun purchases by people who have been convicted of domestic violence, but the Air Force admitted on Monday that it had failed to report Mr. Kelley’s case to the federal databases used for such background checks. The Air Force said it was investigating whether other convictions had also been left unreported.

There were other signs of trouble for Mr. Kelley, who received a “bad conduct” discharge from the Air Force after finishing his sentence. In 2013, he was investigated by the Comal County Sheriff’s Office on a complaint of rape and sexual assault in New Braunfels, Tex., his hometown, but no charges were filed. A statement from the sheriff’s office said on Tuesday that the investigation had “stalled sometime in October 2013 for reasons yet to be determined.”

Mr. Kelley then moved to a recreational vehicle park in Colorado Springs, where four witnesses told the police that they had seen Mr. Kelley chase down his white-and-brown Siberian husky and punch the dog four or five times, yelling at it, before dragging it into his camper, according to a report from the sheriff’s office in El Paso County, Colo. Mr. Kelley was charged with animal cruelty, pleaded guilty and received a deferred sentence, records show.

Brent Moody, a neighbor who called the police, said in an interview that he and his wife moved out sooner than they would have liked because they were scared of Mr. Kelley. “In his eyes, he looked like there was intense anger,” Mr. Moody said. “Something didn’t seem right with him.”

Last Sunday morning, Mr. Kelley took a Ruger AR-556 assault rifle to the First Baptist Church and opened fire, killing 26 people and wounding at least 20 others. After a shootout outside the church with a bystander, in which he was hit twice, Mr. Kelley raced away in his car, chased by the bystander and another man, and soon crashed. He was found dead, having shot himself in the head.

Officials have said that the massacre may have stemmed from acrimony between Mr. Kelley and the family of his estranged second wife. His mother-in-law, who attended the church, was not there on Sunday, but his wife’s grandmother was among those killed.

But as they try to delve deeper into what might have motivated the rampage, investigators said, they have hit a roadblock: They have not been able to unlock the killer’s cellphone, reviving an issue that received national attention after another mass shooting two years ago.

“Unfortunately, at this point in time, we are unable to get into that phone,” Christopher H. Combs, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.’s San Antonio office, said. He refused to name the brand of the phone, saying that it would encourage other criminals to get the same kind.

After 14 people were shot to death in a conference room in San Bernardino, Calif., the F.B.I. was unable to unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the attackers. The bureau went to court to try to force Apple to build a software “back door” allowing law enforcement agencies to get into phones, but the company refused.

Before the issue could come to a head, the F.B.I. hired hackers who were able to unlock the phone.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Solvers are naturally curious when entries appear frequently or on the same day in different puzzles. Do constructors and editors really get together in secret, Oreo-fueled meetings to compare notes? Are repetitions committed deliberately, to send messages to puzzle solvers?

The answer is no, there aren’t enough Oreos in the world to make them do that. Any commonalities between puzzles, be they entries like OWIE or even an entire theme, are purely coincidental.

I bring this up because Damon Gulczynski, the constructor of today’s puzzle, explains in his notes below that a theme very similar to his own ran in The Wall Street Journal recently, and the truth is, these things happen all the time. It’s not because of laziness on the part of the constructor. More than one person can have the same great idea, and because editors work at different companies and don’t consult each other, sometimes identical entries or themes run close together.

Today’s puzzle by Mr. Gulczynski is a fresh, three dimensional take on an interesting topic.

The conversation we’re not having in this country is: How do we fund colleges and universities?”However the admissions process might evolve, it surely will continue to serve the interests of colleges first and foremost.","Whatever happens, age-old questions about fairness in admissions will surely endure. For one thing, the nation can’t come to terms with a tricky five-letter word: merit. Michael Young, a British sociologist, coined the pejorative term “meritocracy” over a half-century ago to describe a future in which standardized intelligence tests would crown a new elite. Yet as Rebecca Zwick explains in her new book “Who Gets In?” the meaning has shifted. The word “merit,” she writes, has come to mean “academic excellence, narrowly defined” as grades and test scores.

But that’s just one way to think of an applicant’s worthiness. Dr. Zwick, professor emeritus at the University of California at Santa Barbara, has long been a researcher at the Educational Testing Service, which develops and administers the SAT. She disputes the notion that testing prowess — or any other attribute, for that matter — entitles a student to a spot at his chosen college. “There is, in fact, no absolute definition of merit,” she writes.

That brings us to you, the anxious applicant, the frazzled parent, the confused citizen, all wondering what colleges want. It’s worth taking a deep breath and noting that only 13 percent of four-year colleges accept fewer than half of their applicants. That said, colleges where seats are scarce stir up the nation’s emotions. Each year, the world-famous institutions reject thousands and thousands of students who could thrive there.

Yes, rejection stings. But say these words aloud: The admissions process isn’t fair. Like it or not, colleges aren’t looking to reel in the greatest number of straight-A students who’ve taken seven or more Advanced Placement courses. A rejection isn’t really about you; it’s about a maddening mishmash of competing objectives.

Just as parents give teenagers a set of chores, colleges hand their admissions leaders a list of things to accomplish. When they fail, they often get fired.

“We don’t live in a cloud — the reality is, there’s a bottom line,” said Angel B. Pérez, vice president for enrollment and student success at Trinity College, in Hartford. “We’re an institution, but we’re also a business.”

On many campuses, financial concerns affect decisions about whom to admit. A recent report by the National Association for College Admission Counseling found that about half of institutions said an applicant’s “ability to pay” was of at least “some importance” in admissions decisions. Among other targets is geographic diversity, which is now seen as an indicator of institutional strength and popularity. (Some presidents have been known to gripe if the freshman class doesn’t represent all 50 states.) A campus might also need a particular number of engineering majors or goalies.

Indeed, a college could accept 33 percent of all applicants, but that doesn’t mean each applicant has a one-in-three chance. Success depends on what a student brings to the table.

Generally, nothing carries more weight in admissions than grades (plus strength of the high school curriculum) and ACT/SAT scores. With limited time and resources, those metrics offer a relatively quick way to predict who will succeed. But the measures have drawbacks. Grade inflation has complicated the task of evaluating achievements, and so has the variance in high school grading policies. Standardized test scores correlate with family income; white and Asian-American students fare better than black and Hispanic students do. Also, when colleges talk about predicting “success,” they usually mean first-year grades — a limited definition.

And so, many colleges rely on “holistic” evaluations, allowing colleges to contextualize applicants’ academic records and to identify disadvantaged students who might lack the sparkling credentials of their affluent peers. Did they attend low-performing high schools or well-resourced ones? Did they participate in extracurricular activities? Do they have leadership experience?

What colleges look for sends a powerful message about what matters, not just to admissions officers but in life, and students often respond accordingly.

Dr. Pérez, a first-generation college student who grew up in a low-income family, recently revamped Trinity’s process to better identify promising students, particularly the disadvantaged. While reading applications, its admissions officers now look for evidence of 13 characteristics — including curiosity, empathy, openness to change and ability to overcome adversity — that researchers associate with successful students. These are also qualities that the liberal-arts college values, inside and outside the classroom.

Trinity’s officers can check as many qualities as apply using a drop-down box labeled “Predictors of Success.” They must note where they saw evidence of each quality in the application. “It can’t be just a hint,” Dr. Pérez said. He recalls a teacher recommendation describing how an applicant had taken a stand on a controversial social issue in class, even though other students vocally disagreed with him. Impressed, Dr. Pérez checked the box for “Comfort in Minority of 1,” a sign, perhaps, that the student would contribute to campus dialogues. Also on the drop-down: “Delayed Gratification” and “Risk Taking.”

While Trinity still values conventional measures, the new model has expanded the staff’s understanding of merit. “We’re trying to give students more credit for these characteristics, especially those who’ve had some challenges,” Dr. Pérez said. The new approach, along with the college’s recent decision to stop requiring ACT/SAT scores, has helped it diversify its classes. Low-income and first-generation students represent 15 percent of this fall’s freshman class, up from 8 percent three years ago.

“I’m trying to increase the tools we have, and get beyond a system that is absolutely antiquated,” Dr. Pérez said. “As the country becomes more diverse, as we learn more about the correlation between standardized test scores and wealth, we have to be a lot more creative in predicting for success in college.”

What most colleges ask for from applicants doesn’t reveal much about the many skills and talents a student might possess. But what if colleges asked for more?

The admissions process at Olin College of Engineering includes a live audition. After completing a traditional application, selected students visit the campus, in Needham, Mass., for an intense two-day tryout. In addition to sitting for interviews, they work in small groups to complete a tabletop design challenge, such as building a tower that can hold a specific weight. On the second day, they are given another task, like designing a campus building. This time, evaluators observe each student, noting how well they communicate with others and adapt on the fly.

The experience is meant to help prospective students understand Olin’s collaborative culture, while giving the college a better glimpse of each applicant before finalizing acceptance. “It’s hard to nail down a student’s mind-set from the traditional elements of the application,” said Emily Roper-Doten, the dean of admission and financial aid. “This allows us to see them in motion, in an educational moment.”

A desire to see what students can do with their hands inspired a recent change at one of the world’s most renowned campuses. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (motto: “Mens et manus,” Latin for “Mind and hand”) now gives applicants the option of submitting a Maker Portfolio to show their “technical creativity.”

Applicants can send images, a short video and a PDF that shed light on a project they’ve undertaken — clothing they’ve made, apps they’ve designed, cakes they’ve baked, furniture they’ve built, chain mail they’ve woven. M.I.T. also asks students to explain what the project meant to them, as well as how much help they got. A panel of faculty members and alumni reviews the portfolios.

Last year, about 5 percent of applicants submitted a Makers Portfolio. “It gives us a fuller picture of the student,” said Stuart Schmill, dean of admissions and student financial services. “Without this, some applicants might not be able to fully get across how good a fit they are for us.”

M.I.T.’s experiment has sparked discussions among admissions deans, some of whom say they plan to offer similar opportunities for applicants to send evidence of project-based learning. They describe the Makers Portfolio as an intriguing glimpse of how a college might better align its process with its culture and values. The catch: Reviewing all those portfolios takes time, something admissions offices lack. Even a small college like Olin, which welcomed fewer than 100 new students this fall, must scramble to pull off its elaborate evaluations. Larger campuses couldn’t even consider such an approach.

Thorough review has become more challenging over the last decade, with waves of applicants overwhelming big-name colleges, victims of their own popularity. The University of California at Los Angeles received more than 100,000 applications for about 6,000 spots this fall. Stanford got 44,000 for just over 1,700 spots, and M.I.T. juggled more than 20,000 for 1,450 seats.

Most colleges are considering more incremental ways to enhance evaluations. The Coalition for Access, Affordability and Success, with more than 130 prominent campuses as members, recently established an application platform with a feature called a virtual college locker, a private space where students can upload materials, such as videos and written work, that they could later add to their applications. Among its stated goals: to make admissions more personal.

So far, most of its members aren’t asking applicants to send anything different than before. But that could change. A handful of colleges are planning experiments using alternative ways to measure student potential. One hopes to enable applicants to demonstrate their “emotional intelligence,” or E.Q., to showcase their ability to work with others, according to Annie Reznik, the coalition’s executive director. Another seeks a way for prospective students to display their “fire” for learning.

“We want better inputs,” said Jeremiah Quinlan, dean of undergraduate admissions and financial aid at Yale. “The inputs we have predict success academically. Now, we have the ability to get to know a student better, from a different type of submission.”

Like many deans, Mr. Quinlan has grown wary of polished personal essays in which applicants describe their achievements. “They feel like they have to show off, because we’re so selective,” he said, “and it’s completely understandable.” Technology, he believes, can help colleges get to know the student beneath the surface of a résumé, to gain a better sense of their passions, the kind of community member the applicant might be.

Last year, Yale allowed students using the coalition’s application to submit a document, image, audio file or video in response to a prompt (they also had to reflect, in 250 words or less, on their submission). When Justin Aubin heard about that option last fall, he thought, “Cool!”

Mr. Aubin, from Oak Lawn, Ill., was then a high school senior hoping to attend Yale. The following prompt caught his eye: “A community to which you belong and the footprint you have left.” He submitted a short video documenting his Eagle Scout project, for which he oversaw the construction of a monument honoring veterans. Even a well-written essay, he figured, couldn’t capture his experience as well as four minutes of footage, shot by his older brother.

The content of the video impressed Yale’s admissions committee. “People sat up in their chairs,” Mr. Quinlan said. “You could see how he handled his leadership role, and we felt like we got a good sense of him in a way that we didn’t get from recommendations.”

Mr. Aubin is now a freshman at Yale.

Did the video tip the scales? “That was a difference-maker,” Mr. Quinlan said.

•

Even as colleges consider innovation, it’s worth asking which fixtures of the admissions process, if any, they are willing to discard. Some prevalent practices seem to stand in the way of meaningful change.

Giving an advantage to the sons and daughters of alumni is one such practice. Some colleges admit legacies (and the children of potential donors) at a much greater rate than non-legacies. Legacies make up nearly a third of Harvard’s current freshman class, The Harvard Crimson has reported. Princeton’s class of 2021 is 13 percent legacy, according to the university’s website.

While a handful of prominent institutions, including the University of Georgia and Texas A&M University, stopped considering legacy status more than a decade ago, most colleges seem unlikely to remove that variable from the admissions equation anytime soon. “I don’t think an applicant’s legacy status is a crazy thing to look at, especially in the financial climate some colleges are in,” said Rick Clark, director of undergraduate admission at Georgia Tech, where nearly a fifth of freshmen are legacies. “Colleges have to think about their longevity.”

The benefits of legacies go beyond maintaining good will with alumni who might open their wallets, Mr. Clark said. In his experience, they tend to be enthusiastic students who help foster community on campus, the kind of relationships that help other students feel at home and succeed. “Multigenerational ties to a place add value, creating this passionate, magnetic source of energy,” he said.

The key, Mr. Clark believes, is not to lower standards, or to enroll so many legacies that other priorities, such as increasing racial and socioeconomic diversity, suffer as a result. “Those two goals aren’t mutually exclusive,” he said.

Other measurements used by selective colleges have nothing to do with a student’s accomplishments or attributes — and everything to do with a college’s agenda.

About one in five institutions allot “considerable importance” to “demonstrated interest,” the degree to which applicants convey their desire to enroll if accepted, according to a survey by the National Association for College Admission Counseling. The strongest expression of demonstrated interest is applying for binding early decision, a policy that favors affluent students who don’t need to compare financial aid offers and one that some colleges use to fill half their seats.

Beyond that, technology has made it easier to track the number of times an applicant engages with a college (by visiting the campus, contacting an admissions officer, responding to an email). This valuable information helps officers gauge who’s most likely to enroll, which can influence who gets admitted in the first place. A higher “yield,” the percentage of accepted students who actually enroll, is widely seen as a measure of status.

The problem is that savvy students who know colleges are watching them can tilt the odds in their favor, said Nancy Leopold, executive director of CollegeTracks, a Maryland nonprofit group that helps low-income and first-generation students get into college: “Demonstrated interest is biased against kids who don’t know the game exists, or who don’t have the time or money to play it.”

What do colleges really cherish? The answer is influenced greatly by the entities they seek to impress. U.S. News & World Report and other college guides, not to mention bond-rating agencies, rely heavily on conventional admissions metrics like ACT/SAT scores and acceptance rates to evaluate institutions. A college president might wish to attract more creative thinkers, but accomplishing that goal won’t help his college’s ranking.

Generally, colleges are risk-averse. Rocking the boat with a newfangled admissions process could hurt their reputations. “The challenge for many admissions offices is to make a change, but not so much change or innovation that you’re risking the position you’re in,” said Ms. Roper-Doten of Olin. Asking students to do more could scare off would-be applicants.

“Colleges seek validation,” said Lloyd Thacker, executive director of the Education Conservancy, a nonprofit group that has sought to reform college admissions. “Without a real external incentive for colleges to care about broadening their understanding of what makes an applicant promising, they don’t seem likely to change the definition on their own.”

A recent campaign called “Turning the Tide,” a project of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, is urging admissions deans to rethink the qualities they consider in applicants. In a report signed by representatives of about 200 campuses, colleges are asked to promote ethical character and service to others through the admissions process.

Although some deans say they have no business assessing the character of still-maturing teenagers, the push has prompted a handful of institutions to tweak their applications. The University of North Carolina now emphasizes contributions to others when asking about extracurricular activities. M.I.T. added an essay question asking students to describe how they’ve helped people.

Richard Weissbourd, a senior lecturer at Harvard, who leads the initiative, recommends that colleges define service in ways that might resonate with disadvantaged students. “Many students don’t have opportunities to do community service,” he said. “They’re taking care of their siblings, or they’re working part-time jobs to help their families. Colleges need to say, ‘That matters to us.’ ”

•

In the end, increasing racial and socioeconomic diversity in higher education is a matter of will. A college can prioritize it or not, said Shaun R. Harper, a professor at the University of Southern California’s Rossier School of Education who studies race and student success.

In September, Dr. Harper gave a keynote speech at the annual conference of the National Association for College Admission Counseling, in Boston. He urged his audience to think hard about racial inequality and “things you perhaps inadvertently and unknowingly do to support it.”

He cited as examples high school counselors who discourage promising minority students from applying to highly selective colleges; college leaders who say they “just can’t find enough” qualified black applicants even as their athletics coaches comb the nation for black students who excel at sports; admissions officers who recruit at the same high schools year after year, overlooking those full of underrepresented minorities.

As Dr. Harper spoke, many listeners applauded; a few scowled. He concluded his remarks by criticizing the lack of racial diversity among admissions deans themselves. He received a standing ovation.

In a subsequent interview, Dr. Harper elaborated on his concerns. “When the demographics of the profession have not changed, particularly at the senior level,” he said, “I don’t know that we can expect a major change, especially in terms of diversifying the class.”

Although Dr. Harper believes colleges rely too heavily on ACT/SAT scores, he says that the major barriers arise well before the application process even begins. Colleges, he said, must do more in terms of outreach to encourage underrepresented students to apply.

Dr. Pérez, at Trinity, has similar concerns. Although he is convinced that the selection process can be successfully revamped, he doesn’t think that will solve the No. 1 problem he sees in admissions. “The problem is money,” he said. “If I had more funding, my class would be more diverse. The conversation we’re not having in this country is: How do we fund colleges and universities?”

However the admissions process might evolve, it surely will continue to serve the interests of colleges first and foremost. Even if someone invents a better, more equitable way to gauge applicants’ potential, a college’s many wants and needs wouldn’t change. Deans would still seek to balance their classes by enrolling a diverse mix of majors from many states and countries. Colleges would still need enough oboe players and theater-arts majors.

“What compels institutions to change is deep discontent,” said Marie Bigham, director of college counseling at Isidore Newman School, in New Orleans. “If they’re only making changes on the margins, it indicates that they’re mostly content with the way things are.”

That leads to a big question in an age of widening social inequality. How unhappy are the wealthiest colleges, really, with the status quo? Some of the nation’s most selective institutions enroll more students from the top 1 percent of the income ladder than from the bottom 60 percent. Is that simply because of lack of preparation in the K-12 system? Flaws within the selection process? Or is it evidence, as Dr. Harper suggests, of a systemic lack of will to change those numbers?

Jon Boeckenstedt, associate vice president for enrollment management and marketing at DePaul University, says that it is the high-profile colleges that have the power to redefine the admissions process.

“Unless and until something changes at the top, nothing else is going to change,” he said. “That’s because, at a lot of colleges, people will go to their graves trying to imitate the Ivy League.”",What Colleges Want in an Applicant (Everything),https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/education/edlife/what-college-admissions-wants.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

According to his account, his parents were killed in an auto accident when he was 3 or 4, and for the next 10 years he was raised in a German Lutheran orphanage. Then, he said, with $3.26 in his pocket, he fended for himself.

After completing high school he attended Marquette University in Milwaukee for two years, then enlisted in the Army in 1940 when he was 19 to avail himself of the proverbial “three hots and a cot” — a place to eat and sleep. After basic training, he was sent to Canada for instruction in explosives.

According to his account, he had a run-in with a senior officer there who extracted revenge by putting him on a plane to Britain without notice. By the time the authorities there realized he was not Canadian, and before the United States Army learned he was missing, he had parachuted into occupied France to apply his skills as a demolition expert and a speaker of German.

“If they catch you they’re going to kill you for being Jewish,” an officer warned him, Mr. Refkin recalled in an interview for the strategic services society this year.

“If they catch me for being a spy, is it going to be any easier?” he asked.

When the officer replied no, Mr. Refkin said, he delivered a typically practical response.

“One way or another,” he said, “I can’t let them catch me.”

He said he carried out three successful missions for the British. Once the United States entered the war he performed special assignments for the Americans, according to the society.

On one, he was ordered to retrieve a confidential file from what turned out to be a cabinet secured by a combination lock. When he could not open it, he came back with the entire cabinet — then was ordered to return it so the Germans wouldn’t discover that the secret file was missing.

On another occasion, he recalled, he was having drinks with a Wehrmacht colonel in a Paris hotel when a Gestapo officer asked for their identification. The colonel expressed such indignation that the frazzled Gestapo officer stalked off, and Mr. Refkin sardonically declared, “These young Gestapo guys don’t even check papers well anymore.”

In contrast to its successor agencies, Mr. Refkin said, the O.S.S. encouraged its field agents improvise as needed.

“They told you what they wanted to get done,” he said, “but they didn’t tell you how to do it.”

In addition to his exploits as a spy, in his regularly assigned role as an airplane inspector he developed a device for administering oxygen to patients.

After the war, he married Anna Bruno. She died in 1990. The couple lived in Southern California, where Mr. Refkin owned a ship repair company and other businesses.

He is survived by three children, Allen and Charles Refkin and Michele Refkin-Holtz; four grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.

“I grew up knowing I had nothing, I deserved nothing, and I did something pretty worthwhile,” he said of his wartime service, which fewer and fewer of his colleagues are left to recall firsthand.

“Machine learning is being thrown at so many problems in robotics,” said Robert Howe, a professor of robotics at Harvard University.
“It is obvious that this is what you need to build flexible, agile robotics,” said Geoff Hinton, a pioneer of machine learning.","“We now have teachable robots,” Mr. Abbeel said during a recent interview at the new company’s offices in Emeryville, Calif., just across the bay from San Francisco.

The new company is part of a much wider effort to create A.I. that allows robots to learn. Researchers in places like Google, Brown University, and Carnegie Mellon are doing similar work, as are existing start-ups like Micropsi and Prowler.io.

Robots already automate some work inside factories and warehouses, such as moving boxes from place to place at Amazon’s massive distribution centers. But companies must program these machines for each particular task, limiting their possible applications. The hope is that robots can master a much wider array of tasks by learning on their own.

“Today, every motion that an industrial robot makes is specified down to the millimeter,” said Sunil Dhaliwal, the Amplify founder who led the firm’s investment in Embodied Intelligence. “But most real problems can’t be solved that way. You have to be able not just to tell the robot what to do, but to tell it how to learn.”

Mr. Abbeel and the other founders of Embodied Intelligence, including the former OpenAI researchers Peter Chen and Rocky Duan and the former Microsoft researcher Tianhao Zhang, specialize in an algorithmic method called reinforcement learning — a way for machines to learn tasks by extreme trial and error.

Researchers at DeepMind, the London-based A.I. lab owned by Google, used this method to build a machine that could play the ancient game of Go better than any human. In essence, the machine learned to master this enormously complex game by playing against itself — over and over and over again.

Other researchers, across both industry and academia, have shown that similar algorithms allow robots to learn physical tasks as well. By repeatedly trying to open a door, for instance, a robot can learn which particular movements bring success and which don’t.

Much like Google and labs at Brown and Northeastern University, Embodied Intelligence is also augmenting these methods with a wide range of other machine learning techniques. Most notably, the start-up is exploring what is called imitation learning, a way for machines to learn discrete tasks from human demonstrations.

The company is using this method to teach a two-armed robot to pick up plastic pipes from a table. Donning virtual reality headsets and holding motion trackers in their hands, Mr. Abbeel and his colleagues will repeatedly demonstrate the task in a digital world that recreates what is in front of a robot. Then the machine can then learn from this digital data.

“We collect data on what the human is doing,” Mr. Chen said. “Then we can train the machine to imitate the human.”

These and similar machine learning methods have only begun to bear fruit over the past few years, but many believe they will overhaul the field of robotics. It is telling that OpenAI, a pure research lab that opened its doors less than two years ago, has now lost two big names to more commercial pursuits.

Poached away from OpenAI by Mr. Musk himself, the machine learning expert Andrej Karpathy is now the director of A.I. at Tesla, working to help autonomous cars get smarter faster. And Mr. Abbeel is launching Embodied Intelligence. “Andrej is stepping out of the research mode and saying: ‘I want to do this in practice,’” Mr. Abbeel explained. “That same thing goes for us.”

He said he believed his new start-up can rapidly push its methods into manufacturing operations like the auto industry. Although robotics already handle many tasks inside such factories, there are many others they can’t yet master. That is what Embodied Intelligence hopes to change.

Some researchers question how much these machine learning techniques will ultimately improve robotics, believing they are overhyped among both researchers and the news media. “Machine learning is being thrown at so many problems in robotics,” said Robert Howe, a professor of robotics at Harvard University. “And it produces just enough results that people can trumpet it.”

With Brexit now the key dividing line in British politics, he said, management of a cabinet has become “close to impossible.”

Having already lost her defense secretary, Michael Fallon, and with two other ministers under threat in the sleaze allegations, Mrs. May has declared Ms. Patel’s case closed. And on Tuesday, Mr. Johnson brushed aside calls for his resignation.

Ms. Patel held the meetings in Israel without telling the Foreign Office, a clear breach of protocol. The appointments were set up with the help of Stuart Polak, the honorary president of the Conservative Friends of Israel, a lobbying organization.

Ms. Patel also asked officials from her department to examine whether public money could support humanitarian operations by the Israeli Defense Forces in parts of the Golan Heights. As she ought to have predicted, the answer was no, because Britain regards the Golan Heights as occupied territory.

In addition, Ms. Patel was forced to issue an embarrassing clarification, walking back the false impression she gave The Guardian that Mr. Johnson was aware of her meetings in advance.

The foreign secretary has problems of his own over comments he made when speaking to a parliamentary committee late last month about a British citizen of Iranian descent, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is imprisoned in Iran. Mr. Johnson described her conviction for sedition as a mockery of justice but also said she had been “simply teaching people journalism.”

Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year prison term on charges of seeking to overthrow the government, claims her supporters have called absurd. Days after Mr. Johnson’s comments, she was taken to a new court hearing, where the minister’s statement was cited as evidence that she had been engaged in “propaganda against the regime,” a serious offense.

On Tuesday Mr. Johnson said that in a phone conversation with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, he had expressed concern that his words had been used against Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, but was told that was not the case.

“I accept that my remarks could have been clearer,” Mr. Johnson said. But he declined to apologize and he called on critics to direct their ire at Iran instead.

That failed to satisfy opposition lawmakers, including Ben Bradshaw, who said that if Britain “had a prime minister who wasn’t so weak,” both of the cabinet ministers “would have been sacked.”

The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, told lawmakers that she hoped that “no lasting damage has been done to Nazarin as a result of his blunder.”

Mr. Johnson was always a controversial choice of foreign secretary, having before his appointment suggested that President Barack Obama had an “ancestral dislike of the British Empire,” written a poem insinuating that Turkey’s president had sexual relations with a goat and likened the European Union to the Third Reich.

Ms. Patel’s appointment raised eyebrows, too, because she told The Daily Telegraph in 2013 that the department she now runs should be scrapped and replaced with a trade-focused body to help businesses invest in the developing world.

Yet, Mr. Johnson and Ms. Patel were leading campaigners for Brexit in the referendum, and Mrs. May therefore found them cabinet jobs — a big one in the case of Mr. Johnson, one of the public faces of the campaign to leave the European Union.

The resignation from the defense post by Mr. Fallon, a “remain” supporter in the referendum, seems to have been prompted in part by complaints from a Brexit-enthusiast, Andrea Leadsom, who is the leader of the House of Commons.

When Mr. Fallon stood down last week, the internal balance of the cabinet meant that he had to be replaced by someone who — like him — was loyal to Mrs. May and who had campaigned for remain during the referendum. Mrs. May opted to promote the chief whip, Gavin Williamson, a decision that provoked fierce complaints that such a senior position had gone to someone with no experience of a big government department or knowledge of the military.

Perhaps the only consolation for Mrs. May is that, at a time when her leadership is under continual threat, several potential successors are — for now at least — out of the picture. Mr. Fallon had been talked of a potential caretaker leader, while Mr. Johnson’s latest misstep error has focused attention on his competence.

On Tuesday one lawmaker, Anna Soubry, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Johnson’s “lack of contrition is as shameful as the original error” over Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe. She said, “Boris Johnson doesn’t understand magnitude of the job & responsibility he holds.”

MONDAY PUZZLE — The crossword editor Will Shortz has called this period of time the “golden age of puzzles,” which makes it especially funny to me that a crossword puzzle then goes ahead and declares six of its own ages. It’s very meta, to use a colloquialism, and a decent start to our solving week.

Today’s Theme

Timothy Polin offers us a theme set of six words that all end in -AGE, and separates the suffix from the base word to make a new AGE, as it were. Mr. Polin manages to pack a lot of theme material comfortably within his grid.

For example, at 39A, the word BONDAGE is split into BOND AGE and clued as “Period known for its 007 movies?” Similarly, at 50A, the word COVERAGE is split into COVER AGE and clued as “Period when tribute bands thrived?” because tribute bands play covers of songs.

I liked this set, although the top entry, 17A’s ANCHORAGE, stood out to me as a place name in a set of nonplace name words.

Does it mean that Democrats can wrest one chamber of Congress from Republican control in 2018? Impossible to say. Politically speaking, there are eons between now and then, and the Virginia governor’s race had facets all its own. But there are reasons for Republicans to be very afraid.

One is that Northam outperformed Clinton without being a particularly energetic, forceful candidate. Through Tuesday morning and afternoon, I heard from pessimistic Democrats who were already ruing the fact that he’d been the party’s nominee. Couldn’t they have found someone with more fire? Someone smoother? In the race’s final days, he flip-flopped on sanctuary cities and made other blunders that cast him as unsteady and uncertain. Didn’t matter. He prevailed, handily.

Republicans should also worry that they’ve oversold themselves on the moderate-progressive divide in the Democratic Party and how severely Democrats would be hobbled by it. In the days leading up to Tuesday, a book by Donna Brazile, the former head of the Democratic National Committee, reignited the enmity between Clinton’s backers and supporters of Bernie Sanders, and that became one of several reasons to wonder if progressives would fail to turn out for Northam, a milquetoast moderate. In the end, enough of them did, not just to guarantee his victory but to jeopardize Virginia Republicans’ 66-to-34 majority in the state’s House of Delegates. On Wednesday morning, unofficial returns showed that Democrats would pick up at least 14 seats, and they could, after recounts, even wind up with control of the House.

“If the Virginia results showed anything, it’s that ideological purity isn’t necessary to win in the Age of Trump,” Lis Smith, a Democratic operative who worked for McAuliffe, told me Tuesday night. “Northam came out as a two-time George W. Bush voter, and he failed some key liberal litmus tests. Still he won.”

In rooting for a Gillespie victory, the G.O.P. was looking for something larger: an assurance that a Republican in a swing state or swing district could find the right recipe for energizing Trump supporters without alienating Trump skeptics. Gillespie’s answer was to keep Trump at arm’s length physically but not spiritually. So while he never — not once — had Trump stump for him in Virginia, he parroted the president’s tough talk about criminals and immigrants and denounced professional football players who didn’t stand for the national anthem.

Trump didn’t cry foul during the campaign, but he did on Twitter on Tuesday night, griping that Gillespie “worked hard but did not embrace me” and showing again that he’s all too content to spar publicly with lawmakers and candidates in his own party. Republicans should be afraid for that reason as well.

Beyond the returns, this was a governor’s race that made the skin crawl, which is to say that it was a sufficiently accurate mirror and microcosm of American political culture in the Age of Trump. Partisan groups and panicked candidates trafficked in overblown fears, appealed to the worst in voters and debased themselves in pursuit of their prize — reasoning, I suppose, that dignity could be recovered on the far side of brutal victory. I’m not sure that’s ever wholly true.

And I’m not drawing any equivalence. Northam didn’t sell out his principles nearly as thoroughly as Gillespie did, and Democrats didn’t sink to Republicans’ level. In fact one of the most audacious tricks that Republicans sought to pull off was ginning up as much outrage over a loathsome Latino Victory Fund ad that ran on television just a handful of times — it showed a truck with a Confederate flag hunting down children of color — as there was over viciously negative commercials of Gillespie’s that blanketed the airwaves. These attacks essentially branded Northam, a mild-mannered pediatrician who served in the Army, as some unhinged leftie eager to give guns to pedophiles.

Gillespie’s campaign “has not been just a dog whistle to the intolerant, racially resentful parts of the Republican base; it’s been a mating call,” wrote The Washington Post in a blistering — and wholly warranted — editorial that noted what many other observers were also fascinated by: how radically Trump’s ascendance and omnipresence changed the way Gillespie comported himself, a transformation with dark implications for the G.O.P. and scary ones for America.

Before this race, Gillespie was as establishment as an establishment Republican could be, aligned closely with George W. Bush, who has made his distaste for Trump’s floridly divisive politics clear. He typified a coolheaded, practical approach to politics. He was more tradesman than ideologue.

Until the last few months. The impression he left on voters was an ugly one, and he and the G.O.P. have nothing to show for it. That should scare Republicans most of all.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.
The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said.
Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq.
“One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.","A serpentine river gently cuts through a mountain plateau. Shepherds tend their flock while young men hunt wild game, fish along ancient tributaries or kayak over rapids. This pleated landscape of rolling hills and jagged mountains is most verdant in spring, when the junipers are full, the grass a vibrant emerald.

These quiet moments and images are not often associated with Iraq. But the Kurdish region, in the country’s northern reaches, is home to such reprieves. Beyond the oil fields of Taqtaq and Kirkuk, far east of Mosul and many miles north of Baghdad, the semiautonomous region often feels timeless and progressive, restive and at peace.

What the Vietnamese photographer Lam Duc-Hien first imagined of Iraq before traveling there on assignment were the usual media tropes from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq — tanks and violence, surges and refugees. Mr. Lam, who was working for nongovernment organizations and a French newspaper, said he had never heard of the Kurdish people, who by then were fleeing Saddam’s oppressive and violent Baath Party. But after he settled down in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a region he documented for more than two decades, he found the country to be vastly different than what he had expected.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.

Over the years he has lived and worked there, he often traveled with the peshmerga, the Kurdish military, while on duty and off. “When I spend time with them, we always go to the mountains,” he said. “For me, it is like coming back to the 19th-century, because we are fishing with Kalashnikovs. For me, it’s incredible.”

Often referred to as a people without a country, the Kurds have for many years sought refuge in the mountains that abut Turkey and Iran. “I focused specifically on different ethnic groups and different religions in Kurdistan,” he said. “It’s small place, but it is very diverse.”

The robust culture of daily Kurdish life is captured in Mr. Lam’s photographs, a collection that stretches from the 1990s through to the war against the Islamic State. The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said. “I spend more time with them than taking pictures of them.”

A child leans in for a kiss from his little companion beneath a tree in the village of Badawan; a group of women in traditional Kurdish dresses dance atop a mountain plateau; families gather on the first day of Eid al-Adha to break the Ramadan feast at the grave of a loved one. “Each time I get back here,” Mr. Lam said, “I feel like I have a link with the people.”

Photo

Though Mr. Lam’s images sometimes show refugees and internally-displaced persons living in camps within the Kurdish region, he often shied away from the violence that has wracked the region and nearly divided the country, choosing instead to focus on the vitality of the people, not their blemishes.

Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq. He has heard whispers of secession since 1991. “One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.

But that dream has become a nightmare for many following an independence referendum in September. Disputed areas controlled by Kurdish forces were reclaimed by the Iraqi army. Flights were suspended to and from the region. A number of Kurds have since been killed or maimed in clashes with federal forces.

Photo

The recent infighting reminded Mr. Lam of a time when, during travels in the areas outside the Kurdish region, he lost that sense of fellowship — and safety — he had felt among the Kurdish people. After two bombs exploded in Baghdad’s Sadr City in 2013, with corpses littering the streets as he worked, Mr. Lam reluctantly fled the country.

“When you get involved with the Kurdish soul or friendship,” Mr. Lam said, “it’s very difficult to get out.”

He returned to Erbil soon after.

“I wish him nothing but the best success,” Mr. Gillespie said.
A native of Virginia’s rural Eastern Shore, Mr. Northam, 58, was perhaps an unlikely vessel for the resistance-era Democratic Party.
In his concession speech, Mr. Gillespie made no mention of Mr. Trump, and declined to answer questions about the president’s criticism on Tuesday night.
But Virginia Democrats were in little mood to offer any olive branches to Mr. Trump on Tuesday.","“Virginia has told us to end the divisiveness, that we will not condone hatred and bigotry — and to end the politics that have torn this country apart,” he said, adding that in this state, “It’s going to take a doctor to heal our differences.”

The Democrats’ electoral validation, though, took place well beyond the Virginia governor’s race: They wrested the governorship of New Jersey away from Republicans, swept two other statewide offices in Virginia, made gains in the Virginia State Legislature, and won a contested mayoral race in New Hampshire.

In New Jersey, Philip D. Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive, won the governorship, according to The Associated Press, by a vast margin that brought an unceremonious end to Gov. Chris Christie’s tumultuous tenure.

In both Virginia and New Jersey, voters rebuffed a wave of provocative ads linking immigration and crime, hinting at the limitations of hard-edge tactics in the sort of affluent and heavily suburban states that are pivotal in next year’s midterm elections.

Even though Republicans in the two states mirrored Mr. Trump’s grievance-oriented politics, they kept him at arm’s length: He became the first president not to appear on behalf of candidates for governor in either state since 2001, when George W. Bush shunned the trail after the Sept. 11 attacks.

Since then, four of the five governors Virginia has elected have been Democrats. The party was also in contention late Tuesday to seize control of the state House of Delegates, an unexpected show of strength that, along with Mr. Northam’s victory, offered Democrats a stronger hand to block any Republican attempts at gerrymandering after the next census.

Representative Scott Taylor, a Republican from Virginia Beach, said he considered the Democratic sweep in Virginia a repudiation of the White House. He faulted Mr. Trump’s “divisive rhetoric” for propelling the party to defeat, and said he believed traditionally Republican-leaning voters contributed to Mr. Northam’s margin of victory.

“I do believe that this is a referendum on this administration,” Mr. Taylor said of the elections. “Democrats turned out tonight, but I’m pretty sure there were some Republicans who spoke loudly and clearly tonight as well.”

Channeling the shock of Republicans across the state, Mr. Taylor voiced disbelief at the party’s rout down ballot. “I know folks that lost tonight who were going against candidates I’d never even heard of,” he said.

Mr. Trump was quick to fault Mr. Gillespie for keeping his distance, writing on Twitter while traveling in South Korea that the Republican candidate “did not embrace me or what I stand for.”

Mr. Gillespie made no mention of Mr. Trump in his concession speech, and alluded only in passing to the explosive themes he wielded as a candidate. Ticking off issues he campaigned on, Mr. Gillespie noted his supporters were worried about “safety for themselves and their families and their businesses.”

Addressing supporters in a hotel ballroom, Mr. Gillespie tried to tack a courteous finale on to a rough-and-tumble race, offering his assistance to Mr. Northam going forward. “I wish him nothing but the best success,” Mr. Gillespie said.

Mr. Northam’s victory was a tonic to an anxious national party that has been reeling since Mr. Trump’s win last year and was demoralized by losses in special House elections in Montana and Georgia.

A native of Virginia’s rural Eastern Shore, Mr. Northam, 58, was perhaps an unlikely vessel for the resistance-era Democratic Party. But the left overlooked the two votes he cast for George W. Bush before he entered politics, and his résumé — he is a pediatric neurologist and Gulf War veteran — proved far more appealing to the state’s broad middle than Mr. Gillespie’s background as a corporate lobbyist.

The Democrats’ success here came as Mr. Gillespie, trailing in the polls, turned to a scorched-earth campaign against Mr. Northam in the race’s final weeks. Mr. Gillespie, a fixture of his party’s establishment who had once warned against the “siren song” of anti-immigrant politics, unleashed a multimillion-dollar onslaught linking his rival to a gang with Central American ties and a convicted pedophile who had his rights restored, while also assailing Mr. Northam for wanting to remove Virginia’s Confederate statues.

The strategy appeared to help Mr. Gillespie narrow the gap in the wake of the Charlottesville protests this summer, but it was not enough to overcome the anti-Trump energy in an increasingly diverse state that has not elected a Republican to statewide office since 2009.

Mr. Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman, found it difficult to balance appeals to the president’s unflagging supporters in rural Virginia while simultaneously attempting to win over Mr. Trump’s skeptics in the state’s population centers. He often would not say the president’s name, referring instead to “the administration” or last year’s Republican “ticket.”

In his concession speech, Mr. Gillespie made no mention of Mr. Trump, and declined to answer questions about the president’s criticism on Tuesday night.

Mr. Northam did not have to concern himself with any such political contortions running in a state that has backed the Democratic nominee for president in the last three elections, a striking reversal from an earlier day here when Virginia Democrats had to distinguish themselves from their more liberal national party.

Indeed, support for Mr. Northam represented a vote for continuity. Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat barred by state law from seeking re-election, is broadly popular, as are the state’s two Democratic senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner. Mr. McAuliffe, who was elected in 2013 during President Barack Obama’s second term, was the first person in 40 years to win a Virginia governor’s race who was in the same party as the president’s.

In New Jersey, the Democratic ticket established a decisive advantage early in the campaign season, and that lead never flagged. Mr. Murphy, a wealthy Democratic donor who served as ambassador to Germany under Mr. Obama, ran on a message of rejecting both Mr. Trump and Mr. Christie, who is a politically toxic figure in the state.

National Republicans virtually ignored the race, viewing their nominee, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, as doomed by a deeply hostile political environment and her association with Mr. Christie. In Utah’s Third Congressional District, John Curtis, the Republican nominee, emerged as the winner Tuesday night, according to The Associated Press.

After blanketing Virginia’s airwaves before the primary with an ad in which he savaged the president as “a narcissistic maniac,” Mr. Northam struck a more sober-minded tone during the general election with another widely aired commercial in which he vowed to “work with” Mr. Trump when it is in the state’s interest.

But Virginia Democrats were in little mood to offer any olive branches to Mr. Trump on Tuesday.

Mr. Kaine, who a year ago was left achingly short of becoming vice president, was especially triumphant in speaking to supporters.

“Trump-style division, pitting people against people, it is not the Virginia Way and it is not the American Way,” he said.","With Virginia, Voters Give Democrats First Big Wins of the Trump Era",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/us/politics/virginia-election-democrats.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

No matter where you lived in New York, sooner or later all roads led to 116th Street and Lexington Avenue, the commercial and cultural heart of East Harlem.

Joseph Rodriguez was no exception: Though born and raised in Brooklyn — with detours at Rikers and a life-changing encounter with photography — he, as a teenager, liked to hang out at his uncle’s candy store and numbers spot where the streets were abuzz with music and life. Those early encounters led to a May 1990 National Geographic cover story and the most important project of his life after he spent the latter half of the 1980’s photographing El Barrio’s streets and residents in their homes and on the block.

Now, a revised version of that body of work will be on display at the Bronx Documentary Center, as well as in the new book, “Spanish Harlem: El Barrio in the ’80s.”

While it is “easy to make gritty pictures of poverty,” Mr. Rodriguez was looking to go deeper and connect with people whose struggles he knew intimately as the son of a single mother.

“I carried this story for a long time before I could go out and make the work,” he said. “That was an important path for me to understand patience and waiting, connecting and trust.”

His images reflect an intimacy — and long-term commitment — that marks his later work in East Los Angeles, Romania and Puerto Rico. For him, this project was deeply personal, and still is.

“We’re not garbage people, we have a presence,” he said. “One thing that was extremely important was to show our children with some dignity. You see their strength. We’ve gone through hell and back, just like now in Puerto Rico. But we get up, and we fight back.”

“I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay.
In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.
The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat.
“The humidity of Key West made a lot of things a little ripe, but the photos are beautiful,” Scott DeWolfe said.","It seems fitting that during Walker Evans’s one-month stay in Havana in 1933 he would befriend Ernest Hemingway. The two shared an appreciation of a spare style that would influence countless others in photography and literature. In fact, Evans entrusted Hemingway with a trove of original prints to ensure they would not be confiscated by the authorities who were violently suppressing popular outrage against the dictator Gerardo Machado.

Now, 46 of those vintage prints are being sold by DeWolfe and Wood Rare Books of Alfred, Me., and Michael Brown Rare Books of Philadelphia, and are featured in a catalog whose comprehensive introductory essay was written by Mr. Brown. The collection is owned by Benjamin Bruce, known as Dink. His father, Telly Otto Bruce, known as Toby, was Hemingway’s friend and factotum and had safeguarded the images for decades in Key West, Fla., where Hemingway had lived.

Photo

Evans had gone to Cuba to make pictures for “The Crime of Cuba,” a book by Carleton Beals that was a fierce critique of American adventurism. “The Beals book is an expose of our misgovernment in Cuba, and the disgraceful part we have played in her tragic history past and present, economic, social, political,” read the review in Kirkus. “Sins of omission perhaps even more than sins of commission. The story of Cuba is the story of tyranny-Spain, the United States, Wall Street, and now, closely linked with the immediate past, the dictatorship of Machado, which makes Mussolini look like a Sunday School picnic.”

Evans got a taste of that supercharged political climate in his earliest days there, according to Mr. Brown’s essay, where a bus ride could turn into a journey of intrigue as who-knows-who was tailing him as he tried to meet with opposition figures. At the same time, the city thrilled him.

“When you are still bewildered,” Evans wrote in his diary, “you notice more things, as in a drunk. I was drunk with a new city for days.”

That feeling became literal when he met Hemingway, likely through an introduction by one of Beals’s newspaper contacts on the island. “I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay. “Drinking every night. He was at loose ends … and he needed a drinking companion, and I filled that role for two weeks.”

Photo

But as the essay also noted, Hemingway’s prose style may have had an influence on Evans, whose vision had been influenced earlier by a stay in Paris, where he came to appreciate the work of Eugène Atget. The images — out of a total of 400 taken during his one-month sojourn, betray that influence in photos of facades and streets. Some of them show more isolated, intimate scenes in public, from a haggard looking country family to beggars. In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.

The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat. Once there, the images ended up in storage either behind, or next to, Sloppy Joe’s, the famous Key West saloon.

“The humidity of Key West made a lot of things a little ripe, but the photos are beautiful,” Scott DeWolfe said. “What is fascinating is I think Evans was printing these where he was able to. Unlike later prints, most of these are uncropped, and slightly different. One print has Evans’s thumbprint. It’s as close to a first generation print you could possibly find.”

I could only laugh reading that tweet. Hearing that Saudi princes were arrested for “corruption” is like reading that Donald Trump fired seven cabinet secretaries “for lying.” You know it has to be something else. Trump obviously missed the story last year that M.B.S. impulsively bought a yacht while on vacation in the south of France — it just caught his fancy in the harbor — from its Russian owner for $550 million. Did that money come out of his piggy bank? Savings from his Riyadh lemonade stand? From his Saudi government 401(k)?

I raise this point because when you’re making as many radical changes at once, and making as many enemies at once, as M.B.S. is, your robes need to be very clean. People have to believe that you mean what you say and that you have no hidden agendas, because change is going to be painful. Look at what M.B.S. is doing all at once:

To speed up decision-making, he is reshaping the Saudi state — from a broad family coalition where power is shared and alternated among seven major families and decisions taken by consensus — to a state governed by a single family line. This is no longer “Saudi Arabia.” It is becoming “Salman Arabia.” In the latest series of arrests, M.B.S. basically eliminated the “young old guard” — the key sons and his natural rivals from the other main Saudi royal lines. He also arrested the owners of the three main quasi-independent private television networks, MBC, ART and Rotana.

At the same time, M.B.S. is shifting the basis of legitimacy of the regime, ending “the 1979 era.” In 1979, in the wake of the takeover of Islam’s most holy site in Mecca by an ultra-fundamentalist Saudi preacher who claimed that the al-Saud family was not Islamic enough, the Saudi ruling family — to shore up its religious legitimacy — made a sharp religious turn at home and began exporting its puritanical Wahhabi Sunni Islam abroad, building mosques and schools from London to Indonesia.

It has been a disaster for the Arab/Muslim world, spawning offshoots like Al Qaeda and ISIS and retarding Arab education and women’s advancement.

M.B.S. has vowed to give birth to a more moderate Saudi Islam, starting by curbing his religious police and permitting women to drive. This is hugely important. He is daring people to judge his government not on piety but on performance, not on Quran but on KPIs — key performance indicators on unemployment, economic growth, housing and health care.

But he is replacing Wahhabism as a source of solidarity with a more secular Saudi nationalism, one that has a strong anti-Iran/Persian/Shiite tenor. And that is taking him to some dangerous places. To confront Iran, M.B.S. got the Sunni Prime Minister of Lebanon, Saad al-Hariri, to quit his office on Saturday while on a visit to Riyadh, and blamed Iran and its Shiite allies for making Lebanon ungovernable — and for a missile attack from Yemen. Lebanon, which had forged a relatively stable balance among Sunnis, Christians and Shiites, is now shaking. M.B.S. also led a Gulf effort to isolate Qatar for being too close to Iran and to crush Iran’s influence in Yemen — and crush Yemen in the process. It’s overreach, and there seems to be no one around to tell him that.

As a veteran Saudi journalist remarked to me of M.B.S.: “This guy saved Saudi Arabia from a slow death, but he needs to broaden his base. It is good that he is freeing the house of Saud of the influence of the clergy, but he is also not allowing any second opinion of his political and economic decisions.”

I worry that those urging M.B.S. to be more aggressive in confronting Iran (whose malign regional influence does need counterbalancing) — like the U.A.E., Trump, Jared Kushner and Bibi Netanyahu — will push M.B.S. into a war abroad and at home at the same time, and we could see Saudi Arabia and the whole region spin out of control at the same time.

Back Story

Bram Stoker’s immortality is proving more difficult to pierce than that of his bloodthirsty creation.

Stoker, who was born in Ireland on this day in 1847, gave everlasting life to Dracula, the Transylvanian vampire, in the 1897 novel of the same name, and then took it away.

Photo

Since then, Stoker’s tale has been reimagined countless times, in books, on television and in films like “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (1992).

Now, one of his descendants is hoping to revive previously unpublished parts of the story.

Stoker took seven years to write the original novel, clawing his way through an overabundance of imagination and research that left much of the material in drafts.

The novelist’s great grandnephew Dacre Stoker announced he would release a prequel, “Dracul,” in 2018. It draws heavily from Bram Stoker’s notes and journal and from family legends. Paramount has already bought the movie rights, so Dracula may be resurrected on the big screen once again.

Luckily, my helmet was securely in place when, for reasons unknown, I fell forward over the handlebars while riding slowly uphill a few houses from home. Although I suffered a mild concussion and have no memory of the accident (I also sustained a nasty cut on my chin, badly bruised ribs and a scraped knee), my helmet prevented a serious brain or facial injury.

I will never again mount a bicycle without the helmet on my head where it belongs, not in my backpack, bike basket or, worse, at home.

There are laws requiring young cyclists to wear helmets in 21 states and Washington, D.C., and at least 200 localities, but very few cover adult riders. A common sight in my neighborhood: Fathers riding helmetless with their helmeted child on a bike seat behind them.

There are many reasons besides helmet hair that keep people from wearing helmets. One of the most frequent excuses: “I’m only going to the store (or the gym).” Yet, as with car accidents, the majority of bike accidents happen close to home, as mine did, and not necessarily in traffic or at high speeds. Even low-speed falls on a bike trail can scramble brains.

“A very low-speed fall can be just as dangerous as a fall at higher speeds,” said Randy Swart, director of the consumer-funded Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute. “All it takes is gravity – the distance to the ground – to cause a head injury.”

Teenagers seem especially resistant to wearing helmets, yet with their still-developing brains they probably incur the greatest risks and have the most to lose from a head injury. “There’s often a rebellion aspect among teens,” Mr. Swart said. “They say, ‘All through childhood, my parents forced me to be safe. Now I want to make my own decisions about risk.’” College students and young adults often also think similarly, he said.

I worry too about younger children, even those whose parents insist that they wear a helmet when riding a scooter, tricycle or bicycle. I see many such riders with parents in tow in my Brooklyn neighborhood, and in at least half the cases I’ve observed, the helmet is too big or is not on correctly and likely to provide little protection in a serious fall or crash.

The most common error is positioning: If the helmet sits too far back on the child’s (or adult’s) head, it will not protect the most vulnerable part of the brain in a hard fall, especially if the skull fractures. When the straps are too loose (or, as I’ve often seen even among adults, the chin strap is not clasped), the helmet will fly off in a fall and offer no protection whatsoever.

The helmet should sit on the head straight, front to back, and not move when you shake your head. The straps extending from the helmet to the chin strap should each form a V right under the ears.

“A bike helmet is a like a seatbelt – it should feel snug, not tight, when you first put it on, but when you start riding, you should be able to forget all about it,” Mr. Swart said.

Another excuse I’ve heard, perhaps from those familiar with concussions among football players, is that helmets do not prevent concussions. And that is true. You don’t even have to actually hit your head to get a concussion. A concussion results when the gel-like brain sloshes violently or slams into the unyielding bony skull, and this can happen with almost any significant impact to the head. What the helmet can do is reduce the energy of the impact and the likelihood of a skull fracture or brain bleed.

If cost is a deterrent, Mr. Swart gleefully noted that many inexpensive helmets perform just as well as expensive ones. His organization had three “extremely cheap” helmets ($15 to $20 range) tested along with three “very expensive” ones ($150 and above) and, he said, “their performance level was almost identical.”

So if you’re not overly concerned about fashion or brand names, you can feel confident purchasing inexpensive helmets for every rider in the family at a chain or big-box store, he said. They all must meet the standards set by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

After determining a proper fit for head size and comfort within your price range, my advice is to select a helmet that is brightly colored; one of mine is red-orange and the other lime-yellow, the same as the colors of the jackets and backpacks I wear with them.

I’d never read an “Odyssey” that sounded like this. It had such directness, the lines feeling not as if they were being fed into iambic pentameter because of some strategic decision but because the meter was a natural mode for its speaker. The subtle sewing through of the fittingly wavelike W-words in the first half (“wandered ... wrecked ... where ... worked”) and the stormy S-words that knit together the second half, marrying the waves to the storm in which this man will suffer, made the terse injunctions to the muse that frame this prologue to the poem (“Tell me about ...” and “Find the beginning”) seem as if they might actually answer the puzzle posed by Homer’s polytropos and Odysseus’s complicated nature.

Complicated: the brilliance of Wilson’s choice is, in part, its seeming straightforwardness. But no less than that of polytropos, the etymology of “complicated” is revealing. From the Latin verb complicare, it means “to fold together.” No, we don’t think of that root when we call someone complicated, but it’s what we mean: that they’re compound, several things folded into one, difficult to unravel, pull apart, understand.

“It feels,” I told Wilson, “with your choice of ‘complicated,’ that you planted a flag.”

“It is a flag,” she said.

“It says, ‘Guess what?’ — ”

“ ‘ — this is different.’ ”

Although translation might seem a natural step for a scholar preoccupied by the connections between antiquity and later texts, Wilson was dissuaded from pursuing it. “My colleagues told me: ‘You really shouldn’t be doing that kind of thing before tenure. Before tenure you have to write, you know, the right kind of book’ ” — the right kind being one on a subject that your discipline has yet to exhaust. Wilson did write a range of books before tenure, most on canonical texts: her study of suffering and death in literature; a monograph on Socrates. But, not heeding her colleagues’ advice, she began to translate Greek and Roman tragedies. A selection of Seneca’s plays appeared in 2010; four plays by Euripides in 2016. Both projects were outgrowths of her old desire to “spend a little bit longer” with these authors.

I asked Wilson why translation isn’t valued in the academy.

“Because there is no perception that it’s serious intellectually. It’s imagined as a subset of outreach. That you’re going to be communicating with the masses, which is less important than being innovative within your field. And even though I think translation is a way of being innovative within your field, my colleagues don’t see it that way.”

One way of talking about Wilson’s translation of the “Odyssey” is to say that it makes a sustained campaign against that species of scholarly shortsightedness: finding equivalents in English that allow the terms she is choosing to do the same work as the original words, even if the English words are not, according to a Greek lexicon, “correct.”

“What gets us to ‘complicated,’ ” Wilson said, returning to her translation of polytropos, “is both that I think it has some hint of the original ambivalence and ambiguity, such that it’s both ‘Why is he complicated?’ ‘What experiences have formed him?’ which is a very modern kind of question — and hints at ‘There might be a problem with him.’ I wanted to make it a markedly modern term in a way that ‘much turning’ obviously doesn’t feel modern or like English. I wanted it to feel like an idiomatic thing that you might say about somebody: that he is complicated.”

I asked: “What about the commentator who says, ‘It does something that more than modernizes — it subverts the fundamental strangeness of the way Odysseus is characterized.’ I’m sure some classicists are going to say it’s flat out wrong, ‘Interesting, but wrong.’ ”

“You’re quite right,” she replied. “Reviewers will say that.”

How, I asked, would she address such a complaint from someone in her field?

“I struggle with this all the time,” Wilson said. “I struggled with this because there are those classicists. I partly just want to shake them and make them see that all translations are interpretations.” Most of the criticism Wilson expects, she says, will come from “a digging in of the heels: ‘That’s not what it says in the dictionary, and therefore it can’t be right!’ And if you put down anything other than what’s said in the dictionary, then, of course, you have to add a footnote explaining why, which means that pretty much every line has to have a footnote. ...” Wilson paused. “That goes to what this translation is aiming to do in terms of an immersive reading experience and conveying a whole narrative. I don’t know what to say to those people, honestly.” Wilson laughed her buoyant laugh. “I need to have a better answer to them, because they will certainly review it, and they will certainly have a loud voice. They just seem to be coming from such a simple and fundamental misunderstanding.”

“Of what?”

“Of what any translation is doing.”

What a translation is doing — and what it should do — has been a source of vigorous debate since there were texts to translate. “I’m not a believer,” Wilson told me, “but I find that there is a sort of religious practice that goes along with translation. I’m trying to serve something.”

Early arguments about translation were over the Old Testament. One tale has it that an Egyptian king of the third-century B.C. wanted a Greek copy of the Pentateuch — the five books of Moses — for the Library of Alexandria. Some 70 Jewish elders said to be “skilled in the Scriptures and in both languages” were sent from Jerusalem. Each worked in a separate room to translate in isolation. When finished, they compared their work. The 70 translations? Identical, “in the very same words and the very same names, from beginning to end,” according to one account. The translation was, literally, faithful: God himself had moved their hands in unison, only one possible translation for his Word. Called “Septuagint” after its 70 translators, this Greek version became a foundational text, both for the early Christian church and for the impossible standard to which all subsequent translations are held: faithfulness. Later Bible translators failed to meet that mystical standard. The Catholic Church took 1,200 years to accept Jerome’s Latin version (“tainted with Judaism,” was the charge, as it relied on Hebrew sources). The first English Bible’s translator, John Wycliffe, was disinterred and his bones were burned for the heresy of translating into English, and his successor, William York Tyndale, was excommunicated, sentenced to death by strangulation and burned at the stake.

Although you can understand, if not condone, how murderous rage at a translator might arise if a believer supposed a sacred text to have been desecrated by a translator’s hand, it is somewhat surprising that similar vehemence can greet translations of secular canonical texts. Perhaps the most famous such expression is in Matthew Arnold’s “On Translating Homer,” his series of lectures in 1860 when he was Oxford professor of poetry. In them, he offered a takedown of existing translations of Homer and then asked “in what faithfulness exists”: “The translator of Homer should above all be penetrated by a sense of four qualities ... that he is eminently rapid; that he is eminently plain and direct both in the evolution of his thought and in the expression of it, that is, both in his syntax and in his words; that he is eminently plain and direct in the substance of his thought, that is, in his matter and ideas; and, finally, that he is eminently noble.”

Most every Homeric translation since has been scrutinized against his quartet of qualities. Wilson is not persuaded.

“These are not good criteria,” Wilson told me. “I think he was a terrible reader of poetry. It’s not like he ever translated Homer. I think he had a good ‘classics major’ undergraduate kind of Greek, but I think it’s all to do with a particular notion of aesthetics and class, the whole ‘plainness and nobility.’ It’s about noblesse oblige and you’re going to be the kind of gentleman who’s going to have gone to Rugby and that will be the kind of language that we speak: the classy kind of language. And projecting all of that back on to the classics. This is what ‘sweetness and light’ is. It’s describing a boys’ club. I think it’s very interesting that’s still with us. Those are the four? It’s just the boys’ club.”

“I do think that gender matters,” Wilson said later, “and I’m not going to not say it’s something I’m grappling with. I’m trying to take this task and this process of responding to this text and creating this text extremely seriously, with whatever I have, linguistically, sonically, emotionally.”

At the center of each of Homer’s epics is a warrior. In the “Iliad,” it is Achilles, the greatest of the Greeks, a demigod almost invulnerable to death. Although the war is begun over a woman, Helen, stolen from her Greek husband by a Trojan, the “Iliad” is a poem about and presided over by men. Zeus is the poem’s prevailing god, and what men do, or are willing to do, in love and war and in the friendships that arise in war and its losses, are the poem’s preoccupations.

In the “Odyssey,” preoccupations shift, radically. Zeus is replaced by Athena as the dominant god of the tale; the poem begins not with Odysseus but with his wife, Penelope, who has been without him for 20 years, in a kingdom overrun by suitors for her hand, whom the conventions of hospitality ensure she cannot simply expel. The reader doesn’t even see Odysseus until the fifth of the poem’s 24 books, where we learn that he has been living on an island with Calypso, a goddess, for seven years; that, earlier, he was detained by another goddess, Circe, with whom he also shared a bed; that the Sirens, as he navigates, call to him, desiring him; that a young princess falls in love with him; that, on all sides, women are temptresses, and whereas he submits, we are to understand that Penelope, alone, assailed, remains faithful.

“In the second-wave feminist scholarship in classics,” Wilson told me, “people were very keen to try to read Penelope as, ‘Let’s find Penelope’s voice in the “Odyssey,” and let’s celebrate her, because look, here she is being the hero in an epic in ways we can somehow unpack.’ I find that’s a little simplistic. What happens to all the unelite women?”

In the episode that Wilson calls “one of the most horrible and haunting of the whole poem,” Odysseus returns home to find that his palace has been overrun by suitors for his wife’s hand. Though she has resisted them, the women in her palace have not. Odysseus, after slaying the suitors, tells his son, Telemachus, to kill the women. It is an interesting injunction from Odysseus, who himself, during his 10 years of wandering, was serially unfaithful. In Robert Fagles’s much-praised translation of the poem, Telemachus says, before he executes the palace women on his father’s command: “No clean death for the likes of them, by god!/Not from me — they showered abuse on my head, my mother’s too!/You sluts — the suitors’ whores!”

But Wilson, in her introduction, reminds us that these palace women — “maidservants” has often been put forward as a “correct” translation of the Greek δμωαι, dmoai, which Wilson calls “an entirely misleading and also not at all literal translation,” the root of the Greek meaning “to overpower, to tame, to subdue” — weren’t free. Rather, they were slaves, and if women, only barely. Young female slaves in a palace would have had little agency to resist the demands of powerful men. Where Fagles wrote “whores” and “the likes of them” — and Lattimore “the creatures” — the original Greek, Wilson explained, is just a feminine definite article meaning “female ones.” To call them “whores” and “creatures” reflects, for Wilson, “a misogynistic agenda”: their translators’ interpretation of how these females would be defined. Here is how Wilson renders their undoing:",The First Woman to Translate the ‘Odyssey’ Into English,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/magazine/the-first-woman-to-translate-the-odyssey-into-english.html

LA VERNIA, Tex. — It’s important to know that in Wilson County in Texas, site of the horrific shooting that killed 26 people at the First Baptist Church on Sunday, life revolves around the schools and the churches. It’s a rural county of five small towns, and the biggest industry is cattle ranching. It is also a place where schools don’t plan anything on Wednesday nights because that is a church night.

I am the pastor at La Vernia United Methodist Church, seven miles west of Sutherland Springs, where the shooting occurred. Everyone here knew someone associated with the First Baptist Church. One of the dead was a parent whose child was in the 4-H club with a child in our program. Another victim was a lifelong friend of one of my parishioners; they graduated from La Vernia High 38 years ago. People from my congregation had attended Bible study at First Baptist or worked with its members on a mission project.

The idea that such a thing would happen in a sacred space, a place where families are supposed to be safe, has angered many people. Churches are places where the spirit of God is felt, where the presence of God is very real, where manners are expected and vulgarity is shunned. The church is where we, with all our faults and failures, come into the presence of the divine to find grace, to find peace, to rest in the arms of the Lord. The church is a sanctuary in the literal sense of the word, set apart, safe, protecting. All this was shattered.

Things like this don’t happen in small towns like ours. Those who moved to the country to protect their family from the perceived dangers of the city were especially shaken.

Almost every family here identifies with a church. In some cases, it’s more a matter of a family tradition than active participation. But for weddings and funerals, it is usually the “family church” that’s called. Even so, families go to different churches as they find activities that fit their needs. The Boy Scouts at the Methodist church. Soccer at the Roman Catholic church. Lions Club meetings at the Church of Christ.

The luxury automaker BMW has issued two recalls involving about one million cars and sport utility vehicles that are at risk of catching fire even when they are not in use.

The first recall covers more than 672,000 cars. It includes several BMW 3 Series models from 2006-11 with wiring and electrical conductors in the climate control system that are vulnerable to overheating, BMW told the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration on Thursday.

The second, larger recall involves the 2008-11 128i and various other 2007-11 models with six-cylinder engines, such as the 328i and the 525i. In these vehicles, the heater designed to keep the positive crankcase ventilation from freezing has the potential to short-circuit, causing the parts inside its valve to melt. The crankcase ventilation system helps gases escape from an internal combustion engine.

More than 740,000 vehicles are included in this group.

The risk of fire is “extremely rare,” Hector Arellano-Belloc, a BMW spokesman, said in an email.

The company said it was asking car owners “in an abundance of caution” to keep their affected vehicles parked outdoors until they are repaired, he said. He said the company knew of three injuries that may be related to the climate control system wiring, but no injuries related to the P.C.V. heater.

There is widespread agreement that the industry failed to properly represent less educated white voters, and that this was part of why last year’s polls were too favorable to Democrats. It’s likely to remain a big issue, at least as long as white voters split so decisively on educational lines. The postelection report of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, the nation’s leading polling association, reached a similar conclusion.

One possible fix is to weight by education, which would give more or less weight to certain respondents to ensure that less educated voters represent the appropriate share of the poll’s final estimate. For many public polls, weighting by education would make a big difference. It could move an otherwise lightly weighted poll by as much as four percentage points toward the Republicans in the Virginia governor’s race, for example, based on an analysis of the most recent Upshot/Siena College poll. With the Democrat, Ralph Northam, holding a modest lead in most polls, the difference could be enough to flip several surveys in the state.

Education Can Make a Big Difference How the Upshot/Siena College poll of Virginia might have gone if it followed three common public polling methods and used weights for: The race, gender and age of registered voters, with a likely voter screen

The race, gender, age, region and party primary history of the likely electorate, using only those who vote regularly

There are a few pollsters in Virginia — like The Washington Post and Quinnipiac — that do weight by education, and did so before the 2016 presidential election. Most others weren’t weighting by education before 2016 and aren’t weighting by it today.

The disparity can be extreme. Sixty-six percent of likely voters were listed as college graduates in the latest Christopher Newport University survey of Virginia, well above the range of 49 percent to 52 percent in Upshot estimates. Mr. Northam led by six points in the Christopher Newport University poll. A Gravis poll, which showed Mr. Northam ahead by five points, had four-year college graduates at 60 percent of the electorate. A tied Roanoke poll had the college-educated share of the electorate at 57 percent.

The relative lack of change among public pollsters doesn’t mean that the pre-election polls in Virginia or elsewhere are doomed to miss by as much as they did in 2016. By most accounts, the 2016 polling error took a perfect storm: Just about everything that could break Mr. Trump’s way appears to have done so. Next time, it could be the Democrats who beat turnout expectations and sway undecided voters. There’s also no guarantee that the stark educational divide of the 2016 presidential election will be as prominent without Mr. Trump on the ballot, or as important with midterm voters, who tend to be more educated.

But the lack of change hints at a bleak possibility: a mismatch between the scale of the challenge facing the survey research industry and the capacity of many individual public pollsters to respond.

Education Is a Mystery

It might seem obvious that the 2016 election would drive public pollsters to adopt big changes. But many individual public pollsters were reasonably satisfied by their results, even though the industry as a whole seemed to get it wrong.

It’s not completely unreasonable. Last year’s polling error was an odd one. It was almost perfectly distributed across the battleground states to maximize the electoral consequences. There were large errors in a small number of states where Mrs. Clinton had a big lead, like Wisconsin and Michigan. But elsewhere the errors were more typical, or even nonexistent. Virginia is one such state: Mrs. Clinton led by five or six points in all the final polling averages; in the end, she won by 5.3 points.

If pollsters didn’t take any surveys in the Midwest, most or all of their results were probably in the margin of error. Their result might have leaned toward Mrs. Clinton, like everyone else’s, but they could explain that away: There is a lot of evidence that undecided voters broke toward Mr. Trump. And most public pollsters didn’t conduct enough polls, late enough in the race, to be sure of just how well or poorly they really did.

Some pollsters did take enough surveys late enough in the race to merit a re-examination, but they didn’t think education was decisive. Patrick Murphy of Monmouth University, for instance, found that weighting by education would have explained only one percentage point of bias in his surveys.

But perhaps the bigger issue is that education is a mystery: It’s hard for pollsters to even know if they’re getting it wrong, let alone to fix it.

“I don’t weight to education because it’s pretty hard to find accurate benchmarks for a likely-voter profile based on education,” said Matthew Towery of Opinion Savvy, a firm that often conducts state polls using automated calls. “That’s not something that’s necessarily easily ascertained most of the time.”

He’s right. It’s not easy to weight by education, and it’s especially tough for pollsters who rely on voter registration files — the “big data” that powers most campaigning polling and analytics. Many pollsters use voter file data, rather than dialing telephone numbers at random (known as random digit dialing, or R.D.D.), to conduct their surveys and estimate the composition of the electorate.

Voter files offer pollsters rich demographic and political data to help them weight their survey and estimate the likely electorate. R.D.D. surveys have their own advantages, but the loss of this data is a considerable disadvantage, especially in a low-turnout election. Unsurprisingly, the Virginia polls that at least partly use R.D.D. have occasionally produced somewhat outlying results.

View all New York Times newsletters.

But the voter file has a weakness: Education is not reliably included on public voter files. To weight by education, pollsters using the voter file have to look elsewhere — something pollsters who trust the voter file are generally reluctant to do. Not coincidentally, only two of the nonpartisan Virginia pollsters using a voter file appear to weight by education; all but one of the pollsters using random digit dialing in Virginia do, most likely using the census.

What’s the alternative? A pollster could ask voters how much education they have in order to match estimates for the likely electorate from some other source, but there isn’t a definitive benchmark for weighting. There still isn’t universal agreement about how many voters in 2016 had a college degree: There’s a wide 10-point gap between the exit poll results and the census postelection survey.

The combination of the uncertainty around the true educational composition of the electorate and the reluctance to weight voter-file surveys by self-reported measures has been enough to deter many public-voter-file-based surveys from weighting by education.

These same factors pose a challenge to private partisan pollsters. But the pace of change among them has nonetheless been far greater.

All but one of the 10 private partisan pollsters interviewed for this article have begun to do something about education, whether by weighting or by other means.

“This is the first time ever that I’ve weighted education, getting ready for some elections in 2018,” said Glen Bolger, a pollster for Public Opinion Strategies, a prominent Republican polling firm, “because education is a pretty damn good predictor.”

For private pollsters, there is a lot more acceptance of the problem — and more acceptance that they just got it wrong, especially on the Democratic side. The big private polling firms conducted more than enough surveys, in enough states, late enough in the race, to have no illusions about whether their results were meaningfully biased.

Some of them were already doing something about it before the election, but now they’re generally doing more. There’s still uncertainty about the exact way to do it, but most private pollsters are persuaded by the necessity of change — uncertainty is no longer an excuse to do nothing.

“It’s kind of a cop-out,” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research. “You can’t say I can’t deal with education because I don’t know the exact weight of it. You wouldn’t not weight on race because you couldn’t figure it out.”

Is It Enough?

The debate among private pollsters, especially on the Democratic side, has instead advanced to a different stage: whether weighting by education is enough.

The cause for debate is simple. Even weighting by education wouldn’t have been enough to give Mr. Trump the polling edge. One possibility, often advanced by more traditional firms, is that the residual error could be explained by turnout or shifts among undecided voters.

But there’s a more ominous possibility. It wasn’t just that polls didn’t capture enough less educated white voters; it was also that they didn’t get the right less educated white voters.

Perhaps the polls missed less educated voters in the most rural areas. Maybe they missed those who don’t work in office jobs, in old-economy sectors like manufacturing or agriculture. Or maybe they missed voters with low levels of social trust or a lower propensity to volunteer, who have long been less likely to respond to surveys and may have been more likely to support Mr. Trump in 2016.

If true, the problem is a lot more difficult to solve. Weighting by education would not be an adequate remedy, since “baristas aren’t exchangeable with factory workers,” as David Shor of Civis Analytics puts it. Civis is the Democratic firm that has probably been the most vocal about the possibility that the polling industry suffers from bigger nonresponse challenges than can be fixed by weighting by education.

The possibility of a deeper kind of nonresponse bias is now broadly held in the Democratic analytics world, but it’s nowhere near a consensus across the polling industry. That’s in part because there’s limited public evidence to support it at this stage. It’s also because many traditional pollsters are skeptical of analytics firms with an economic incentive to argue that traditional polling is broken or even impossible. But traditional pollsters mentioned some of these issues as well.

Research in this area seems poised to continue for the foreseeable future. But most of these efforts are occurring out of the view of public polling firms. If something is more profoundly wrong with public polling than weighting by education alone can address, it’s hard to see how many public polling firms will be able to do anything about it.","After a Tough 2016, Many Pollsters Haven’t Changed Anything",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/upshot/after-a-tough-2016-many-pollsters-havent-changed-anything.html

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Well, look who’s collaborating on crossword puzzles. Digital crossword editor Joel Fagliano and assistant crossword editor Sam Ezersky offer us a midweek puzzle with just enough of a mental tug-of-war to get us over the hump. Not only that, but I always enjoy when constructors show us something we might not have noticed before about words.

Today’s Theme

At first glance, few solvers will know what the three-part lists in this theme are about, but all you need is one solved theme entry and the rest of them will easily fall into place.

For me it was APOSTATES, at 15D. I already had the “A” from Edgar ALLAN Poe at 15A, and I knew that “Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Ohio” were all STATES, so I used my superpower of staring at the clue until I burned a hole in my screen to figure out that the answer — and the theme — was the first letter of each of the items in the list plus what they are. That would be APO + STATES, or the word APOSTATES. Now you go figure out the other three. It’s not that hard, but it’s certainly fun.

To make up for the relative easiness of the theme, our intrepid constructors have thrown in some speed bumps in the nontheme fill, which certainly slowed me down. I was not familiar with the term DAD ROCK (a debut), which I presume one listens to when one has a dad bod. At 20D, I filled in KNEECAP because I solved this on a Monday and I haven’t yet had enough coffee to remember that the patella is the KNEECAP. So a “Patella protector” would be a KNEEPAD. Finally, I got Naticked at the crossing of 46A and 47D. I just couldn’t wrap my head around ISOGON/GHANA.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Most of us solve crossword puzzles in our SPARE TIME, but I’ve gotten mail from people who have told me that they solved under their desks during classes to make a boring lecture go faster. In another lifetime, I raced my boss to see who could finish fastest when we should have been working. So clearly, spare time is the not the same as down time. Spare time is all in the eye of the solver.

Roland Huget returns with a wide open grid that has only 60 words in it. The pinwheel design intrigued me, although I felt a bit boxed in by the long, black square “arms” that made, as he admits, the puzzle feel like four mini-crosswords. If I’m going to be boxed in, so to speak, I like to see each sector really shine, and I’m not sure this one did it for me. As always, your mileage may vary, but there are more “RE-” words in here than I like to see (RELET, REVOICE, REBOX, REAWAKENS) and each section has some gluey bits that made me feel as if the majority of the puzzle had been filled using the autofill option in a puzzle constructing software program.

Yes, I know it’s Saturday. There is some nice fill in here (I liked SEAFARERS, GO IT ALONE, SPARE TIME, LOSE A STEP). And PAPETERIE might just become the ETUI of stationery products one day. But I really like some knotty wordplay in my late week cluing, and this seemed mostly definitional. Combine that with the lack of real sparklers in the fill, and the puzzle as a whole feels vaguely disappointing. To me. You might feel otherwise, and that’s perfectly O.K.

Tricky Clues

The Tricky Clues section is generally limited to clues that involve some sort of wordplay, and there wasn’t much of it in today’s puzzle. Even so, here is a selection of clues that might have been speed bumps for some solvers.

41A: Foreign language in the clue = foreign language answer. “Un examen” is “a test” in French, so the answer would be ELEVE, or French for “student.”

36D: “It’s not the main story” is a SUBPLOT.

43D: Now we’re talking, sort of. “It can get the blood flowing” could be anything exciting, but today it’s a STENT.

Constructor Notes

This puzzle was constructed in October 2016 and accepted for publication in February of this year. It is one of a series of open grids that I constructed in the late summer and fall of 2016. This grid has the largest open square count of any I have constructed to date. The layout of the blocks was designed for that purpose. It is as close to being four independent mini-puzzles as you can get, and this fact needs to be taken into account in the cluing so that solvers can gain a foothold. This grid took longer than most to construct, and in the end required compromises, as has been my experience with many puzzles. The Scrabble average often suffers in grids like this because the friendliest letters in the open areas tend to be the ones with the lowest scores. I hope solvers enjoy this one.

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, after all, may be enacting a version of democratic rule that is in line with what many of Myanmar’s citizens demand.","Some of that is simply politics. But Ms. Lupton believes that those simplistic judgments are rooted in a quirk of psychology that makes them hard to avoid, and harder still to alter once they take hold.

“In political psychology there’s this notion of confirmation bias: that you have a predetermined belief about either an outcome or in this case whether a person is good or bad,” she said. That bias leads people to subconsciously select information that reinforces those beliefs — and to ignore facts that are inconsistent with it.

That helps explain how Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s champions in the West seemed to overlook signs that she might not be a paragon of liberal democratic values after all.

In a 2013 interview with the BBC, for instance, she brusquely dismissed questions about rising violence against the Rohingya, saying that Buddhists had also been displaced from their homes and that there was fear “on both sides.” Asked why the violence had overwhelmingly affected Muslims, she deflected, saying that Buddhists lived in fear of “global Muslim power.”

Though such episodes mounted during her rise, they conflicted with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s saintly image, and so went largely unnoticed. Western leaders continued to embrace her, building her legitimacy as they pressured the transitional government to hold elections that were widely expected to elevate her to power.

“Confirmation bias is so powerful that we can ignore information that conflicts, and don’t even notice we’re doing it,” Ms. Lupton said.

That can feed a much more significant political bias, experts say, toward believing that a political system will take on the characteristics of its leader. In fact, the truth is often the opposite.

Together, those biases make it easy to conclude that if heroic individuals could just win power, that would be enough to bring democracy and freedom.

“We’re always in search of the leader that we can rely on to be our partner so that we can just kind of sign off on that person and go back to worrying about other things,” said Elizabeth Saunders, a George Washington University political scientist who studies American foreign policy.

A Long Line of Would-Be Saviors

The simple story of a crusading leader who will transform a nation rarely works out that way.

The United States once championed the Afghan leader Hamid Karzai as the democratic successor to the Taliban’s oppressive regime. But Washington was disappointed to find that Mr. Karzai, rather than rising above the problems of corruption and cronyism that had beset Afghanistan, established an inner circle that embodied them.

“If you hold up a leader as a paragon of virtue, you may aid in consolidating their power, which can have all kinds of unintended consequences,” Ms. Saunders said.

In Rwanda, President Paul Kagame was hailed as his country’s savior when he took office, with Western support, after the 1994 genocide. But despite successes in reducing poverty, he has proved to be an authoritarian leader. Opposition politicians often end up in prison, in exile or dead. Human Rights Watch has documented widespread military detention and torture.

And it was easy to support the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement when it was a rebel group fighting Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese leader currently under indictment for genocide in Darfur. But after the group’s officers and allies took power in the newly independent South Sudan, they helped plunge the country into civil war.

It is not only Western leaders who make such misjudgments. In the 1960s and ’70s, activists worldwide cheered the rise of African independence leaders like Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, many of whom later hardened into dictators.

There are exceptions, such as Nelson Mandela, the first post-apartheid president of South Africa. But the Mandelas are so uncommon, and their successes rely on so many factors clicking into place, that they are still marveled over as wondrous mysteries, including among frustrated activists in Myanmar.

‘Features of a Dictator’

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is not Mr. Kagame or Mr. Mugabe, but after less than 20 months in office she is showing hints of the traits that define such leaders.

Upon winning power, she quickly sidelined many of the activists and civil society groups that had aided her rise. “She is only listening to those close to her,” said U Yan Myo Thein, an activist with the pro-democracy 88 Generation group and a former political prisoner, characterizing her inner circle as a “personality cult.”

“This is one of the features of a dictator,” he said.

As international plaudits for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi continued to mount, some in Myanmar saw growing signs that she was consolidating power and suppressing critics.

“Though they claim themselves as an icon of democracy, they want to centralize and control everything,” Kyaw Thu, who leads the prominent civil society group Paung-Ku, said of the elected government. He added, “Anyone not supporting their agenda is the enemy.”

Dozens have been charged under a law that restricts criticism of the government, an echo of the imprisonment of dissidents under military rule.

Aaron Connelly, an analyst at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia, said such measures “have characterized N.L.D. rule in Myanmar,” referring to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s political party.

Even beyond her stance on the Rohingya, he said, “Aung San Suu Kyi has not been a particularly liberal leader.”

A Lesson to Learn?

Though senior policymakers seem confident in their habits, younger voices are beginning to question whether the international community, after so many such disappointments, might have something to learn.

“This pattern is far too frequent to be ignored,” Tim Hirschel-Burns, a Peace Corps officer in Benin, wrote on his personal blog.

Perhaps the underlying model, of reforming a troubled country by installing a promising leader, might have the problem backward, he argued. Perhaps change needs to come bottom-up, even if this is harder and messier and takes longer.

“People in these countries, just as we are, are largely products of their environments,” he wrote.

Treating Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi as somehow above Myanmar’s problems allowed the world to see only her “moral righteousness and bravery rather than the political force she represented,” he added.

Even leaders who say all the right things and show good intentions tend to reflect the systems through which they rise. If those systems remain broken, it is fair to blame leaders for their mistakes, but unrealistic to expect a different outcome.

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, after all, may be enacting a version of democratic rule that is in line with what many of Myanmar’s citizens demand.

A 2015 survey by Asia Barometer found that most respondents in the country opposed checks on executive power, believed religious authorities should have a role in lawmaking and said citizenship should be tied to religion. Support for a strong-handed ruler was high and support for full rights for minorities was low.

“People want democracy in the sense of being rid of dictatorship and having a leader that’s popularly elected,” said Thant Myint-U, a historian and former United Nations official. “But that’s very different from accepting the whole panoply of liberal values, especially when it comes to issues of race, ethnicity or gender equality.”

It is worth asking how much of the Western anger now directed at Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, including calls to revoke her Nobel Peace Prize, is partly buyers’ remorse from supporters who regret their own role in transforming her into such a powerful symbol.

Last winter, a Detroit woman seeking financial stability walked into a local job-readiness center, supported by a national community development nonprofit called LISC. She enrolled in an eight-week job-preparedness program that taught her the skills needed to land an apprenticeship in the building trades. Seven months, four certifications and a union card later, the woman, Tiffany, is working full-time — with benefits — as a millwright apprentice, installing and repairing factory machinery. She finds the work fulfilling and is up for a raise in a few months.

The need to help people like Tiffany, who did not want her last name used, will grow only more acute: Job dislocation and wage pressure caused by rapid technological development and globalization are likely to persist for a long time. These forces can contribute powerfully to productivity and growth, but they have worsened problems in our economy, from stagnant wages to the lack of opportunities for those with less education.

Too many people lack access to entry-level jobs with good wages, especially in industries like manufacturing, where activity is actually near a high. The reason is that technology has enabled this work to be done by far fewer employees — or it’s not being done at all, because workers don’t have the specialized skills certain jobs demand.

That’s where a robust federal jobs program could help. Millions of Americans could work in high-need areas rebuilding and repairing crumbling roads and bridges or taking care of the elderly. The jobs should pay a living wage (even during the training phase), come with good benefits and be widely available, including to the formerly incarcerated. The program could include both public jobs and subsidized private employment, either temporary or longer-term. The jobs would provide credentials and hard and soft skills through on-the-job training, which could then facilitate a transition into unsubsidized private-sector employment. We should also invest in more vocational training and apprenticeships, like the one Tiffany landed.

Though public jobs programs are associated with Democrats, Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Trump administration’s Council of Economic Advisers, recently backed the idea, creating the possibility of bipartisan support.

Public employment should be viewed not as a social program but as a public investment with a high rate of return. The return is increased economic output, coupled with the development of human capital — which increases productivity and the size of the effective labor force — in a population and economy that badly need it. That human capital, in turn, could catalyze more business investment and activity in low-income neighborhoods, which would further promote economic growth.","Why the U.S. Needs a Federal Jobs Program, Not Payouts",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/opinion/federal-jobs-program-payouts.html

The election of Mr. Murphy was yet another low-water mark in a long fall from grace for Mr. Christie, who once saw his approval ratings soar into the 70s and whose re-election margin in 2013 was so high that it instantly vaulted him into the presidential conversation.

And Mr. Murphy’s victory was further rejection of the politics of Mr. Trump, who was roundly defeated by Hillary Clinton in New Jersey last November. Mr. Murphy enjoyed the support of a parade of Democratic luminaries — Barack Obama, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Al Gore, to name a few — who trekked to New Jersey to rally voters and remind them that this was one of their first opportunities to send a message to the White House.

In the final weeks in New Jersey, Ms. Guadagno, perhaps sensing that she was not gaining any traction, veered toward a style of politics more akin to Mr. Trump’s, campaigning against undocumented immigrants and running caustic ads that twisted Mr. Murphy’s words about cities that offer them sanctuary.

But support from Mr. Trump, who had been frantically tweeting about the Virginia governor’s race for weeks, was nowhere to be found for Ms. Guadagno, nor did any Republican Party luminaries travel to the state to offer their support.

From a campaign that began with a sharp focus on property taxes — she made a promise on primary night not to run for re-election if she failed to lower property taxes — Ms. Guadagno changed course and warned repeatedly that Mr. Murphy would turn New Jersey into a sanctuary state, hoping to energize the base of the Republican Party.

But the strategy fell flat, particularly in a state where the successful Republican Party playbook, which guided Mr. Christie and former governors Christine Todd Whitman and Thomas Kean to victory in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, has relied on winning over the large swath of New Jersey’s independent voters with a message focused on pocketbook issues.","Phil Murphy Is Elected Governor of New Jersey, in a Lift for Democrats",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/nyregion/phil-murphy-governor.html

Looking at Trump’s Hiring Habits

On “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert highlighted recent reports that Mar-a-Lago, President Trump’s golf resort in Florida, received government permission to hire 70 immigrant workers. Mr. Trump has criticized companies that don’t “hire American.”

“Mar-a-Lago has been granted what’s known as H2B visas, and to get them, Mar-a-Lago ‘had to show that no one else wanted the jobs,’ including ‘calling old employees and putting ads in the newspaper.’ They also posted the job online with You’re Going to Be Working for a Monster.com.” — STEPHEN COLBERT “Obviously, the way the law is drawn up, they have incentive to make the jobs look bad to American workers. And they succeeded —because look at this actual listing in the Palm Beach Post that read, ‘3mos recent & verifiable exp in fine dining/country club… No tips,’ and instructed applicants to ‘Apply by fax.’ You might as well post, ‘Dead-end job, slave wages, must apply via telegram, high probability of meeting Donald Trump.’” — STEPHEN COLBERT

On “Late Night,” Seth Meyers pointed out some questionable hiring practices within Mr. Trump’s administration — specifically in the Department of Agriculture. The Trump ally Sam Clovis recently withdrew from consideration for the job of chief scientist within the department — a job Mr. Trump had nominated him for — after he was linked to the Russia election-meddling scandal. Mr. Clovis is not in fact a scientist.

“Clovis is one example of what seems to be a pattern in the type of people Trump nominates and hires: The only qualification necessary is loyalty to Trump himself. And nowhere is that perhaps more blatantly obvious than at the U.S.D.A. According to reports, the Trump team has brought into the agency ‘a long-haul truck driver, a clerk at AT&T, a gas-company meter reader, a country-club cabana attendant, a Republican National Committee intern and the owner of a scented-candle company.’ That doesn’t sound like the leadership of a government agency, it sounds like the cast of ‘Survivor.’ Or like you’re assembling a team for a [expletive] bank heist. ‘Murph, you’re on candles. You, read the gas meter!’” — SETH MEYERS

“That can’t be right. Rene Boucher attacked a U.S. senator over leaves?

He’s so unpopular, pretty soon it’s just going to be ‘Fox & Friend.’” — SETH MEYERS

The Bits Worth Watching

Mr. Colbert imagined an address from a very offended Kim Jong-un, in which the North Korean leader wished Mr. Trump were visiting his country during his current tour of Asia.

Jimmy Kimmel heard that a new study suggests alcohol can help people speak foreign languages more easily. He wondered if marijuana might help, too.

I had chased Halladay for two years, through his agency and his former teams, with no luck.
Halladay was a little bigger than I remembered, as many players are when their training stops.
“If I threw 120 pitches in a game, I would throw a 20-pitch bullpen,” Halladay explained.
After our tour, he asked for a framed Halladay photo collage from a store on Main Street.","He left behind a wife and two sons. He coached youth teams and seemed to be enjoying a blissful retirement — “in the air or on the water” as he wrote on his Twitter page, where he posted this right under his handle: “Courage is not being fearless but rather acting in spite of the existence of fear!”

That playoff debut, the one he had wondered so much about, will stand as Halladay’s signature performance. He threw a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds, the first in the postseason since Don Larsen’s perfect game in the 1956 World Series. And that was as good as it got.

In Halladay’s final playoff game, the next fall, he lost by 1-0 to the St. Louis Cardinals and Chris Carpenter, an old teammate who had taught Halladay his curveball while playing catch in the minors. Somebody had to win that day, and it was his friend, not him. Halladay had given his best, and lost. It happens, and he was rational enough to understand that.

I was in the Phillies’ clubhouse after that loss, when Halladay expressed a version of the comment above. It has struck me ever since as the essence of the competitor: All you really want is a chance to test yourself, to see how it all turns out with everything at stake.

Halladay had gotten his opportunities. He was proud of how he had handled them.

We spoke this spring as part of my research for a book I am writing on pitching. I had chased Halladay for two years, through his agency and his former teams, with no luck. On my visit to Clearwater, Greg Casterioto, the Phillies’ director of baseball communications, told me Halladay was there, working with prospects on the minor league side. He met me at the picnic tables while the major leaguers played on the main field.

Halladay was a little bigger than I remembered, as many players are when their training stops. He had been a fitness fanatic when he played, and said the work — the way it flowed into the competition — was what he missed most since retiring in 2013, at age 36.

Durability was Halladay’s hallmark. He pitched 63 complete games from 2002 through 2011, 30 more than any other pitcher in that decade. His back gave out, but he said his arm always felt strong. The workload never caught up to him because he measured it precisely.

“If I threw 120 pitches in a game, I would throw a 20-pitch bullpen,” Halladay explained. “If I threw 100 pitches in a game, I would throw a 40-pitch bullpen. If I only threw 80, I’d throw a 60-pitch bullpen. So I was always getting the same amount of pitches in a five-day period.”

We talked a bit about the modern state of pitching. Halladay had eight seasons of at least 220 innings, a total no pitcher reached in 2017. He said today’s pitchers, with their turbo fastballs, tried too hard to strike hitters out.

“I felt like with two strikes — 0-2, 1-2 — if they didn’t swing at it, it was going to be strike three,” he said. “I wanted something that they had either had to swing at and put in play, or was going to be a strike on 0-2. Now it’s two extra pitches, and we’re getting back to 2-2 and the count goes on. So I think it’s just changed a lot in the way people think about pitching. They want to stay just off the plate to where they’re avoiding contact.”

Halladay induced weak contact — and so many awkward swings — using the Greg Maddux model of moving the ball in or away on either side of the plate. Hitters knew that Halladay could carve an X in the air, down by their hands or out by their handle, with his sinkers and cutters. He could also lock them up with a curve in the zone, or a split-change — a pitch he learned from Rich Dubee, a Phillies coach — in the dirt.

“I wanted them to swing at every pitch,” he said. And with an arsenal like that, why not?

Halladay’s success was hard-earned. After parts of three seasons in the majors, the Blue Jays sent him to Class A to rebuild his psyche and master a lower arm slot. He appreciated how fleeting success could be, and approached his work with a serious demeanor that evoked Steve Carlton, an earlier Phillies ace.

Carlton was my baseball hero when I was young. My son now roots for the Phillies — his grandparents have tickets — and Halladay was his favorite. When I took him to the Hall of Fame two years ago, he took a picture with the cap Halladay wore for his perfect game in 2010. After our tour, he asked for a framed Halladay photo collage from a store on Main Street.

On Tuesday, my son took inventory of the shrine to Halladay in his bedroom: two framed wall-hangings, two bobbleheads, a pennant and a baseball card.

These conditions have been in place all year. It just hasn’t yielded Democratic victories until now because the high-profile races have been fought in reliably Republican areas — districts that voted for either President Trump or Mitt Romney by at least 15 points.

But Virginia voted for Hillary Clinton by five points in 2016, and it backed Barack Obama twice as well. New Jersey, Washington State’s 45th Senate district, New York’s Westchester and Nassau Counties and Maine are generally even more Democratic-leaning.

Just because Tuesday’s victories came in states or districts won by Mrs. Clinton doesn’t mean they can be dismissed, however. College-educated white voters, paired with nonwhite voters, could profoundly endanger the G.O.P. in traditionally Republican, upscale districts.

Up until the polls closed in Virginia, it was reasonable to suppose that Mrs. Clinton’s performance represented something of a ceiling for Democrats in well-educated areas. It would be easy, the theory went, for Republican voters to distinguish their longtime Republican representatives from Mr. Trump. Jon Ossoff’s failure to outdo Mrs. Clinton in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District seemed fully consistent with that possibility.

But well-educated voters in Virginia didn’t appear to make any distinction between Mr. Trump and their incumbent representatives. Ed Gillespie, who was thought to have run a pretty strong campaign for governor against Ralph Northam, wound up running well behind Mr. Trump in many well-educated suburbs, a possibility that few imagined heading into the contest.

The catch, though, is that the overwhelming Democratic strength in well-educated areas did not cross the political divides of the 2016 election into white working-class areas. In fact, Mr. Northam, a Virginia Military Institute graduate with a strong Southern pedigree, didn’t even come close to matching Gov. Terry McAuliffe, Mr. Obama or Senator Tim Kaine in rural western Virginia. Democratic State Assembly candidates didn’t run well ahead of Mrs. Clinton, either.

Yes, the political divisions of the 2016 presidential election wound up working pretty well for Democrats in Virginia, a highly educated state. But this might not be the case for Democrats in a lot of the rest of the country. There are only 11 Republican-held congressional districts in the United States where Mrs. Clinton won by five points or more. Even if Democrats swept those 11 districts, it wouldn’t get them far toward the 24 seats they need to flip the House.

To my surprise, it’s not obvious that a rerun of the Virginia House of Delegates election on a national scale would yield Democratic control of the House. Without greater strength in areas that supported Mr. Trump, it would still be a tossup.

The good news for Democrats is that they did run well ahead of Mrs. Clinton in white working-class areas during this spring’s special congressional elections. And on Tuesday, Mr. Northam ran ahead of her in some areas, too, even if he landed short of prior Democratic benchmarks.

The big question in 2018 might prove to be whether Democrats can have it all: Will it be possible to combine a Virginia-like near sweep of Republicans in Clinton districts with a broad Democratic overperformance in white working-class districts? If they can do both, they will be favored to retake the House. One or the other would probably make the fight for House control a tossup. The fact that they’ve done both at various points this year might be an early clue.","The Other Virginia Elections, and What They Mean for 2018",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/upshot/the-other-virginia-elections-and-what-they-mean-for-2018.html

It would be hard, however, to fault Thailand and its Vietnam War veterans for seeing the war as a kind of national success.","By all accounts, the Thai troops fought well. From their base at Bear Cat Camp in Bien Hoa Province, they clashed with the Viet Cong in medium and small engagements along the vital National Route 15 linking the port of Vung Tau to areas surrounding Saigon. Thai newspapers of the day reported the successes in impressive ratios of enemy soldiers to Thai dead that looked like winning tallies of a sports score, such as “In 150 Fights, 100 [Thais] Are Dead, 1000 Viet Cong Are Killed.” Many veterans recalled how even Gen. William C. Westmoreland, commander of the Military Assistance Command — Vietnam, praised them.

The pride was cultural, too, a sign that their country had made it onto the world stage. Thai soldiers recall the Vietnam War as a yearlong opportunity to observe the American-style consumerism that would influence Thailand in the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s. The soldiers delighted in the affordable American consumer goods they encountered in the military post exchanges, or PXs. They saved up their pay to buy their first SLR cameras, televisions, refrigerators, stereo systems, champagne, Scotch and Playboy magazines.

This focus on materialism would taint their reputation. The zest with which Thai soldiers sought American goods at the PX stores caught the attention of international journalists. Reports describing the Thai soldiers’ involvement in schemes to sell PX goods to Saigon’s black market appeared in the American press, including in The New York Times. In the early 1970s, during the Senate’s Foreign Relations subcommittee hearings into the Vietnam War, it was revealed that the United States was paying the full cost of Thailand’s deployment. This revelation and the negative PX reports contributed to the Thai troops’ reputation in some histories as “America’s mercenaries.”

This wasn’t entirely off base. Thailand was a significant beneficiary of American largess during the Vietnam War years. Its military-dominated government had been a stalwart ally of the United States from the earliest days of the Cold War, and had committed its territory, people and resources to the American-led campaign against Hanoi and its allies. In return the United States poured $1.1 billion in economic and military aid into Thailand; the United States Agency for International Development gave an additional $530 million.

Thailand hosted seven air bases that launched American military aircraft daily on missions to strike strategic targets in Laos, North Vietnam and South Vietnam. The United States funded the rapid expansion of a naval base and port facilities that brought war-related supplies into the region. At the height of the war, some 50,000 American military personnel were stationed throughout Thailand. Thai entrepreneurs, many with connections to the government, built scores of new hotels, restaurants and bars to serve the waves of free-spending American G.I.s visiting on R&R. The G.I.s added $111 million to the Thai economy. At the war’s end, Thailand kept all of this military equipment and infrastructure. The Buddhist kingdom saw itself rapidly modernized thanks to the war.

The “mercenary” tag has done little to harm the soldiers’ reputation at home. Thailand’s official memorials to its Vietnam War veterans laud battlefield success, military professionalism and honor. The Thai Vietnam War Veterans Memorial in Kanchanaburi evokes the more famous World War II-era monument in Bangkok called Victory Monument. Its bas-relief images show well-armed Thai troops defeating ragtag Viet Cong guerrillas. The Royal Thai Army counts the Vietnam War as one of its proudest moments of the 20th century. The dioramas and displays in the official National Memorial Museum outside Bangkok show Thai troops killing their communist foes in arrangements that stress the successful defense of Thailand.

Less evident today is the terrible cost that Thailand paid for its involvement in the war. In addition to the 351 killed in action and the 1,351 wounded in Vietnam, Thailand sent volunteer troops to Laos in the so-called Secret War, many of whom fought and died under terrible conditions. The Vietnam War and the presence of American military personnel played a role in inciting episodes of political violence in the mid-1970s, notably the horrific massacres of student demonstrators by troops, police officers and vigilante gangs in 1973 and 1976.

Bangkok’s notorious red-light districts catering to Western sex tourists trace their origins to the R&R visits by American troops. Some of these soldiers left behind unacknowledged offspring from short-term relationships with Thai women; many of these children were raised in poverty and ostracization. But these events — and especially their connection to the war — are largely elided from Thailand’s official memorials and histories.

It would be hard, however, to fault Thailand and its Vietnam War veterans for seeing the war as a kind of national success. In the two decades after Hanoi’s capture of Saigon, a unified Vietnam endured warfare, poverty and isolation. The most common images of Vietnam in this period were those of desperate seaborne refugees — the Vietnamese boat people — who risked their lives to escape the deprivation and harassment in the postwar period.

In that same period that Vietnam suffered, Thailand saw foreign investment soar. American-built highways now linked rural areas to Bangkok and regional capitals. The rice-growing countryside added factories and processing plants in a spate of rapid industrialization. The former R&R infrastructure left over from the war became the basis of a world-famous tourist industry that has grown enormously since the mid-1970s; this year foreign tourists are expected to add nearly $50 billion to the Thai economy. For all of the downsides that Thailand found in being America’s ally in a losing effort, it can legitimately claim, as it does in its monuments, command histories and veterans’ memories, that it came out of the Vietnam War a winner.",Why Thailand Takes Pride in the Vietnam War,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/opinion/thailand-vietnam-war.html

It’s hard to have Trumpism if you don’t have Trump.

Ed Gillespie, the Republican candidate for governor in Virginia, tried his best to sound the call of Mr. Trump’s followers in stoking the nation’s culture wars. He was harsh on immigration, supportive of Confederate monuments and opposed to those N.F.L. players who have taken a knee.

But his public record before, as a national party chairman, White House counselor and Washington lobbyist, had few of those harsh edges. And like a lot of Republicans, he only grudgingly supported Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Most notably, Mr. Gillespie did not seek to campaign with the president in Virginia, settling for support via Twitter.

That left him with almost all of Mr. Trump’s baggage and few potential benefits.

Trump is allergic to accepting blame.

Mr. Trump, traveling in Asia, said that Mr. Gillespie’s problem may well have been not embracing him enough. The president’s approval rating in Virginia was 38 percent in one recent poll, and he lost the state to Hillary Clinton by more than five percentage points. Mr. Trump posted a message on Twitter endorsing Mr. Gillespie several weeks ago, then added a few more on Election Day. But with the stain of losing, Mr. Trump quickly cut ties.

Northern Virginia is the clear epicenter of the state’s political power.

The suburbs of Northern Virginia outside Washington, D.C., are now undeniably the most important region of the state politically. Wealthy and well-educated, the counties have rapidly become strongly Democratic, and population projections for the state indicate the areas will continue to far outpace more rural and Republican areas in growth.

The counties in Northern Virginia are broadly diverse. Prince William County now has more minorities than it does whites. The white population in Loudoun County has dropped almost 30 percentage points since 2000, and Asians are now the largest minority group, at 17 percent.

Hard-line Republican policies on immigration have helped drive immigrant voters to Democrats. Couple that with suburban women gravitating to the party, and it is a coalition so large in number that it is difficult to beat.

Republicans have not won statewide in Virginia since 2009. The next major test will be the Senate race in 2018, when Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat who was Hillary Clinton’s running mate last year, will seek a second term. His prospects now look much better.

Pragmatism wins over purity.

Progressives who did not enthusiastically back Lt. Gov. Ralph S. Northam, the Democratic candidate for Virginia governor, will be rethinking their theory of the race. Mr. Northam had a résumé that fit the profile of his state. He is an Army veteran, a physician and a moderate politically. He was, in a word, electable.

That does not mean the friction between the institutional party Democrats and those in the Bernie Sanders wing will fade. But the lesson from Virginia is that those fights in the primary are fine as long as each side coalesces behind the nominee. Mr. Northam defeated former Representative Tom Perriello, who was favored by progressives. But Mr. Perriello worked energetically for Mr. Northam’s election.

Red counties stay red.

Mr. Northam’s voice may have gone down easy in the vast southwestern part of Virginia, but there was no political affinity. While many Democrats have argued that their party needs to work to regain the support of rural white voters, the results in Virginia, at least, show that those efforts may be futile.

But there was a notable exception. Mr. Northam won in Virginia Beach, a traditionally Republican area, showing perhaps that the backlash against Trumpism could extend to parts of the military population that dominates that region.

An end to Chris Christie’s smash-mouth politics.

With a convincing, if expected, victory for governor of New Jersey, Philip D. Murphy, a former Wall Street banker, brought an emphatic end to the Chris Christie era. The Garden State now joins six other states that have Democrats in control of the legislative and executive branches.

Mr. Murphy managed to persuade voters of his transformation from wealthy deal maker to progressive Democrat, and he has vowed to make his state a firewall against the policies of Mr. Trump.

But many allergists say such reactions are extremely rare, noting that the reports are anecdotal and that rigorous double-blinded studies have not found evidence that allergies to food additives exist.

But many allergists say such reactions are extremely rare, noting that the reports are anecdotal and that rigorous double-blinded studies have not found evidence that allergies to food additives exist.

“It’s very, very rare to see hives from a chemical that’s a food additive, because these are small molecules that typically don’t trigger allergic reactions,” said Dr. Scott Sicherer, a professor of pediatrics, allergy and immunology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “No one’s saying it doesn’t happen, but the reports in the literature are handfuls — they’re not in the thousands.”

In 1986, however, after more than a dozen deaths were linked to severe allergic reactions to sulfite preservatives used to prevent green vegetables from turning brown, the Food and Drug Administration banned restaurants from using sulfites on raw fruits and vegetables.

The agency also requires foods containing yellow dye No. 5 to list the color on the label, saying the dye can cause hives in rare cases, estimated at “fewer than one in 10,000 people.”

In recent years, however, as consumer demand for natural foods has risen, food manufacturers have been replacing synthetic additives with natural ones derived from plants, insects and other animal products. These natural substances are more likely to provoke an allergic reaction because they contain proteins that our immune systems might react to, said Dr. Ronald Simon, an allergist and immunologist at Scripps Clinic Carmel Valley in San Diego, who reviewed the literature for UpToDate, a clinical information resource used by doctors.

These natural additives include substances like a red food dye called carmine or cochineal extract, which is made from insects; a yellow dye made from the fruit of the annatto tree; psyllium, a source of dietary fiber derived from seed husks; and guar gum, which is made from a bean and is used as a binder and emulsifier in food and drugs. All of these have been implicated in rare cases of anaphylaxis.

Allergic reactions have also been reported from carrageenin, a thickener derived from seaweed; the jelling agent pectin; gelatin; and Mycoprotein/, a fermented fungus used as a meat substitute and marketed under the brand name Quorn.

Our immune system recognizes these natural proteins, Dr. Simon said, “because it evolved to protect us against invading organisms and to recognize protein structures in fungi and bacteria or cancer cells.” He said the immune system is less likely to recognize a synthetic additive. (Dr. Simon acknowledged he has served as a consultant on food additives for the International Association of Color Manufacturers.)

Dr. Swerlick, the dermatologist who treated Ms. Eisenberg, agreed that reactions to synthetic additives are rare and not well understood, making them even more difficult to identify. In a 2013 paper, he described 11 patients he had seen over a five-year period, all of whom came in with chronic skin disorders that cleared up significantly when drugs containing coloring were replaced by dye-free medications. (Skeptics say that hives generally come and go and there is no proof that the removal of dyes caused the patients’ skin to clear.)

Each of Dr. Swerlick’s cases was slightly different, he said, so it was “a bit of detective work.” One 61-year-old patient had chronic skin problems on his hand, but the rash flared up suddenly, shortly after he refilled a prescription for diabetes pills and noticed that the color had changed from off-white to dark purple. The new pills, it turned out, contained a blue dye. Another patient, a 42-year-old man, had suffered from a rash for almost a year but noticed it resolved when he went on vacation and left his toothpaste, which contained a blue dye, at home.

Many of the patients had “a drug allergy list that’s 20 drugs long,” Dr. Swerlick said. “You realize they can’t be allergic to all these medications. It must be something common to all of them, like a dye. That’s one of the clues.”

He said people concerned about dye additives should watch for reactions to items that contain food coloring, such as red velvet cake and drinks like Powerade and Crystal Light. Patients can look up the ingredients in prescription and nonprescription drugs by reading the label or using the online resource Daily Med.

Unlike severe allergic reactions to a food, like peanuts, which occur immediately, the reactions to additives tend to be delayed for several hours or even days, making them difficult to trace, he said, and there are no good diagnostic tools for identifying food additive allergies. One hint that you may have an allergy to an additive is if you develop a reaction to a prepared product or a restaurant item, even though you tolerate the same food when you make it at home.

“There’s reason to be skeptical,” Dr. Swerlick said. “But I think the allergy community historically has equated absence of proof with proof of absence.”",Could You Be Allergic to Additives in Food or Drugs?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/well/eat/could-you-be-allergic-to-additives-in-food-or-drugs.html

Manual driving is outlawed. Our cars are better drivers than we ever were. And not only that, they coordinate with one another in an elegant choreography, threading through traffic with inches to spare. Parking becomes parkland, because no cars ever stay still for long; they stop only to recharge themselves as needed. If you choose, you can just hang out at home and let the robocars bring you everything you need. But even if that future does arrive, it would come with a trunkful of nagging questions. What does it feel like to live in that world? And how does 21st-century society — which has been built, in ways large and small, around human drivers — change and reconfigure when they all become mere riders? In the pages that follow, we begin to wonder at some answers.

Cities Without Signs By Clive Thompson Street signage is the iconography of the automobile age. It’s like highly functional pop art: silhouettes of schoolchildren, white arrows, rectangular cries of WRONG WAY and, most central of all, the ubiquitous stoplight. The traffic light might be the first part of that iconographic world to be transformed, or vanish altogether, once we are fully in the age of autonomous cars. Robots, after all, won’t need signs to optimize the way they move through urban landscapes. Urban-transportation experts have been busily creating computer simulations to show how this might work. In one model, each crossroads would have an “intersection manager,” a computer that senses the approaching traffic and uses wireless communication to talk to the oncoming cars. When each self-driving car is perhaps 300 yards away, it sends a request to the intersection manager — to turn right, say, or to move on through. The intersection manager then does an on-the-fly calculation to route that vehicle most efficiently, like an omnipotent and tireless traffic cop. The result? A ballet of cars whizzing and weaving past one another in the intersection. Some slow down as they approach; others pass straight through. But crucially, compared with today’s intersections, many fewer cars come to a complete halt. This could significantly speed up traffic throughout an entire city. Peter Stone, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin who works with one model, has found that the “delay” time at intersections shrinks remarkably. “Right now, it takes me an average of 20 minutes to get to work, but with autonomous-car intersections, it might be half that time,” he says. Safety would be enhanced, too: Forty-three percent of car crashes in the United States occur at intersections, and Stone predicts that robot vehicles would crash only if there was a mechanical error. Better yet, autonomous intersections could produce an estimated 20 to 50 percent less carbon dioxide, because there would be fewer idling cars and jack-rabbit starts. “That’s the most expensive and most polluting part of driving,” says Remi Tachet des Combes, a mathematician who created robot-intersection models while at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For the human passenger, though, a robotized intersection could be mildly terrifying — like flying through a crowded asteroid belt, trusting the A.I. to find the right path. “At first I think it will be freaky,” Stone admits. “Some people will need the window darkened so they don’t freak out.” But in the long run, we’ll probably shrug, get used to it and barely look up from our games of Candy Crush as we zip through. And pedestrians? They would probably push a button at the intersection to request their turn — or even use a smartphone app. More subtly unsettling, however, might be the spectacle of a city devoid of stoplights. Indeed, devoid of all major street signs: no huge billboards across highways naming the exits, no complex merge instructions. Those signs are expensive to build and maintain. They’re designed for humans, and GPS-brained robots don’t need them to know where they’re going. Certainly, human pedestrians and cyclists will still need guideposts, but as Stone suspects, far fewer, and smaller, ones. A world with almost no street signs would feel strange. It could make a city less cluttered and more attractive. But it might also leave us feeling unmoored. Social critics worry that GPS has already eroded our knowledge of the city; some studies have found that the more we rely on devices, the less we deeply intuit where we are and how to navigate on our own. “We become more helpless,” as Greg Milner, the author of “Pinpoint,” a history of GPS, told me. If robots rule the roads, we might get where we’re going a lot more quickly — but end up not knowing precisely where we are. Clive Thompson is the author of “Smarter Than You Think: How Technology Is Changing Our Minds for the Better.”

Picturing the Self-Driving City By Anna Wiener Marshall Brown, an associate professor of architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology, recently traveled to Ann Arbor, Mich., to visit the Mcity Test Facility, the University of Michigan’s 32-acre testing ground for automated vehicles. Mcity, which looks like a soundstage of a midcentury suburb, is a simulator: It has no actual residents. Still, Brown found it “bizarre and frankly frightening” that it looked as though the track had been designed almost entirely by transportation experts, not urban planners or architects. He identified it as part of a larger problem: As technologists imagine the driverless world, they seem to be doing so with a distinct lack of imagination. Brown is a creator of the Driverless City Project, an interdisciplinary research initiative at I.I.T. that takes a playful, rigorous approach to envisioning the fully autonomous future. The project helps participants generate various situations for a city in order to determine how autonomous cars will fit into the picture. Central to the project is a “mind map” representing the group’s research, organized into four areas of impact: street space, parking space, commuter space and delivery space. The map, as well as other tools — including a set of large tokens for scenario building, like a tarot deck for urbanists — is meant to encourage others to be ambitious and creative about the world in which they want to live. “We should write the future,” Brown says, “rather than trying to predict it.” Brown has found two prevalent attitudes when it comes to self-driving vehicles: either an active but unimaginative approach, rushing to build robots to accommodate the world as it is now, or a totally passive approach, a sort of “wait and see.” The first, he says, is characteristic of the tech industry; the second, of the public sector. “I hear too much surrendering in the question about our future right now,” he adds. “Just surrendering to Google or Amazon, or surrendering to your phone, or surrendering to a driverless car. We should not surrender.” One way to stave off surrender, Brown believes, is to invite more diverse thinkers, like architects and urban planners, into the process of imagining and designing the autonomous future. (He also listed sociologists, fiction writers, Buddhist monks, poets and rabbis as useful stakeholders.) The current discourse around the future of autonomous vehicles is centered on “technologically deterministic fantasies,” Brown says. He’s concerned that technological values — like logic, predictability and efficiency — will be erroneously imposed upon the built environment, leading to urban spaces that fail to take into account delight, pleasure or human connection. “A society is cultural, and political, and aesthetic, and about desires — it’s not just how you solve problems,” he says. “They’re going to need more than just software engineers working on it.” As an architect, Brown is especially attuned to the unlocked aesthetic potential of urban environments. Today’s visual clutter, necessary for keeping human-driven cars as nonlethal as possible, could be eradicated. It is critical, in his view, to consider the beauty and quality of the world that self-driving cars could bring. It’s worth considering, then, where cars will go when people don’t need them. “What happens when a car can park itself anywhere?” Brown asks. He hypothesizes that parking, if performed robotically, could become “a negative externality, not unlike that of a trash dump,” should developers repurpose garages and parking lots for more lucrative uses. (Why look for parking in Greenwich Village if the car can park itself on the edge of New Jersey?) In the Midwest, he speculates, deindustrialized cities with waning property values could even be bought wholesale and transformed into vast, flat parking lots — a future that he deemed plausible, if “too dystopian,” in no small part because of the likelihood that it would be pushed upon lower-income communities. On the other hand, those same communities could benefit from increased mobility and access to employment. Brown is also considering the changes to storage: If robotic trucks constantly roam our landscape, will warehouses be abandoned? He’s focused on the changing needs and desires of a human driver. To accommodate an autonomous, cross-country route, truck cabs, he speculates, may need to expand according to a driver’s needs, perhaps going so far as to resemble a microapartment. An emphasis (or lack thereof) on efficiency also addresses the temporal dimension of cities: It favors — or facilitates — a working lifestyle in which there is never enough time. In a future of increased automation and accessibility, work culture may begin to shift; labor, and its attendant time constraints, may no longer be central to the urban experience. Brown envisions the possibility of a hands-free commute that opens up space for socializing — “an interior social world.” Riders could chat with people in adjacent cars or simply take the opportunity to watch the world go by. (A more cynical take on this, he says, is that the hands-free commute will simply increase the demands on workers, as the car becomes an extension of the home office — a WeWork on wheels.) Second-order effects of autonomous vehicles tend to get lost in the techno-utopian chatter, but there seems to be an increasing awareness that self-driving cars won’t just arrive in cities; they’ll change them too. Some tech companies are beginning to get into data-driven city-building, a movement largely galvanized by the seeming inevitability of autonomous vehicles. Last year, Y Combinator announced a research initiative, New Cities, that aimed to study how to build a metropolis entirely from scratch. In mid-October, Sidewalk Labs, an Alphabet subsidiary, announced that it will redevelop a 12-acre strip along Toronto’s waterfront, called Quayside, which will integrate technology across the human experience. The vehicles it is planning to accommodate will be shared, electric and self-driving. Power and control over autonomous-vehicle technology is already concentrated in the hands of a small few: If a company like Uber or Alphabet controls the dominant transportation infrastructure, you need not live in an intentional community like Quayside to feel as though your city is becoming a company town. Brown is wary of the smart-cities initiative, and he resents the efforts of technology companies to fully saturate the human — and urban — experience. “A city is not a problem to be solved,” he says. “A city is a cultural construct, even though it involves the deployment of technologies. A city is not science alone.” Anna Wiener is a writer based in San Francisco.

The Augmented-Reality Windshield By Ferris Jabr For obvious reasons, our present-day cars are designed for keen observation of the outside world, offering a nearly panoramic view of the road and landscape through panels of glass. The parade of images flitting past a car’s windows can be exhilarating or can induce a kind of pleasurable trance. By virtue of being transparent and inert, however, windows are inherently limited. Although we have begun to augment the car’s field of vision with new layers of information — phones suction-cupped to the windshield, or GPS built into the dashboard — there is still so much useful knowledge just out of reach. Today’s windows allow you to scope out a parking spot or search for that tiny cafe with the faded sign, but they can’t help you find them. Nor can they show you exactly where that highway exit will lead or identify the odd building you just passed. Tomorrow’s could. Unlike Google Glass — which awkwardly placed screens where they didn’t need to be — a car already requires a membrane between passengers and their environment. Why not turn that typically passive barrier into a dynamic canvas? Ordinary windows could be replaced with holographic glass or an advanced semitranslucent liquid-crystal display. They could anticipate our needs and instantaneously display weather forecasts, reviews of nearby restaurants and hotels, details about popular tourist attractions — and warnings about miserable tourist traps. As the technology improves and people become more comfortable obscuring their surroundings, your windows could begin to overlay a vast digital diorama onto passing scenery. Passengers would no longer have to wonder about the identity of a landmark and scramble to look it up on their phones. Instead, the car itself, wired with artificial intelligence, plugged into sophisticated mapping technology and equipped with magic eyes, would instantaneously recognize, annotate and augment its surroundings. A mountain, desert or coastline could become an interactive infographic, peeling away the physical surface of the earth to reveal hidden layers of geology. A self-directed double-decker bus ambling through London could rearrange the city like a Lego set, refashioning streets and buildings to illuminate the capital’s rich history. Early television sets made the distant accessible; the self-driving car could reveal the invisible in the immediate. As exciting as such possibilities are, recent history suggests plenty of reasons to temper our optimism. When windows double as screens, we will have the opportunity to gaze at the world anew through richly animated portals. Alternatively — and perhaps more realistically — we could end up staring into larger versions of our phones, distracting ourselves with email, mindless games and the infinite bazaar of the internet. The potential of the autonomous vehicle is to help us interact with our environment in ways never before possible. The temptation is to turn ever more inward, exchanging the physical world for yet another simulation. Either way, self-driving cars with ubiquitous screens will inevitably bring all the familiar drawbacks of digital media onto the open road. Taxi TV in New York City is just a preview of the potential nightmare. What if the price for enchanted windows of the future is a nauseating kaleidoscope of advertisements, vapid movie reviews and contextless late-night jokes? Rather than learning about the hidden history of your surroundings, you may very well learn only about two-for-one cricket tacos in the food truck a lane over, homeowner’s insurance for the Anthropocene or the sale on microdrones at a nearby mall.

The Seizure of Commuting Time By Rahawa Haile One big question about the driverless car will be who gets to own our new wealth of free time. Will it remain with commuters — or will corporations expect them to tap into the office as their vehicles ferry them there? While the potential for hours of unplugged leisure exists, the way we currently fill our downtime leads me to believe that some form of digital immersion will take precedence, as bosses expect employees to work on their way to and from work. It wouldn’t be surprising to see the remaining minimum-wage positions in the rapidly automating food industry go to those who have access to driverless cars; use their cars for deliveries while they work, and you get two employees for the price of one. It’s tricky. On their surface, driverless cars will take some of the mess out of living, but they can also take the living where they don’t want to go, both psychologically and physically. Some car interiors might more closely resemble cubicles. Or cells. Will private employers surveil workers in order to control off-duty behavior? It’s also easy to conceive of a future where newly created infrastructure, explicitly dedicated to automated vehicles, will enable people with the means to own the cars to avoid the people without. We should be wary of any technology that allows those with power to distance themselves even further from society. Rahawa Haile is an Eritrean-American writer of short stories and essays.

Nonstop Teenage Party By Geoff Manaugh In a short essay published in 1970, the British architect David Greene suggested that his colleagues pay more attention to cars. “A traffic jam is a collection of rooms,” he explained, and “so is a car park — they are really instantly formed and constantly changing communities.” It was a memorable observation that nonetheless would surprise few teenagers, who long ago embraced the transformative notion that cars are not just rooms, but rooms they can control. Autonomous cars will once again transform teenage life. Anab Jain, a founder of the design studio Superflux, says the ritual requirements of teenage socializing will inspire “a new range of acts and services that help you obfuscate your car’s identity or your own data.” Instead of trying to roll back the odometer on the family car à la Ferris Bueller, teenagers hoping to roam the city, free from parental view, might trick it into recording destinations they didn’t really visit. “The whole notion of freedom will change,” Jain says, even as some of the destinations remain familiar. Dark streets or quiet state parks where GPS doesn’t reach would be the coolest sites of all. The question of when, exactly, the party has started will also become an intriguing one: After all, each car is a room unto itself. The Situationist International, a loose group of artists, political agitators and heavy drinkers who roamed the streets of Paris and other cities in the 1960s, treating them as arenas for detours and debauchery, offers some clues about how such rooms could be transformed. “I only ever hear self-driving cars talked about as a functional solution to the problem of getting from A to B,” says McKenzie Wark, the author of a history of the Situationists called “The Beach Beneath the Street.” (The title is a reference to the sand that was revealed when protesters picked up cobblestones from the Paris streets to throw at the police.) Wark imagines these machines rolling out of the factory with more radical settings hard-wired into their operating systems. “A hybrid of the self-driving car and, say, Grindr could bring a whole new meaning to the concept of cruising,” Wark suggests. “There should be a ‘scenic route’ setting, a ‘random’ setting, a ‘surprise me’ setting. Or maybe ‘mystery destination,’ which whisks you — and algorithmically chosen others — to an undisclosed location. Algorithmic chicken for teenage drivers, where you drive head-on toward another car — then magically swerve off at the last minute.” Unlike today’s cars, autonomous cars can also be made to swarm together, creating somewhat of a paradox: a moving traffic jam. Once the swarm is formed, proximity algorithms could mine social-media profiles to arrange like-minded clusters, while enabling “shuffle mode” might one day be the equivalent of texting a friend to rescue you from the boring guy in the corner. Aspiring D.J.s will rely on software to assemble self-driving cars into the ideal configuration for louder bass. Couples armed with GPS jammers — the future’s perfect Valentine’s Day gift — will quietly steer strangers away, creating a halo of romantic privacy around their makeout sessions. If all else fails, hit “skip” to be transported to an entirely new party. Hidden beneath the hormone haze of future block parties, new opportunities for cultural pranks and political protest will emerge. Rather than throw cobblestones, protesters could quickly jam the streets to show political solidarity or organize a strike. With the right programming skills, they might be able to shut down a whole city just by blocking a few crucial nodes. They could even open the streets back up to foot traffic, remaking them as a space for celebration. Then, of course, when it’s time to go home, all those dull factory presets, optimized for safety and efficiency, will finally come into their own — no designated driver necessary. Geoff Manaugh is the author of “A Burglar’s Guide to the City.”

Your Autonomous Dealer By Jamie Lauren Keiles Drug dealers tend to choose cars at the extremes — on the one hand a cocaine-white G-Wagen, on the other a ’98 Toyota Tercel. Each suggests a kind of shady guarantee that the self-driving car isn’t likely to sustain. Like most new stuff from Silicon Valley, the autonomous car is bound to be cute — a gumdrop whip fit for a Pixar protagonist. Hardly what you dream of when you’re trying to score. If drugs are still cool, they’ll have stayed that way in part because of their illicitness and the mild supply-line chaos that brute fact engenders: the inconsistent product, unreliable hookups and hours spent waiting for the dealer to arrive. Self-driving cars will succeed only by reducing and avoiding such chaos as much as possible. If these two industries are ever to play nice, then the success of one will come at the cost of the cool-guy reputation of the other. In the self-driving future, a weed transaction will begin the same as always — by texting your dealer in search of “tree,” or by casually asking if he wants to “hang out.” En route to another customer’s house, he will text back immediately, freed from the imposition of two hands on the wheel. Memories of waiting impatiently on a flaky dealer will recede as his car appears on your app, predicting arrival time down to the minute. Watch as his vehicle weaves around school zones, or is maybe flagged and pulled over by the police. The new possibilities for surveillance are endless. In any case, if he makes it to your house, it is likely that he will emerge from his self-driving pod in a sweatshirt for a company with a name like TōkTaxi or Gangl.ly or Lyft’d. As weed begins to trend toward legality, we’ve already seen such standing-desk branding start to creep into the stoner vernacular. A scan down PC Magazine’s “15 Blazing Hot Weed Tech Companies to Watch” reveals Tokken (a blockchain system for dealers), MassRoots (a stoner social network) and Eaze (the obligatory “Uber for weed”). In this new age of cannabis, the only thing that moves faster than the tech is the rate at which smoking itself becomes corny. But cringe-worthy orthography is not the only thing that this self-driven industry will inherit from Silicon Valley. In the age of semiautonomous cars, dealers will be forced to file 1099s, sharing their profits as lowly subcontractors. As in the time when dealers drove themselves, this fleet of buddies-for-hire will offer five to 10 minutes of humanity-affirming chitchat. Unlike preautonomous dealers, they will plead that you tweet their referral codes in order to receive a complimentary edible. This, of course, is one good reason to strive for fully autonomous drugmobiles. The driverless vehicle eliminates small talk, supplying your fix directly from the glove box with a personalized passcode, à la Amazon Locker. With no human body attached to the cargo, suppliers will seek to move harder drugs, in bigger quantities, potentially unleashing a new set of problems. The narc, a liability throughout all of human history, isn’t likely to go anywhere soon. Self-driving cars will scan for hazards in the street but will also pickup telltale signs of an informant: nervous twitches, too-enthusiastic slang. A customer might even be asked to answer a question like, “Are you a cop?” (Because, as all drug dealers know, a real cop has to say yes, even to an A.I.) It is likely that a database of narcs will be compiled, and inevitably, this database of narcs will be hacked. Millions of Americans will be exposed as poseurs — a social problem tragically immune to disruption. Jamie Lauren Keiles is a writer in New York.

Policing With No Tickets By Gareth Cook The temptation is the greatest on nights when the evening rush seems to congeal around the car, and she just wants to be home. She waits until she has left downtown (too many traffic towers), and then, with a few taps to a screen, she goes for it. Chinese software hacks come well recommended, and it’s soon clear why: The car picks up speed and begins to weave through the slower traffic — pleasingly aggressive but more sure in its lines, with less lurching, than the typical Russian black-market goods. She returns to her movie, but before long she hears a chime and a grating alert: “Traffic ticket assessed.” She spots a police car speeding past, a quad drone fixed to the roof, as her own vehicle reverts to its factory settings and rejoins the docile march of the lemmings. In the coming world of ubiquitous self-driving, it will just be you, the open road and the vast apparatus of the nanny state. Cars won’t readily violate traffic laws and may well be legally required to report on their owners. Ignore that burned-out headlight for too long, and the overnight software update may include a virtual boot. Traffic tickets bring in billions of dollars annually, so all those well-behaved cars will have an economic impact. Governments that have historically viewed traffic citations as an extractive industry (Ferguson, Mo., say, or the State of California) will have no choice but to find alternatives. Far more consequential, for both the police and their communities, will be the death of the routine traffic stop. The Supreme Court has ruled that law enforcement may stop any car, whatever its true motive, as long as an infraction is observed. Human drivers can’t get far without breaking the letter of the traffic law, so the pretexts come easy. If officers then spot a dozen laptops stacked on the back seat, they can ask questions. Yet this broad, virtually unchecked power to stop has led to charges of racial profiling. (A recent linguistic analysis of bodycam footage from Oakland, Calif., for example, concluded that officers spoke “with consistently less respect toward black versus white community members.”) With pretexts largely automated away, these kinds of interactions will be rare. “The self-driving car,” says Elizabeth Joh, a professor at the U.C. Davis School of Law, “will come to be seen as a civil rights issue.” The police will have lost an important investigative tool, but the government will have gained new surveillance possibilities. Cars will sweep up vast amounts of data about their surroundings and their occupants, including 24/7 GPS trails. (An important Fourth Amendment case being heard this fall, Carpenter v. United States, will decide whether the government needs a warrant to gain access to cellphone locational data, setting a precedent that could apply to cars.) Another potential target is the pedestrian. In the first part of the 20th century, manufacturers lobbied to make “jaywalking” a crime, so the new horseless carriages could cruise along urban streets relatively unimpeded. The pedestrians of the future, emboldened by the fact that self-driving cars are sure to stop, could cause havoc. No worries, though: Facial-recognition technology is coming along nicely, and the automotive industry will be, if anything, even more powerful. Look for today’s complaints about speeding tickets to be replaced by stories of “jaywalking traps” and pitiless fines for a second offense. Gareth Cook is a contributing writer for the magazine.

The Rise and Fall of Aquacars By Jennifer Kahn Looking back at the decades when the autonomous car was developed, you may find it hard to believe that its engineers imagined that it would stay landbound. All along, sea levels continued to rise, gradually overwhelming the sea walls that many coastal cities built as protection and flooding the (now absurdly named) ground floor of apartment and office buildings. Rather than simply abandon these buildings, though, many residents chose to stay — fueling a demand for autonomous aquacars and, as that technology improved, for mobile aquahomes. This became especially true after the successful completion of the SeaOrbiter, a floating laboratory originally designed for oceanography research. Elegant and semisubmersible, the SeaOrbiter acted as a kind of prototype for local offshore living — and the rise of aerial drone delivery, originally pioneered by Amazon, made the challenge of resupplying straightforward. Unfortunately, hackers quickly figured out how to hijack the aquahomes’ navigation system — first by disabling it and then with programs that directed vessels to floating “chop shops” run by roving gangs of ship-breakers. Piracy rates dropped only after huge kelp growth, driven by a mix of ocean warming and overfishing, rendered the submerged communities as unnavigable by aquacars as they had been by roadbound ones. Jennifer Kahn last wrote for the magazine about the YouTube series “Primitive Technology.”

Ninety minutes later, the lawmaker — Michael Fallon, the defense secretary — stepped down, saying he had “behaved inappropriately in the past.”

“It’s exhausting, challenging something so powerful as a political establishment, that is self-protecting and self-preserving,” Ms. Merrick said. “To try to get a chink in that armor is so exhausting.”

On Tuesday, the crisis apparently encompassed a death: Carl Sargeant, who was dismissed as a minister in the Welsh government last week amid allegations of sexual misconduct, was found in his home, apparently a suicide. He had denied any wrongdoing.

The scandal has hit Prime Minister Theresa May at a difficult time, as she struggles to control warring factions in her party and break free from a deadlock in negotiations for Britain’s exit from the European Union, known as Brexit. On Monday, she promised to create a cross-party body to investigate complaints of misconduct, something some female lawmakers have sought for years.

Hanging over Mrs. May’s head are allegations against her deputy and longtime friend, Damian Green, the first secretary of state. Mrs. May called for an investigation into the case last week after a Conservative Party activist wrote that he had touched her knee and sent her suggestive text messages. Mr. Green has called the allegations by the activist, Kate Maltby, “untrue” and “deeply hurtful.”

Mrs. May has also ordered a Cabinet Office inquiry into Mark Garnier, her international trade minister, who has acknowledged asking his assistant to buy sex toys. In all, about a dozen members of Parliament, eight from the Conservative Party and four from Labour, are under investigation. One Tory, Charlie Elphicke, was suspended after “serious allegations” were referred to the police, the party has said. He has denied any wrongdoing.

“Britain’s political class feels pretty fragile right now,” said Tom McTague, the chief Britain correspondent for Politico and author of “Betting the House,” a new book on this year’s general election, in which the Conservative Party lost its overall majority, although it managed to cling to power.

“When something like this starts to get going, they just feel out of control,” he said. “The M.P.s don’t know where this is going. They don’t know how many allegations are going to come. They don’t know how to get on top of it.”

The episodes have unfolded against the peculiar structure of Britain’s Parliament: The 650 members of the House of Commons hire, employ and manage their staff personally, as if they were small-business owners.

Jess Phillips, 36, a Labour member of Parliament who worked with victims of sexual abuse before entering politics, recalled showing up on her first day in 2015 and asking a senior colleague where her employees should turn with workplace complaints.

“They said, ‘There is no place,’” she said. “I said, ‘Well, what if that was the case?’ I got a shrug in response. I see a lot of young women working here, around very powerful people, and I worry.”

Ms. Phillips began receiving calls from employees with complaints 10 days ago, she said, and has heard from one or two people every day since. Many of the complaints fall well short of a criminal threshold.

“The truth of the matter is, to me, the varying degrees didn’t matter,” she said. “There is a cultural problem where people are using their power for sexual gain, or to hold over women who work in here.”

Party whips, who historically served as a clearinghouse for complaints about officials’ behavior, were also responsible for protecting the party from damage — and for persuading or coercing the members of Parliament to get in line. According to political legend, past whips collected compromising information in a “black book,” to be used as leverage at some future point.

Tim Fortescue, who served as the Tory chief whip in the 1970s, told the BBC that he had often helped lawmakers who feared prosecution.

“It might be debt, it might be a scandal involving small boys, or any kind of scandal,” he said. “We would do everything we can, because we would store up Brownie points. It’s a pretty nasty reason, but it’s one of the reasons. If we could get a chap out of trouble, they’d do as we ask forever.”

Over the weekend, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, herself a former whip, denied that parties had withheld reports of wrongdoing by members of Parliament.

“I don’t recognize some of those more lurid stories that are told about the sort of things whips knew and did,” she said. “I just don’t recognize it.”

But Ms. Merrick, who last week brought forth her complaint from 2003, said she saw no recourse when Mr. Fallon, then a member of Parliament, tried to kiss her after a working lunch, leaving her feeling “so humiliated and so ashamed.”

One of the main reasons she said nothing, she said, was that she was “scared of the whips,” who, if displeased, could prevent her from getting any political news.

“This behavior is reported to whips all the time,” she said. “If there is a new system in place, the whips will still be able to collect information, but staff and journalists will be able to report it openly, rather than it becoming part of the game of snakes and ladders that the whips are controlling.”

On the night last week when Mr. Fallon stepped down, she said, there was no sense of triumph, but instead the sense that she had set right a 14-year-old error.

Voters in Maine approved a ballot measure on Tuesday to allow many more low-income residents to qualify for Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, The Associated Press said. The vote was a rebuke of Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican who has repeatedly vetoed legislation to expand Medicaid.

At least 80,000 additional Maine residents will become eligible for Medicaid as a result of the referendum. Maine will be the 32nd state to expand the program under the health law, but the first where voters, not governors or legislators, decided the issue. Other states whose leaders have resisted expanding the program were closely watching the campaign, particularly Utah and Idaho, where newly formed committees are working to get Medicaid expansion on next year’s ballots.

Supporters, including advocacy groups that collected enough signatures to get the question on the ballot, said the measure would help financially fragile rural hospitals, create jobs and provide care for vulnerable people who have long gone without.

Old Rules, New Products

Wary of the push, the United States has used existing rules to stop Chinese purchases of foreign businesses in areas important to national security.

But many of those tools do not apply to today’s deals, as A.M.D.’s Chinese pact shows.

A.M.D.’s joint venture with its Chinese partner can be found in a gleaming industrial area of the city of Chengdu called Tianfu Software Park.

The park represents Beijing’s vision of the future. Trees and sidewalks jammed with ride-sharing bikes sit beneath a vast strip of office towers, hotels and apartment complexes. Offices of China’s most innovative companies, like Huawei and Tencent, sit next to outposts of their foreign analogues, like SAP and Accenture.

Inside one of its glass towers, A.M.D. works with its Chinese partner, a company called Sugon, to produce new chips.

Under the nearly $300 million deal, A.M.D. agreed to license chip technology to a Chinese joint venture with Sugon to make chips for servers. Because A.M.D. controls that joint venture, the technology is considered to remain in American hands.

But A.M.D. struck a second partnership that the Chinese company controls. That joint venture works on applications such as integrating the chips with servers. The two ventures are on the 11th and 12th floors of the same building.

Experts say the dual partnerships could help China develop a new generation of powerful supercomputers. China already makes the world’s fastest computers, but they run on homegrown chips that cannot read commonly available software for supercomputers. With A.M.D.’s help, experts say, Sugon could develop chips that could make China’s supercomputers more versatile and adaptable and replace those from foreign firms.

“We have worked closely with and been very clear with U.S. government officials on the strategy and specifics of the technology, which is classified as permitted for export,” an A.M.D. spokesman said in an emailed statement. He added that the processors are also lower performing than other options that A.M.D. sells in America.

Executives in Chengdu said there was a firewall between the two joint ventures, and the one outside of A.M.D.’s control was not involved in chip development.

Yet in an interview with the Chinese state news media, Zhang Yunquan, a top government researcher and head of the National Supercomputing Center in Jinan, China, said that Sugon could use the work of the joint venture to make supercomputer microchips. Such a supercomputer would be crucial in designing next-generation weapons systems, according to experts.

“When they first announced the partnership I was shocked,” said Stacy Rasgon, a semiconductor analyst with Sanford Bernstein.

“You would think intellectual property and joint ventures would belong under Cfius review,” Mr. Rasgon said, referring to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign deals. “It should. It’s surprising it isn’t.”

New Rules for a New Era?

For some in the Trump administration, an 18-year-old book by two Chinese Air Force colonels has become required reading.

Called “Unrestricted Warfare,” the book argues that China does not need to match the United States militarily. Instead China can take advantage of the global economy and the internet to take down its main rival.

Some American officials see in it a guide to China’s plan. Some United States lawmakers are proposing to toughen American takeover laws to evaluate deals on an economic as well as a national security basis. They are also pressing for reviews of licensing agreements and joint ventures. The United States trade representative has also launched an investigation into whether Chinese companies are stealing intellectual property.

“There’s concern that U.S. firms are transacting away their competitive advantages,” said Greg Levesque, managing director of Pointe Bello, a research firm in Washington, and a former executive at the US-China Business Council.

Such changes could ripple through the tech world. Chinese investment often means more money with fewer strings attached. Some tech companies say that is good for innovation. China’s spending on science and research is also growing at a time when the United States government and others are cutting back.

Still, many American companies fear the deck is stacked against them. The United States long believed bringing China into the World Trade Organization, which oversees global trade disputes, would ensure it would follow the rules. But the W.T.O. has proved ineffective when it comes to tech issues.

At a recent dinner event in Washington, an American technology executive held up a dinner plate to illustrate the size of the China market, said a person who was there who asked not to be identified because the event was not public. Then the American executive held up a wine coaster that represented the size of his firm’s business.

The message was clear: American companies are at risk of being muscled out of the market.

“Made in China 2025 seems to reject all notions of comparative advantage and future opportunities for high-value-added manufactured exports from the rest of the world to China,” said Jeremie Waterman, president of the China Center at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

“If Made in China 2025 achieves its goals,” he said, “the U.S. and other countries would likely become just commodity exporters to China — selling oil, gas, beef and soybeans.”",China’s Technology Ambitions Could Upset the Global Trade Order,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/business/made-in-china-technology-trade.html

Op-Ed Contributors Why Is America Wasting So Much Energy? Image Federal programs like Energy Star are under threat in Washington. Credit Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

Partisan fights in Washington can leave the impression that we’re hopelessly divided. The truth is there are plenty of bipartisan solutions to the energy and environmental challenges we face, and energy efficiency is near the top of the list.

America fails to capture some two-thirds of the power it generates, much of it through simple waste, according to federal data . In a recent survey, the United States was ranked eighth among 23 of the world’s top energy-consuming countries in efficiency, behind several European nations, China and Japan.

We shouldn’t accept that.

Energy efficiency is one of the most powerful resources we have for meeting our energy and environmental goals. It is also an enormous economic opportunity.

Setting aside the significant environmental impact, this energy waste costs American businesses and households billions of dollars every year. In commercial buildings alone, where annual electricity costs are roughly $190 billion, about 30 percent of this energy goes to waste.

We’re making progress. Federal programs like Energy Star (which identifies and clearly labels the most efficient products on the market) are saving American consumers and businesses billions of dollars per year while reducing power plant pollution. Also, America’s utilities are doing their part, investing $7.5 billion annually in cost-effective electricity and natural gas efficiency programs.

Yet many of the federal efficiency programs stimulating this progress are under threat in Washington. The Trump administration has proposed killing Energy Star and all but eliminating other efficiency programs, with cuts averaging nearly 80 percent. Congress wisely rejected these proposals initially for the short term, but legislation recently passed by the House isn’t much better, proposing to cut many of these money-saving and job-creating programs nearly in half.

A House subcommittee was scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss altering Energy Star in ways that could compromise the program, which supporters call one of America’s most successful public-private partnerships. The government-backed effort estimates it has saved consumers and businesses $430 billion on their utility bills since its launch in 1992, and it has grown to 16,000 partners (including a wide range of manufacturers, retailers, builders and utilities).

Eliminating or weakening Energy Star and other efficiency programs is absolutely going in the wrong direction.

Energy efficiency is not new — it was our grandparents’ energy policy: Don’t waste. Save as much as you can for later when you, or future generations, might need it.

We need energy efficiency to accommodate emerging technologies and population growth, which are putting demands on our electricity grids that our grandparents never imagined. We can do so much more than shutting off our lights or keeping a close eye on the thermostat.

That’s where smart policy and programs come into play.

Our federal agencies run some of the most innovative efficiency programs in the world. They work with American manufacturers on the latest efficiency technologies to improve productivity and competitiveness. They develop efficiency standards for household appliances, saving families an average of $500 per year. They provide testing and expertise to local and state governments trying to adopt the most effective building-efficiency codes for homes and commercial buildings.

This is not federal bureaucracy run amok. It’s good government that will save taxpayers money and drive our economy. To critics who say that “government intervention isn’t needed to save energy” or “efficiency standards are intrusive federal mandates,” the best response is simply to invoke a decades-long record of economic and environmental success across the nation, dating back at least 30 years, when the first legislation authorizing federal efficiency standards was signed by President Ronald Reagan.

Today, according to the Energy Department, energy efficiency supports 2.2 million American jobs — from contractors weatherizing houses to workers manufacturing more efficient appliances and equipment. Imagine how many more jobs could be created if we were to turn our waste into opportunity.

Evidence shows that Americans of all stripes want reasonable energy efficiency policies. Shortly after the November 2016 election, a poll released by the Conservative Energy Network found that 94 percent of respondents said policies supporting energy efficiency were important.

Among those who supported Donald Trump, the number was 90 percent.

It’s hard to beat those numbers. Congress should come together and deliver strong funding for federal efficiency programs. Energy efficiency presents both Republicans and Democrats with an opportunity to reach consensus on an issue that is good for their constituents and the environment. Taxpayers and customers win. It’s a nonpartisan solution to a nonpartisan challenge.

But when Ms. Thurman lobbed a line like, “I can’t control who falls in love with me,” it landed.
“It’s physical de-escalation on an oppositional line,” Ms. Thurman explained with typical hyperarticulacy.","Plays, however, were Ms. Thurman’s first taste of acting. As a sophomore at her Massachusetts boarding school, she played the female lead in “The Crucible.” More than 30 years later, there was swagger in her throaty voice when she said, “It was an achievement for a sophomore to get the role that usually a senior gets.”

Some agents she’d met while modeling the summer before came to see the play. Their interest helped persuade her parents, Robert Thurman, a professor of Buddhist Studies at Columbia University, and Nena von Schlebrügge, a former fashion model who now helps to run Menla, a retreat in the Catskill Mountains, to let her transfer to Manhattan’s Professional Children’s School. By 17, she had booked her first four film roles, including a clamshell-born Venus in “The Adventures of Baron Munchausen” and the convent girl Cécile in “Dangerous Liaisons.”

“It wasn’t very difficult to cast her,” said Stephen Frears, the director of “Dangerous Liaisons,” speaking by telephone. “She was so striking, so beautiful and so fresh.”

She was also, as Mr. Frears said, “very formidable.” That’s a hallmark of her career and also maybe a clue to why that career has been so eclectic. Ms. Thurman isn’t a delicate actress or a melting one or the kind who comes right to the front of a movie screen and invites you in. There’s a remove in a lot of her best work (“Henry & June,” “Kill Bill”), a sense that she has emotions and ideas that are hers alone.

She has refused to be typecast as a siren or a femme fatale and has struggled to find roles that attract her. It isn’t that she won’t play wives and girlfriends — she will, she has. But these are women as likely to steal a scene as to yield to it.

Quentin Tarantino, who directed her as a gangster’s wife in “Pulp Fiction” and wrote the “Kill Bill” movies for her, compared Ms. Thurman to golden-age luminaries like Greta Garbo and Bette Davis. “There’s this year’s blonde and there’s last year’s blonde. Interchangeable. But to me, Uma has a quality that could rank with a Marlene Dietrich,” he said in a phone interview. He also called her, with affection, “a big, tall willow.”

Will Ms. Thurman’s old-Hollywood style play on Broadway? Her 1999 outing, as the film star Jennifer in Martin Crimp’s version of Molière’s “The Misanthrope,” didn’t dazzle critics. “She brings to mind a beautiful, sheltered girl at her first grown-up dance, putting on airs and hoping against hope she’ll get away with it,” Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times.

Did the tone of the responses surprise her? “I don’t expect anyone to pat me on the back,” she said. That script, a series of rhymed couplets barnacled with topical quips, “was so impenetrably difficult,” she said. “It was madness.”

Photo

Since then, the closest Ms. Thurman has come to a stage role was a guest-star arc on the first season of the NBC show “Smash,” in which she played Rebecca, a movie star trying to conquer Broadway, felled at an out-of-town tryout by a tainted smoothie.

Nothing so dramatic has affected “The Parisian Woman,” but Ms. Thurman and Mr. Willimon have both found themselves in the news for reasons unrelated to the play. As rehearsals began, accusations against Mr. Weinstein broke wide. As to whether she had personally been subject to abuse, Ms. Thurman gave the clipped response, “I’ll discuss it when I want to discuss it.” (In an “Access Hollywood” interview, which has since gone viral, she offered a similar answer, though in more obviously indignant tones.)

In late October, the allegations against Mr. Spacey also surfaced and production on “House of Cards,” was halted. (Mr. Willimon left the series in 2016.)

Though “The Parisian Woman” traffics in questions of sex and power, any discussion of these real-world events “never made its way into the rehearsal room,” Ms. MacKinnon said firmly.

Inside that room, a few days before the actors were to move into the theater for technical rehearsals, Ms. Thurman clacked onto the temporary set in teal heels, prop phone in her hand, gemstone glint in her eye. With mischief and languor, she subdued her lover (Marton Csokas) and teased her husband (Josh Lucas). (Mischief extended to her downtime, too. When this reporter slunk into the room, Ms. Thurman called brightly, “Write some fake news for us today!”)

The blocking for the scene wasn’t set yet; the pacing juddered. But when Ms. Thurman lobbed a line like, “I can’t control who falls in love with me,” it landed.

Ms. MacKinnon occasionally stopped the action to offer a suggestion. Sometimes the suggestions were Ms. Thurman’s. Maybe she could speak an early line more lightly. Maybe she should cross the stage later. She asked Ms. MacKinnon if she could sit during an argument with Mr. Csokas’s character, the better to soothe him. “It’s physical de-escalation on an oppositional line,” Ms. Thurman explained with typical hyperarticulacy.

Rehearsing a play has required some adjustments in the ways she attacks a role.

Last month, an Access Hollywood correspondent asked the actress Uma Thurman to comment on abuse of power in Hollywood, presumably in light of the sexual assault allegations against the producer Harvey Weinstein. Speaking slowly and deliberately, through gritted teeth, Thurman responded, “I don’t have a tidy soundbite for you, because I’ve learned — I am not a child — and I have learned that when I’ve spoken in anger I usually regret the way I express myself. So I’ve been waiting to feel less angry. And when I’m ready, I’ll say what I have to say.”

Thurman is seething, like we have all been seething, in our various states of breaking open or, as Thurman chooses, waiting. We are seething at how long we have been ignored, seething for the ones who were long ago punished for telling the truth, seething for being told all of our lives that we have no right to seethe. Thurman’s rage is palpable yet contained, conveying not just the tempestuous depths of #MeToo but a profound understanding of the ways that female anger is received and weaponized against women.

In the past few months alone we’ve seen Carmen Yulín Cruz, mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, pilloried by the far right for criticizing Donald Trump’s anemic response to Hurricane Maria (“We are dying here,” Cruz told the news media, “I am mad as hell.”) and the Florida congresswoman Frederica Wilson deluged with abuse after she characterized Trump’s call to the military widow Myeshia Johnson as “insensitive” and “an insult.” Both Cruz and Wilson were directly targeted by the president on Twitter, then incessantly memed and regurgitated and redigested and rememed by his obedient online horde.

Just this week, Juli Briskman, a government contractor, lost her job after a photo of her flipping off the presidential motorcade went viral. Solange, Britney Spears, Sinead O’Connor, the Dixie Chicks, Rosie O’Donnell — I struggle to think of women who lost their tempers in public and didn’t face ridicule, temporary ruin, or both.

“I’ve practiced up to a C above high C in the past,” she said in an interview in her dressing room. “So I know it’s in me. But it’s just nothing I’ve performed on any stage before.”

“When I saw Ariel the first time, it was like a dare,” she added, referring to the “Tempest” score. “And this is a double-dog dare.”

In “The Exterminating Angel,” based on the 1962 Luis Buñuel film, Ms. Luna plays Leticia, an opera diva who is part of a blue-bloods dinner party, the guests of which find themselves mysteriously unable to leave at the end of the evening. The vocal demands are a workout for almost every performer onstage.

“The note,” Mr. Adès said, “the range, the tessitura, is a metaphor for the ability to transcend these psychological and invisible boundaries that have grown up around them.”

Adding to the excitement of the high A is its placement in the score. Unlike in other high-flying parts — the imperious Queen of the Night in “The Magic Flute,” the spunky Zerbinetta in “Ariadne auf Naxos,” the long-suffering title role in “Lucia di Lammermoor” — there’s little time for Ms. Luna to warm up: The A is her very first note, sung before she’s even visible onstage. (She sings it again a short time later, as the party guests, in a surreal portent, leave the stage and re-enter.)

“It’s a moment of arrival,” Mr. Adès said. “It had to be on this note.”

Growing up in Oregon, Ms. Luna sang the daunting Queen of the Night when she was still in high school “just because it was fun,” she said. “And I liked the sensation it made in my bones, in my head, in my sinuses. It just gave me a high. It still gives me a high.”

Her topmost register is unusually lucid and effortless. Even in those notes unattainable by most other sopranos, and even when those notes are held far longer than the pecks requested by most other composers, Ms. Luna’s tone is full. She manages to avoid shrillness in what she aptly calls the “Wagnerian coloratura spectacle” that is her final “Exterminating Angel” aria, a flood of sustained superhigh sound up to F.

Even if nothing in previous Met history has equaled her high A, other singers have come close, sometimes adding unwritten interpolations and transpositions to show off their personal stratospheres. A number of the highest notes in Met history have emerged from sopranos singing the title part in “Lucia di Lammermoor”; it’s no coincidence that this is the role Ms. Luna’s character performs just before the dinner party at the start of “The Exterminating Angel.”

Ellen Beach Yaw, born near Buffalo in 1869, sang a G above C as Lucia in her single Met performance in 1908. The review in The New York Times praised her “flutelike Santos-Dumont notes,” comparing her to a Brazilian aviation pioneer, and added, in a reference to a Wild West gunslinger: “She hit that high G as promised, but it is like Bat Masterson hitting a tomato can with a .44 at four paces.”

The celebrated French soprano Lily Pons sustained a high F in the final mad scene from “Lucia” — sung, at her Met debut in 1931, “in legitimate note, not bird whistles or falsetto,” according to The New York Post. At the turn of the 20th century, Sibyl Sanderson, as Massenet’s Manon, hit a G, known as her “Eiffel Tower note.” Mado Robin, a French coloratura, was recorded shrilling up to a B flat, but she never sang at the Met.

More recently, Natalie Dessay was known in New York for her crystal-clear G’s as the mechanical doll Olympia in Offenbach’s “Les Contes d’Hoffmann.” Just this fall, Erin Morley’s Olympia ornaments brought her up to A flat, a feat Rachele Gilmore achieved in the role at the Met in 2009.

The company admits it is possible that an even higher note could have slipped through the archival cracks. “There’s no record keeping of such things, especially of improvised stuff,” said Peter Clark, the Met’s archivist, who remembers hearing Pons’s F on a radio broadcast as a child. “So it’s not to say that in 1908, say, something higher didn’t happen. But I doubt that it wouldn’t be mentioned somewhere.”

“The Exterminating Angel” isn’t the first time Mr. Adès has pushed a singer to extremes, nor was “The Tempest.” In fact, one of his very first works, “Five Eliot Landscapes” for soprano and piano, from 1990, ends on a sustained G flat.

“It’s a certain amount of useful cruelty involved,” he said with a chuckle, before correcting himself. “Not cruelty, but the callowness of youth.”

Callow or not, he’s still at it. Mr. Adès said that in the score of “The Tempest,” which had its premiere in London in 2004, he had placed a high G in brackets, indicating a note that at the time he only dreamed of hearing.

Chinese and American officials offered a taste on Wednesday, when they disclosed a series of deals they valued at $9 billion ahead of an event planned for Thursday with the two presidents. One, the sale of 50 Bell helicopters to a Chinese buyer, represented the kind of industrial export that Mr. Trump called for during his campaign. But several others were food sales that might do little to strengthen the United States’ industrial base. Many of the details were not disclosed.

The lack of progress on trade issues has led to grumbling among business types.

Several financial firms were interested in joining the trip to discuss Chinese restrictions on bank ownership, but they decided to pull back when they learned that the Trump administration was focused on making deals rather than pushing for structural reform, said an industry source who is familiar with the negotiations, who declined to be identified while discussing internal deliberations.

Trump administration officials say there was more preparation on trade issues than meets the eye for the current trip, and they add that they have been laying the groundwork to do more in the coming months. These efforts include an investigation into Chinese infringement of American intellectual property, which could lead the administration to impose tariffs or other significant limits on Chinese goods. They also include an effort to tighten restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States, complemented by congressional legislation that is expected to be introduced soon. There are also investigations into limiting imports of solar panels, steel, aluminum foil and other goods mainly from China that the administration contends are subsidized by the Chinese government.

Those efforts have been proceeding slowly. As a result, the preparatory work for the summit meeting has been led by Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross, whose agency focuses more on corporate transactions.

Some companies declined to join the trip, afraid of provoking reprisals by the Chinese government or of being perceived as too close to the Trump administration and its controversies. But more than two dozen were planning to attend, including smaller firms like Stine Seed, the solar project developer SolarReserve and the wastewater treatment company Drylet.

Critics say these commercial deals will do little to address the bigger economic imbalances between the countries.

“There are a lot of deals in the works,” David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said at a conference in Washington on Oct. 31. “They do not reflect a change in policy.”

China has nonetheless been considering opening some narrowly targeted sectors to greater international competition. Beijing ministries have particularly looked at whether to allow greater investment in Chinese service industries. In a briefing on Oct. 31, a senior administration official said improving trade competitiveness in services would be one of the White House’s top priorities for the trip. Chinese officials said they were open to that.

“Our manufacturing industries opened up relatively early with relatively wide areas,” said Gao Feng, a Commerce Ministry spokesman. “In contrast, service industries opened up relatively late. We need to expand the opening up of services while we deepen the opening up of manufacturing.”

More American investment in the Chinese service sectors may not do much to help the heavily blue-collar workers in Rust Belt states who helped propel Mr. Trump to the presidency a year ago. These workers have absorbed the brunt of job losses from Chinese competition and technological change.

One service sector that may be ripe for opening is banking. China has begun reviewing how it has hamstrung foreign banks with a long list of regulations that limit the services they can offer and cap their ownership stakes in Chinese banks. Those rules have left foreign banks with a combined market share of just 1.5 percent of the Chinese banking system’s assets.

Guo Shuqing, the chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, said during a news conference on the sidelines of the recent Communist Party congress that he saw room for changes. “We will further open up and give more space to foreign banks in the types of establishments, the credentials of stakeholders, the percentage of stakes they hold, and the range of businesses,” he said.

China has already made it a little easier for international asset managers to operate investment funds in China and allowed big institutions like Citibank to establish toeholds in China’s bond market by granting them narrowly defined trading licenses.

But a separate issue has cropped up this year: China’s ever-tightening cybersecurity rules. These regulations have dimmed considerably the American banking sector’s enthusiasm to start making large investments in China, particularly in commercial banking.

China has issued new rules — although they have been paused because of bitter complaints from bankers — that would require banks to buy most of the telecommunications equipment they use in China from Chinese suppliers and to store their Chinese data in China.

“It’s still very much on the minds of our bankers,” said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. “That is not something they are eager to do.”",Trump’s Visit to China: More Business Deals Than Trade Pacts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/business/trump-china-trade.html

It was an open secret that federal prosecutors were investigating Mr. Spota’s office for its role in a possible cover-up in the beating of a suspect by the county’s former police chief, James Burke. A protégé of Mr. Spota, he is now serving a 46-month prison sentence for assaulting the suspect.

Mr. Sini highlighted his record of solving murders by MS-13 and sending its members to prison. The county police agency has made more than 300 arrests of MS-13 members, he said, and solved the most gruesome killings committed by MS-13 in the past two years — the murder of two teenage girls in September 2016 in Brentwood, and the quadruple murder of four young men in the woods here at the hands of a machete-armed gang.

But Mr. Perini countered that his own experience as a defense lawyer had given him a unique perspective on both MS-13 and the drug dealers who traffic in opioids. He also said he would draw on his 17 years of experience as a prosecutor, both in Brooklyn and Suffolk County (where he was head of the narcotics unit), in targeting criminals.

Specifically, he said he would make liberal use of the so-called kingpin statute, in which those making more than $75,000 from selling certain drugs in a six-month period face up to 25 years to life in prison upon conviction. “The heroin kingpins have to know that we are not plea-bargaining,” Mr. Perini said during the campaign.

For all their differences, both candidates sounded similar themes during the campaign, from the strategies they would use to tackle MS-13 to their desire to work with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies.

In his victory speech, Mr. Sini said the district attorney’s office would be “particularly focused on eradicating MS-13 and other violent street gangs” from the county.

And Finally...

Can you imagine local art and architecture made of cans?

Canstruction, an annual contest and exhibition of unusual shapes, statues and towers built from full cans of food, has returned to Brookfield Place in Lower Manhattan. The event, now in its 25th year, is intended to generate discussion on food access and raise awareness about hunger. The architects, engineers and design students who have created the life-size structures competed this week for titles like “Most Cans,” “Best Use of Labels” and “Structural Ingenuity.”

(The structure with the most cans had 7,250.)

Stop by this year and you may see a tree made of cans. Or perhaps a can-made pineapple, Pokémon or Pacman character — to name just a few.

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Photo

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

And though the cars are driverless, they are not entirely without humans, at least for now.
Driverless cars are regulated by a patchwork of state laws.
On the other hand, California, where Waymo is headquartered, requires any self-driving car to have a safety driver sitting in the front.
“It’s the wrong approach when you’re dealing with self-driving cars,” said John M. Simpson, a director at Consumer Watchdog.","Waymo said its driverless cars hit the public roads last month. The company did not say whether it was testing the driverless cars in environments considered challenging for autonomous vehicles, like bridges or tunnels, or more difficult conditions, like driving at night or in rain and snow — usually not a big concern in the dry Phoenix climate.

While the prospect of cars without emergency drivers may raise concerns among some passengers, Waymo said it had confidence in the safety of its self-driving technology. It has included backup systems like a secondary computer to take over if the main computer fails. And though the cars are driverless, they are not entirely without humans, at least for now. Waymo employees sit in the back seat of the cars, monitoring them, a company spokesman, Johnny Luu, said.

Once passengers join the tests, they will be able to contact Waymo support staff with a button inside the car. If the cars are involved in a crash, they are programmed to respond appropriately, including pulling off the road on their own.

Driverless cars are regulated by a patchwork of state laws. Arizona, like many states, has no restrictions against operating an autonomous vehicle without a person in the driver’s seat. On the other hand, California, where Waymo is headquartered, requires any self-driving car to have a safety driver sitting in the front.

In December, Waymo published a report for California’s Department of Motor Vehicles about how frequently its car “disengaged” — deactivating its autonomous mode because of a system failure or safety risk and forcing a human driver to take over. In the report, Waymo said this happened once every 5,000 miles the cars drove in 2016, compared with once every 1,250 miles in 2015.

Consumer Watchdog, a frequent critic of Alphabet, said that data demonstrated that the cars are not ready to drive without any human intervention and that Waymo was following the Silicon Valley model of “beta testing” a new technology on the public.

“It’s the wrong approach when you’re dealing with self-driving cars,” said John M. Simpson, a director at Consumer Watchdog. “When things go wrong with a robot car, you kill people.”

Researchers believe self-driving cars can be safer than cars operated by human drivers because they are programmed to adhere strictly to traffic laws, they don’t get distracted, and they usually refrain from taking unnecessary risks.

Timothy Tait, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Transportation, said the state was on pace to exceed 1,000 automobile-related fatalities this year and that its top priority is the public’s safety — particularly by advancing efforts to reduce crashes and deaths on its roads.

“We are closely monitoring emerging technologies like self-driving cars that may ultimately support safer travel and open up opportunities for populations who today are unable to drive for themselves,” he said in a statement.

Waymo, which started as a research and development project for Google in 2009, maintains what many in the industry consider a technological advantage over its competitors. Waymo said its autonomous vehicles had driven more than 3.4 million miles on actual roads — with safety drivers — as well as running 10 million miles every day in a virtual simulator.

In his remarks, Mr. Krafcik said Waymo sees a ride-hailing taxi service as the first commercial application of the company’s driverless car technology, though there could be other uses in logistics and public transportation.

Taking the human out of the equation will fundamentally change transportation and change how people buy cars, said Mr. Krafcik, who was an executive at Hyundai Motors before joining Google.

“Because you’re accessing vehicles rather than owning, in the future, you could choose from an entire fleet of vehicle options that are tailored to each trip you want to make,” he said. “They can be designed for specific purposes or tasks.”",Waymo’s Autonomous Cars Cut Out Human Drivers in Road Tests,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/technology/waymo-autonomous-cars.html

Coach Steve Alford announced the decision but would not elaborate.

BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon is used to affronts to its sovereignty. Israel occupied part of the country for years. Syrian troops stayed even longer. Then the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah fought a war with Israel, and waged another in Syria, as the Lebanese government watched. The United States, France and Britain have, over the past century, done their share of meddling.

But no one has seen anything quite like the spectacle that has played out over the past few days. Saad Hariri, the prime minister, who had previously shown no signs of planning to quit, unexpectedly flew to Saudi Arabia and announced his resignation from there, to the shock of his own close advisers. He has not been back since, and no one is sure when, or if, he is returning.

Hours after Mr. Hariri’s announcement — televised Saturday on a Saudi-controlled channel — Saudi Arabia’s assertive new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, presided over the roundup of some 500 people, including 11 princes, on corruption charges.

Lebanon broke out the popcorn.

In a country where political analysis is a near-universal hobby, and where political power is — to oversimplify a bit — divided between Mr. Hariri’s Sunni, Saudi-backed party and the Shiite, Iran-backed Hezbollah, speculation was immediate that Mr. Hariri was also being held against his will. He holds dual Lebanese and Saudi citizenship and has extensive business dealings in the Persian Gulf kingdom.

But in effect, Mr. Boies helped draft a new contract to retain the services of Black Cube for Mr. Weinstein.
Lawyers usually deal with potential conflicts by giving clients the option of switching to another law firm, legal experts said.
While all that was going on, Mr. Boies’s moneymaking side of the business was generating some unflattering headlines.
Mr. Boies said Tuesday that the incidents at Theranos and Adelphia had been misconstrued by his critics.","The article said the investigative firm had been instructed to dig up information on Rose McGowan, an actress who had accused Mr. Weinstein of rape, and to find out what various reporters knew about the allegations against Mr. Weinstein.

On Tuesday, Mr. Boies issued a statement saying he believed the investigators had been hired solely to determine the facts related to the allegations against Mr. Weinstein, which he believed would be to The Times’s benefit. He denied there was any conflict of interest with his work for the paper.

But late in the day, the paper said it was ending its relationship with his firm.

“We never contemplated that the law firm would contract with an intelligence firm to conduct a secret spying operation aimed at our reporting and our reporters,” The Times said in a statement. “Such an operation is reprehensible.”

Mr. Boies said neither he nor his firm had any role in initially hiring the private investigative firm, Black Cube. But he said he had made a mistake in helping out Mr. Weinstein, whom Mr. Boies described as a longtime client and who has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex, in forging a new contract with the firm.

“It was not thought through, and that was my mistake,” he said in the statement. He pointed out that he had never been disciplined for his work.

In an interview, he sought to minimize his involvement with Mr. Weinstein, contending that he was brought in to deal with a “billing dispute” with Black Cube. But in effect, Mr. Boies helped draft a new contract to retain the services of Black Cube for Mr. Weinstein. The contract, a copy of which was posted on The New Yorker’s website, said one objective was to provide Mr. Weinstein with “intelligence” to “stop publication of a new negative article in a leading NY newspaper.”

“In retrospect, we should not have gotten involved in the billing dispute,” Mr. Boies said. “In the case of Harvey Weinstein, there is a lot of information that I didn’t have.”

The episode may deepen the perception that Mr. Boies pushes the boundaries on potential conflicts, while raising questions about why he didn’t seek to learn more about Mr. Weinstein’s team of hired-gun investigators.

“From Boies’s perspective, this is no good deed goes unpunished,” said Laurie L. Levenson, the David W. Burcham chair in ethical advocacy at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. “From what I heard, he should have had more information as to what it was about. He is leaving a thumbprint on it, and whether he wants it or not, this now belongs to him.”

The rules of professional conduct in New York, where Mr. Boies practices, prohibit lawyers who have not gotten consent to a conflict from representing clients “if a reasonable lawyer would conclude” that “the representation will involve the lawyer in representing differing interests.”

Stephen Gillers, who teaches legal ethics at New York University School of Law, said there were several ways to view Mr. Boies’s decision to execute the contract.

“If all he did, as he seems to claim, was help Weinstein unearth facts about his accusers that affected their credibility and might have persuaded the paper not to run the story, that would not be seen as adversely affecting his ‘loyalty’ to The Times,” Mr. Gillers said. “The paper has an interest in the credibility of its sources.”

“On the other hand, if Boies assisted Weinstein in targeting the integrity of Times journalists as a way to prevent the story from running or, failing that, to discredit the reporting if it did run, that would certainly be disloyal to his client,” he said.

Lawyers usually deal with potential conflicts by giving clients the option of switching to another law firm, legal experts said. In many instances, if the matters are not related, the clients will give the lawyer permission to keep representing them.

Sometimes broad waivers are included in the initial retention agreement. The agreement between Mr. Boies’s firm and The Times acknowledged that the firm would from time to time do work for clients whose interest may be adverse to the newspaper’s — a fact that Mr. Boies cited Tuesday.

But The Times’s statement on Tuesday made clear that it believed Mr. Boies’s firm had gone too far by handling a contract for a company that sought to undermine a major reporting effort.

Actual conflict or not, legal experts said Mr. Boies would most likely pay little penalty for his dual work for Mr. Weinstein and The Times. They said disciplinary action was unlikely because it usually required a formal complaint. Moreover, they said, some clients may find Mr. Boies’s aggressiveness appealing.

“I don’t think this will hurt from a business perspective,” said Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School and a former prosecutor who specializes in legal ethics. “It is not going to harm his reputation with most clients. When you hire Boies, you are hiring an aggressive lawyer.”

That assertive, sometimes belligerent, style has made Mr. Boies a favorite in the business world. Steven A. Cohen, the billionaire investor, hired him to do battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission when it was deciding how long to bar him from the securities industry for failing to adequately monitor employees charged with insider trading. Maurice R. Greenberg, the former head of American International Group, tapped Mr. Boies and his team to deal with a long-running civil fraud case filed against him.

And Mr. Boies is no stranger to controversy. His decision in 1997 to leave Cravath, Swaine & Moore, a longtime legal powerhouse, came about because he wanted to represent George Steinbrenner, who owned the New York Yankees, in a suit against Major League Baseball. Lawyers at Cravath objected because the firm also represented Time Warner, which owned the Atlanta Braves.

So Mr. Boies started his own firm, which grew quickly. Some critics said his affinity for high-profile cases led him to take on more work than he could handle.

“My wife says I have a hard time saying no,” Mr. Boies said in a 2002 interview.

Occasionally, he worked for little or no money. He charged a reduced fee, for instance, to represent the federal government in its failed attempt to break up Microsoft on antitrust grounds. His videotaped deposition of Bill Gates, one of the company’s founders, is remembered as a classic example of the art of cross-examination.

And a casual follower of his career might take Mr. Boies for a champion of progressive causes. He represented Al Gore in the 2000 recount litigation that culminated in the Supreme Court decision that handed the presidency to George W. Bush.

And he may be best known to the general public for joining with Theodore B. Olson, his adversary in Bush v. Gore, to challenge California’s ban on same-sex marriage.

The Supreme Court heard the case in 2013 but ducked it. The court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage two years later.

While all that was going on, Mr. Boies’s moneymaking side of the business was generating some unflattering headlines.

In 2016, the law firm stopped representing Theranos after the disagreements over legal strategy with the board. There were also allegations that lawyers at Boies Schiller were trying to learn the identity of sources The Wall Street Journal used for a series of stories on the company.

Mr. Boies said Tuesday that the incidents at Theranos and Adelphia had been misconstrued by his critics. He said that his firm had not been disciplined with regard to Theranos, and that there had been no attempt to impede the Wall Street Journal reporting.

He conceded that aggressive litigation was going to leave some people unhappy.",Weinstein Work Pulls Lawyer Back Into an Ethical Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/business/weinstein-lawyer-david-boies.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Since going public, however, it has had to address slower-than-expected user growth, rising costs and investor doubts about its strategy for dealing with both. Other problems that the company has grappled with include overestimating demand for its Spectacles camera-equipped sunglasses, a once-hot product whose sales cooled rapidly.

During a call with analysts on Tuesday, Evan Spiegel, Snap’s co-founder and chief executive, said that the company was focused on issues like simplifying the ad-purchase process on its platform and making its core app easier to use, a longstanding complaint. He also promoted the company’s efforts to grow its content and augmented reality offerings.

“I guess we’re just not afraid to make changes in the long-term interest of the business,” Mr. Spiegel said on the call. “So I would expect us to continue learning as we grow the business and making changes that we think are in the best interest of growing the user base, growing revenue and, ultimately, providing our customers with a great product experience.”

That he spoke openly about his priorities marked a change for the Mr. Spiegel, who is normally tight-lipped about his strategy. Such an approach has frustrated investors who have sought a better sense of where the company was headed.

But now, Snap has the support of Tencent. The Chinese company has had a history of taking stakes in chat apps, such as Snap, in order to learn more about how they work and how they perform from a business perspective. It has long held a stake, for example, in South Korea’s Kakao.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Snap said that Tencent and its affiliates had “recently acquired” 145.8 million nonvoting shares through purchases in the open market.

That represents nearly 17 percent of Snap’s class A shares, which hold no voting power, and about 12 percent of its total shares.

“We have long been inspired by the creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of Tencent, and we are grateful to continue our longstanding and productive relationship that began over four years ago,” Snap said in the regulatory filing. “For its part, Martin Lau, Tencent’s president, informed us that Tencent is excited to deepen its shareholding relationship with us, and that it looks forward to sharing ideas and experiences.”

A spokesman for Tencent said at a company conference in Chengdu, China, that it viewed the Snap stake as a strategic investment.

“We saw Snap as an innovative company with a huge user base that is mostly focused on Western, developed markets,” he said.

“You wrote what you had,” she says. “And that was what I happened to have at the moment.”

The couple collaborated on screenplays. Warren Beatty dropped by their Malibu beach house and flirted with her. In public, she hid behind big sunglasses and a little voice. In photographs, the angle of her hips and dangle of her cigarette were just so.

But the wisdom of the documentary, which is available on Netflix, is that it emphasizes prose over pose and keeps returning to her words.

They’re read aloud. They appear onscreen in their original typefaces. They’re why anyone cared about the rest of it and why her essay collections “Slouching Towards Bethlehem” and “The White Album” could be found on the bookshelves of just about every aspiring journalist I knew when I was young.

Those volumes include this sentence, about an awakening: “That was the year, my twenty-eighth, when I was discovering that not all of the promises would be kept, that some things are in fact irrevocable and that it had counted after all, every evasion and every procrastination, every mistake, every word, all of it.”

And this sentence, about college in the 1950s: “I suppose I am talking about just that: the ambiguity of belonging to a generation distrustful of political highs, the historical irrelevancy of growing up convinced that the heart of darkness lay not in some error of social organization but in man’s own blood.”

Also this, about the late ’60s: “I was meant to know the plot, but all I knew was what I saw: flash pictures in variable sequence, images with no ‘meaning’ beyond their temporary arrangement, not a movie but a cutting-room experience.”

Tobias is a Labrador retriever with one job: sniffing out invasive Argentine ants wherever they hide. He’s really good at it, and with his help, a fragile island ecosystem may be spared a repeat inundation with the pests.

Santa Cruz Island is 25 miles off the coast of Southern California, part of Channel Islands National Park. The island’s rich, rugged environment — which includes more than 1,000 kinds of plants and animals, including the bald eagle and the island fox — is threatened by Argentine ants, one of the world’s most successful and wily invasive species.

The ants are one in a long line of threats that The Nature Conservancy has worked to overcome since it bought most of the island in 1978. In one section, the ants chased away flower-pollinating bees, native ants, spiders and other insects crucial to local ecology.

They are nearly impossible to get rid of; it had never been done with an infestation as large as Santa Cruz’s. But Christina Boser, an ecologist who leads the conservancy’s ant eradication project, devised an aerial assault, dropping tiny sugar water beads spiked with diluted poison from helicopters.

The campaign, largely in 2015 and 2016, appears to have killed off the ants. Still, if even one colony has survived, this elaborate effort might have been wasted.

On Tuesday, voters across the country returned to the polls. Believe it or not, Wednesday marks one full year since Election Day 2016.

And while some states held votes that attracted national attention — the governor’s race in Virginia, for example — Californians had only local contests to decide.

But don’t fret. Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst and professor at the University of Southern California, said the eyes of the national political parties will turn back to California soon enough.

There’s a governor’s race in 2018, and a fight brewing over Dianne Feinstein’s senate seat. And perhaps most important to national onlookers, Dr. Bebitch Jeffe said, “California will play a major role in determining whether the Democrats have a chance of retaking the House.” As many as nine of 14 Republican seats could be vulnerable, she said.

“They’re already running around beating up one another,” she said of the various candidates. “Californians are not patient.”

“We’re already into it,” she added, noting that, somehow, “it’s almost 2018.”

There is room for almost 200 people in the square bar up front, the main dining room with rows of light wood tables and chairs in neutral upholstery, and a raised mezzanine that manages to make room for both extra tables and an entire sushi bar.

“Keeping On Keeping On” comprises a decade of diary entries, from 2005 to 2015, all originally published in The London Review of Books, each one a burst of intellectual fire and feeling — but unpretentious and unsentimental to the core. There’s not a damp squib to be found.

The notion of a public diary might seem oxymoronic, an attempt to satisfy two opposing impulses. But it suits Bennett, who prefers to riff rather than reveal. His book is a string of wry asides to the audience — pensées, jokes and anecdotes with the compression and tang of a Lydia Davis short story. Here’s one entry in full: “I almost bump into an aged New York lady as I come into the grocery store and she comes out. ‘Oh sorry,’ she says. ‘I zigged when I should have zagged.’ ”

The small dramas of life are on display — he tries (and fails) to protect his eyebrows from his barber’s clippers — as well as the unappeasable longings and sorrows. He remembers the tobacco-stained hands of his father, long dead. He records his shame at his country; how after Britain’s initial participation in the so-called war on terror,“sometimes being English it felt as if one smelled.”

View all New York Times newsletters.

But pleasure is never distant from Bennett’s view, nor is it trivial. For him, the inextinguishable thrill of life is in noticing. Nothing is too small: “The inside of a bean pod, shaped to the bean and furred like the inside of a violin case, has always seemed to me an instance of the prodigality of nature, a thing that is beautiful in itself and suited to its function.” He is endlessly attentive to birds — a baby robin with “fierce black eyebrows,” a pigeon “hitting the same note again and again like a piano tuner” — and the beauty of men, their own ways of preening and posing.

This lightning shift between registers is just one example of Bennett’s relaxed virtuosity. This brick of a book — more than 700 pages — goes down like ice cream.

But just as you’re lolling complacently in your chair, a saw-toothed observation startles you to attention.

On Margaret Thatcher: “No one had done such systematic damage to the North since William the Conqueror.” On Tony Blair: “Less perilous, I would have thought, to have a leader intoxicated with whiskey than one like Blair, intoxicated with himself.”

Political outrage is the engine of the book. Bennett has had a lucky life, and he knows it. His parents were each finished with formal education by the age of 13; their son went on to become, for a time, a medievalist at Oxford. His fame was instantaneous, established when he co-wrote and performed in “Beyond the Fringe” at an Edinburgh festival in 1960. So when he takes stock of the gutting of the social services and education systems that made him, it’s with a kind of filial outrage. “Closing libraries is child abuse,” he writes.

He has been publishing his diaries for 30 years, and a valedictory note inevitably creeps in. What has it all been for? What, even, is this book for? (Questions you wish more writers would consider.) In the case of Bennett — this wolf forced into sheep’s clothing — the proof is on every page. He remains energetically and profitably exasperated, committed to exposing corruption, the abuse of language, the exploitation of people and assorted foolishness of all kinds.

Today’s Theme

Four phrases are reinterpreted as things that might be in the life of a witch. For example, witches cast spells, so “Computer help for a witch?” would be SPELL CHECK. Similarly, WARTS AND ALL at 41A is “How one might be forced to accept a witch?” because a witch has at least one wart. (Practitioners of witchcraft, please do not write to me objecting to this. I know you do not have warts. We’re talking about the cartoon stereotype.)

Constructor Notes

I originally set out to create a Halloween-themed puzzle that incorporated all the familiar characters associated with Halloween: witches, ghosts, skeletons, vampires and zombies. But the theme never felt tight enough. After a while, I settled on a witch/BROOM HILDA-themed puzzle and sent it off. While Will liked the idea, he felt young solvers might not be familiar with the character. So not only did I have to replace BROOM HILDA at 58-Across, I had to do some serious re-cluing (CHARM SCHOOL, for example, was clued as “Educational institution attended by 58-Across?”) Here’s where things got tricky. One of the original theme entries was WITCH HUNT, which meant I couldn’t use the word “witch” in the clues. “Educational institution attended by a Halloween broom-rider” just didn’t do the trick. It felt too forced. In the end, I simply dropped WITCH HUNT as an answer, and thankfully Will was O.K. with the puzzle having just four main fills. As always, I can’t tell you how much of a treat it is to see one of my puzzles in The New York Times.

Because rebuses. I just don’t see them. It’s a flaw in my brain. My best piece of advice to anyone who asks how to recognize whether there is a rebus element in their crossword is to say that if you find yourself cursing at the puzzle because none of your expected answers fit, it is more than likely that it’s a rebus theme. And even with that bit of knowledge in my brain, I still miss them.

Private scholarships should be a lifeline for students who want to avoid debt. But there’s an awful glitch in the system: Students who get private scholarships risk losing financial aid they were awarded from their state or school. Their private scholarships don’t save them a dime.

Like many students, when I thought about college I worried most about affording it. Rice University, in Houston, where I am a senior, is known for generous financial aid packages, but I still had to take out student loans to cover the full cost.

As a college freshman, I saw an episode of “Shark Tank” on which an entrepreneur claimed that millions of private scholarships go unused every year. He was pitching Mark Cuban and the other investors on an app that was intended to match students with private scholarships. I was fascinated: Maybe I could avoid taking on thousands of dollars in debt in college. All I had to do was answer a few questions, submit my résumé and personal statement, and wait to collect.

But when I talked with friends who were also concerned about financing college, they told me that I probably shouldn’t bother applying for private scholarships. They told me about a significant wrinkle in my plan. It’s called “scholarship award displacement.”

I learned that any money I received from private companies, my church or even from a crowdsourcing campaign had to be reported to my college or university. The school would then evaluate the reported funds, and could decrease my financial aid by the same amount.

Doesn’t this seem strange? Why should students bother applying for scholarships if colleges are allowed, and in many cases pushed by federal and state regulations, to effectively take them away?

But, not heeding her colleagues’ advice, she began to translate Greek and Roman tragedies.
The translation was, literally, faithful: God himself had moved their hands in unison, only one possible translation for his Word.","When I first read these lines early this summer in The Paris Review, which published an excerpt, I was floored. I’d never read an “Odyssey” that sounded like this. It had such directness, the lines feeling not as if they were being fed into iambic pentameter because of some strategic decision but because the meter was a natural mode for its speaker. The subtle sewing through of the fittingly wavelike W-words in the first half (“wandered ... wrecked ... where ... worked”) and the stormy S-words that knit together the second half, marrying the waves to the storm in which this man will suffer, made the terse injunctions to the muse that frame this prologue to the poem (“Tell me about ...” and “Find the beginning”) seem as if they might actually answer the puzzle posed by Homer’s polytropos and Odysseus’s complicated nature.

Complicated: the brilliance of Wilson’s choice is, in part, its seeming straightforwardness. But no less than that of polytropos, the etymology of “complicated” is revealing. From the Latin verb complicare, it means “to fold together.” No, we don’t think of that root when we call someone complicated, but it’s what we mean: that they’re compound, several things folded into one, difficult to unravel, pull apart, understand.

“It feels,” I told Wilson, “with your choice of ‘complicated,’ that you planted a flag.”

“It says, ‘Guess what?’ — ”

“ ‘ — this is different.’ ”

Although translation might seem a natural step for a scholar preoccupied by the connections between antiquity and later texts, Wilson was dissuaded from pursuing it. “My colleagues told me: ‘You really shouldn’t be doing that kind of thing before tenure. Before tenure you have to write, you know, the right kind of book’ ” — the right kind being one on a subject that your discipline has yet to exhaust. Wilson did write a range of books before tenure, most on canonical texts: her study of suffering and death in literature; a monograph on Socrates. But, not heeding her colleagues’ advice, she began to translate Greek and Roman tragedies. A selection of Seneca’s plays appeared in 2010; four plays by Euripides in 2016. Both projects were outgrowths of her old desire to “spend a little bit longer” with these authors.

I asked Wilson why translation isn’t valued in the academy.

“Because there is no perception that it’s serious intellectually. It’s imagined as a subset of outreach. That you’re going to be communicating with the masses, which is less important than being innovative within your field. And even though I think translation is a way of being innovative within your field, my colleagues don’t see it that way.”

One way of talking about Wilson’s translation of the “Odyssey” is to say that it makes a sustained campaign against that species of scholarly shortsightedness: finding equivalents in English that allow the terms she is choosing to do the same work as the original words, even if the English words are not, according to a Greek lexicon, “correct.”

“What gets us to ‘complicated,’ ” Wilson said, returning to her translation of polytropos, “is both that I think it has some hint of the original ambivalence and ambiguity, such that it’s both ‘Why is he complicated?’ ‘What experiences have formed him?’ which is a very modern kind of question — and hints at ‘There might be a problem with him.’ I wanted to make it a markedly modern term in a way that ‘much turning’ obviously doesn’t feel modern or like English. I wanted it to feel like an idiomatic thing that you might say about somebody: that he is complicated.”

I asked: “What about the commentator who says, ‘It does something that more than modernizes — it subverts the fundamental strangeness of the way Odysseus is characterized.’ I’m sure some classicists are going to say it’s flat out wrong, ‘Interesting, but wrong.’ ”

“You’re quite right,” she replied. “Reviewers will say that.”

How, I asked, would she address such a complaint from someone in her field?

“I struggle with this all the time,” Wilson said. “I struggled with this because there are those classicists. I partly just want to shake them and make them see that all translations are interpretations.” Most of the criticism Wilson expects, she says, will come from “a digging in of the heels: ‘That’s not what it says in the dictionary, and therefore it can’t be right!’ And if you put down anything other than what’s said in the dictionary, then, of course, you have to add a footnote explaining why, which means that pretty much every line has to have a footnote. ...” Wilson paused. “That goes to what this translation is aiming to do in terms of an immersive reading experience and conveying a whole narrative. I don’t know what to say to those people, honestly.” Wilson laughed her buoyant laugh. “I need to have a better answer to them, because they will certainly review it, and they will certainly have a loud voice. They just seem to be coming from such a simple and fundamental misunderstanding.”

“Of what?”

“Of what any translation is doing.”

What a translation is doing — and what it should do — has been a source of vigorous debate since there were texts to translate. “I’m not a believer,” Wilson told me, “but I find that there is a sort of religious practice that goes along with translation. I’m trying to serve something.”

Early arguments about translation were over the Old Testament. One tale has it that an Egyptian king of the third-century B.C. wanted a Greek copy of the Pentateuch — the five books of Moses — for the Library of Alexandria. Some 70 Jewish elders said to be “skilled in the Scriptures and in both languages” were sent from Jerusalem. Each worked in a separate room to translate in isolation. When finished, they compared their work. The 70 translations? Identical, “in the very same words and the very same names, from beginning to end,” according to one account. The translation was, literally, faithful: God himself had moved their hands in unison, only one possible translation for his Word. Called “Septuagint” after its 70 translators, this Greek version became a foundational text, both for the early Christian church and for the impossible standard to which all subsequent translations are held: faithfulness. Later Bible translators failed to meet that mystical standard. The Catholic Church took 1,200 years to accept Jerome’s Latin version (“tainted with Judaism,” was the charge, as it relied on Hebrew sources). The first English Bible’s translator, John Wycliffe, was disinterred and his bones were burned for the heresy of translating into English, and his successor, William York Tyndale, was excommunicated, sentenced to death by strangulation and burned at the stake.

Although you can understand, if not condone, how murderous rage at a translator might arise if a believer supposed a sacred text to have been desecrated by a translator’s hand, it is somewhat surprising that similar vehemence can greet translations of secular canonical texts. Perhaps the most famous such expression is in Matthew Arnold’s “On Translating Homer,” his series of lectures in 1860 when he was Oxford professor of poetry. In them, he offered a takedown of existing translations of Homer and then asked “in what faithfulness exists”: “The translator of Homer should above all be penetrated by a sense of four qualities ... that he is eminently rapid; that he is eminently plain and direct both in the evolution of his thought and in the expression of it, that is, both in his syntax and in his words; that he is eminently plain and direct in the substance of his thought, that is, in his matter and ideas; and, finally, that he is eminently noble.”

Most every Homeric translation since has been scrutinized against his quartet of qualities. Wilson is not persuaded.

“These are not good criteria,” Wilson told me. “I think he was a terrible reader of poetry. It’s not like he ever translated Homer. I think he had a good ‘classics major’ undergraduate kind of Greek, but I think it’s all to do with a particular notion of aesthetics and class, the whole ‘plainness and nobility.’ It’s about noblesse oblige and you’re going to be the kind of gentleman who’s going to have gone to Rugby and that will be the kind of language that we speak: the classy kind of language. And projecting all of that back on to the classics. This is what ‘sweetness and light’ is. It’s describing a boys’ club. I think it’s very interesting that’s still with us. Those are the four? It’s just the boys’ club.”

“I do think that gender matters,” Wilson said later, “and I’m not going to not say it’s something I’m grappling with. I’m trying to take this task and this process of responding to this text and creating this text extremely seriously, with whatever I have, linguistically, sonically, emotionally.”

At the center of each of Homer’s epics is a warrior. In the “Iliad,” it is Achilles, the greatest of the Greeks, a demigod almost invulnerable to death. Although the war is begun over a woman, Helen, stolen from her Greek husband by a Trojan, the “Iliad” is a poem about and presided over by men. Zeus is the poem’s prevailing god, and what men do, or are willing to do, in love and war and in the friendships that arise in war and its losses, are the poem’s preoccupations.

In the “Odyssey,” preoccupations shift, radically. Zeus is replaced by Athena as the dominant god of the tale; the poem begins not with Odysseus but with his wife, Penelope, who has been without him for 20 years, in a kingdom overrun by suitors for her hand, whom the conventions of hospitality ensure she cannot simply expel. The reader doesn’t even see Odysseus until the fifth of the poem’s 24 books, where we learn that he has been living on an island with Calypso, a goddess, for seven years; that, earlier, he was detained by another goddess, Circe, with whom he also shared a bed; that the Sirens, as he navigates, call to him, desiring him; that a young princess falls in love with him; that, on all sides, women are temptresses, and whereas he submits, we are to understand that Penelope, alone, assailed, remains faithful.

“In the second-wave feminist scholarship in classics,” Wilson told me, “people were very keen to try to read Penelope as, ‘Let’s find Penelope’s voice in the “Odyssey,” and let’s celebrate her, because look, here she is being the hero in an epic in ways we can somehow unpack.’ I find that’s a little simplistic. What happens to all the unelite women?”

In the episode that Wilson calls “one of the most horrible and haunting of the whole poem,” Odysseus returns home to find that his palace has been overrun by suitors for his wife’s hand. Though she has resisted them, the women in her palace have not. Odysseus, after slaying the suitors, tells his son, Telemachus, to kill the women. It is an interesting injunction from Odysseus, who himself, during his 10 years of wandering, was serially unfaithful. In Robert Fagles’s much-praised translation of the poem, Telemachus says, before he executes the palace women on his father’s command: “No clean death for the likes of them, by god!/Not from me — they showered abuse on my head, my mother’s too!/You sluts — the suitors’ whores!”

But Wilson, in her introduction, reminds us that these palace women — “maidservants” has often been put forward as a “correct” translation of the Greek δμωαι, dmoai, which Wilson calls “an entirely misleading and also not at all literal translation,” the root of the Greek meaning “to overpower, to tame, to subdue” — weren’t free. Rather, they were slaves, and if women, only barely. Young female slaves in a palace would have had little agency to resist the demands of powerful men. Where Fagles wrote “whores” and “the likes of them” — and Lattimore “the creatures” — the original Greek, Wilson explained, is just a feminine definite article meaning “female ones.” To call them “whores” and “creatures” reflects, for Wilson, “a misogynistic agenda”: their translators’ interpretation of how these females would be defined.

Twenty-six people were killed when Devin P. Kelley opened fire on Sunday at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., including a pregnant victim’s unborn baby, officials said. Here are some of the lives that were lost.

Robert and Shani Corrigan

Robert and Shani Corrigan buried their 25-year-old son, Forrest, in December. His memorial service was held at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs.

Less than a year later, in that same church, Robert and Shani became victims of a mass shooting. They are survived by their sons Preston Corrigan and Benjamin Corrigan.

Robert and Shani were high school sweethearts who moved to Texas after Robert retired as a chief master sergeant in the Air Force, after nearly 30 years of service, said Renee Haley, director of veterans services for Clare County, Mich.

Preston and Benjamin, following in their father’s footsteps, are also in the Air Force. They are currently on active duty, Ms. Haley said.

“I am truly amazed at the strength of this amazing family, whose faith has not been shaken by this tragedy,” Ms. Haley said in an email.

The Holcombe Family

One minute the Holcombes were a tight-knit family praying in the tiny church on Fourth Street.

The next, eight of them were gone.

Bryan and Karla Holcombe, a guest preacher and his wife, were dead.

Their son Marc Daniel Holcombe, gone. Their pregnant daughter-in-law, Crystal Holcombe, gone.

And four of their grandchildren — Noah, Emily, Megan and Greg — gone.

The gunman nearly wiped out the Holcombe family, leaving Joe Holcombe, 86, Bryan’s father, to mourn the loss of the generations he had raised. “We know where they are now,” he said in an interview, his voice strained by exhaustion. “All of our family members, they’re all Christian. And it won’t be long until we’re with them.”

Haley Krueger, 16, one of several children who died in the church shooting, had planned on attending the Galen College of Nursing in San Antonio.

She wanted to work in the neonatal intensive care unit so that she could help babies, her mother, Charlene Uhl, said in a Facebook message.

“She was a vibrant dramatic teenager,” Ms. Uhl wrote. “She has two nephews that were the light of her life. She was excited for her future.”

Haley leaves behind two brothers, a sister and her grandfathers.

Tara McNulty

Tara McNulty, 33, was a single mother raising her children Hailey and James on her own. She struggled to make ends meet between a desk job and bartending shifts, said Amber Maricle, who described herself as Ms. McNulty’s best friend, remembered her as “a caring, great mother.”

Ms. McNulty became a mother while she was still a teenager, and Ms. Maricle said her friend’s life revolved around her children. “I wouldn’t be surprised if she died protecting her children, because that was Tara, always protecting her babies,” she said.

Ms. McNulty’s daughter, Hailey, 15, is a sophomore at Floresville High School, and her son, James, is 12. Both of the children were wounded in the attack. Ms. Maricle reported that Hailey is still in the hospital, and James underwent surgery at a hospital in San Antonio on Tuesday morning. Ms. Maricle’s concern, now, was for the children. “We have to make sure Tara’s babies are taken care of,” she said.

Ms. Maricle met her friend in Louisiana, where Ms. McNulty had worked as a real estate agent before returning to her hometown, Sutherland Springs, two years ago. “I always tried to convince her to move back” to Louisiana, Ms. Maricle said, “but she just kept saying, ‘Sutherland Springs is my home.’”

Ms. McNulty was the only child of Lisa McNulty, also a Sutherland Springs resident, who could not be reached on Tuesday.

Ms. Maricle remembered her friend as “super sarcastic, but so sweet, too.” The two had matching mermaid and unicorn key chains, and just hours before she was killed, Ms. McNulty made a teasing comment on Ms. Maricle’s Facebook page. “That was us,” recalled Ms. Maricle, her voice cracking, “rocking chairs on the front porch, just talking, just laughing for hours.” The day of the shooting, Ms. Maricle texted Ms. McNulty: “That shooting is too close to you.” Ms. McNulty never texted back.

Richard and Therese Rodriguez

Richard Rodriguez was “country,” his daughter Regina told CNN in an interview accompanied by a photograph of her father sporting a black cowboy hat and dark handlebar mustache. He and his wife, Therese, also killed in the shooting, had been married for 11 years. Therese was Regina’s stepmother.

Richard and Therese were longtime members of the First Baptist Church and sometimes took Regina’s children to Sunday service. “If they weren’t at church, they were always in their yard working on their garden beds or cutting the grass,” Regina said.

Regina’s oldest son emulated Richard’s style, putting on the same kind of pants, boots and hats.

“The oldest ones, they’re the ones that are taking it hard,” she told CNN of her children. “Especially my Justin — he really looked up to my dad,” she continued, “just waiting for my dad to pull up when he would come on the weekends.”

The Ward Family

Three members of the Ward family died in the church shooting, Michael Ward, a surviving relative, told the Dallas Morning News.

Two of them were Mr. Ward’s nieces, Brooke Ward, 5, and Emily Garza, 7.

Another was their mother, Joann Ward.

Ryland Ward, Joann’s 5-year-old son, was also shot. Ryland liked to pretend he could drive, his uncle said, and once started a truck up when the adults were looking away. The child survived the shooting but faces a long recovery.

The night of the shooting, the Dallas Morning News was at home with one of the Ward cousins, McKinley, 9. Alone in the family kitchen, she cried. Two of her cousins were gone, and another had lost his family. “Ryland is the only one left,” she said.

Lula Woicinski White

Lula Woicinski White was the grandmother of the gunman’s estranged wife, Danielle Shields.

“I loved her very much, and she was my rock,” Ms. White’s sister, Mary Clyburn, said in a phone interview. “She was just a wonderful person.”

Ms. White’s granddaughter married Mr. Kelley in 2014.

When asked if Ms. White had ever mentioned feeling threatened by Mr. Kelley, Ms. Clyburn said, “No, I don’t think so. I don’t think so. My sister loved God. My sister was a Christian woman.”

Friends and relatives shared their grief on social media. “I have no doubt where she is right now. She is in Heaven laying her crowns and jewels at the feet of Jesus and celebrating,” Amy Johnson Backus said in a post on Facebook. “I love and will miss you Aunt Lula Woicinski White.”",The Lives Cut Short in a Texas Church,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/us/sutherland-springs-texas-victims.html

There are tools that can help. Mr. Campagna organizes projects on Google Drive spreadsheets that he shares with his wife. Smartphone apps like HomeZada and BrightNest can also help you keep tabs on a to-do list that never ends.

Still, you need to know what to do — from the roof down to the basement, and out to the backyard. Here is how to get started.

CHECK THE EXTERIOR

Start by giving the outside of your house a checkup. Walk around the perimeter and look for cracks in the siding or peeling paint. Are the windowsills in good condition? Check the roof for missing or broken tiles. Fix problems while the days are still relatively warm. After a rainstorm, walk around the house and look for any signs that water might not be draining properly, like pooling water or damaged gutters or downspouts.

“The objective is to get as much of the water away from your house as possible,” said Scott Johnson, the director of operations for WIN Home Inspection, a network of more than 190 home inspection firms in 33 states.

THE GUTTERS

Of all the fall chores, cleaning the gutters and downspouts is among the most critical. Your gutters direct water away from your roof and siding, and down into the drainage system. Clogged gutters can cause your roof to leak and lead to ice dams in cold weather. So clean them or hire someone to do the job after the leaves fall. “When the gutters aren’t kept clean, the moisture just sits on the rooftop,” said Dina Dwyer-Owens, a co-chair of the board of directors of the Dwyer Group, a parent company of home-repair franchises including Mr. Handyman and Mr. Rooter.

Just don’t do the work too soon. Clean the gutters before the last of the leaves fall, and you could find yourself back up on that ladder a few weeks later. “I think I did it a little too early,” said Mr. Campagna of West Orange, N.J., who rushed to clean his gutters before Mrs. Campagna, 30, gave birth to their first child in October. “That was a rookie mistake.” And a wasted Saturday afternoon.

If you plan to do the work yourself, be careful on that ladder. Ladder mishaps sent nearly 176,000 people to the hospital in 2013, according to the National Safety Council. If your ladder has seen better days, consider an upgrade. (These fiberglass models are recommended by Wirecutter, the New York Times’s product review site.)

If you hire a professional, expect to spend around $150 for the job, according to HomeAdvisor.

THE WINDOWS AND DOORS

If you have window air-conditioning units, take them out and store them until next summer. But handle those unwieldy appliances with care to avoid injury.

Or you could leave them in place. Ms. Levy of Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, covers the outside of her window units with an insulated sheath and wedges towels between the sill and the unit to keep drafts out.

Next, swap out screens for storm doors and windows. “It’s something that we automatically do when it starts getting cold out,” Ms. Levy said. While you’re changing out the screens for glass, check your windows and doors for drafts. Add weather stripping or caulk wherever cold air seeps in.

SMOKE ALARMS

Three out of five home-fire deaths happen in properties without working smoke alarms, according to the United States Fire Administration. So make sure yours work. Change the batteries in all your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors once a year; the day you set the clocks back is a good one to do it.

Check the manufacturing date, too, and replace any detectors that are more than 10 years old. Any reliable model will do, but if you’re interested in one that will alert you to problems when you’re away, a smart smoke alarm like the Nest Protect is sensitive to slow- and fast-burning fires, and has apps that will alert you anywhere in the world if something’s amiss.

Laundry dryers cause 2,900 home fires a year nationally and failing to clean them is the leading culprit, according to the United States Fire Administration. So call a professional once a year to service your dryer vent and help remove lint, debris and other hazards that could spark a fire.

THE CHIMNEY

Heat, smoke and dangerous gases from your fireplace and heating system travel up your chimney and out of your house, keeping the air inside breathable. A dirty chimney could affect air quality and also pose a fire hazard.

So keep your chimney clean. The Chimney Safety Institute of America recommends having it inspected annually and cleaned as needed. “In general, with chimneys and fireplaces, the more you use it, the more likely you need it to be swept,” said Mr. Johnson, of WIN Home Inspection. Expect to spend between $125 and $200 on a chimney sweep, according to Angie’s List.

THE HEATING SYSTEM

If you were going on a long road trip, you would get your car tuned up before you started your journey, not afterward. The same goes for your heating system. Call a plumber or a furnace repair company to prepare your boiler or furnace for winter before the cold weather arrives.

Your contractor should clean the equipment, make sure it is working properly and let you know if it needs any repairs. “The heating system ain’t going to break down when it’s 80 degrees out,” said Kerry O’Brien, the president of T.F. O’Brien Cooling and Heating in New Hyde Park, N.Y. “You don’t want to be stuck when it’s five degrees in the middle of the night” with a heating system that won’t turn on.

THE PIPES

No one wants a frozen pipe, so keep an eye on yours. Drain the outside water faucets and shut them off before the first freeze. On very cold nights, open cabinets beneath the sink to let warm air in and, if you are especially worried about freezing pipes, let a slow drip of water run through them. Resist the urge to turn down the thermostat to save money – you want to keep the pipes warm. Extreme weather “is not a time to start trying to save on your energy bill,” Mr. O’Brien said. “Crank your heat up during those weeks.”

PUT THE GARDEN TO BED

By November, you may not be thinking much about your hydrangeas, but they still need you. Prune your shrubs and hedges now. Cut foliage away from the house so that ice or snow on the branches won’t damage your siding or let water into your home.

But use restraint, so as not to cut off next spring’s bloom. “Try to contain yourself. Cut back half of what you want to cut back,” said Jan Johnsen, a landscape designer in Mount Kisco, N.Y.

If you have trees on your property, the battle of the leaves may feel endless, but ignore the pile on your lawn and it could mold and suffocate your grass. But before you succumb to the mighty leaf blower and start blasting away, consider a more measured approach. Rake up most of the leaves and use them as mulch for your flower beds. Mow the rest in place with your lawn mower. By mowing over the leaves, you help break them down so they can decompose and feed the grass. All that foliage “is not garbage, it’s black gold,” Ms. Johnsen said. “There’s a reason the leaves fall to the earth.”

THE PATIO

Empty ceramic pots of soil and store them in your garage or basement for the winter so they do not crack in freezing temperatures. Drain the hoses and store them, too. Shut down the sprinkler system and call the pool maintenance company to close up your pool, if you have one. But wait for a crisp sunny to day to cover patio furniture — you don’t want to trap any moisture under the tarp.

STOCK UP ON FIREWOOD

If you plan to build a fire this winter, order seasoned firewood in the fall. Stack it loosely on pallets to keep moisture at bay. Cover the pile with a plastic tarp. You can store wood in an unheated garage, but do not store more than a week’s supply in the house, as the wood could attract insects, according to Michigan State University Extension.

BRACE FOR WINTER WEATHER

If you have a snowblower, check it. You may need to have it serviced, and many local repair companies will pick up and drop off a blower as part of the service. “Start it up, run it for a couple of minutes and make sure it’s O.K.,” said Rich Janow, 74, who has lived in a six-bedroom house in South Orange, N.J., for 32 years with his wife, Nancy Chiller Janow, 64. “Do it now so that if you have a problem and you need the repair people to fix it, you have enough time before the really bad weather sets in.”

If you don’t have a snowblower, now is the best time to buy one, when it’s early in the season. (Wirecutter has some suggestions.)

If you have a portable generator, check that, too. If you don’t have one, now is a good time to consider investing in one. Update your emergency supply kit with flashlights, fresh batteries, a first-aid kit, food, water and a portable radio.

Stock up on Snow Melt and make sure your shovels are in good condition before the weatherman tells you snow is imminent. Make sure the supplies are accessible (and you remember where you put them) before the snow starts falling. Otherwise, you may find yourself digging your way to that shovel.

If the winter is a snowy one, use a roof rake to remove excess snow from your roof, and stay on the lookout for ice dams, accumulations of ice and snow along your eaves that could damage your gutters, roof and siding.

STAY ON TRACK

These quiet moments and images are not often associated with Iraq. But the Kurdish region, in the country’s northern reaches, is home to such reprieves. Beyond the oil fields of Taqtaq and Kirkuk, far east of Mosul and many miles north of Baghdad, the semiautonomous region often feels timeless and progressive, restive and at peace.

What the Vietnamese photographer Lam Duc-Hien first imagined of Iraq before traveling there on assignment were the usual media tropes from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq — tanks and violence, surges and refugees. Mr. Lam, who was working for nongovernment organizations and a French newspaper, said he had never heard of the Kurdish people, who by then were fleeing Saddam’s oppressive and violent Baath Party. But after he settled down in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a region he documented for more than two decades, he found the country to be vastly different than what he had expected.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.

Over the years he has lived and worked there, he often traveled with the peshmerga, the Kurdish military, while on duty and off. “When I spend time with them, we always go to the mountains,” he said. “For me, it is like coming back to the 19th-century, because we are fishing with Kalashnikovs. For me, it’s incredible.”

Often referred to as a people without a country, the Kurds have for many years sought refuge in the mountains that abut Turkey and Iran. “I focused specifically on different ethnic groups and different religions in Kurdistan,” he said. “It’s small place, but it is very diverse.”

The robust culture of daily Kurdish life is captured in Mr. Lam’s photographs, a collection that stretches from the 1990s through to the war against the Islamic State. The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said. “I spend more time with them than taking pictures of them.”

A child leans in for a kiss from his little companion beneath a tree in the village of Badawan; a group of women in traditional Kurdish dresses dance atop a mountain plateau; families gather on the first day of Eid al-Adha to break the Ramadan feast at the grave of a loved one. “Each time I get back here,” Mr. Lam said, “I feel like I have a link with the people.”

Though Mr. Lam’s images sometimes show refugees and internally-displaced persons living in camps within the Kurdish region, he often shied away from the violence that has wracked the region and nearly divided the country, choosing instead to focus on the vitality of the people, not their blemishes.

Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq. He has heard whispers of secession since 1991. “One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.

But that dream has become a nightmare for many following an independence referendum in September. Disputed areas controlled by Kurdish forces were reclaimed by the Iraqi army. Flights were suspended to and from the region. A number of Kurds have since been killed or maimed in clashes with federal forces.

The recent infighting reminded Mr. Lam of a time when, during travels in the areas outside the Kurdish region, he lost that sense of fellowship — and safety — he had felt among the Kurdish people. After two bombs exploded in Baghdad’s Sadr City in 2013, with corpses littering the streets as he worked, Mr. Lam reluctantly fled the country.

“When you get involved with the Kurdish soul or friendship,” Mr. Lam said, “it’s very difficult to get out.”

He returned to Erbil soon after.

Last Wednesday at 5:30 p.m., Ms. Merrick called the prime minister’s staff to report the 2003 episode. Ninety minutes later, the lawmaker — Michael Fallon, the defense secretary — stepped down, saying he had “behaved inappropriately in the past.”

“It’s exhausting, challenging something so powerful as a political establishment, that is self-protecting and self-preserving,” Ms. Merrick said. “To try to get a chink in that armor is so exhausting.”

On Tuesday, the crisis apparently encompassed a death: Carl Sargeant, who was dismissed as a minister in the Welsh government last week amid allegations of sexual misconduct, was found in his home, apparently a suicide. He had denied any wrongdoing.

The scandal has hit Prime Minister Theresa May at a difficult time, as she struggles to control warring factions in her party and break free from a deadlock in negotiations for Britain’s exit from the European Union, known as Brexit. On Monday, she promised to create a cross-party body to investigate complaints of misconduct, something some female lawmakers have sought for years.

Hanging over Mrs. May’s head are allegations against her deputy and longtime friend, Damian Green, the first secretary of state. Mrs. May called for an investigation into the case last week after a Conservative Party activist wrote that he had touched her knee and sent her suggestive text messages. Mr. Green has called the allegations by the activist, Kate Maltby, “untrue” and “deeply hurtful.”

Mrs. May has also ordered a Cabinet Office inquiry into Mark Garnier, her international trade minister, who has acknowledged asking his assistant to buy sex toys. In all, about a dozen members of Parliament, eight from the Conservative Party and four from Labour, are under investigation. One Tory, Charlie Elphicke, was suspended after “serious allegations” were referred to the police, the party has said. He has denied any wrongdoing.

“Britain’s political class feels pretty fragile right now,” said Tom McTague, the chief Britain correspondent for Politico and author of “Betting the House,” a new book on this year’s general election, in which the Conservative Party lost its overall majority, although it managed to cling to power.

“When something like this starts to get going, they just feel out of control,” he said. “The M.P.s don’t know where this is going. They don’t know how many allegations are going to come. They don’t know how to get on top of it.”

The episodes have unfolded against the peculiar structure of Britain’s Parliament: The 650 members of the House of Commons hire, employ and manage their staff personally, as if they were small-business owners.

Jess Phillips, 36, a Labour member of Parliament who worked with victims of sexual abuse before entering politics, recalled showing up on her first day in 2015 and asking a senior colleague where her employees should turn with workplace complaints.

“They said, ‘There is no place,’” she said. “I said, ‘Well, what if that was the case?’ I got a shrug in response. I see a lot of young women working here, around very powerful people, and I worry.”

Ms. Phillips began receiving calls from employees with complaints 10 days ago, she said, and has heard from one or two people every day since. Many of the complaints fall well short of a criminal threshold.

“The truth of the matter is, to me, the varying degrees didn’t matter,” she said. “There is a cultural problem where people are using their power for sexual gain, or to hold over women who work in here.”

Party whips, who historically served as a clearinghouse for complaints about officials’ behavior, were also responsible for protecting the party from damage — and for persuading or coercing the members of Parliament to get in line. According to political legend, past whips collected compromising information in a “black book,” to be used as leverage at some future point.

Tim Fortescue, who served as the Tory chief whip in the 1970s, told the BBC that he had often helped lawmakers who feared prosecution.

“It might be debt, it might be a scandal involving small boys, or any kind of scandal,” he said. “We would do everything we can, because we would store up Brownie points. It’s a pretty nasty reason, but it’s one of the reasons. If we could get a chap out of trouble, they’d do as we ask forever.”

Over the weekend, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, herself a former whip, denied that parties had withheld reports of wrongdoing by members of Parliament.

“I don’t recognize some of those more lurid stories that are told about the sort of things whips knew and did,” she said. “I just don’t recognize it.”

But Ms. Merrick, who last week brought forth her complaint from 2003, said she saw no recourse when Mr. Fallon, then a member of Parliament, tried to kiss her after a working lunch, leaving her feeling “so humiliated and so ashamed.”

One of the main reasons she said nothing, she said, was that she was “scared of the whips,” who, if displeased, could prevent her from getting any political news.

“This behavior is reported to whips all the time,” she said. “If there is a new system in place, the whips will still be able to collect information, but staff and journalists will be able to report it openly, rather than it becoming part of the game of snakes and ladders that the whips are controlling.”

On the night last week when Mr. Fallon stepped down, she said, there was no sense of triumph, but instead the sense that she had set right a 14-year-old error.

“These are M.P.s who have gone from public school to Oxford to Commons and have never been challenged, never been questioned,” she said. “I suppose it’s like a muscle that you’re trying to make work.”","In U.K.’s Clubby Parliament, Abuse Complaints May Be Used as Weapons",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/europe/uk-parliament-misconduct.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer
