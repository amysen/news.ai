The Research Association of Vision of North Korea interviewed 21 North Korean defectors who lived in Kilju, a nearby town north of the Punngye-ri nuclear test site where six tests have been conducted, and said babies were reportedly being born with birth defects and residents feared radiation contamination because of the high mortality rate for any form of life, South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported.

“I personally saw corpses floating down the river with their limbs severed."" - North Korean defector

""I heard from a relative in Kilju that deformed babies were born in hospitals there,” one defector said, according to the newspaper.

Another added: ""I spoke on the phone with family members I left behind there and they told me that all of the underground wells dried up after the sixth nuclear test.""

GRAPHIC PICTURE WARNING:

The defectors said drinking water in the town streamed down from Mount Montap, where the nuclear tests were reportedly conducted underground. They added authorities left residents in the area to fend for themselves and provided no warning prior to the detonations or protections after. A defector who fled North Korea in 2010 recalled how only soldiers and their family members were evacuated before two tests were conducted.

""During the first nuclear test [October 2006] and second one [May 2009], only family members of soldiers were evacuated to underground shafts. Ordinary people were completely unaware of the tests,” the defector recalled.

“I personally saw corpses floating down the river with their limbs severed,” the defector said, adding that local residents were also ordered to dig “deep holes for those tests.”

The defectors claimed all forms of life struggled to stay alive. About 80 percent of trees that were planted on the mountains died off, and trout and pine mushrooms just “disappeared” from the region when the first nuclear test was conducted in 2006.

""If you plant trees in the mountains there, 80 percent of them die. You can blame it on poor planting, but the number of trees that die is higher than in other mountains,” a defector said.

The defector accounts by Chosun Ilbo were not verified by North Korean officials, but the former North Korean residents claimed Kim Jong Un’s regime made sure none of the local residents were able to tell their stories.

One person recalled, ""Kilju locals who made appointments in a large hospital in Pyongyang were not allowed to enter the capital after the sixth nuclear test.""

""People who boarded trains to the border with samples of soil, water and leaves from Kilju County were arrested and sent to prison camps,” another defector said.

North Korea has slammed recent reports surrounding the Punngye-ri test site, calling a Japanese television’s claim that at least 200 people died when tunnels collapsed underground as “misinformation.” The report by Asahi TV, citing a North Korean source, stated hundreds were trapped and killed while doing underground construction on the tunnel last month. Scientists believe the site was destabilized after the sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3, when a purported hydrogen bomb was detonated. Satellite images obtained by 38 North, which specialized in North Korean issues, also showed a possible “collapsed chimney crater” at Mount Mantap.

Radiation leaking and drifting across the Sea of Japan and to the Japanese islands has also been a concern. Dr. Joel Myers, the founder and chairman of AccuWeather, said lingering radiation from the sixth nuclear test could threaten other countries. North Korean officials' hope to contain the radiation leakage within the Hermit Kingdom could change as winds pick up out of the northwest, according to Myers.

President Trump spent Tuesday in South Korea during his five-country Asia tour, his first visit to the region since taking office. North Korea immediately chastised the president, saying, ""Trump, accustomed to getting money by cajoling other people, recklessly mulls…a nuclear war gambling while despising the opponent,” the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported.","North Korea's nuclear test site causing 'deformed babies,' killing vegetation, defectors say",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/07/north-koreas-nuclear-test-site-causing-deformed-babies-killing-vegetation-defectors-say.html

Ed Gillespie, the Republican politico, failed to “embrace” the president, Trump tweeted Tuesday evening while in Asia. Until the results came in, Trump often took to Twitter to encourage Virginians to vote for Gillespie and accused Northam of ""fighting for the violent MS-13"" gang.

However, while Gillespie entwined much of Trump’s policies, he didn’t utilize the president while campaigning. Trump lost the swing state to opponent Hillary Clinton by about 5 points during the 2016 election.

Northam received 54 percent of the vote to Gillespie’s 45 percent, with 99 percent of precincts reporting. The lieutenant governor led Gillespie by about 5 percentage points in a Fox News poll ahead of the election.

Here’s a look at the candidates.

Ralph Northam, Democrat

Ralph Northam, the lieutenant governor of Virginia, is a physician and Army veteran. On his campaign website, he said he is “most proud” of “his career fighting for children – as a pediatric neurologist and volunteer medical director for a pediatric hospice care facility.”

While current Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is barred by state law from running for re-election, Northam, 58, is expected to govern the commonwealth much as McAuliffe did. He ran on greater gun control and abortion rights. He also promised to “be a brick wall against the discrimination of the Trump administration.”

Northam lives in Norfolk, Va., with his wife. They have two children.

Ed Gillespie, Republican

This wasn’t Ed Gillespie’s first rodeo when it came to Virginia politics. The 56-year-old ran against incumbent Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., in 2014 and nearly defeated him.

Gillespie is a former chair of the National Republican Committee and served as a counselor to former President George W. Bush for nearly two years. Gillespie touted his leadership within conservative circles on his campaign website, highlighting his time as chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia and work as a communications aide to former House Majority Leader Dick Armey.

Gillespie and his wife have three children and live in Fairfax County, Va. He graduated from Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.

Endorsements and ads

While Trump endorsed Gillespie in a tweet in October, the establishment gubernatorial candidate didn't totally embrace the president on the campaign trail. And he almost lost to an ardent Trump defender in the primary race.

But as the race came to a close, Gillespie reinvented himself and adopted more of Trump’s racially-tinged policies.

Still, Trump offered his support and encouraged his more than 40 million Twitter followers to “Vote Ed Gillespie!”

Trump also accused Northam of “fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs [and] sanctuary cities.”

Northam responded on Twitter with a link to his campaign donations website. He called the president a “narcissistic maniac” multiple times during the primary.

""Ralph Northam will allow crime to be rampant in Virginia. He’s weak on crime, weak on our GREAT VETS, Anti-Second Amendment and has been horrible on Virginia economy,"" Trump tweeted on the morning of the election.

Advertisements from both sides had been criticized ahead of Election Day.

Northam’s campaign came under fire for a Democratic mailer that showed Gillespie and Trump along with a photo of the angry white nationalists carrying torches who descended on Charlottesville, Va., in August. The mailer encourages voters to “stand up to hate.”

Northam stood by the mailer and slammed Gillespie for not denouncing Trump “for not calling these white supremacists out for who they are.”

“Because the message is that we live in a very diverse society. That means that we need to be inclusive,” Northam said, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

Another highly criticized ad – this one from the nonprofit Latino Victory Fund – showed frightened minority children being chased by a truck with a “Gillespie for governor” sticker, a Gadsden flag vanity license plate and Confederate flag.

“Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the American Dream?” a narrator asks in the one-minute spot.

Chris Leavitt, Gillespie’s campaign manager, slammed the advertisement as “an all-out attack on the people of Virginia” and blamed “Northam and his allies” for what he called a “desperate smear campaign.”

Northam’s supporters “have reached a new low with a disgusting, vile television ad seeking to instill fear in our children with that same imagery,” Leavitt said in a statement to Fox News.

Northam's campaign has defended the ad. Campaign spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel said in a statement that, ""It's not shocking that communities of color are scared of what his Trump-like policy positions mean for them.""

The ad was deleted after the New York City terrorist attack in October.

Gillespie, too, was criticized for ads in support of his campaign. He released several spots that attempted to tie Northam to the MS-13 gang.

One ad in particular showed a sinister hooded figure holding a baseball bat as the word’s “Kill, Rape, Control” – MS-13’s motto – flash on the screen. The ad accuses Northam of being “weak” on combating the gang.

The Northam campaign called Gillespie’s ads “beyond the pale.”

Bush hosted a fundraiser for Gillespie in Virginia in October. And Vice President Mike Pence joined him at a weekend rally.

Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton headlined a fundraiser for Northam in New York. And former Vice President Joe Biden backed Northam during a roundtable event.

Former President Barack Obama and Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J., also campaigned for Northam.

And some states contend it violates their laws to forward mental health records to the federal database.
The National Rifle Association and lawful gun owners are not involved in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
Start with enforcing the federal laws on the books before attempting one of those “conversations” about curtailing rights.","In the wake of a Baptist church shooting that left 26 people dead Sunday, Democratic politicians and pundits once again took to social media and cable news to denounce those who they deem to be the true monsters in the entire situation – National Rifle Association members and Christians offering thoughts and prayers.

The NRA was denounced a “terrorist organization” that was “drenched in the blood” of the victims of gun violence.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. – who looks like a pining presidential candidate – was of course out front in a rush to the microphones. He demanded that we all do “something,” without ever actually disclosing what that something might be. Apparently, what he really wants is confiscation of firearms from law-abiding Americans, who are now once again facing media backlash for a crime they had nothing to do with.

But as was revealed Sunday, in what is becoming a common theme in these mass shootings, no amount of background checking would have stopped the shooter in Sutherland Springs, Texas from purchasing his firearms, because the federal government failed to do it’s job properly. It’s not the first time.

If federal employees cannot perform the simplest of tasks of enforcing laws already on the books meant to keep people safe, then those employees need to be released and their agencies eliminated.

While serving in the U.S. Air Force, shooter Devin Patrick Kelley was convicted of domestic assault against his wife. He pleaded guilty to multiple charges stemming from incidents including physically striking his wife and choking and kicking her. He also pleaded guilty to assaulting his stepson, severely enough to crack the young child’s skull.

Kelley’s court-martial conviction should have disqualified him immediately from purchasing any kind of firearms. So what happened? The Associated Press reported:

“Under Pentagon rules, information about convictions of military personnel in crimes like assault is supposed to be submitted to the FBI’s Criminal Justice Investigation Services Division for inclusion in the National Criminal Information Center database. For unspecified reasons, the Air Force did not provide the information about Kelley as required.”

The AP report continued: “Acknowledging its mistake, the Air Force said in a written statement that the top two Air Force officials – Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson and Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein – have ordered a review of the Kelley case by the Air Force Office of the Inspector General.”

Because of a law passed in 1996, it’s illegal for anyone convicted a domestic abuse crime to purchase a firearm, something some of our dutiful lawmakers in Congress seem to not be aware of.

Because Kelley’s court records were never submitted the FBI database, Kelley sailed through several background checks and purchased up to four known firearms. Great work, guys.

This also appears to not just be a bad slip in judgment but a systematic problem. The Trace reported: “… the military has no distinct charge for domestic violence, notes Grover Baxley, a former judge advocate general who now practices military law as a civilian. ‘We see this all the time,’ Baxley said. ‘There is no specific domestic violence article.” Instead, military prosecutors charge abusers with other offenses, like assault. A scan of active records shows that the Department of Defense has just a single misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence on file with the National Criminal Instant Background Check System, or NICS.”

A chart accompanying the report shows a startling statistic. The military has submitted “zero records for members subject to domestic violence restraining orders” to federal authorities. This isn’t one or two bad apples falling through the cracks. This is a tree shaking them all to the ground.

But even when the FBI has all the data needed to flag someone from purchasing a gun, there have been examples of gross incompetence as well.

Dylann Roof shot and killed nine people during evening services at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015.

Roof was not legally permitted to own a firearm due to an unlawful drug possession charge from earlier that year. Roof’s record listed the wrong arresting agency and because of this error, he was able to legally purchase the weapon he used in the shooting. Victims of family members killed by Roof have filed suit against the U.S. government because of this avoidable error.

Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people and then committed suicide at the school in 2007, was under years of mental health observation. In 2005 he was accused of harassing female students and ordered by a court-appointed special justice, who declared him mentally ill, to attend treatment.

The justice declared that Cho “presents an imminent danger to himself as a result of mental illness.” Because Cho was never actually institutionalized, his state records were never sent to the FBI database, and he was able to purchase his weapons. Families of the victims settled with Virginia for $11 million in damages over the lapse.

A 2012 report from Mayors Against Illegal Guns found similar lapses in the background check system. As NPR reported: “The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined why states aren't submitting records in a July report. Some cited bureaucratic barriers, others technical ones, like switching from paper-based to computer systems. And some states contend it violates their laws to forward mental health records to the federal database. A few states are changing their laws.”

It should not matter if these incidences are occurring because of a political correctness stigma around mental health, or just dumb laziness. If federal employees cannot perform the simplest of tasks of enforcing laws already on the books meant to keep people safe, then those employees need to be released and their agencies eliminated.

The National Rifle Association and lawful gun owners are not involved in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. During the shooting in Texas, a former NRA instructor was instrumental in stopping Kelley’s rampage – a rampage that could have been prevented had our government not been asleep at the wheel again. But sure, let’s turn over our health care to the government now.



If our government cannot perform simple tasks like filling our criminal record forms and entering information into databases, then why in the world would we burden federal employees with new gun laws that do nothing but restrict the constitutional rights of citizens and vendors in full compliance with the law?

Start with enforcing the federal laws on the books before attempting one of those “conversations” about curtailing rights. When our government gets that right, then we can have a larger discussion about the Second Amendment.

Attorney General Paxton told Fox News that ""people never think"" a shooting like this can ""happen in their communities.""
Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.","At least 26 people were killed and 20 wounded in Texas after a gunman dressed in tactical gear opened fire at a church outside San Antonio on Sunday, investigators confirmed.

Multiple sources speaking to Fox News identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley. The mass shooting unfolded around 11:30 a.m. at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, which is about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio.

Investigators said at a news conference Sunday evening that the victims ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. One official said about 20 people were hospitalized with injuries ranging from minor to ""very severe.""

Sunday's massacre is the deadliest church shooting in modern U.S. history. It is also, according to Gov. Greg Abbott, the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history.

A possible motive was unclear. Kelley lived in a suburb of San Antonio and didn't appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. The official said investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley may have made in the days before Sunday's attack, including one that appeared to show a semiautomatic weapon.

A spokesperson with the U.S. Air Force confirmed to Fox News that Kelley served in the military branch at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until a bad conduct discharge in 2014.

He was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and child, and when he was discharged received 12 months of confinement and a reduction in military rank.

""It is horrible,"" Wilson County Commissioner Larry Wiley told Fox News of the massacre. ""It appears someone walked in and started shooting.""

Around 11:20 a.m., Kelley arrived at a Valero gas station across from the First Baptist Church dressed in black tactical gear and a ballistic vest. He crossed the street and started firing a Ruger AR rifle at the church, officials said. He entered the building and kept shooting.

He was confronted by an armed nearby resident who chased after him. Kelley was later found dead, roughly five miles away in Guadalupe County, according to Wiley. It's unclear whether Kelley was killed by police or the armed resident, or from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

""We have accepted a multiple number of patients from the shooting,"" Megan Posey, a spokeswoman for Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, 15 miles from the church, told Fox News.

Some victims were transported to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, KSAT reported.

Officials said 23 people were found deceased in First Baptist Church, while two were found dead outside. One person who was transported to a hospital later died.

One of those killed was 14-year-old Annabelle Pomeroy, the church pastor's daughter.

The FBI is investigating the shooting, in addition to multiple other agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The San Antonio Express-News reported police were checking the gunman's home for explosives following the shooting.

The church's layout would've made it difficult for churchgoers to flee a shooter who came through the front door, according to a congregant attending a vigil at the church Sunday night.

The church was described as having only small exits on the side and in the back, according to Hunter Green. He said if a gunman came through the front door, people ""wouldn't have had anywhere to go.""

Neighbors of Kelley's told The Associated Press they heard gunfire coming from his direction in recent days.

""It's really loud,"" 16-year-old Ryan Albers said. ""It was someone using automatic weapon fire.""

Another neighbor, who argued hearing gunfire in the area is not uncommon, said they had heard gunfire coming from across the street, but couldn't be sure if it was from Kelley's property.

Attorney General Paxton told Fox News that ""people never think"" a shooting like this can ""happen in their communities.""

""In a small town ... I can imagine that these people are devastated. And everyone in the community is going to ... have some type of close relationship"" to those either killed or injured at the First Baptist Church. He added it's ""hard to justify why anyone would do this.""

""This is horrific for our tiny little tight-knit town,"" Alena Berlanga, who lives 10 minutes outside of Sutherland Springs told The Associated Press. ""Everybody's going to be affected and everybody knows someone who's affected.""

President Trump, speaking from Tokyo during his trip to Asia, called the shooting an ""act of evil,"" and added: ""Through the tears and through the sadness, we stand strong.""

Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.""

Gov. Abbott said in a statement that ""While the details of this horrific act are still under investigation, Cecilia and I want to send our sincerest thoughts and prayers to all those who have been affected by this evil act.""

""I want to thank law enforcement for their response and ask that all Texans pray for the Sutherland Springs community during this time of mourning and loss,"" the statement read.

Sutherland Springs has a population of about 400 residents.

Sunday's shooting comes just over a month after 58 people were killed and hundreds injured on Oct. 1 after a gunman opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas.

In fact, our church may be the safest public gathering place in our city.
First, every church should hire at least one uniformed police officer to be visible in the main lobby and parking lot.
Our security team makes it possible for them to find hope and healing in a very safe environment.","Ten years ago, the church where I pastor, New Life Church, suffered through its darkest day when a gunman came on our property, opened fire with an assault rifle, killing two of our teenage girls, injuring others, before taking his life in the hallway. This Sunday, I was taking a special guest to our memorial site to tell her the miracle story of our healing, when the news broke that another church in South Texas had just experienced the same horror.

A military trained man with an assault rifle with the intent to kill unarmed people is almost impossible to stop. No amount of training could have prepared that tiny church in Texas for this evil. We’re now living in a violent society where even small-town America and small rural churches are not safe.

Church security was something I never heard discussed while growing up in North Louisiana. Guns were plentiful, but there seemed to be no threats to our safety in the sanctuaries of my youth. Today, the world has changed, and violence is seemingly always at our doorsteps.

We are not fearful, but we are wise. We are not downcast, but we are watchful.

The sad reality is that every church should have a strategy to protect its members when they gather. We had a great plan on December 9, 2007 that saved scores of lives and today, we are even more prepared. In fact, our church may be the safest public gathering place in our city. We take it seriously.

We have learned some valuable lessons. First, every church should hire at least one uniformed police officer to be visible in the main lobby and parking lot. Every Sunday, there is a police car parked in front of our church. These off-duty officers are paid by us to be present. They are now our friends and we see them as part of our vital team each weekend. Most crime studies show that criminals can be deterred by the physical presence of the police on property. If local police are not available, hire a very visible security guard.

When we first employed uniformed police, people were concerned that church would feel unsafe, but the opposite has happened. So many people have personally thanked me for having the officers present, because it is so reassuring. That is a huge testimony to our local police and sheriff’s department, who both have stellar reputations in our community.

Because we live in a military town, we’re able to recruit and train dozens of men and women to serve our church as volunteers. They spend all week protecting our nation and they love serving their church the same way. They dress in plain clothes, but walk the property during our worship services, serving our people.

We live in a state that allows most people to carry concealed weapons and to carry openly if they choose. We discourage our members from bringing guns into the church. In fact, if we know someone has a weapon, we escort them out to their car and watch them put it away. We have plenty of trained and qualified people who are appropriately armed, so extra weapons are not necessary and can actually cause more harm should there be a violent episode.

We train our team to be watchful and diligent, but not obtrusive or aggressive. In fact, most of the 10,000 or so people who attend our church are not even aware of the security team, other than noticing a police car out front. We are a church, not a sports stadium, so we do not have metal detectors, and we are not checking handbags as people enter.

Most of the violence that happens in a church is a spillover of some sort of domestic issue. Families target one another at church because they know they can be found at a certain time and place each week. Our pastors are sensitive to families going through divorce or some type of custody dispute with their children. If there’s a problem at home that could affect our church, we alert the police officer on duty. Many times, that officer has diffused conflict before it ever turns ugly and violent.

With all this attention to violence and securing our worship space, we have made sure that we have not lost our innocence along the way. We are not fearful, but we are wise. We are not downcast, but we are watchful. We gather every week, to pray our songs, to sing our prayers and to learn the Scriptures. We have chosen to forgive those who wish us harm and to bless those that speak evil against us.

Church is a holy gathering of imperfect people. People wrestling with mental health and those struggling with relationships come through our doors every day. Our security team makes it possible for them to find hope and healing in a very safe environment.","Pastor: Our church had a deadly shooting, too.

Cody Andersen, 33, told Fox News he was thrilled to be accepted in 2010 as an intern at Webster PR, a firm that boasted Dolly Parton, Charlie Daniels and Kenny Rogers among its clients. And when Webster, the firm’s CEO, started taking an interest in him, Andersen said he thought it was because of his work ethic.

“Everything was fine for a while,” Andersen told Fox News in an interview Wednesday. But when the then-intern revealed he was transgender, things started to become “uncomfortable” with Webster.

“After I told him I was trans, he told me he was gay,” Andersen told us. “And one day he followed me [into] the bathroom and he was like, ‘Do you want to?’ I was like, ‘What?’ He said, ‘F--k.’ And I was like, ‘No, no.’”

“I was really taken aback by it…” Andersen said.

Harvey Weinstein scandal: What you need to know

Andersen alleged Webster would speak openly about a number of sexually graphic topics, like owning a 24-carat gold sex toy. He also said Webster often told sexually explicit stories about his employees.

Andersen alleges that Webster once asked him to come into a hot tub, naked. That prompted Andersen to alert the Webster company human resources office — several times.

“[My complaint] didn’t go anywhere,” Andersen said. “To get out of Kirt Webster’s grasp once he brings you in, it's hard to get away from him… He’s a predator.”

Andersen said he told his family about the ongoing harassment. A family member spoke to Fox News who recalled hearing about Webster’s alleged behavior in detail at the time, back when Andersen was 26.

Andersen’s claims came a day after former singer Austin C. Rick, who performed under the name Austin Cody, told Fox News he suffered months of “terrible, terrible” abuse at the hands of Webster.

Through his company, Webster denied the allegations in a statement Tuesday afternoon, saying he engaged in a consensual relationship with Rick. Fox News was told on Wednesday afternoon Webster will take ""some time away from the business to focus on combating the egregious and untrue allegations made against him.""

The company announced Wednesday it will continue operating under the name Westby PR with former Webster PR Vice President Jeremy Westby as CEO. However, Westby told Fox News on Thursday that Webster is not involved in Westby PR in any capacity.

When reached by email about Andersen’s allegation, a rep for Webster said she had no additional information at this time.

Rick and Andersen’s stories are two of “many,” according to five former employees who spoke to Fox News this week. They detailed instances where they say Webster showed them porn, made lewd gestures in the office and mocked clients during staff meetings.

A former employee previously known to Fox News, who wished to remain anonymous, said Webster touched him inappropriately on “multiple occasions” adding there are “so many” stories similar to his.

“There’s no telling how many there are,” he said. “There [is] sexual harassment running rampant through that place as long as I’ve known.” A close friend told Fox News the former employee discussed Webster’s behavior in detail many times with him.

A former female employee told Fox News Webster once grabbed her hair and “humped” her in front of fellow staff members. She called the behavior “typical,” and said her former boss would “caress me” on multiple occasions. She also alleged Webster made comments about her vagina in front of clients. Her roommate at the time told Fox News the former employee told her they discussed Webster’s behavior at length, and the roommate met Webster several times and witnessed his “lewd behavior.”

Another female former employee told us Webster was “verbally abusive” and told her he was going to “cut my [clitoris].’”

“He scares you. He makes you think you’ll never work in country music again,” she said. Her boyfriend at the time told Fox News he often urged her to leave Webster after hearing about her then-boss’ behavior.

A fourth former employee told Fox News he was hired after graduating from college, and was asked to bring things to Webster at his home, where he encountered his then-boss watching porn.

“One time he was just sitting in a towel on his couch watching porn. He invited me into his hot tub, and when I told him I didn’t have a swimsuit, he implied I could come in naked.”

A fifth former employee told Fox News working for Webster was “the worst experience"" of his life.

“Everybody in Nashville knows Kirt Webster and knows he's a horrible person,” he said.

Reviews on the site Glassdoor, a platform for people to anonymously share information about companies, mimic the sentiments former Webster employees shared with Fox News.

“[Webster] runs his business using fear, intimidation, and harassment,” one reviewer from October 15 wrote. “I am not exaggerating in my accusation of Webster PR as a hostile work environment where employees are subject to sexual harassment, sudden and inappropriate anger outbursts.”

Representatives for Webster himself, or for the company, did not respond to numerous requests for comment.","Country music's top publicist accused of propositioning intern for sex, showing employees porn",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/02/country-musics-top-publicist-accused-propositioning-intern-for-sex.html

Pendants, uplights, downlights, LEDs — are you confused by all the options out there in kitchen lighting when it comes to creating the illumination you need to prep, cook and dine? We’ve asked expert Ben Mills to explain the different lighting types and the main things to consider in planning an effective design.

Why is kitchen lighting so important? For most of us, the kitchen is the workhorse of the home and a busy spot from morning till night. Good lighting is essential, as it allows you to perform tasks such as prepping food and cleaning up safely, says Mills, executive general manager at Australia’s Crompton Lighting. Plus, it adds character to a space and can quickly take the mood from functional to cozy, perfect for an eat-in kitchen.

Plan lighting as early as possible. Moving light fixtures after a kitchen has been installed can be expensive: Rewiring and repainting mean costs can add up quickly. For that reason, it’s best to plan kitchen lighting during the design stage.

What is a layered lighting design? Light layering involves creating different shades of light, playing with shadows and using colors to highlight a room’s best features. In the kitchen, it generally incorporates task lighting for food prep and cooking, ambient lighting for general illumination and character, and accent lighting to highlight specific features such as a gorgeous backsplash or a piece of art.

Consider safety first. The first priority of kitchen lighting is to provide sufficient illumination for safe and efficient meal prep, cooking and cleaning. This is achieved with task lighting — think LED strip lights under an upper cabinet (these create a lovely, even light with no shadows or heat) or a track system over the island.

Make sure there are no shadows in your prep zones. The best way to do is this is to install task lighting in front of or above you, rather than behind you.

Add ambient lighting for character. Soft, ambient lighting will wash your kitchen with light and create a warm, welcoming glow. It could be in the form of a pendant above a counter or dining table, downlights around the perimeter of the room or a central ceiling light.

Highlight your best features with accent light. Use accent lighting to draw attention to special features such as a backsplash or a dramatic island facade. Installing strip lighting under cabinets or counters is a great way to achieve this. You could also add accent lighting to glass cabinets or open shelving to highlight your displays.

Choose the right style. When it comes to choosing kitchen lights, take your cues from your home’s architecture and the lighting styles in the rest of the home. Choosing similar styles (or at least having a unifying theme such as shape or finish) will create a sense of flow among the spaces. This is particularly important in an open-plan kitchen that flows directly into a living or dining area.

When it comes to decorative lighting trends, the Scandi look is still popular, as well as simple styles in natural wood and black, white and industrial metallics.

Get the proportions right. With pendant lights and other decorative styles, size is also important: too large and the fixture will overwhelm a small kitchen; too small and it may get lost in a large space.

It’s also important to hang the pendant at an appropriate height to reduce the risk of people bumping their heads. Generally speaking, it should be about 32 inches above a table or counter.

Take control. Lighting control systems allow you to alter the illumination as needed and change the mood of the space. With dimmers, for example, you can go from bright lighting for precision cooking to a warm glow for dining. Having controls on separate switch plates lets you control lights in different areas separately.

Don’t be tempted to do the job yourself — unless you’re a trained electrician, always hire a professional to do electrical work in your home.",9 pro tips for choosing kitchen lighting,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/03/9-pro-tips-for-choosing-kitchen-lighting.html

After recovering, instead of picking back up where he left off, he determinedly returned to Patagonia, amidst hurricane winds, to begin again.

The survey also showed 92 percent of veteran households support research into medical marijuana, including as a possible substitute for prescription opioids.

The telephone survey of the Legion's two-million members was conducted from Oct. 8 to Oct. 10 by Five Corners Strategies, an independent public opinion research company, and had a margin of error of 3.43 percent.

The survey found bipartisan support for legalizing medicinal marijuana, with 88 percent of self-identified conservatives and 90 percent of self-identified liberals in agreement.

The Legion has previously called on the Drug Enforcement Agency to reclassify marijuana to recognize it as ""a drug with potential medical value.”

In August during the group's national convention in Nevada, the group passed a resolution calling on the federal government to allow medical providers within the Department of Veterans Affairs to discuss medical cannabis as a treatment option in states where medical marijuana is legal.

At a news conference Thursday announcing the results of the study, Legion Executive Director Verna Jones said the group is ""not advocating for recreational use of marijuana, but we are advocating for the removal of cannabis from Schedule One of the Controlled Substances Act so that more medical investigators can do research.""

The removal of marijuana from the list of ""Schedule One"" drugs, which includes heroin and Ecstasy, would place it in a different category of drugs deemed to have no medical use.

A father is begging for help after a mosquito bite left him with ""elephant leg disease,"" which caused his limb to swell to four times the size.

Chetan Pithadia, 53, noticed his left leg was getting bigger four years ago and doctors gave him pills that did not help.

His leg continued to bulge to an estimated 55 pounds, and his foot can now barely be seen thanks to huge folds and lumps.

The condition is caused by parasitic filarial worms carried by mosquitoes which enter the body when victims are bitten.

The former garment worker from Jaamnagar, India, who has since had to give up work, is appealing for help to raise $4,500 he needs for treatment.

""But the process requires admitting me to hospital for a month three times, and I will need medicines for around two years,"" Pithadia said.

Pithadia, who lives with his wife, son and daughter, said he initially thought the swelling was temporary.

“I’ve witnessed him bragging [to staff about] telling Dolly Parton fans they can have a meet-and-greet for a b--- job,” according to a former Webster employee, who worked on Parton’s publicity team for several years. The former employee, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retribution by Webster, said Webster also told the then-employee directly that he received oral sex, on multiple occasions, in exchange for the meet-and-greets.

The ex-employee told Fox News that Webster routinely approached fans and asked for sexually explicit images, and told the fans they could meet the 71-year-old country superstar if they complied. The former employee said Webster showed her and other employees the explicit photos he received from fans, after promising to introduce them to Parton. The employee’s boyfriend, who also spoke to Fox News, said she often complained of Webster’s lurid use of Parton’s fame.

The former employee said she does not believe Parton was ever aware of Webster’s behavior.

Another former staffer who worked for Webster told Fox News he also heard the publicist brag about “trading” meet-and-greets and backstage passes for oral sex, as late as Parton’s “most recent touring season.” Parton’s ""Pure and Simple"" tour ran from June 3, 2016 to December 10, 2016.

A third employee echoed the others’ statements and said Webster often spoke of using Parton’s name for sexual favors from fans.

Parton cut ties with Webster’s firm this week, and her face disappeared from the front page of the company website on Thursday. It was not immediately clear if she had acquired a new publicist. Her manager and record label did not return repeated requests for comment about Webster allegedly using her name in exchange for sexual favors.

Parton released a note about Webster late Thursday via Twitter, which some fans criticized as not critical enough of the publicist. ""I've worked with Kirt Webster for many years, and he has done a wonderful job. I am hoping that the accusations are not true,"" she wrote.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on.
I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly.
After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears.
My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""","The day my oldest daughter was born, I held her in my arms in the hospital and made two promises: ""First, I promise I will never leave your mother; and second, I'll show up. I'll do everything I can to be at your recitals and ball games and dinner around the table.""

My baby laid there in my arms blinking, breathing, oblivious to the magnitude of the words I was saying.

My promises seemed so valiant when I made them at the hospital. But when I got home, I realized my daughter was going to need my wife and me to do a lot more than just stay married and love each other. She needed to see a regular demonstration of our love. That was not our strong suit.

While we loved each other deeply, we were in a constant battle for control and both of us were losing as we bickered and bickered. Having a baby in the house made us more self-conscious about what we sounded like – especially to the ears of a little one. We made an unspoken agreement to change.

I'd like to say we immediately abandoned our old habits and learned how to disagree without being disagreeable. That, however, would not be true. We still struggled, but at least we were finally making an effort to resist our dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

Over the years we made a lot of progress, which was largely due to confessing our struggles with Christian friends and praying things like ""Father, please show me how I need to change.""

God responded, showing us unflattering things about our character that we didn't want to see. It was humbling and made us less likely to assume we were always right when there was a conflict. It also had an unexpected benefit: We became more affectionate to each other.

I don't mean to say we weren't affectionate before – we never lost the spark of infatuation that attracted us to each other in the first place. But as we grew in humility towards each other, we were more likely to gently touch each other in the car or say encouraging things to each other in the everyday ho-hum. We had no idea the impact it was having on the other members of our household.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on. I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly. I could tell it caught her off-guard and embarrassed her a little – it came out of nowhere. Thank goodness she stayed in my arms and danced with me anyway.

As the song approached the final chorus, I looked in my peripheral vision and suddenly realized we weren't alone. Our daughters, who were five and seven, were standing there watching us in silence.

The song approached the end, and as the strings played the last notes, I decided to give the girls a Hollywood ending. I took my wife's face in my hands and kissed her. After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears. Then she came over, buried her face in my wife's legs, and cried.

""Why are you crying?"" my wife asked.

""I can't explain it.""

""Can you at least give me one word to describe how you're feeling?"" I asked.

My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""

That one word – ""loved""— took my breath away. Like so many others, I work hard to be a good parent and spouse, but I typically see those roles as having separate tasks and separate functions. My daughter helped me see that there's far more overlap for children than we realize.

Parents are the first two people who get the opportunity to teach children what love looks like, and our kids are counting on us to prove that love is real.

Children want to see their imperfect, dysfunctional parents dance in the kitchen, say ""I love you"" when they get off the phone, pray together, kiss as they say goodbye and speak highly of each other. Those moments of affection provide assurance to our kids – the world isn't all bad. Things are going to be OK at home.

Demonstrating marital love to our children is a privilege, a unique opportunity to be both a good parent and a good spouse. To love each other well is to love our children well.",What happened when my daughter saw me kiss my wife,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/what-happened-when-my-daughter-saw-me-kiss-my-wife.html

But both the Trump and Clinton campaign imbroglios with foreign players are tokens of the challenges posed by globalization.","As long as there has been politics, there has been corruption. So the investigative hand-grenades which have been flying for the past year, first at the Trump campaign, now at Mrs. Clinton’s, are not exactly new in American political life. What is new, however, is the geography.

Corruption used to be something American politicians did with other Americans. Now, it’s become something that involves other countries, and one in particular – Russia – which can’t be accused of friendly intentions toward the United States.

Curiously, at the beginning of the nation, Americans were confident that political corruption would never happen in their republic. Corruption was what occurred in monarchies, and (to judge by the long list of accusations in the Declaration of Independence) especially under King George III.

But once independent, American politicians proved to be just as short on virtue. Thomas Jefferson, the first Secretary of State under the first president, George Washington, put a journalistic hit-man, Philip Freneau, on the State Department payroll to dig up dirt on Washington and other cabinet members.

The Clintons have been associated with foreign pay-for-play activities since the 1990s, and the Fusion GPS affair is, in many ways, simply an extension of that association. But both the Trump and Clinton campaign imbroglios with foreign players are tokens of the challenges posed by globalization.

Andrew Jackson frankly used his presidential appointments power to reward political cronies in what became known as the “spoils system.”

Bribery and kickbacks were so notorious within the administration of James Buchanan (1856-60) that when Abraham Lincoln ran for the presidency in 1860, his supporters made a bigger issue of Buchanan’s corruption than of slavery. And corruption almost became a way of defining the presidencies of Ulysses Grant in the 1870s and Warren Harding in the 1920s.

Surprisingly, there were few actual convictions for corruption before the 1940s. Politicos whose corrupt practices were exposed to public gaze simply resigned or, more rarely, were impeached.

Only very gradually did Congress move to criminalize corruption through the Hobbs Act (1946), the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (known as RICO), and the Federal Campaign Elections Act (1971).

This has, nevertheless, done little to stem the tide of corruption. Since 1986, five federal judges have been impeached on bribery charges; since 2000, five members of the House of Representatives have been convicted in corruption cases.

In 1987 five U.S. senators – including John McCain – tried to intercede on behalf of Charles Keating and his failing Lincoln Savings & Loan after Keating made $1.3 billion in campaign contributions to them. Only one of the “Keating five” was officially reprimanded after a Senate investigation; the others were criticized for “poor judgment.""

Bill Clinton, as president, brought the Democratic National Committee’s fund-raising activities under the White House roof, including 103 events which netted an average of $56,000 per person in contributions to the DNC. Yet, only one Clinton official, Ronald Blackley, was actually indicted and convicted.

Part of the depressingly relentless spread of corruption has to do with the size of the federal government itself – in an annual budget of $3.5 trillion, there are tremendous amounts of fruit on the federal tree to be picked illegally, and few places where it is liable to be noticed. Another part is the sheer variety of corrupt practices, which invent themselves into new shapes, from money-laundering to tax-exemptions, faster than statutes can criminalize them.

The newest beachhead, however, has involved corruption with foreign partners.

Starting in the 1980s, when Illinois Congressman Paul Findley was accused of receiving laundered contributions from Saudi oil interests, foreign money has exploited cracks in federal campaign legislation to make itself felt in federal elections.

From 1994 to 1996, Johnny Chung funneled $366,000 in campaign donations to the DNC from 12 Chinese donors, with another $300,000 donated in 1996 from officials of the state-owned Chinese aero-space industry.

In 2009, Louisiana Representative William J. Jefferson was charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (which was originally designed to prevent U.S. corporations from engaging in foreign bribery) for bribes he solicited from third-world governments to promote their business interests in the U.S.

The charges of Russian “collusion” which have now been hurled by both political parties are part of this disturbing new trend. On one hand, Paul Manafort’s ties to Ukraine and Jared Kushner’s conversations with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya look embarrassing, but have as yet turned into nothing illegal under federal election law or the FCPA.

The rebound accusations which have emerged over the past week that Mrs. Clinton’s campaign hired a British intelligence officer and Fusion GPS (a Washington-based intelligence firm with ties to Russian interests) to create a foreign-sourced dossier on Trump are far more blatant, and thus far more serious than Trump Tower chit-chat.

The Clintons have been associated with foreign pay-for-play activities since the 1990s, and the Fusion GPS affair is, in many ways, simply an extension of that association. But both the Trump and Clinton campaign imbroglios with foreign players are tokens of the challenges posed by globalization.

In a world of instant communications, where global interests aggressively over-shadow national concerns and where enormous sums of unregulated money can be moved at digital speed through various levels of concealment, foreign influences are only likely to become more threatening.

Whatever the outcomes of the various “Russiagate” investigations, the real test will be in how vigorously the American people will demand -- and Congress adopt -- newer, sharper legislation to deter foreign-connected corruption.

But while heart-wrenching details of the rampage that left 26 people dead might revive the debate over the balance of digital privacy rights and national security, it's not likely to prompt change anytime soon.

Congress has not shown a strong appetite for legislation that would force technology companies to help the government break into encrypted phones and computers. And the fiery public debate surrounding the FBI's legal fight with Apple Inc. has largely faded since federal authorities announced they were able to access a locked phone in a terror case without the help of the technology giant.

As a candidate, Donald Trump called on Americans to boycott Apple unless it helped the FBI hack into the phone, but he hasn't been as vocal as president.

Still, the issue re-emerged Tuesday, when Christopher Combs, the special agent in charge of the FBI's San Antonio division, said agents had been unable to get into the cell phone belonging to Devin Patrick Kelley, who slaughtered much of the congregation in the middle of a Sunday service.

""It highlights an issue you've all heard about before. With the advance of the technology and the phones and the encryption, law enforcement is increasingly not able to get into these phones,"" Combs told reporters. He did not provide further details other than saying the device was being flown to an FBI lab for analysis. ""We're working very hard to get into that phone, and that will continue until we find an answer,"" Combs added.

Combs was telegraphing a longstanding frustration of the FBI, which claims encryption has stymied investigations of everything from sex crimes against children to drug cases, even if they obtain a warrant for the information. Agents have been unable to retrieve data from half the mobile devices — more than 6,900 phones, computers and tablets — that they tried to access in less than a year, FBI Director Christopher Wray said last month, wading into an issue that also vexed his predecessor, James Comey. Comey spoke before Congress and elsewhere about the bureau's inability to access digital devices. But the Obama White House never publicly supported legislation that would have forced technology companies to give the FBI a back door to encrypted information, leaving Comey's hands tied to propose a specific legislative fix.

Security experts generally believe such encryption backdoors are a terrible idea that could expose a vast amount of private, business and government data to hackers and spies. That's because those backdoor keys would work for bad guys as well as good guys — and the bad guys would almost immediately target them for theft, and might even be able to recreate them from scratch.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein took aim at Silicon Valley's methods for protecting privacy during a speech last month, saying Trump's Justice Department would be more aggressive in seeking information from technology companies. He took a harder line than his predecessors but stopped short of saying what specific steps the administration might take.

Washington has proven incapable of solving a problem that an honest conversation could fix, said David Hickton, a former U.S. attorney who now directs a cyberlaw institute at the University of Pittsburgh.

""We wait for a mass disaster to sharpen the discussion about this, when we should have been talking about it since San Bernardino,"" he said. ""Reasonable people of good will could resolve this problem. I don't think it's dependent on the political wins or who is the FBI director. It's begging for a solution.""

Even so, the facts of the church shooting may not make it the most powerful case against warrant-proof encryption. When the FBI took Apple to court in February 2016 to force it to unlock the San Bernardino shooter's phone, investigators believed the device held clues about whom the couple communicated with and where they may have traveled.

But Combs didn't say what investigators hoped to retrieve from Kelley's phone, and investigators already have ample information about his motive. Authorities in Texas say the church shooting was motivated by the gunman's family troubles, rather than terrorism, and investigators have not said whether they are seeking possible co-conspirators.

Investigators may have other means to get the information they seek. If the Texas gunman backed up his phone online, they can get a copy of that with a legal order — usually a warrant. They can also get warrants for any accounts he had at server-based internet services such as Facebook, Twitter and Google.

In the California case, the FBI ultimately broke into the phone by paying an unidentified vendor for a hacking tool to access the phone without Apple's help, averting a court battle. It's unclear if the FBI could or would do that again; phone security varies widely by model, and Combs wouldn't say what the gunman had.

Former federal prosecutor Joseph DeMarco, who filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of groups that supported the Justice Department against Apple, said he was hopeful the case would spur fresh discussion. If not by itself, he said, the shooting could be one of several cases that prompt the Justice Department to take other technology companies to court.

""Eventually, the courts will rule on this or a legislative fix will be imposed,"" he said. ""Eventually, the pressure will mount.""",Texas shooting: FBI again finds itself unable to unlock a gunman's cellphone,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/08/texas-shooting-fbi-again-finds-itself-unable-to-unlock-gunmans-cellphone.html

WARNING: VIDEO CONTAINS STRONG LANGUAGE

The Taco Bell employee explains to the woman that she is not in Burger King — she is in Taco Bell, which does not offer hamburgers or french fries. The employee then tries to take the woman’s order, who once again, asks for french fries.

Once the woman seemingly understands that the fast food chain doesn’t sell french fries, she attempts to have the employee read the menu. The employee does not.

As the woman continues to stand at the counter, she becomes increasingly distraught that the employee is intentionally not being nice to her, and proclaims, “This is racism at it’s f---ing finest,” before nearly dissolving into tears.

Another customer steps in and tells her it’s not racism — it's just that Taco Bell sells “tacos and burritos.”

After an exchange with other people in the restaurant, where she claims to work “with people who are challenged every day,” the customer again refers to Burger King — where she apparently still thinks she is.

Another employee tried to help out by “starting over” and walking the woman through the menu, but the woman felt that she had been treated poorly by both the drive-thru employee and the counter employee, and decides to leave, ultimately stating “I don’t like what happened here.”

Happy Birthday, Billy Graham!","The Rev. Billy Graham turned 99 on Tuesday. To me, he will always be America's preacher. He introduced a brand of faith unlike any our country or even the world had ever seen. He brought millions of people to faith in Jesus Christ through his simple, down-home, country preacher style.

I’ve just returned from Ashville, N.C., where I spoke at the Todd Starnes Fall Getaway at the Billy Graham Training Center, also known as The Cove. This bucolic setting is nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains, not far from Mt. Pisgah and a short distance from the Biltmore Mansion.

The Cove is a reminder of the dedication that Billy Graham and his deceased wife, Ruth, had to teaching people how to put their faith into action. It was not enough to go to church on Sundays. Faith was something that you lived every moment of your life.

The training center teaches the lessons that Billy Graham taught, by being a haven for people from all over the world. They come for conferences, retreats and seminars.

At The Cove, you never know when you might see a member of the Graham family. They continue the work of their famous patriarch.

I was privileged to have Anne Graham Lotz, Billy Graham’s second-oldest daughter, stop by and listen to my talk on music as God’s creation. She has her own Angel Ministry and is the author of 11 books. She said a few words to the group and talked a little about how her dad was doing ahead of his birthday. She told us his faith in Jesus Christ is as strong as ever.

During the seminar, guests got a sneak peek at the sequel to the movie “Unbroken,” the Louis Zamperini story. The new movie, called “Unbroken: Path to Redemption,” focuses on how the WWII prison camp survivor came to faith at a Billy Graham tent meeting in Los Angeles in 1949. Graham’s grandson, Will, is playing his grandfather in the new film.

It was that tent revival that put Billy Graham on the world stage, because of two words the newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst directed to his editors: “Puff Graham.” The rest, as they say is history. From newspapers, to radio, to television, Billy Graham could mesmerize a crowd. But he always said it wasn’t about him. It was about Jesus.

Other ministers have come to the stage to carry on the mantle of Billy Graham. Ministers like Bishop T.D. Jakes, Pastor Rick Warren and Franklin Graham. But it was Billy Graham who started it all. Something happened in 1949 that changed forever how people understand what it means to be a faithful believer.

Activists have been urging the European Union to take action against Denmark over the Faroe Islands’ whale hunts.","Gruesome pictures given to Fox News show the mass slaughter of whales and dolphins in a series of hunts in the waters around the Faroe Islands this summer.



The pictures were taken by volunteers from the ocean conservation group Sea Shepherd Global posing as tourists on the Faroe Islands, a Danish archipelago halfway between Norway and Iceland.

The group told Fox News that its volunteers participated in “covert land-based patrols” to document the hunts, which are legal in Denmark, over a 10-week period from July to early September this year.

The project’s goal was to expose “the continued barbaric killing of dolphins and pilot whales by the Faroese,” said Sea Shepherd U.K. Director Rob Read in a statement emailed to Fox News. Some 18 volunteers from the U.K. and France took part, he added.

GRUESOME PIC SHOWS MASS SLAUGHTER OF WHALES IN FAROE ISLANDS HUNT

The hunts, or “drives,” date back to the late 16th century. Authorities on the islands allow residents to drive herds of pilot whales into shallow waters, where they are killed using a ‘spinal lance’ that is inserted through the animal’s neck to break its spinal cord.

Sea Shepherd Global said that its volunteers documented nine separate hunts, which are known as grindadrap in the local Faroese language. The nine hunts accounted for the deaths of 198 Atlantic white-sided dolphins and 436 pilot whales, according to the conservation group.

The Faroe Islands government slammed Sea Shepherd's activities in a statement emailed to Fox News. ""Sea Shepherd representatives will go to any lengths to paint a negative picture of the Faroese whale hunt as 'barbaric', 'unnecessary', 'evil' and 'lunacy' describing Faroese as 'sadistic psychopaths', with the aim of inciting anger and outrage against the people of the Faroe Islands,"" it said. ""They have chosen an easy target, as whale drives in the Faroe Islands take place in the open for anyone to watch and document.""

'UNPRECEDENTED' ORCA HUNTING FRENZY CAPTURED ON FILM

The government noted that whale meat and blubber of pilot whales have long been a valued part of the Faroes' national diet. ""Catches are shared largely without the exchange of money among the participants in a whale drive and residents of the local district where they are landed,"" it said. ""Each whale provides the communities with several hundred kilos of meat and blubber – meat that otherwise had to be imported from abroad.""

One Sea Shepherd Global volunteer, whose identity has been withheld by the organization, described the Aug. 29 hunt at the Faroese village of Hvannasund.

“Witnessing a grind first hand was truly an eye-opening experience,” explained the volunteer, in a statement provided to Fox News. “As the pilot whales were driven to the shoreline by the small boats the intensity of the thrashing bodies grew. Hooks were sunk into the blowholes and the whales were dragged onto the shore in a sadistic game of ‘Tug of War.’ We witnessed whales seemingly bashing their heads against the stones in a frenzy.”

HUGE SEAL BATTLES OCTOPUS IN INCREDIBLE FIGHT TO THE DEATH

Sea Shepherd Global says that 46 long-finned pilot whales were killed in the Aug. 29 Hvannasund hunt.

An unnamed eyewitness also described a hunt at the village of Bour on Aug. 31, where 29 long-finned pilot whales were reportedly killed. “We recorded children attempting to remove the teeth of several whales with nothing more than a pocket knife as well as removing slices of what appeared to be a tumour on one whale,” said the Sea Shepherd volunteer in a statement.

Around 1,700 pilot whales and white-sided dolphins (including the aforementioned hunts) have been caught in the Faroe Islands so far this year, according to the islands' government. ""The annual long-term average catch of pilot whales in the Faroe Islands is around 800 whales, with large fluctuations in total catches and the number of individual whale drives from year to year,"" it added.

MYSTERIOUS OCTOPUS INVASION ROCKS BEACH IN WALES

Official statistics show that 295 pilot whales were killed last year and 501 were killed in 2015.

Faroese authorities say that whaling on the islands is sustainable. ""The long-term annual average catch of pilot whales in the Faroe Islands represents less that 1% of the total estimated stock,"" said the islands government, in its statement emailed to Fox News. ""It has long since been internationally recognised that pilot whale catches in the Faroe Islands are fully sustainable.""

The hunts can happen at any time of the year and the long-finned pilot whales are not an endangered species.

The ‘spinal lance’ used to kill the whales was designed by a Faroese veterinarian and ensures that the mammals lose consciousness and die within a few seconds, a spokesman for the Faroe Islands government told Fox News earlier this year. An entire pod of whales is typically killed in less than fifteen minutes, he said.

The islands' government says that the pilot whale population in the eastern North Atlantic is approximately 778,000, of which around 100,000 are around the Faroes.

""Sheep farming, whaling and fowling have enabled the Faroe Islands as an island nation to maintain a relatively high degree of self-sufficiency in food production,"" said the government, in its statement to Fox News. ""In the Faroe Islands it is considered both economic and environmental good sense to make the most of locally available natural resources, and to maintain the knowledge required to use what nature can provide in a harsh oceanic environment.""

With her cart full of groceries and her hand full of coupons, she looked at me in line and said: “When will it get better, Kristi? The cost of these groceries, of health care, of child care – they’re all going up, but I haven’t gotten a raise in years.”

She’s not alone. Many American families in every state are asking that exact question: When will it get better? When will the pinch stop?

Last week, House Republicans introduced a once-in-a-generation tax reform package that will finally give folks some breathing room. In fact, the nonpartisan Tax Foundation finds that after years of the status quo, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will increase wages by 3.1 percent, add 975,000 jobs, and raise the after-tax income of the average middle-income family by nearly $2,600.

What’s more, those savings are targeted toward our priorities: maybe most importantly, building strong families.

For instance, at the same time our legislation lowers tax rates across the board, it grows the Child Tax Credit by 60 percent, creates a new Family Flexibility Credit and protects the Child Care Credit for working families.

Our bill also gives people a boost during those milestone times in their lives, such as when they buy a home or save for retirement. On top of it all, the legislation significantly simplifies the tax code, so many busy families can file their taxes on a form as simple as a postcard. Think of the stress that would save come tax time.

And while we offer support to the families raising our next generation, this tax reform package is also designed to help job creators thrive from one generation to the next.

Today more than 70 percent of family businesses don’t make it to the second generation, and 90 percent don’t survive to the third. There are many reasons for this, but our tax code doesn’t make it any easier.

One of the hallmarks of the House GOP plan is a historically low 25 percent tax rate on small businesses that is accompanied by reforms to level the playing field and reduce compliance costs. Additionally, we fully and permanently repeal the Death Tax by 2024, doubling the exemption levels between now and then.

I know there are folks who want to keep the Death Tax in place, who say it doesn’t really impact families. That’s simply false. Our family was hit by the Death Tax when my dad died suddenly in a farming accident.

A few months afterward, we got a letter from the IRS telling us we owed the Death Tax. We were still reeling from the loss of the powerhouse in our family, and already, the government was reaching out its hand to take part of our American Dream. We had a tough choice: sell off a portion of our family farm or face a decade in debt. We took a decade in debt and struggled to keep our heads above water.

From that experience, I learned firsthand how awful and immoral the Death Tax is, but ultimately, the justification for its repeal rests in the fact that it’s a double – sometimes triple – tax. Families hit by it have already paid taxes on their land, machinery, and cattle. Now, because they experienced a tragedy, the federal government forces them to fork over a substantial amount of that hard-earned success.

By eliminating the Death Tax, we’ll eliminate one of the most unfair, un-American taxes on the books – a tax that has threatened second- and third-generation businesses for far too long.

I understand that no tax reform plan will be perfect in everyone’s eyes. Nonetheless, I’m optimistic about the impact this package could have on American families.

With lower rates, a simpler tax code, family-focused policies, and meaningful reforms, I’m hopeful we can finally relieve the pinch that the young woman I met in the grocery store felt. I believe in her. I believe that if we keep more money in her pocket, she can build a strong future for herself – and for the next generation.",Rep.

By James Freeman, The Wall Street Journal



“US Sen. Rand Paul is not a perfect neighbor, says developer of gated community.” That’s the headline this afternoon on a story in Kentucky’s Louisville Courier Journal. It’s a follow-up to last week’s news of a physical assault on Mr. Paul by his neighbor Rene Boucher.

The developer of the gated community where the two men live is named Jim Skaggs. After seeing his comments in the Courier Journal, some readers might almost be tempted into thinking Mr. Paul had it coming. According to the Courier Journal:

While there’s no official word on what caused the fight, Skaggs suggested it might have stemmed from Paul allegedly blowing lawn trimmings into his neighbor’s yard.

There have been disagreements in the past, Skaggs said, over lawn clippings or who should cut down a tree branch when it stretched over a property line. The two men live on different streets but their lots join and their homes are 269 feet apart, according to Google Maps.

Skaggs described Boucher as a “near-perfect” neighbor, but he said the libertarian politician is a different story.

Paul “was probably the hardest person to encourage to follow the (home owner’s association regulations) of anyone out here because he has a strong belief in property rights,” said Skaggs, who is the former chairman of the Warren County Republican Party.



It’s rather kind to Mr. Boucher to describe their interaction as a “fight.” There seems to be no dispute that without any warning, while Mr. Paul was wearing ear plugs and had his back turned, Mr. Boucher ran up from behind and tackled the senator with such force that he caused “five rib fractures including 3 displaced fractures,” according to Doug Stafford, an aide to Mr. Paul. The senator also suffered bruised lungs and facial injuries, notes the local Bowling Green Daily News.",Why Couldn't He Stand Rand?,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/08/why-couldnt-he-stand-rand

“I promised myself after that day that I would not stop until I brought justice,” Bajoo said at the forum.

In a U.N. forum sponsored by the Holy See Mission last Thursday titled, “Peace, Reconciliation and Justice for the religious and ethnic minorities victimized by Daesh [ISIS],” two survivors retold the horrors they suffered at the hands of ISIS militants who devastated communities in Syria and in Iraq’s Nineveh Plain.

Ekhlas Khudur Bajoo, a now 17-year-old Yazidi survivor from Iraq, was kidnapped by ISIS when the terror group raided her village in August 2014. The girl, who watched ISIS murder her father, was raped repeatedly and faced humiliation every day during her six-month captivity. She was also sold as a sex slave. She attempted to escape three times and experienced horrific beatings after each time she failed. Finally, on her fourth try, she succeeded.

“I promised myself after that day that I would not stop until I brought justice,” Bajoo said at the forum. “I am fighting for all women, not just Yazidi women -- but for all women of all religions and all groups who are victims of ISIS.”

Bajoo is just one of many who have called on the international community to acknowledge that ISIS persecuted and committed genocide against Christians and Yazidis.

“We want justice and accountability for those perpetrators who raped me and my sisters and took our honor,” she added. “Come and hold my hand. I plead with you to stand with us. We want to feel humanity wipe our tears, to heal our wounds, to bring back the smiles on our faces, and to bring back the girls that are still in captivity.”

One man, who only gave his name as “Gabi” and wore a disguise during a video message because his family’s safety is still threatened in Syria, recalled his one month in ISIS captivity.

He was on a bus from Aleppo when he and two other Christian men were kidnapped, stripped, robbed and interrogated before being held captive where they were psychologically and physically tortured.

“They started beating and kicking me and afterward they scourged me for an hour,” he said during his video, which was recorded in Europe, where he has found refuge.

Four days into his captivity, he was taken to a nearby village where he was to be beheaded in front of a cheering crowd.

“[They were] rejoicing at the killing of an infidel Christian,” he said during the testimony. “I knelt and waited for over 10 minutes to be executed.”

At the last minute, the leader of the ISIS unit allowed him to live if he paid jizya, a tax that ISIS imposed on non-believers. ISIS often used jizya as a form of extortion.

Weeks later, Gabi, who was blindfolded, hands tied and an explosive belt tied around his waist, was finally freed after the ransom was received.

The two testimonials underscore what supporters say is the urgent need for the global community to assist in rebuilding, repopulating and stabilizing the region.

“While we tragically did not stop their sufferings, we can act to bring justice for them and other victims, help them to rehabilitate and rebuild, and do everything we can to prevent similar barbarity from happening to others,” Archbishop Bernardito Auza, permanent observer of the Holy See to the U.N., said in his opening remarks. “While we tragically did not stop their sufferings, we can act to bring justice for them and other victims, help them to rehabilitate and rebuild, and do everything we can to prevent similar barbarity from happening to others.”

The Nineveh Plain, also known as the Plain of Mosul, has been the ancestral homeland of Assyrian-Chaldean-Syriac Christians, Yazidis and other minorities -- all of whom were under attack from ISIS once the terror group started to control the region in 2014.

The Christian population in Iraq has plummeted to 275,000 from 1.5 million in 2003, according to current estimates. It is feared the population could be permanently gone within five years, if no action is taken, according to a November 2015 report from Aid to the Church in Need, an international Catholic charity.

It has been estimated that a dozen Christian families fled Iraq each day during the ISIS occupation of the northern half of the country. Christians who have managed to escape ISIS have fled to Europe and Lebanon. Others simply wandered the region avoiding U.N.-operated refugee camps for fear that Muslim refugees in the camps would target them.

Many of those who have been displaced want to return to their homeland and see the Nineveh Plain as the cradle of their faith. Now, approximately 100,000 are starting to return to villages throughout the region.

“Their history is millennia, but their presence in the region is even older,” Edward Clancy, director of outreach for The Aid to the Church in Need, which also presented at the forum, told Fox News.

Clancy also says that the key to stabilizing the region is an estimated $250 million, with $125 million to rebuild the villages and cities left decimated by ISIS and the other half going toward creating institutional structures like schools and hospitals and rebuilding infrastructure.","ISIS victims in Iraq, Christians and Yazidi, desperately need global aid, Vatican says",https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/08/isis-victims-in-iraq-christians-and-yazidi-desperately-need-global-aid-vatican-says.html

But the homeless problem has now spread throughout Silicon Valley, where the disparity between the rich and everyone else is glaring.
'”The plight of the Hernandez family points out one of the confounding problems of the homeless surge along the West Coast.
“This is not a crisis of unemployment that’s leading to poverty around here,” said Tom Myers, executive director of Community Services Agency, a nonprofit based in Mountain View.
I have to decide whether to be homeless or penniless, right?”This story originally appeared in the Associated Press.","MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — In the same affluent, suburban city where Google built its headquarters, Tes Saldana lives in a crowded but tidy camper that she parks on the street.

She concedes it’s “not a very nice living situation,” but it also is not unusual. Until authorities told them to move, more than a dozen other RVs filled with people who can’t afford rent joined Saldana on a tree-lined street in Mountain View, parked between a Target and a luxury apartment complex.

Homeless advocates and city officials say it’s outrageous that in the shadow of a booming tech economy — where young millionaires dine on $15 wood-grilled avocado and think nothing of paying $1,000 for an iPhone X — thousands of families can’t afford a home. Many of the homeless work regular jobs, in some cases serving the very people whose sky-high net worth is the reason housing has become unaffordable for so many.

Across the street from Saldana’s camper, for example, two-bedroom units in the apartment complex start at $3,840, including concierge service. That’s more than she brings home, even in a good month.

Saldana and her three adult sons, who live with her, have looked for less rustic accommodations, but rents are $3,000 a month or more, and most of the available housing is distant. She said it makes more sense to stay in the camper near their jobs and try to save for a brighter future, even if a recent city crackdown chased them from their parking spot.

“We still need to eat,” said Saldana, 51. “I still want to bring my kids, once in a while, to a movie, to eat out.”

She cooks and serves food at two hotels in nearby Palo Alto, jobs that keep her going most days from 5 in the morning until 10 at night. Two of her sons, all in their 20s, work at a bakery and pay $700 toward the RV each month. They’re all very much aware of the economic disparity in Silicon Valley.

“How about for us people who are serving these tech people?” Saldana said. “We don’t get the same paycheck that they do.”

It’s all part of a growing crisis along the West Coast, where many cities and counties have seen a surge in the number of people living on the streets over the past two years. Counts taken earlier this year show 168,000 homeless people in California, Oregon and Washington — 20,000 more than were counted just two years ago.

The booming economy, fueled by the tech sector, and decades of under-building have led to a historic shortage of affordable housing. It has upended the stereotypical view of people out on the streets as unemployed: They are retail clerks, plumbers, janitors — even teachers — who go to work, sleep where they can and buy gym memberships for a place to shower.

The surge in homelessness has prompted at least 10 local governments along the West Coast to declare states of emergency, and cities from San Diego to Seattle are struggling to come up with immediate and long-range solutions.

San Francisco is well-known for homeless tent encampments. But the homeless problem has now spread throughout Silicon Valley, where the disparity between the rich and everyone else is glaring.

There is no firm estimate on the number of people who live in vehicles in Silicon Valley, but the problem is pervasive and apparent to anyone who sees RVs lining thoroughfares; not as visible are the cars tucked away at night in parking lots. Advocates for the homeless say it will only get worse unless more affordable housing is built.

The median rent in the San Jose metro area is $3,500 a month, yet the median wage is $12 an hour in food service and $19 an hour in health care support, an amount that won’t even cover housing costs. The minimum annual salary needed to live comfortably in San Jose is $87,000, according to a study by personal finance website GoBankingRates.

So dilapidated RVs line the eastern edge of Stanford University in Palo Alto, and officials in neighboring Mountain View have mapped out more than a dozen areas where campers tend to cluster, some of them about a mile from Google headquarters.

On a recent evening, Benito Hernandez returned to a crammed RV in Mountain View after laying flagstones for a home in Atherton, where Zillow pegs the median value of a house at $6.5 million. He rents the RV for $1,000 a month and lives there with his pregnant wife and children.

The family was evicted two years ago from an apartment where the rent kept going up, nearing $3,000 a month.

“After that, I lost everything,” said Hernandez, 33, who works as a landscaper and roofer.

He says his wife “is a little bit sad because she says, ‘You’re working very hard but don’t have credit to get an apartment.’ I tell her, ‘Just wait, maybe a half-year more, and I’ll get my credit back.'”

The plight of the Hernandez family points out one of the confounding problems of the homeless surge along the West Coast.

“This is not a crisis of unemployment that’s leading to poverty around here,” said Tom Myers, executive director of Community Services Agency, a nonprofit based in Mountain View. “People are working.”

Mountain View, a city of 80,000 which also is home to Mozilla and 23andMe, has committed more than $1 million over two years for homeless services, including money for an outreach case manager and a police officer to help people who live in vehicles. At last count, there were people living in more than 330 vehicles throughout the city.

Mayor Ken Rosenberg is proud of the city’s response to the crisis — focusing not on penalties but on providing services. Yet he’s also worried that the peace won’t last as RVs crowd into bike lanes and over-taxed streets.

Last week, Mountain View officials posted signs banning vehicles more than 6 feet high on some parts of the street where Saldana, Hernandez and others living in RVs were parked, saying they were creating a traffic hazard. The average RV is well over that height.

That follows similar moves over the summer by Palo Alto, which started cracking down on RVs and other vehicles that exceed the 72-hour limit on a busy stretch of El Camino Real.

In San Jose, officials recently approved an ordinance pushed by an interfaith group called the Winter Faith Collaborative to allow places of assembly — including gyms and churches — to shelter homeless people year-round.

Ellen Tara James-Penney, a 54-year-old lecturer at San Jose State University, parks her old Volvo at one of those safe-haven churches, Grace Baptist Church, and eats in its dining hall. She is paid $28,000 a year to teach four English classes and is carrying $143,000 in student debt after earning two degrees.

She grades papers and prepares lessons in the Volvo. At night, she leans back the driver’s seat and prepares for sleep, one of two dogs, Hank, by her side. Her husband, Jim, who is too tall for the car, sleeps outside in a tent cot with their other dog, Buddy.

The Bay Area native remembers the time a class was studying John Steinbeck, when another student said that she was sick of hearing about the homeless.

“And I said, ‘Watch your mouth. You’re looking at one.’ Then you could have heard a pin drop,” she said. “It’s quite easy to judge when you have a house to live in or you have meds when you’re depressed and health care.”

In response to growing wealth inequities, unions, civil rights groups and community organizations formed Silicon Valley Rising about three years ago. They demand better pay and benefits for the low-income earners who make the region run.

SEIU United Service Workers West, for example, organized roughly 3,000 security guards who work for companies that contract with Facebook, Google and Caltrain, the mass transit system that connects Silicon Valley with San Francisco.

One of those workers is Albert Brown III, a 46-year-old security officer who recently signed a lease for half of a $3,400 two-bedroom unit in Half Moon Bay, about 13 miles from his job.

He can barely afford the rent on his $16-an-hour salary, even with overtime, but the car that doubled as his home needed a pricey repair and he found a landlord willing to overlook his lousy credit. Still, Brown worries he won’t be able to keep up with his payments.

His feet have been hurting. What if a doctor tells him to rest for a few days or a week?

“I can’t miss a minute. If I miss a minute or a shift? No way, man. A week? Forget it, it’s over. It’s all downhill from there,” he said.

“It’s a sad choice. I have to decide whether to be homeless or penniless, right?”

A little girl who was born with a life-threatening heart condition saw a big wish come true recently, when she was able to “marry” her best friend in a special playground ceremony. Sophia Elyssa Chiappalone, of Connecticut, has already undergone two open-heart surgeries and several other procedures, and had made the special request ahead of a third surgery, which is scheduled for January at Boston Children’s Medical Center, Yahoo reported.

On Oct. 23, Sophia and her best friend, Hunter, who she met in preschool, joined together on a playground and exchanged “vows” while photographer Marisa Balletti-Lavoie of Sassy Mouth Photo captured the precious images. The idea came from the pint-sized bride herself, and was happily agreed to by Hunter and his mom.

Sophia was diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, which is a genetic heart defect involving four different issues, shortly after her birth. Sophia’s mother, Kristy Somerset-Chiappalone, started the “Sophia Elyssa Chiappalone the beautiful baby with a broken heart” Facebook page and explained that her daughter’s case is considered severe and will require several open-heart procedures before it is completely repaired. The condition is also likely to shorten her lifespan, and she will need a heart and lung transplant in the future.

FAMILY SEES HOPE IN GENE THERAPY FOR SON DIAGNOSED WITH FATAL NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE

“She’s a walking miracle,” Somerset-Chiappalone told NBC Connecticut. “There is no life expectancy at this time because there’s no reason for her to be alive.”

Balletti-Lavoie told Yahoo she was asked to do the shoot by Hunter’s mom, Tracy Laferriere, who is a close friend. Shortly after she shared photos of the pair on her Facebook page, their story went viral.

“I cannot help but be overwhelmed by the love and support we’ve gotten with Sophia and her recent wish,” Somerset-Chiappalone posted on her personal Facebook page, on Oct. 25. “It was pure innocence in the purest form. My heart aches with joy with the people standing behind Supergirl on this fight. She’s fought to be alive since her first breath, but that’s all she knows. I love the idea of sharing the beautiful story that is her and Hunter. Most people wait a lifetime for someone who wouldn’t stand by them through such illness. She met a best friend and love of her life at 3 who does. You know they say marry your best friend, it just doesn’t usually happen before 1st grade!!! I agree, the world should know this story.”

The automaker has announced it is forming a $750 million joint venture with Chinese automaker Anhui Zotye to build battery-powered cars for sale in China. The country is currently the world's largest market for electric cars.

Sales of pure-electric and gasoline-electric hybrids in China rose 50 percent last year over 2015 to 336,000 vehicles, or 40 percent of global demand. U.S. sales totaled 159,620.

Beijing has supported sales with subsidies and a planned quota system that would require automakers to produce electric cars or buy credits from companies that do.

Ford said it expects China's market for all-electrics and hybrids to grow to annual sales of 6 million by 2025. The company said previously that it plans to offer electric versions of 70 percent of its models sold in China by 2025.

Daimler AG's Mercedes Benz makes electric cars with a Chinese partner. Other global automakers including General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG have announced or are exploring similar ventures.

It's not just any tatty old hat stuffed in the back of the wardrobe, though, but a hi-tech new product.

Ford has revealed its Alert Cap that monitors the driver and gives them a jolt if they're drifting off.

It's fitted with sensors and a gyroscope to track head movement and recognise when a motorist is looking at the road and if they're tired.

If the hat thinks the driver is nodding off, it will warn them by lighting up, vibrating and letting off a sound.

And while it's only at prototype stage now, the hat will be put into production.

Trucking in Brazil is considered an extremely dangerous job.

Research has found 11 per cent of Brazilian lorry drivers - who drive more than 60,000 miles per year on average - have been in an accident over the past two years.

Lyle Watters, president of Ford America, South, said: ""Ford is the first automaker to think of a 'wearable' technology to use while the driver is behind the wheel and can contribute to accident prevention.

""In this way, we reinforce our commitment to bring technology onboard not only in vehicles, but also in accessories that make life easier for the driver, and focus on safety as a priority in our technology investment.""

The Hermit Kingdom demanded the U.S. “withdraw the hostile policy toward” Kim Jong Un’s dictatorship and said a “decisive choice” needed to be made, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday.

""The U.S. must oust the lunatic old man from power and withdraw the hostile policy towards [North Korea] at once in order to get rid of the abyss of doom."" - KCNA statement

""The U.S. must oust the lunatic old man from power and withdraw the hostile policy towards [North Korea] at once in order to get rid of the abyss of doom,” the statement read. “The U.S. had better make a decisive choice…if it does not want a horrible nuclear disaster and tragic doom.”

Kim’s warning about the impending “abyss of doom” heading toward the U.S. — and every country joining in America's aim to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear program — comes after Trump issued a stark warning to Kim Jong Un during a speech in South Korea during Trump's five-country Asia tour.

""Do not underestimate us. And do not try us,” Trump said, directly addressing North Korea as Trump stood in a room full of South Korean lawmakers. ""The weapons you are acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger.”

He added: ""The world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens with nuclear devastation.”

Trump painted North Korea as a bleak country where citizens bribe government officials in order to leave the country, and poverty and desperation thrive instead of prosperity.

""North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned. It is a hell that no person deserves,"" Trump said.

The message came hours after Trump attempted to make a surprise visit to the Demilitarized Zone, the border separating North and South Korea, with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. But heavy fog prevented Trump’s helicopter from safely landing in the area.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president was disappointed he couldn't make the trip. ""I think he's pretty frustrated,"" she told reporters. ""It was obviously something he wanted to do.""

Trump headed to China on Wednesday for a two-day visit — most likely to be, again, dominated by talks about the growing nuclear crisis in the Korean peninsula. A day before he arrived in Beijing, Chinese officials ordered tour operators to halt trips to North Korean capital Pyongyang, sources told Reuters.

“It was very unexpected, we had no idea this was going to happen until we received the notification [Tuesday],” a Chinese tour operator told Reuters. “This is devastating news for us.”

“I definitely think God was looking out,” she told WSVN.","The quick actions of a group of good Samaritans in South Florida Tuesday helped save a 93-year-old Holocaust survivor whose vehicle became stuck on a train track.

Henry Flescher told WSVN he made a wrong turn, taking the curve too fast “because it’s very dark there"" and his wheels became stuck on a track.

The 93-year-old soon realized a freight train was barreling toward him.

“And then the train is coming, and I couldn’t get out,” Flescher said.

Natalie Grant told WSVN she was sitting in her car nearby and took out her iPhone to start recording as a group of people went to help Flescher.

“It was literally about one or two minutes before he was pulled out of the car that the train came,” Grant said. “It was definitely a miracle that he was pulled out in time, and definitely a miracle for me as well that I didn’t get my car damaged.”

Miami-Dade Fire Rescue transported the 93-year-old to an area hospital, where he was evaluated and released, according to WSVN.

Flescher, who survived internment at multiple concentration camps during World War II and shared his experience in 2016 in a heartbreaking Reddit AMA, thanked those who came to his rescue.

“I’m a survivor so far. I’ve survived a lot of things,” he said. “I’m very active, thank God. I’m doing things, and it pays back.”

Grant said the outcome of the close call was a sign from a higher power.

British pianist James Rhodes tweeted a newspaper clipping from The Mirror Saturday in which the Irish star revealed she was ready to quit acting because both producers and directors reportedly claimed she was “a cold potato without sex appeal"" after she refused to sleep with them.

EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT HARVEY WEINSTEIN

O’Hara, who was nicknamed “The Queen of Technicolor,” appeared in major blockbusters, including 1941’s “How Green Was My Valley,” 1947’s “Miracle on 34th Street,” and 1952’s “The Quiet Man” opposite John Wayne.

“I am so upset with it that I am ready to quit Hollywood,” said the then-25-year-old. “It’s got so bad I hate to come to work in the morning. I’m a helpless victim of a Hollywood whispering campaign. Because I don’t let the producer and director kiss me every morning or let them paw me they have spread word around town that I am not a woman – that I am a cold piece of marble statuary.”

O’Hara added, “I guess Hollywood won’t consider me as anything except a cold hunk of marble until I divorce my husband, give my baby away and get my name and photograph in all the newspapers. If that’s Hollywood’s idea of being a woman I’m ready to quit now.”

That wouldn’t be the last time O’Hara spoke out about the price of fame. Back in 2004, O’Hara told The Telegraph she never regretted standing up to the men who ran Hollywood’s most notable studios.

“I wouldn’t throw myself on the casting couch, and I know that cost me parts,” she explained. “I wasn’t going to play the whore. That wasn’t me.”

O’Hara still had a lasting career as a leading lady. By the 1960s, she was ready for retirement. In 1968, she married Gen. Charles F. Blair and the couple lived in St. Croix.

“I was happier with Charlie than I’d ever been in Hollywood,” she recalled. “We had a great life.”

NEW YORK CITY MARATHON FEATURES MASSIVE SECURITY EFFORT AFTER DEADLY TRUCK ATTACK

Flanagan finished second in New York in her first marathon in 2010 but hadn't run this race since. After a fracture in her lower back kept her out of the Boston Marathon, Flanagan trained hard for New York with an eye on Keitany.

Flanagan called Keitany ""the alpha racer"" and said she was ready to ""suffer dearly"" while keeping up with the unpredictable runner.

On the podium, Flanagan put her hands over face and began to cry again when she was announced the winner. She turned to hug Keitany before accepting her medal.

""This is the moment I've dreamed off since I was a little girl,"" Flanagan said.

Flanagan had said she may retire if she won New York. She didn't immediately make an announcement regarding her future.

For the men's competition, Geoffrey Kamworor of Kenya held off countryman Wilson Kipsang by three seconds for his first major victory at the marathon.

Kamworor ran the race in 2 hours, 10 minutes, 53 seconds. He and Kipsang embraced just past the finish line to huge cheers.

The race on Sunday took place just days after a truck attack in Lower Manhattan killed eight people, and took place under the watchful eye of an extremely heavy police presence.

In Brooklyn, where runners made their way down a long stretch, roads were blocked and officers lined the street. As the runners went by, they were accompanied by an escort of police vehicles.

Those cheering the runners on say the increased security presence was noted, but didn't dim the experience.

Karen Hester has been coming to watch the race for 10 years and told the Associated PRess she was ""not in the slightest"" bit concerned about being in a crowded space or the threat of a terror attack.

Contrary to popular belief, it's not just those who sit up front that get top-notch service.

One flight attendant has revealed that backseat passengers are likely to receive VIP treatment — purely due to their location on the aircraft.

5 EXPERT TIPS FOR GETTING THROUGH THE AIRPORT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

Air stewardess Annie Kingston says that passengers sitting at the front of the plane can disembark first, and have a better chance of securing their preferred meal option. But if you're seated at the back, you can expect the most attentive service.

Why? It's similar to giving one child a lollipop in full view of his or her playmates. Give one person a treat, and everyone wants one.

The passengers at the back of the plane are seen by less fellow travellers, so if they get slipped an extra drink or a set of earplugs, it's more likely to go unnoticed.

""We like to avoid responding to call bells from the front of the plane because answering one means potentially flaunting whatever item the passenger has requested to everyone else along the way,"" Kingston said in a blog post for Oyster.com.

LUGGAGE GO MISSING AT THE AIRPORT? HERE'S WHAT TO DO

""This can cause a problem since planes often don't have enough extra vodka, pillows, earplugs, and toothbrushes, or the time on shorter flights to deviate from the service schedule.

""For passengers sitting near the back of the plane, however, it's much easier to slip in that second mini bottle of wine.""

Flight attendant and author of FlyerTalk Amanda Pleva agreed in an interview with Sun Online Travel. ""Do passengers get better service at the back of the plane? Absolutely! Usually we end up having more of a rapport with the people seated in the last row or two because we have finished our service and things have slowed down.

As long as there has been politics, there has been corruption. So the investigative hand-grenades which have been flying for the past year, first at the Trump campaign, now at Mrs. Clinton’s, are not exactly new in American political life. What is new, however, is the geography.

Corruption used to be something American politicians did with other Americans. Now, it’s become something that involves other countries, and one in particular – Russia – which can’t be accused of friendly intentions toward the United States.

Curiously, at the beginning of the nation, Americans were confident that political corruption would never happen in their republic. Corruption was what occurred in monarchies, and (to judge by the long list of accusations in the Declaration of Independence) especially under King George III.

But once independent, American politicians proved to be just as short on virtue. Thomas Jefferson, the first Secretary of State under the first president, George Washington, put a journalistic hit-man, Philip Freneau, on the State Department payroll to dig up dirt on Washington and other cabinet members.","First Trump, Now Clinton -- Investigative Hand-Grenades Keep Flying",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/08/first-trump-now-clinton-investigative-hand-grenades-keep-flying

The waiters and kitchen staff, meanwhile, will reportedly keep their clothes on for hygienic reasons.

The mass shooting unfolded around 11:30 a.m. at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, which is about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio.
Sunday's massacre is the deadliest church shooting in modern U.S. history.
Attorney General Paxton told Fox News that ""people never think"" a shooting like this can ""happen in their communities.""
Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.","At least 26 people were killed and 20 wounded in Texas after a gunman dressed in tactical gear opened fire at a church outside San Antonio on Sunday, investigators confirmed.

Multiple sources speaking to Fox News identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley. The mass shooting unfolded around 11:30 a.m. at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, which is about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio.

Investigators said at a news conference Sunday evening that the victims ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. One official said about 20 people were hospitalized with injuries ranging from minor to ""very severe.""

Sunday's massacre is the deadliest church shooting in modern U.S. history. It is also, according to Gov. Greg Abbott, the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history.

A possible motive was unclear. Kelley lived in a suburb of San Antonio and didn't appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. The official said investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley may have made in the days before Sunday's attack, including one that appeared to show a semiautomatic weapon.

A spokesperson with the U.S. Air Force confirmed to Fox News that Kelley served in the military branch at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until a bad conduct discharge in 2014.

He was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and child, and when he was discharged received 12 months of confinement and a reduction in military rank.

""It is horrible,"" Wilson County Commissioner Larry Wiley told Fox News of the massacre. ""It appears someone walked in and started shooting.""

Around 11:20 a.m., Kelley arrived at a Valero gas station across from the First Baptist Church dressed in black tactical gear and a ballistic vest. He crossed the street and started firing a Ruger AR rifle at the church, officials said. He entered the building and kept shooting.

He was confronted by an armed nearby resident who chased after him. Kelley was later found dead, roughly five miles away in Guadalupe County, according to Wiley. It's unclear whether Kelley was killed by police or the armed resident, or from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

""We have accepted a multiple number of patients from the shooting,"" Megan Posey, a spokeswoman for Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, 15 miles from the church, told Fox News.

Some victims were transported to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, KSAT reported.

Officials said 23 people were found deceased in First Baptist Church, while two were found dead outside. One person who was transported to a hospital later died.

One of those killed was 14-year-old Annabelle Pomeroy, the church pastor's daughter.

The FBI is investigating the shooting, in addition to multiple other agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The San Antonio Express-News reported police were checking the gunman's home for explosives following the shooting.

The church's layout would've made it difficult for churchgoers to flee a shooter who came through the front door, according to a congregant attending a vigil at the church Sunday night.

The church was described as having only small exits on the side and in the back, according to Hunter Green. He said if a gunman came through the front door, people ""wouldn't have had anywhere to go.""

Neighbors of Kelley's told The Associated Press they heard gunfire coming from his direction in recent days.

""It's really loud,"" 16-year-old Ryan Albers said. ""It was someone using automatic weapon fire.""

Another neighbor, who argued hearing gunfire in the area is not uncommon, said they had heard gunfire coming from across the street, but couldn't be sure if it was from Kelley's property.

Attorney General Paxton told Fox News that ""people never think"" a shooting like this can ""happen in their communities.""

""In a small town ... I can imagine that these people are devastated. And everyone in the community is going to ... have some type of close relationship"" to those either killed or injured at the First Baptist Church. He added it's ""hard to justify why anyone would do this.""

""This is horrific for our tiny little tight-knit town,"" Alena Berlanga, who lives 10 minutes outside of Sutherland Springs told The Associated Press. ""Everybody's going to be affected and everybody knows someone who's affected.""

President Trump, speaking from Tokyo during his trip to Asia, called the shooting an ""act of evil,"" and added: ""Through the tears and through the sadness, we stand strong.""

Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.""

Gov. Abbott said in a statement that ""While the details of this horrific act are still under investigation, Cecilia and I want to send our sincerest thoughts and prayers to all those who have been affected by this evil act.""

""I want to thank law enforcement for their response and ask that all Texans pray for the Sutherland Springs community during this time of mourning and loss,"" the statement read.

Sutherland Springs has a population of about 400 residents.

Sunday's shooting comes just over a month after 58 people were killed and hundreds injured on Oct. 1 after a gunman opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas.

This article originally appeared on Newser: One Snub of Hitler May Have Changed History","A snub appears to have led Adolf Hitler to the Nazi party. A historian is making the case that the most reviled dictator in history first tried to join the German Socialist party but was rejected, the Guardian reports.

If the German Socialists, another far right party, had taken him, Hitler may have settled for a more minor role in the party, which was larger than the Nazis, argues Thomas Weber.

Since Hitler hadn't previously ""shown any leadership qualities and had been happy to follow orders,"" Weber says he may not have ever risen to prominence. ""The Nazi party would have been absorbed by the German Socialist party and thus would have disappeared and history would have taken a different path,"" Weber tells the Guardian.

If that happened, it's unlikely there would have been World War II or the Holocaust, Weber tells the Independent. Weber, of the University of Aberdeen, found an overlooked document from 1919 in a Munich archive showing the German Socialists told Hitler not only that he wasn't welcome as a member, but that he couldn't write for the party paper.

Hitler went on to join the Nazis and became its leader in 1921. The German Socialist party was dissolved the following year. Weber writes in in his upcoming book that the ""erratic doings of a prima donna"" attributed to Hitler belied a ""skillful and conniving political operator"" who ""kept a lifelong vengeance"" against his enemies.

So why did the German Socialists spurn Hitler? Weber tells the Independent that perhaps ""it had something to do with the fact Hitler was opinionated and they did not want to have someone there who was telling them what to do."" (The Dutch Red Cross admits a ""painful"" WWII truth.)

Director Rory Karpf, in a documentary, followed the career of Flair, 68, and revealed the lifestyle of one of the most influential men in the wrestling business.

Flair, who has been married four times, said that his public persona intertwined with his private life, resulting in sleeping with more than 10,000 women during his lifetime and having a strong alcohol addiction, the USA Today reported.

Flair said he used to consume as many as 10 beers and five alcoholic cocktails a day for decades while travelling from show to show. He recalled telling a psychiatrist that he drank “at least 10 beers, and probably five mixed drinks” every day – to which the medical professional replied saying, “That’s not possible.”

“I work every day. I drink a beer in the car, I get to the hotel and I drink vodka,” he told the psychiatrist in 1989.

He recalled his relationship with the doctor, “By the time I got through with that son of a (expletive), he was laying on the couch and I was on the chair talking to him,” Flair told the documentary makers.

The alcohol addiction almost proved to be fatal to the wrestler. In August, Flair was placed in a medically induced coma before going for surgery amid kidney failure prompted by excessive drinking over the years.

Doctors reportedly said he had only a 20 percent chance to survive, the New York Daily News reported. ""I wouldn't even begin to think about drinking,” he told the paper. ""If you ever hear that I'm out drinking again, say, 'Ric, you (dummy), you deserve whatever you get.""

By James Freeman, The Wall Street Journal



“US Sen. Rand Paul is not a perfect neighbor, says developer of gated community.” That’s the headline this afternoon on a story in Kentucky’s Louisville Courier Journal. It’s a follow-up to last week’s news of a physical assault on Mr. Paul by his neighbor Rene Boucher.

The developer of the gated community where the two men live is named Jim Skaggs. After seeing his comments in the Courier Journal, some readers might almost be tempted into thinking Mr. Paul had it coming. According to the Courier Journal:

While there’s no official word on what caused the fight, Skaggs suggested it might have stemmed from Paul allegedly blowing lawn trimmings into his neighbor’s yard.

There have been disagreements in the past, Skaggs said, over lawn clippings or who should cut down a tree branch when it stretched over a property line. The two men live on different streets but their lots join and their homes are 269 feet apart, according to Google Maps.

Skaggs described Boucher as a “near-perfect” neighbor, but he said the libertarian politician is a different story.

Paul “was probably the hardest person to encourage to follow the (home owner’s association regulations) of anyone out here because he has a strong belief in property rights,” said Skaggs, who is the former chairman of the Warren County Republican Party.



It’s rather kind to Mr. Boucher to describe their interaction as a “fight.” There seems to be no dispute that without any warning, while Mr. Paul was wearing ear plugs and had his back turned, Mr. Boucher ran up from behind and tackled the senator with such force that he caused “five rib fractures including 3 displaced fractures,” according to Doug Stafford, an aide to Mr. Paul.

As long as there has been politics, there has been corruption. So the investigative hand-grenades which have been flying for the past year, first at the Trump campaign, now at Mrs. Clinton’s, are not exactly new in American political life. What is new, however, is the geography.

Corruption used to be something American politicians did with other Americans. Now, it’s become something that involves other countries, and one in particular – Russia – which can’t be accused of friendly intentions toward the United States.

Curiously, at the beginning of the nation, Americans were confident that political corruption would never happen in their republic. Corruption was what occurred in monarchies, and (to judge by the long list of accusations in the Declaration of Independence) especially under King George III.

But once independent, American politicians proved to be just as short on virtue. Thomas Jefferson, the first Secretary of State under the first president, George Washington, put a journalistic hit-man, Philip Freneau, on the State Department payroll to dig up dirt on Washington and other cabinet members.","First Trump, Now Clinton -- Investigative Hand-Grenades Keep Flying",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/08/first-trump-now-clinton-investigative-hand-grenades-keep-flying#commenting

Webster, 43, is a Nashville publicist who was the president and CEO of Webster PR. Fox News was told on Wednesday afternoon Webster will take ""some time away from the business to focus on combating the egregious and untrue allegations made against him.""

The company announced Wednesday it will continue operating under the name Westby PR with former Webster PR Senior Vice President Jeremy Westby as CEO. However, Westby told Fox News on Thursday that Webster is not involved in Westby PR in any capacity.

Webster has worked in the music industry in Nashville for over 20 years. In addition to clients like Dolly Parton, his firm has also helped artists like George Jones and Kenny Rogers with their marketing campaigns.

Who is Austin Rick?

Austin Rick, whose stage name is Austin Cody, is originally from Waldorf, Maryland, but moved to Nashville to persue his music career. Rick claims Webster began sexually harassing and assaulting him in 2008.

After a year of alleged sexual assault and harassment by Webster, Rick moved back to Maryland and stepped away from his career, according to the Tennessean.

After ending his country career, Rick attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He graduated in May with a degree in sociology.

Despite moving away, Rick has said that Webster has allegedly tried to contact him as recently as this year.

Rick created a GoFundMe page on Oct. 31 to help pay for his legal fees as he prepares to take Webster to court over the allegations.

Rick said he suffered months of “terrible, terrible” abuse at the hands of Webster.

“He sexually assaulted me repeatedly, he drugged and sexually violated me, he offered me publicity opportunities and magazine columns in exchange for sexual acts. He paid me to keep my mouth shut,” Rick wrote on his GoFundMe page and on Facebook.

He is crowdfunding $15,000 for his legal fees.

Rick said he was inspired to share his story after the #MeToo social media movement went viral, which began after countless allegations against famed Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein came to light.

What has happened since Rick came forward?

Webster has denied Rick’s claims. Since then, many of Webster’s former employees have stepped forward with harassment allegations against him. One ex-employee, a man who requested anonymity, told Fox News “There [is] sexual harassment running rampant through that place as long as I’ve known.”

Another female employee told Fox News Webster once grabbed her hair and “humped” her in front of fellow staff members. She called the behavior “typical,” and said her former boss would “caress me” on multiple occasions.

Many former employees also detailed stories of unwanted physical contact. And, in addition to Rick, other men have come forward with allegations against Webster.

Webster did not return Fox News' multiple requests for comment on the allegations.

What's happening now?

Police are not pursuing Rick’s charges against Webster because a statute of limitations prevents them from doing so, the Tennessean reported.

However, in addition to Parton, Rock, and Cyrus, many of Webster’s clients have also left the company. Those artists include: Justin Moore, Naomi Judd, Charlie Daniels and more.

JOHNNY DEPP ALLEGEDLY SHOWED UP DRUNK TO MOVIE PREMIERE, REPORTS SAY

“TMG agreed to come to the aid of its long-time client,” the complaint stated. “The idea behind this arrangement, which was designed to save Depp from a public and devastating financial collapse, was that Depp would pay TMG what TMG was required to pay CNB under the loan.”

Adam Waldman, Depp’s attorney, told People the actor would not sell his homes and called the action an “effort to intimidate Depp into dropping his lawsuit.”

In February, Depp sued TMG for $25 million, accusing the company of fraud and attempting to foreclose his main home.

“As a result of years of gross mismanagement and sometimes outright fraud, Mr. Depp lost tens of millions of dollars and has been forced to dispose of significant assets to pay for TMG’s self-dealing and gross misconduct,” the complaint stated.

“In essence, TMG treated Mr. Depp’s income as their own, available to either TMG or third parties to draw upon as desired.”

Depp and the company parted ways in March 2016 after 17 years together.

TMG said it gave Depp the loan to “save him from bankruptcy,” People reported. The actor’s former managers said the five homes in question were used as “collateral for the loan, and since Depp has stopped making payments, they want to sell the houses.”

“At least at the time, Depp and his sister, personal manager, and the president of his production company, (Elisa Christi) Dembrowski, were very grateful to TMG for coming to Depp’s aid and helping him to avoid a public financial collapse,” the complaint stated.

Depp’s former managers also accused the Academy Award-nominated actor of mismanaging the $650 million he made in the last two decades.

After the actor sued TMG in February, the company filed a cross-complaint against the movie star stating Depp “lived an ultra-extravagant lifestyle that often knowingly cost [him] in excess of $2 million per month to maintain, which he simply could not afford.”

When you’re getting dressed in the morning, you look for a shirt in your closet – not your refrigerator. When you want to go out to dinner, you look for a restaurant – not a dentist’s office. And when you’re a cop looking for radical Islamic terrorists … well, let’s just say you don’t look in a convent, a monastery or a rabbinical seminary.

Is this politically correct? Absolutely not. Is it simple common sense? Of course it is.

There’s no question that the vast majority of Muslims in America are peaceful, law-abiding and hardworking men and women. They serve in our armed forces and police departments, teach in our schools, treat us in hospitals, and work in countless other jobs that benefit our nation. We welcome and appreciate them.

But there’s also no question that a small subset of Muslims in this country don’t fit the above description, because they support the aims of radical Islamic terrorists. And an even smaller, very tiny subset actually engages in terrorism. Finding these people after they commit terrorist acts is challenging.

The beautiful island of Cuba, once a hotspot for American tourists in the 1940's and 1950's, is now an oppressed nation of 11 million people governed by a ruthless communist dictator. In this gripping episode of ""War Stories with Oliver North,"" you'll see how Fidel Castro brought a country together with promises and hope, and then tore it apart in one swift grab for power.

You'll witness how Castro committed this ultimate betrayal through a campaign of murder, mayhem and lies to his fellow countrymen. Learn how as a Catholic schoolboy, who once wrote letters to President Roosevelt, Castro rose to command an army of idealistic revolutionaries to overthrow Fulgencio Batista. You'll bear witness to Castro's 1959 victorious entrance into the city of Havana from the man who rode alongside him. In a rare firsthand account, Oliver North interviews Huber Matos, one of Castro's most trusted commanders. Matos was betrayed, tortured and jailed by Castro for 20 years.

You will meet the brave men who fought for the freedom of Cuba only to be abandoned at the last minute by President John F. Kennedy in the debacle known as the Bay of Pigs. You'll go inside the ensuing Cuban Missile crisis and see how a nuclear holocaust was narrowly avoided between America and the Soviet Union. From the pilot himself, you will hear him retrace the mission of a U-2 spy plane that provided the proof the world needed that ballistic missiles were aimed at the United States.

Cohen, 27, wrote in a lengthy Facebook post Monday that the British actor raped her three years ago. The “Ladies Like Us” star said she decided to come forward with her allegations following a number of actresses speaking out about the sexual misconduct they say they experienced while working in Hollywood.

Cohen claims she fell asleep at a get-together with the ""J Edgar"" actor and awoke when, she alleges, Westwick climbed on top of her.

“I was paralyzed, terrified. I couldn’t speak, I could no longer move. He held me down and raped me,” Cohen wrote.

By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. - The Wall Street Journal



With the latest leak of international financial records comes evidence of one unambiguous crime that won’t be investigated—the theft of the papers themselves from Appleby, a global law firm based in Bermuda.

Rather, the trope the press strains to enact is that the clients whose documents were stolen are themselves guilty of shady doings. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who ran a private-equity firm, owns a stake in a shipping firm that has a Russian customer. Yuri Milner, a Russian fund manager who controls stakes in Facebook and Twitter, has his own investors, among which is a state-owned Russian bank.

The so-called Paradise Papers are the latest electronic document dump received by the so-called International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The previous dump, known as the Panama Papers, in unminced words was described by Vladimir Putin’s personal spokesman as a direct attack on Mr. Putin.

This is not to rule out a sincere whistleblower or the proverbial 400-pound teenager, but when so much hacking for commercial or political purpose these days is attributed to national actors, the question does leap to mind: Which nation’s intelligence agency might be responsible for the leak? And what is the motive?

Now a group of experts has concluded the Dutch artist was plagued by short psychotic episodes during his last 18 months of life, the BBC reports.

But while those episodes may have been caused by medical conditions such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or syphilis, all of which were scrutinized by the researchers, the panel is leaning more toward everyday stresses as pushing him over the edge, per the Telegraph.

""Before December 23, 1888, it is not really possible to say he had a disease or an illness,"" says Arko Oderwald, the moderator of the Amsterdam scientific gathering.

And per a University of Amsterdam art history professor who spoke with the New York Times, it was a ""fierce"" debate among the three dozen or so international mental health professionals, medical doctors, and art historians who tried to figure out van Gogh's deal.

The Kokomo Herald reports the attacks in van Gogh's final years included ""terrifying hallucinations,"" vertigo, unconsciousness, and amnesia. The group examined materials the Van Gogh Museum had gathered, including personal letters, medical records, and other data.

Says Oderwald, the psychosis ""could [have] come from alcohol intoxication, lack of sleep, work stress and troubles with [roommate Paul] Gauguin, who was going to leave."" (A 1930 sketch may reveal the truth of van Gogh's mutilated ear.)

""Numbers are phenomenal over the last year — since November 8th, Election Day,” Trump told business leaders in Tokyo on Monday. “Our unemployment is at a 17-year low. We've gotten almost 2 million more people in the workforce in just that short period of time. I've reduced regulations terrifically, frankly, if I do say so myself.”

Observers, however, caution that the drop in unemployment is due in part to many Americans giving up searching for work — one of the criticisms Trump made of President Obama's record during the 2016 campaign. Many of the economic figures Trump cites are advancing a recovery from the Great Recession that dates back to the middle of 2009.

As for the stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average returned to its previous peak in March 2013 and has been setting records ever since. The promise of corporate tax cuts by Trump has helped the stock market, but many of the gains rest on the foundations of an economic recovery in which corporate profits climbed.

By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. - The Wall Street Journal



With the latest leak of international financial records comes evidence of one unambiguous crime that won’t be investigated—the theft of the papers themselves from Appleby, a global law firm based in Bermuda.

Rather, the trope the press strains to enact is that the clients whose documents were stolen are themselves guilty of shady doings. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who ran a private-equity firm, owns a stake in a shipping firm that has a Russian customer. Yuri Milner, a Russian fund manager who controls stakes in Facebook and Twitter, has his own investors, among which is a state-owned Russian bank.

The so-called Paradise Papers are the latest electronic document dump received by the so-called International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The previous dump, known as the Panama Papers, in unminced words was described by Vladimir Putin’s personal spokesman as a direct attack on Mr. Putin.

This is not to rule out a sincere whistleblower or the proverbial 400-pound teenager, but when so much hacking for commercial or political purpose these days is attributed to national actors, the question does leap to mind: Which nation’s intelligence agency might be responsible for the leak? And what is the motive?

Michael Arega, of Texas, was arrested Monday afternoon on the north side of Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House for saying he wanted to kill “all white police.”

In U.S. District Court on Tuesday, Arega, who works as an inspector and an Uber driver, told the judge he wanted his wife to represent him in court and attempted to refuse the representation of a public defender.

When the judge told Arega his wife, who is not an attorney, could not represent him, Arega said: “She is a child of God, and so am I.”

The judge agreed to have Arega held in custody until a detention hearing because he threatened violence against President Trump and police near the White House. He also agreed to have Arega undergo a mental evaluation.

The Secret Service received an alert around 3 p.m. Monday afternoon from the Metropolitan Police Department to be on the lookout for a man who wanted to kill “all white police” at the White House.

Arega allegedly traveled from Texas and was staying at a hotel in Maryland in an attempt to pull through with his threat in the nation's capital.

Arega's wife told Secret Service agents that Arega is bipolar, and that the couple is in the process of divorcing. She added that Arega is not welcome in their church in Texas after he made threatening Facebook posts toward other church members.

Arega didn't have any weapons on him during his arrest, and none were found in his hotel room -- but police said they're searching other locations ""where the defendant may have potentially placed weapons.""

A detention hearing for Arega has been scheduled for Nov. 20.

And yet my goal, aside from supporting the work mothers at home do, is no different from Komisar’s: “We don’t want the 50s to come back.
The only reason women don’t do this today is because we place so little value on motherhood.
We don’t understand the significance of what goes on the early years and how indispensable mothers are to their babies.","This past weekend the Wall Street Journal published what I consider to be the most important op-ed of the 21st century. Due to its sensitive nature, Americans rarely hear about this subject. But they should.

The article, by James Taranto, is entitled “The Politicization of Motherhood,” and it centers on an interview with psychoanalyst Erica Komisar, whose new book “Being There: Why Prioritizing Motherhood in the First Three Years Matters,” makes the oh-so-obvious yet controversial argument that babies need their mothers.

As Komisar says in a video about her book, “Mothers are critically important to children in the first three years of life. [It] impacts their emotional well-being.”

For daring to write such a book, Komisar has received the inevitable backlash. After all, it’s taboo enough to suggest parents should stay home. It’s even more taboo to suggest that parent be Mom. Why? Because popular orthodoxy insists the sexes are interchangeable. That’s what the gender equality crowd believes, and it’s what they want everyone else to believe.

If you don’t agree with it (and you shouldn’t, because it isn’t true), you’ll be treated as a pariah. “I couldn’t get on NPR,” Komisar told Taranto. And, she adds, she was “rejected wholesale—particularly in New York—by the liberal press.”

Addressing the effects of maternal absence is difficult enough on its own, but it’s impossible when, as Taranto points out, liberals—who, as we all know, dominate mainstream media—“won’t even acknowledge the problem.”

Komisar did manage to get a spot on “Good Morning America;” but prior to the interview, host Lara Spencer made it clear to Komisar that she didn’t like her book and didn’t “believe in its premise.”

Well, of course she didn’t. Morning television is dominated by female producers and journalists, many of whom are married with kids. And as Bernard Goldberg wrote in “Bias,” “…those gals got a dog in this fight.” He adds, “America’s newsrooms are filled with women who drop their kids off someplace before they go to work or leave them at home with a nanny. These journalists are not just defending working mothers—they’re defending themselves!”

How rich I’d be if I had a dollar for every time I’ve run into this media bias. My first book, which was published 15 years ago (and was coincidentally re-released this year), is similar to Komisar’s in that I make a case for why a mother’s physical and emotional presence are vital to children, to families and to society as a whole. And I too was vilified in the media.

And yet my goal, aside from supporting the work mothers at home do, is no different from Komisar’s: “We don’t want the 50s to come back. What we do want is to be a child-centric society.”

Not the kind of child-centric society we have now, where children are coddled by well-meaning but overprotective parents.

The kind that puts the needs of children above the needs of adults.

Unfortunately, Komisar and I part ways on how to create such a society. As a political liberal, Komisar believes the answer is other people’s money. “All mothers and babies should have the right to be together in the first year,” she says. To do that, America needs maternity leave at full pay “and then flexibility to be together as much as possible for the next two years—meaning mothers should have the ability to work flexibly and part time.”

It is true that flexibility and part-time work become indispensable once children are older and in school all day, but it’s pointless in the first three years. The needs and demands of a baby, let alone a baby and a toddler, are simply too great to be able devote one’s attention to something else without everything falling apart.

Still, there is much Komisar gets right. Her case is particularly compelling because her work has been developed from “three decades’ experience treating families,” writes Taranto. And her conclusions are right on the mark—though admittedly, for some, are hard to hear.

“What I was seeing,” notes Komisar, “was an increase in children being diagnosed with ADHD and an increase in aggression in children, especially in boys, and an increase in depression in little girls.” She saw that the absence of mothers in children’s daily lives was “one of the triggers for these mental disorders.”

Addressing the effects of maternal absence is difficult enough on its own, but it’s impossible when, as Taranto points out, liberals—who, as we all know, dominate mainstream media—“won’t even acknowledge the problem.”

They won’t acknowledge it because they refuse to allow themselves, or anyone else, to feel guilty about the choices they’ve made—as if experiencing this emotion is tantamount to being tortured.

But it isn’t the end of the world to feel guilt. “My best patient is a patient who comes to me feeling guilty,” says Komisar. “Women who feel guilty—it’s a ‘signal’ feeling, that something’s wrong, that they’re in conflict. If they go talk to a therapist or deal with the conflict head-on, they often make different choices and better choices.”

And one of those choices, to prioritize baby care well in advance of its arrival, is a smart one. The only reason women don’t do this today is because we place so little value on motherhood. We don’t understand the significance of what goes on the early years and how indispensable mothers are to their babies. We don’t understand it because we refuse to look.

But the information is there for all who choose to see.",It's time we acknowledge how indispensable mothers are to their babies,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/31/its-time-acknowledge-how-indispensable-mothers-are-to-their-babies.html

The olive green jacket, which is posed with designer distressed jeans and Doc Marten boots – a symbol of punk fashion – features a bold “Revolution” printed across the front, along with a sloppy anarchy symbol and other ""edgy"" phrases and quips.

Angelyn Fernandez, VP of Product at Alpha Industries, said in an e-mailed statement to the Daily Dot, “We have seen resistance to power and authority become a trend in our current pop culture and society, often expressed through fashion,” she said.

However, that attempt to capitalize on the pop culture “trend” of resistance to power is what has many outraged on Twitter. Some have questioned if the jacket is fake because of its bizarrely high-price tag (members of the antifa movement are usually against capitalism) and over-the-top look.

The commercialized jacket tries very hard to look authentically anarchist, while also costing nearly $400 and being mass-produced, but is not winning any fans.

Alpha Industries, which “started as a contractor for the U.S. Military,” said in a statement to Fox News, “Since 1965, the M65 field jackets have been a favored method to graphically express one’s opinion.”

People on Twitter aren't buying the ""self-expression"" angle. One user is even claiming this is an attempt to silence anti-facism members by making them “trendy.” While another is calling for a complete boycott of Barneys, who is selling the jacket.

Other Twitter users argue, however, that the coat will be purchased by ""ANTIFA cowards"" and ""privileged Millennials.""

""If you don't do this you're going to mistrust them, you're going to look for problems when maybe there aren't any, the other big problem you run into is that if this relationship doesn't work out and you want to move on and you haven't forgiven them you're going to put the next person you date on the cross.""

Step two is to own your role in the dysfunction of the relationship. The third step is to have the betrayer write you an apology letter:

""So in other words if someone says i'm so sorry for cheating on you, i'm so sorry i stole money from you that's not enough. I went them to write down the specific things they did who they did them with and why. See, that means they're sincere about coming back in and earning back your trust.""

Fourth, Essel says if they stole something they must pay you back. If they don't do step three or four- let them go.

A bride-to-be was left in tears after a skin condition triggered by the stress of her big day caused her skin to change color.

Stunning Kandice Benford, 32, developed vitiligo and was horrified to see white patches spread over her body as the big day approached.

She thinks the condition - where patches of skin lose their pigment - was triggered by the anxiety of juggling the wedding preparations.

At first she desperately tried to cover the spots makeup but eventually she plucked up the courage to go barefaced thanks to support from her partner Elliott Benford.

Benford, a hairstylist, wore minimal makeup when she tied the knot to Elliott, 30, on Nov. 5 last year, and she says she had a ""perfect day.""

Now as the couple celebrate their first anniversary, Benford is more confident than ever and hopes to inspire other women with vitiligo to embrace their bodies.

""I was really down about it at first,"" Benford, of Terry, Mississippi, said. ""You see yourself every day for 30 years and then one morning you wake up and you look different.""

""The white spots spread over my face, hands and legs and I found it very difficult,"" she said. ""I tried to cover it up with makeup. It was even more difficult with people around me who didn't know what it was and would ask questions or stare.""

""Kids would say, 'Mommy, was is that all over her face?' or people would ask, 'Is it a burn?'"" she said. ""I was freaking out but everybody has been very supportive. My husband said, 'You're beautiful with or without it.'""

""I gave myself a pep talk and moved on. I had to embrace it. My body is my body,"" she said. ""I ended up feeling great on my wedding day. I can honestly say having vitiligo has made me more confident in myself.""

Benford first noticed white spots on her hands when she was at college in her late teens.

""I had a spot here and there and I had heard about vitiligo so I knew what it was but I didn't really care about it at the time,"" she said.

It was only when she hit 30 in 2015 - less than a year before she was due to tie the knot to Elliott - that the disease spread rapidly.

Benford's husband-to-be was also sick at the time and she was juggling work and wedding planning while worrying about his health.

Vitiligo is widely believed to be an autoimmune disorder and though it's not known what it's caused by, stress and emotional trauma can exacerbate the symptoms.

""I think stress triggered it, because when I got stressed I started seeing a more prominent spot on my nose and it started spreading more.,"" she said. ""It was like it happened overnight.""

Over the course of a year the white spots spread and now they cover her entire body.

The disease, which affects around one per cent of the global population, is incurable.

But Benford said she wouldn't want to be without it anyway and said vitiligo makes her unique.

""Vitiligo has honestly made me a stronger person,"" Benford said. ""At first the stares made me feel very very uncomfortable but now I look at those people and wave. To anyone else going through this, you need to love yourself. Be patient with yourself. You are stronger than you think.""",Bride says stress triggered skin condition ahead of wedding day,https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/11/07/bride-says-stress-triggered-skin-condition-ahead-wedding-day.html

Ed Gillespie, the Republican politico, failed to “embrace” the president, Trump tweeted Tuesday evening while in Asia. Until the results came in, Trump often took to Twitter to encourage Virginians to vote for Gillespie and accused Northam of ""fighting for the violent MS-13"" gang.

However, while Gillespie entwined much of Trump’s policies, he didn’t utilize the president while campaigning. Trump lost the swing state to opponent Hillary Clinton by about 5 points during the 2016 election.

Northam received 54 percent of the vote to Gillespie’s 45 percent, with 99 percent of precincts reporting. The lieutenant governor led Gillespie by about 5 percentage points in a Fox News poll ahead of the election.

Here’s a look at the candidates.

Ralph Northam, Democrat

Ralph Northam, the lieutenant governor of Virginia, is a physician and Army veteran. On his campaign website, he said he is “most proud” of “his career fighting for children – as a pediatric neurologist and volunteer medical director for a pediatric hospice care facility.”

While current Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is barred by state law from running for re-election, Northam, 58, is expected to govern the commonwealth much as McAuliffe did. He ran on greater gun control and abortion rights. He also promised to “be a brick wall against the discrimination of the Trump administration.”

Northam lives in Norfolk, Va., with his wife. They have two children.

Ed Gillespie, Republican

This wasn’t Ed Gillespie’s first rodeo when it came to Virginia politics. The 56-year-old ran against incumbent Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., in 2014 and nearly defeated him.

Gillespie is a former chair of the National Republican Committee and served as a counselor to former President George W. Bush for nearly two years. Gillespie touted his leadership within conservative circles on his campaign website, highlighting his time as chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia and work as a communications aide to former House Majority Leader Dick Armey.

Gillespie and his wife have three children and live in Fairfax County, Va. He graduated from Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.

Endorsements and ads

While Trump endorsed Gillespie in a tweet in October, the establishment gubernatorial candidate didn't totally embrace the president on the campaign trail. And he almost lost to an ardent Trump defender in the primary race.

But as the race came to a close, Gillespie reinvented himself and adopted more of Trump’s racially-tinged policies.

Still, Trump offered his support and encouraged his more than 40 million Twitter followers to “Vote Ed Gillespie!”

Trump also accused Northam of “fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs [and] sanctuary cities.”

Northam responded on Twitter with a link to his campaign donations website. He called the president a “narcissistic maniac” multiple times during the primary.

""Ralph Northam will allow crime to be rampant in Virginia. He’s weak on crime, weak on our GREAT VETS, Anti-Second Amendment and has been horrible on Virginia economy,"" Trump tweeted on the morning of the election.

Advertisements from both sides had been criticized ahead of Election Day.

Northam’s campaign came under fire for a Democratic mailer that showed Gillespie and Trump along with a photo of the angry white nationalists carrying torches who descended on Charlottesville, Va., in August. The mailer encourages voters to “stand up to hate.”

Northam stood by the mailer and slammed Gillespie for not denouncing Trump “for not calling these white supremacists out for who they are.”

“Because the message is that we live in a very diverse society. That means that we need to be inclusive,” Northam said, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

Another highly criticized ad – this one from the nonprofit Latino Victory Fund – showed frightened minority children being chased by a truck with a “Gillespie for governor” sticker, a Gadsden flag vanity license plate and Confederate flag.

“Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the American Dream?” a narrator asks in the one-minute spot.

Chris Leavitt, Gillespie’s campaign manager, slammed the advertisement as “an all-out attack on the people of Virginia” and blamed “Northam and his allies” for what he called a “desperate smear campaign.”

Northam’s supporters “have reached a new low with a disgusting, vile television ad seeking to instill fear in our children with that same imagery,” Leavitt said in a statement to Fox News.

Northam's campaign has defended the ad. Campaign spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel said in a statement that, ""It's not shocking that communities of color are scared of what his Trump-like policy positions mean for them.""

The ad was deleted after the New York City terrorist attack in October.

Gillespie, too, was criticized for ads in support of his campaign. He released several spots that attempted to tie Northam to the MS-13 gang.

One ad in particular showed a sinister hooded figure holding a baseball bat as the word’s “Kill, Rape, Control” – MS-13’s motto – flash on the screen. The ad accuses Northam of being “weak” on combating the gang.

The Northam campaign called Gillespie’s ads “beyond the pale.”

Bush hosted a fundraiser for Gillespie in Virginia in October. And Vice President Mike Pence joined him at a weekend rally.

Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton headlined a fundraiser for Northam in New York. And former Vice President Joe Biden backed Northam during a roundtable event.

Former President Barack Obama and Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J., also campaigned for Northam.

Trump would double the personal exemption (fewer people will itemize) and kill the ""death tax,"" deductions for local taxes and the alternative minimum tax.
Canada has no mortgage deduction, yet Canada's homeownership rate is higher than the United States'.
The big mortgage deduction is welfare for the rich.
Ideally, tax cuts should be accompanied by even larger spending cuts to avoid expanding that $20 trillion debt.","As you read this, President Trump's tax plan is being debated. Congress will change it. Where this ends, no one knows.

I want two things:

1. Simplification.

2. More money in private hands.

Trump offers some of both.

His cuts would leave more money in private hands, where it will be used more efficiently. Politicians' spending decisions already put us $20 trillion in debt; they shouldn't be trusted with more money.

Cutting the corporate tax rate isn't popular (rich people!), but a cut is needed. Economic growth is really important. It's stifled when America's taxes are higher than other nations'.

Trump also offers some simplification. Good. The more complex the rules, the more time we waste hiring accountants and the more time lawyers spend fighting over who qualifies for what. Trump would double the personal exemption (fewer people will itemize) and kill the ""death tax,"" deductions for local taxes and the alternative minimum tax.

It's a start. But that's not nearly good enough. Heck, the ""simplification"" bill itself is 400 pages long.

Americans spend about 7 billion hours trying to comply with today's tax rules. That's the equivalent of 3.7 million people working 40-hour weeks. What a waste.

I spend hours filling out forms and forwarding paperwork to an accountant. I distort my spending and investments because of tax rules. What a waste.

America's first 1040 form was four pages long. Today's code is more than 3.7 million words. No one understands it.

Even the tax specialists get things wrong.

Yet parts of Trump's plan make taxes more complex: He increases the child tax credit and creates a new credit for nonchild dependents. It may be fair to help people who care for helpless adults, but each new deduction creates complexity and parasites who feed off it. As usual, some rich people will game that credit, and some poor people will never figure it out.

Far better to lower everyone's taxes to, say, 15 percent, by getting rid of all deductions.

Then we could focus on creating wealth instead of filling out forms.

But good luck with that, President Trump.

Today's tax deductions are the main reason we've got a huge culture of lobbyists.

One of the most unfair tax breaks is the mortgage interest deduction. It encourages rich people to buy more homes than we need. It exacerbates housing bubbles.

Trump merely proposed cutting the maximum deduction to half-a-million dollars. But even that has the swamp creatures screaming, ""Unfair!""

Jerry Howard of the National Association of Home Builders says he will fight that ""tooth and nail."" He claims it ""is a direct assault on the American dream of homeownership.""

Bunk. Canada has no mortgage deduction, yet Canada's homeownership rate is higher than the United States'. The big mortgage deduction is welfare for the rich.

But people like Howard have clout. Homebuilders and mortgage bankers give politicians money.

Likewise, even some Republicans in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey now are whining about losing state tax deductibility. They fear voter backlash in their districts.

Once again, Congress ends up fighting over who gets the biggest cuts instead of the overall tax haul and size of government.

Ideally, tax cuts should be accompanied by even larger spending cuts to avoid expanding that $20 trillion debt. But that's not happening.

How about a variation on Trump's two-for-one regulation rule (cut two regulations for each new one you propose)? Cut two dollars from the budget for every dollar in tax reduction. That way we won't end up deeper in the hole.

The best way to avoid Washington's spending getting out of balance is to avoid giving them our money in the first place.

I'm rooting for a tax law so simple that everyone understands it, and one that will keep as much money as possible out of government's hands.

That's the best formula for a growing economy.",John Stossel: Simpler tax simplification,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/08/john-stossel-simpler-tax-simplification.html

The move, beginning in 2015, allowed Apple to continue to avoid paying billions of dollars in taxes.

Apple, the most valuable and most profitable company in the world, had been paying a corporate income tax of 5 percent or less thanks to a loophole in US and Ireland tax law, according to reports.

That is much less than the 12.5 percent Irish corporate tax rate and the 35 percent top US corporate tax rate.

The loophole, known as the “double Irish,” is perfectly legal.

The overseas operations of the Cupertino, Calif., company were based in Ireland and all of its non-US sales were funneled through that office.

But beginning in 2013, the European Union began an investigation of Apple’s “double Irish.”

So Apple quietly searched for a new tax-friendly home for its international HQ.

That search led to the Jersey island offices of the Appleby law firm, a business whose main goal was to help wealthy individuals and companies legally avoid taxes.

Apple, in several emails, asked the law firm about moving its Ireland headquarters to the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Mauritius, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey, according to the leaked documents, known as the Paradise papers.

In the emails, Apple made it clear it wanted to keep the move secret, according to the BBC, which reported on the leaked emails.

“For those of you who are not aware, Apple [officials] are extremely sensitive concerning publicity,” one email read.

“They also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know.”

The Channel Island of Jersey, a UK dependency, sets its own tax laws. The corporate rate for foreign companies is zero percent, the BBC reported.

In 2017, Apple earned $44.7 billion outside the US and paid just $1.65 billion in taxes, the BBC reported

Apple, in a statement on Monday, said it pays every tax dollar it owes.

“Apple believes every company has a responsibility to pay its taxes, and as the largest taxpayer in the world, Apple pays every dollar it owes in every country around the world,” the statement reads.

“We’re proud of the economic contributions we make to the countries and communities where we do business.”

A German newspaper was leaked more than 13 million documents from the law firm. They were reviewed and released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

Apple has more than $250 billion in profits on the island of Jersey.

Corinna Slusser, 19, was reported missing on Sept. 20, the same day she was last seen leaving Haven Motel in Rego Park, Queens in the early morning, police said Monday. Police are investigating Slusser as a possible victim of sex trafficking, NYPD sources told Fox News on Wednesday.

Little is known about the Bloomsburg native, but Slusser reportedly filed a complaint against a 32-year-old man, possibly her pimp, about a month before she was last seen. She alleged the man grabbed her neck and pushed her against the wall when she demanded he hand over $300 that was allegedly stolen from her. NYPD sources indicated to Fox News the identification of Corrina Slusser as the assault victim was correct.

Slusser’s Facebook page showed she was studying marketing at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Relatives initially reported her missing on Sept. 12 when she didn’t show up at her grandfather’s funeral in Florida, the New York Daily News reported. Her last post on her Instagram page was Sept. 10 — a photo of herself with the location tag listed in the Bronx.

Relatives told the New York Daily News that Slusser moved to New York City after meeting her alleged pimp in March. She called the man “her daddy” and still kept in touch with her family until early September, when she was last seen and heard from.

“She's so sweet and so naive. She didn't know what she was getting herself into,” a relative told the newspaper. “She just needs to know that everybody wants her home. I can’t imagine what she's gone through or what she’s going through. I just want her to have an out.”

Slusser’s social media followers have posted on her pages, telling her to “stay safe” as police try to locate her whereabouts.

“stay safe! you have a lot of people that love you Corinna! i don’t know who you are but i am praying for you!” a woman commented on Instagram.

Another wrote: “Corina please be safe .xoxo I love you.”

Slusser was described as being about 5 feet 6 inches tall, 140 pounds with blond hair and blue eyes. She has a distinct tattoo on her chest — a large black flower.","Missing Pennsylvania teen feared to be sex-trafficking victim, police say",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/08/missing-pennsylvania-teen-feared-to-be-sex-trafficking-victim-police-say.html

In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.

Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.",4 clever decluttering solutions for wires and cables,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/4-clever-decluttering-solutions-for-wires-and-cables.html

Dylan Howard was a sports reporter for the Australian TV network but was dumped in 2008 over the AFL medical records scandal.

He’s now the chief content officer of American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer, Radar Online and US Weekly.

In a recent piece by The New Yorker, it’s claimed that Howard was one of a number of journalists and spies who tried to help Harvey Weinstein disprove Rose McGowan’s allegations of sexual misconduct against the movie mogul by feeding him information uncovered by one of his reporters.

Howard reportedly emailed Weinstein about an off the record interview one of his reporters conducted with a woman called Elizabeth Avellan, whose husband left her to start dating McGowan.

In the email, Howard wrote: “I have something AMAZING ... eventually she laid into Rose pretty hard.”

According to The New Yorker, Weinstein replied, “This is the killer. Especially if my fingerprints r not on this.”

In a statement, Howard told The New Yorker: “I had an obligation to protect AMI’s interests by seeking out — but not publishing — truthful information about people who Mr. Weinstein insisted were making false claims against him. To the extent I provided ‘off the record’ information to Mr. Weinstein about one of his accusers — at a time when Mr. Weinstein was denying any harassment of any woman — it was information which I would never have allowed AMI to publish on the internet or in its magazines.”

Harvey Weinstein hired journalists and highly trained ex-spies and military personnel who used fake identities to try to stop accusers from going public with sexual misconduct claims against him.

Howard also claimed that he never let his relationship with Weinstein affect his editorial decisions.

“I always separated those two roles carefully and completely — and resisted Mr. Weinstein’s repeated efforts to have AMI titles publish favorable stories about him or negative articles about his accusers,” Howard said in the statement.

Since the bombshell allegations against Weinstein were first published five weeks ago in The New York Times, more than 100 women have come forward and claimed they were sexually abused by the disgraced mogul.

WARNING: VIDEO CONTAINS STRONG LANGUAGE

The Taco Bell employee explains to the woman that she is not in Burger King — she is in Taco Bell, which does not offer hamburgers or french fries. The employee then tries to take the woman’s order, who once again, asks for french fries.

Once the woman seemingly understands that the fast food chain doesn’t sell french fries, she attempts to have the employee read the menu. The employee does not.

As the woman continues to stand at the counter, she becomes increasingly distraught that the employee is intentionally not being nice to her, and proclaims, “This is racism at it’s f---ing finest,” before nearly dissolving into tears.

Another customer steps in and tells her it’s not racism — it's just that Taco Bell sells “tacos and burritos.”

After an exchange with other people in the restaurant, where she claims to work “with people who are challenged every day,” the customer again refers to Burger King — where she apparently still thinks she is.

Another employee tried to help out by “starting over” and walking the woman through the menu, but the woman felt that she had been treated poorly by both the drive-thru employee and the counter employee, and decides to leave, ultimately stating “I don’t like what happened here.”

Now she's got her own team guiding her through those same hoops.

Trump surprised many in his administration when he announced his decision to nominate Nielsen to run the sprawling agency, which has been leading the charge on implementing Trump's aggressive immigration agenda. Nielsen had served as former DHS Secretary John Kelly's top deputy early in the Trump administration, and she moved with him to the White House when he was elevated to Trump's chief of staff.

She is scheduled to appear before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday for her confirmation hearing.

It's been a lightning-fast rise for the 45-year-old, who arrived in Trumpworld only after Trump won the election and joined his transition team, on the recommendation of several former co-workers, to helped guide Kelly through the confirmation process. Nielsen quickly earned the retired general's trust, impressing him with her work ethic and command of the issues and standing out in a team filled with political appointees.

Nielsen's supporters describe her as a straight shooter, with a relentless work ethic and high standards.

""Among an incredibly overburdened and hardworking staff, Kirstjen stood out in the sense that she was indefatigable. She would work long hours, she would never complain, she would stay until it got done,"" said Frances Townsend, Nielsen's boss in President George W. Bush's administration, where she served as special assistant to the president and senior director for prevention, preparedness and response on the White House Homeland Security Council.

""It was extraordinary,"" Townsend said.

Townsend said Nielsen was always the first to arrive in the morning and the last person to leave at night, and expected those around her to work as hard as she did.

Townsend recalled how men would leave their suit jackets on the backs of their chair in the evening so it would appear they'd gone to the restroom instead of home. One woman, she said, would stash her purse in the women's restroom so that she could sneak out on the sly.

""She didn't want to have her purse on her shoulder,"" said Townsend of the Nielsen underling. ""As her boss, I absolutely loved her.""

It was one of several such stories. Two transition officials recalled how, during the lead-up to Kelly's confirmation hearings, Nielsen became ill from working too hard and wound up coughing and displacing a rib while suffering from a bronchial cold. Instead of taking time off, however, she was back to work the next day.

""No job is too small — or, should I say, no job is too big,"" said Blain Rethmeier, who first worked with Nielsen in the Bush White House and is now working on her ""sherpa"" team.

But those same qualities have also chafed some colleagues, both at DHS and the White House, who have been put off by her brusque, no-nonsense style.

As she worked with Kelly to impose order in a chaotic and dysfunctional White House that lacked clear lines of command, people inside and outside the White House complained she was controlling access to Kelly, alienating staffers and failing to return phone calls. A constant presence in Kelly's orbit, Nielsen quickly established herself as the West Wing ""enforcer.""

Similar concerns extended to the DHS, where current and former staffers recall her canceling other people's meetings with Kelly if she couldn't attend.

For some at DHS, it was a shock that a person so polarizing and with minimal management experience had been nominated to run a department of 240,000 people that oversees the Federal Emergency Management Agency, immigration policy and the Transportation Security Administration, among other major divisions. When acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke announced the news to senior department leadership in a hastily arranged conference call, she was met with what one person on the line described as dead silence.

The person, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of angering Nielsen and compromising their job.

Her supporters, however, have pushed back at that characterization, dismissing it as jealousy and, perhaps, sexism.

""The people who complain, are, in my opinion, people who don't work as hard,"" Townsend said. Nielsen declined an interview request.

Nielsen has experience on the Hill and created and managed the Offices of Legislative Policy and Government Affairs at the TSA. After serving in the Bush administration, she worked as general counsel and a president at the Civitas Group consulting firm, before founding her own private consulting firm, Sunesis Consulting, where she advised senior domestic and foreign government officials and senior private sector officials on cyber and preparedness issues. (She is also an avid surfer who played Division I soccer in college.)

If confirmed by the Senate, Nielsen will be the first DHS secretary to have previously worked for the department, excluding ""acting"" secretaries.

She'll also be the first with a cybersecurity background. Frank Cilluffo, a former director of the President's Homeland Security Advisory Council in the Bush administration, said that when it comes to the department, ""she knows it inside and out.""

Nielsen, he said, would be able to ""parachute in"" and speak to various analysts and teams in ""the same language that they speak and understand the issues""

She's an ""incredibly thoughtful"" analyst, he said. ""I actually think she's a wonk at heart.""

American veterans may hear these words on Saturday, as tributes for former service members roll in in honor of Veterans Day.

Unsure what Veterans Day is? Read on for a look at the holiday and the history behind the occasion.

What is Veterans Day?

“While those who died are also remembered, Veterans Day is the day set aside to thank and honor ALL those who served honorably in the military - in wartime or peacetime,” the Department of Veterans Affairs says.

It explains the holiday “is largely intended to thank LIVING veterans for their service, to acknowledge that their contributions to our national security are appreciated, and to underscore the fact that all those who served - not only those who died - have sacrificed and done their duty.”

Memorial Day, the VA says, is meant to honor those who have died while serving.

What is the history behind the holiday?

The roots of Veterans Day go back nearly 100 years.

Fighting during WWI stopped on Nov. 11, 1918 due to an armistice between the Germans and the Allies, the VA notes. Nov. 11 was commemorated as Armistice Day by President Woodrow Wilson in 1919, it adds.

A resolution passed by Congress in 1926, according to the federal agency, called for Nov. 11 to be remembered every year “with thanksgiving and prayer and exercises designed to perpetuate peace through good will and mutual understanding between nations.”

In 1938, Armistice Day was officially made a legal public holiday, the VA says.

Many American soldiers lost their lives during WWII and the Korean War. In the wake of these wars, Armistice Day was renamed Veterans Day in 1954.

VETERAN ASKS PEOPLE TO TAKE A KNEE AT VETERANS' GRAVES

In 1968, a bill was passed which called for Veterans Day to be observed on the fourth Monday in October starting in 1971. The change was part of a move to give federal workers several three-day holiday weekends, the Navy History and Heritage Command blog The Sextant says online.

But in 1971, two states observed Veterans Day on Nov. 11 instead, The Sextant says, adding that over time, other states did the same.

President Gerald Ford signed a bill in 1975 which pushed Veterans Day back to Nov. 11, with the changes taking place in 1978.

Ford said in a statement that he felt “restoration of the observance of Veterans Day to November 11 will help preserve in the hearts and lives of all Americans the spirit of patriotism, the love of country, and the willingness to serve and sacrifice for the common good symbolized by this very special day.”

What else should I know?

Some in the U.S. observe Veterans Day with parades, such as the upcoming one that will take place Saturday in New York City.

There will also be a wreath-laying ceremony on Saturday morning at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Va.

A significant detail was inadvertently included in a Vincent van Gogh painting, but with scholars and art lovers alike it was crickets for 128 years.

A grasshopper, that is.

Researchers looking closely at Vincent van Gogh’s “Olive Trees” painting have discovered part of a grasshopper that has been trapped in the paint for more than a century.

“Van Gogh worked outside in the elements,” Julián Zugazagoitia, director of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, which houses the painting, told the Kansas City Star. She added that “we know that he...dealt with wind and dust, grass and trees, and flies and grasshoppers.”

Van Gogh completed “Olive Trees” in St. Remy, France, and the grasshopper – which is missing its thorax and abdomen – was found after a researcher looked at the painting’s brush strokes under a microscope. The inspection was part of a project to analyze the museum’s 104 French paintings.

“But just go and sit outdoors, painting on the spot itself!” van Gogh wrote in an 1885 letter to his brother, Theo, according to the Kansas City Star. “Then all sorts of things like the following happen — I must have picked up a good hundred flies and more off the 4 canvases that you’ll be getting, not to mention dust and sand.”

The bug was dead when it fell onto the canvas, a paleo-entomologist said, and it will be left in the painting.",Vincent van Gogh painting had grasshopper stuck in it for 128 years,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/08/vincent-van-gogh-painting-had-grasshopper-stuck-in-it-for-128-years.html

Noah admitted he was conflicted. ""On the one hand, I do wake up terrified most days that he's president of the most powerful nation in the world.

The new regulations were designed to avoid questions about the recent mass shooting in Las Vegas and other political topics.

The statement comes following a backlash by artists, including from the co-host for the awards show, Brad Paisley.

""I'm sure the CMA will do the right thing and rescind these ridiculous and unfair press guidelines. In 3...2....1.....,"" Paisley tweeted Friday.

After the decision was reversed Paisley tweeted, ""Bravo CMA awards for doing the right thing & apologizing for this mistake. All are welcome, let's have a great show.""

The CMA's original statement was as follows:

“In light of recent events, and out of respect for the artists directly or indirectly involved, please refrain from focusing your coverage of the CMA Awards Red Carpet and Backstage Media Center on the Las Vegas tragedy, gun rights, political affiliations or topics of the like,” read the guidelines provided to Fox News.

“It’s vital, more so this year than in years past due to the sensitivities at hand, that the CMA Awards be a celebration of Country Music and the artists that make this genre so great. It’s an evening to honor the outstanding achievements in Country Music of the previous year and we want everyone to feel comfortable talking to press about this exciting time.”

A representative for the CMAs noted to Fox News that “all outlets must agree for access” to the event. The 51st Annual CMA Awards are scheduled to take place in Nashville, Tennessee on November 8.

At a media preview Thursday in New York City, with hosts Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley, The Associated Press asked the performers about the Vegas shooting. The stars said they want to honor the victims’ families during the show.

The world of country music has been in unique and unfamiliar territory of late following the tragedy in Las Vegas at a Jason Aldean concert that left nearly 60 people dead. Additionally, one of the genre's most popular publicists, Kirt Webster, is embroiled in a sexual abuse scandal.

But based on an Instagram comment feed I scrolled through just last week, I know I am not alone.
I say this to encourage us to get on our knees in surrender and fight for our kids in prayer.
In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ.
Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.","“The older my kids get, the more I realize how little control I have over them. My slipping sense of control produces so much anxiety in my life so I end up grasping for even more control. I don’t know what else to do but I’m afraid to surrender. Really afraid.”

That was a very real and honest fear shared with me recently by another mom who is watching her eldest child navigate his teen years and is worried sick about his choices and the outcomes.

As I wrote about my own struggle with “controlling my kids” in my book “Mom Set Free,” I often wondered if surrender came easier to other moms. I wondered if I was mostly alone in my struggle to unclench my fists that were trying to control outcomes and parent more open-handed to God’s plans.

But based on an Instagram comment feed I scrolled through just last week, I know I am not alone. In fact, control seems to be something most moms struggle with.

Here are just six out of 132 comments shared by brave women and their struggle to surrender:

“I don’t even know what motherhood looks like without being worried, anxious and a total control freak!”

“My biggest fear is MY anxiety becoming THEIR anxiety.”

“I thought I’d moved past control issues once my kids got to school, but now they’re teens and it’s a real struggle to step back and give them their wings.”

“I’m such a control freak and it’s been a challenge not being able to control a single thing with my 5-week-old. Being on her schedule at all times has been the biggest struggle for me.”

“Mom guilt is real and life is crazy! Extra hard when you're a control freak.”

“I am anxious and worried way too often and want everything to be in perfect order. I need to be set free from those unhealthy mindsets!”

I can’t help but wonder if you can relate to any of these comments, because even if you wouldn’t describe yourself as a “control freak” you still might struggle with surrendering your kids to their sovereign Father.

I think part of our struggle is rooted in a misunderstanding of what surrender actually is.

One way we might think of surrender is this: “I give up. There is nothing I can do or say that is going to make a difference here. I’ve tried everything and nothing helps. My influence in my kid’s lives is useless and exhausted. I’m done trying. I surrender.”

But if we look to Jesus we find an entirely different lens through which to view surrender.

In the Gospel of Mark, chapter 14, we find that Jesus is “overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death” (v. 34 NIV). Jesus knew that the fulfillment of his mission was imminent. He would soon take on the sin of the world and bear the wrath and shame for the entire human race. Jesus was “deeply distressed and troubled” when he prayed: “Abba Father, everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will” (v. 36 NIV).

This simple but profound prayer shows us what surrender really is. Surrender is acknowledging God’s power, submitting to his will, and trusting in his goodness.

When we find ourselves grasping for control over our kid’s lives, or our own circumstances, we can pray like Jesus prayed to his Father: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

The above prayer, which my pastor Drew Williams shared at church many years ago, has expanded my heart and opened my hands to God’s perfect will in times when I have come to him very fearful and close-fisted.

This can be our prayer of surrender when:

Our hearts are aching and our fears are raging over the choices our kids are making.

We crash into the reality that our kids unique needs will seriously mess with our perfect plans.

We have so much anxiety over our role as moms that we witness our anxiety spilling over into our homes and onto our kids, who then take on our anxiety.

We feel helpless and hopeless.

This is a prayer that we probably need to pray over and over and over again, each and every day: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

Prayer is not only the antidote to finding peace amidst all of the anxiety-inducing pressure, but it is our most powerful weapon against the enemy who, like it or not, is working against us. He “prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:8 NIV).

I don’t say this to scare us. I say this to encourage us to get on our knees in surrender and fight for our kids in prayer.

Our prayers for our children (and with our children) are unimaginably significant. Through prayer, we get to partner with God in the work he is doing in the lives of our kids, all the while remembering that: “It won’t be long before this generous God who has great plans for us in Christ – eternal and glorious plans they are! – will have you put together and on your feet for good. He gets the last word; yes, He does!” (1 Peter 5:11 MSG).

In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ. And not just temporal plans, but eternal plans. And he gets the last word.

We can rest in his sovereignty and surrender to his will, just as we saw Jesus surrendering to his Father’s will in his prayer at Gethsemane. Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.

Surrender isn’t giving up. It’s giving over every one of our fears and worries and problems and weaknesses to God. And in turn, receiving his peace as we partner with him, rather than trying to be him in our kid’s lives.

We have a profound role to play in our kid’s lives, by establishing healthy boundaries and enforcing consistent consequences, wrapped in unconditional love. But as we do that, we have to remember that we are not the originator and orchestrator of our kid’s lives.

Our role is to seek and surrender to “The Great Originator and Orchestrator” and trust him to be – and to do – everything we can’t. He’s good at that, you know. He’s good at being God. So let’s let him. And in doing so, we are enabled to release the anxiety and reclaim the adventure that we’ve lost in the quest to play his role.

And some states contend it violates their laws to forward mental health records to the federal database.
The National Rifle Association and lawful gun owners are not involved in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
Start with enforcing the federal laws on the books before attempting one of those “conversations” about curtailing rights.","In the wake of a Baptist church shooting that left 26 people dead Sunday, Democratic politicians and pundits once again took to social media and cable news to denounce those who they deem to be the true monsters in the entire situation – National Rifle Association members and Christians offering thoughts and prayers.

The NRA was denounced a “terrorist organization” that was “drenched in the blood” of the victims of gun violence.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. – who looks like a pining presidential candidate – was of course out front in a rush to the microphones. He demanded that we all do “something,” without ever actually disclosing what that something might be. Apparently, what he really wants is confiscation of firearms from law-abiding Americans, who are now once again facing media backlash for a crime they had nothing to do with.

But as was revealed Sunday, in what is becoming a common theme in these mass shootings, no amount of background checking would have stopped the shooter in Sutherland Springs, Texas from purchasing his firearms, because the federal government failed to do it’s job properly. It’s not the first time.

If federal employees cannot perform the simplest of tasks of enforcing laws already on the books meant to keep people safe, then those employees need to be released and their agencies eliminated.

While serving in the U.S. Air Force, shooter Devin Patrick Kelley was convicted of domestic assault against his wife. He pleaded guilty to multiple charges stemming from incidents including physically striking his wife and choking and kicking her. He also pleaded guilty to assaulting his stepson, severely enough to crack the young child’s skull.

Kelley’s court-martial conviction should have disqualified him immediately from purchasing any kind of firearms. So what happened? The Associated Press reported:

“Under Pentagon rules, information about convictions of military personnel in crimes like assault is supposed to be submitted to the FBI’s Criminal Justice Investigation Services Division for inclusion in the National Criminal Information Center database. For unspecified reasons, the Air Force did not provide the information about Kelley as required.”

The AP report continued: “Acknowledging its mistake, the Air Force said in a written statement that the top two Air Force officials – Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson and Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein – have ordered a review of the Kelley case by the Air Force Office of the Inspector General.”

Because of a law passed in 1996, it’s illegal for anyone convicted a domestic abuse crime to purchase a firearm, something some of our dutiful lawmakers in Congress seem to not be aware of.

Because Kelley’s court records were never submitted the FBI database, Kelley sailed through several background checks and purchased up to four known firearms. Great work, guys.

This also appears to not just be a bad slip in judgment but a systematic problem. The Trace reported: “… the military has no distinct charge for domestic violence, notes Grover Baxley, a former judge advocate general who now practices military law as a civilian. ‘We see this all the time,’ Baxley said. ‘There is no specific domestic violence article.” Instead, military prosecutors charge abusers with other offenses, like assault. A scan of active records shows that the Department of Defense has just a single misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence on file with the National Criminal Instant Background Check System, or NICS.”

A chart accompanying the report shows a startling statistic. The military has submitted “zero records for members subject to domestic violence restraining orders” to federal authorities. This isn’t one or two bad apples falling through the cracks. This is a tree shaking them all to the ground.

But even when the FBI has all the data needed to flag someone from purchasing a gun, there have been examples of gross incompetence as well.

Dylann Roof shot and killed nine people during evening services at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015.

Roof was not legally permitted to own a firearm due to an unlawful drug possession charge from earlier that year. Roof’s record listed the wrong arresting agency and because of this error, he was able to legally purchase the weapon he used in the shooting. Victims of family members killed by Roof have filed suit against the U.S. government because of this avoidable error.

Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people and then committed suicide at the school in 2007, was under years of mental health observation. In 2005 he was accused of harassing female students and ordered by a court-appointed special justice, who declared him mentally ill, to attend treatment.

The justice declared that Cho “presents an imminent danger to himself as a result of mental illness.” Because Cho was never actually institutionalized, his state records were never sent to the FBI database, and he was able to purchase his weapons. Families of the victims settled with Virginia for $11 million in damages over the lapse.

A 2012 report from Mayors Against Illegal Guns found similar lapses in the background check system. As NPR reported: “The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined why states aren't submitting records in a July report. Some cited bureaucratic barriers, others technical ones, like switching from paper-based to computer systems. And some states contend it violates their laws to forward mental health records to the federal database. A few states are changing their laws.”

It should not matter if these incidences are occurring because of a political correctness stigma around mental health, or just dumb laziness. If federal employees cannot perform the simplest of tasks of enforcing laws already on the books meant to keep people safe, then those employees need to be released and their agencies eliminated.

The National Rifle Association and lawful gun owners are not involved in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. During the shooting in Texas, a former NRA instructor was instrumental in stopping Kelley’s rampage – a rampage that could have been prevented had our government not been asleep at the wheel again. But sure, let’s turn over our health care to the government now.



If our government cannot perform simple tasks like filling our criminal record forms and entering information into databases, then why in the world would we burden federal employees with new gun laws that do nothing but restrict the constitutional rights of citizens and vendors in full compliance with the law?

Start with enforcing the federal laws on the books before attempting one of those “conversations” about curtailing rights. When our government gets that right, then we can have a larger discussion about the Second Amendment.

To allay some fears, Amazon is offering what it calls the ""Amazon Key Happiness Guarantee.""","Amazon wants to help people get into your house when you're not at home. And the retail giant claims its approach will be secure.

Amazon today (Oct. 25) unveiled the new Amazon Key, an exclusive for Amazon Prime subscribers. The service, which requires several hardware components to work, will allow delivery people to securely enter your home and deliver packages. You can also use Amazon Key to authorize certain people to get into your house, all while being monitored with the company's new Amazon Cloud Cam.

But is Amazon Key safe, and does it come with enough features to make it appealing? Here's what you need to know about Amazon's latest service.

What is Amazon Key?

Amazon Key is a new smart access technology developed by Amazon to allow you to invite people into your home without having to be there. Think of it like the technological equivalent of leaving a key under the mat. Only this time, people can only get in your house when you authorize it, and they'll do so with your smart lock technology.

How does Amazon envision Key working?

Amazon sees a few ways for this to work.

For one, Amazon thinks Key could be useful for delivery people, who instead of leaving your goods outside, can now slip them into your house. Amazon also believes it can be useful if you want to provide a handyman or other people who might be working on your house into the place without your supervision.

Do I need to be a Prime subscriber?

Yep. You'll need to have an Amazon Prime subscription.

What hardware is required?

Amazon Key requires a few things in order to work. For one, you're going to need the company's $120 Cloud Cam (Key Edition) indoor security camera. You'll also want to get an Amazon Key-compatible smart lock from companies like Kwikset or Yale. (Amazon has a guide on what's compatible.)

Finally, you'll need the Amazon Key app, which should be able to communicate with your Cloud Cam and the smart lock and give you full control over the door.

Expect the hardware to set you back $250 on top of that $99-a-year Prime membership.

Where is Amazon Key available?

Amazon isn't offering Key just anywhere. Instead, the company says that the service will be available in select areas to start and then roll out to more locations as time goes on. You can go to the Amazon Key In-Home Kit page to see if your area qualifies.

What kind of door do I need?

Amazon Key works with standard deadbolts that are mounted separately from the handle. However, be aware that your door must be between 1-3/8-inch to 2 inches in thickness in order to work with the smart lock.

Where do I place the Cloud Cam?

Amazon says that Key users should place Cloud Cam is direct view of the door at which people will enter. Ideally, the company said that the Cloud Cam should be within 25 feet of the door.

Should I use Amazon Key with a pet?

Amazon is apparently worried your dog might run away. So no — Amazon doesn't recommend you use Key if your pet can access and run through the door.

What happens on delivery day?

When it's time for a package to be delivered, you'll receive a notification in the morning with a 4-hour delivery window. Before your driver gets to your door, you'll receive an ""Arriving Now"" alert that will allow you to see what's happening in real time.

Once the driver is at your door, he or she will knock on your door and then place a request to unlock it with an Amazon-provided handheld scanner. Amazon will then ensure that the package belongs at your house and that the driver is near your door. Amazon will also turn on Cloud Cam and start recording.

If everything checks out, Amazon will unlock the door and give the driver access to your house to drop the package. The driver will alert Amazon to completing the delivery and will request the door be locked.

You will then receive a notification saying the door is locked, and you can watch the video clip to ensure everything went smoothly.

What's the Happiness Guarantee?

To allay some fears, Amazon is offering what it calls the ""Amazon Key Happiness Guarantee."" If for some reason the delivery wasn't completed to your satisfaction, Amazon will ""work with you to correct the problem."" Amazon will, however, need some proof and video from the delivery to verify whatever it is you might be claiming in the complaint.",Amazon Key lets delivery people in your house: Is it safe?,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/11/08/amazon-key-lets-delivery-people-in-your-house-is-it-safe.html

That’s what a 53-year-old woman learned Thursday afternoon when she was stopped by Polk County sheriff deputies while riding down a busy highway in Florida.

Officials said a passerby noticed a woman who appeared confused and possibly in danger along Combee Road near North Crystal Lake Road in Lakeland.

When deputies arrived they found Donna Byrne riding her horse on the road and had an odor of alcohol, red watery eyes and was staggering, Fox 13 Tampa reported.

Officers did a sobriety test and said she gave breath samples that registered blood-alcohol level of .161 — twice Florida's legal limit of .08.

Byrne is charged with DUI and animal neglect for endangering and failing to provide proper protection for the horse.

""Ms. Byrne was obviously not in any condition to be on the road,"" said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. ""She not only put herself and the horse in danger but also anyone who was driving on the road, which is typically very busy.""

Deputies took the horse to the Polk County Sheriff's Animal Control livestock facility. She was booked into the Polk County Jail. Jail records did not list an attorney for her.

According to an official menu obtained by Bloomberg, the “exquisite” condiment was used to make a “special sauce” served with the beef rib, which itself was made from a distinct breed of Korean cattle called Hanwoo.

It’s unclear if Trump — who preferred fast food on the campaign trail — actually ate the beef or the sauce, but he was also treated to a piece of grilled sole, which is reportedly one of his favorite dishes.

Another notable menu item was “shrimp caught in the waters of Dokdo,” an island that’s claimed by both South Korea and Japan. Its inclusion, according to Bloomberg, may have been an intentional to provoke discussion about the strained relationship between the two counties.

However, there’s a more obvious reason why the father of 5-month-old twins has chosen to take a step back from acting.

Nobody was going to make ‘Good Night, and Good Luck,’ ‘Michael Clayton’ or ‘Up in the Air,’ and I fought to get those out there.”

Clooney admitted the current political climate has inspired him to possibly pursue politics. However, the Hollywood star stressed he’s not ready to tackle that role.

“So many people since Trump was elected have really been pushing on me to get more involved in actual politics, specifically at the highest office,” he explained. “I don’t have political aspirations.”

Gardeners know that a landscape is much more than plants. The lushest foliage and flowers have limited appeal without other elements to act as a foil. Rocks and stones play a vital role, setting unpolished grainy textures against delicate plants, playing earthy tones against vivid floral displays, and adding weight, mass and a sense of solidity to a dynamic green scene. Enlist these heavy hitters to take your garden to the next level of loveliness.

Steady as a rock. The presence of rocks in a garden is calming and restful. Surrounded by seasonal changes of plants and weather, rocks stand firm. For some, this steadfastness promotes a meditative environment and a strong connection with nature on a spiritual level.

Creating a rock garden as a place for reflection is possible in even the smallest garden, using existing materials and virtually no water. Sitting in a quiet corner contemplating plants growing in harmony with rocks is a respite from the busy outside world.

Stones for sustainability. Rocks, stones and gravel cut down on areas used for lawns and water-hungry plants, substantially reducing water usage. “With our limited water resources and changing climate, sustainability is an underlying philosophy for most landscape designers,” says Janine Mendel, a landscape designer at Cultivart Landscape Design.

Local heroes. Mendel points out that many washed river stones for sale are from countries like Indonesia, and this contributes to erosion there. Buying exotic stone is really the reverse of sustainability, she says. Going local makes even more sense when you factor in the financial and environmental cost of transporting heavy materials long distances.

Aesthetically, local stones and rocks add a cohesive look, especially if there are already naturally occurring rock elements in your garden.

Supporting players. Rocks and stones enhance feature plants as an attractive edging for garden beds. If existing soil is poor, they form a raised bed that can be filled with a more fertile medium.

When planting around rocks, consider color, shape and size. Dark green backgrounds make light rocks stand out, while pale planting makes an ideal foil for dark rocks. Don’t forget that rocks absorb heat — ideal for warmth-loving plants. Don’t plant shrubs that will grow to hide them.

Smooth stones are a lovely accent for tiny succulents in a small garden. Plant a selection of quirky cactuses in a light potting mix with crushed pumice or gravel mulch for drainage. Decorate with a layer of pretty stones — they’ll help retain moisture, which means that less watering is required.

Rocks au naturel. “The placement of rocks in a contrived landscape should reflect how they’d occur in a natural environment. It’s quite a creative skill,” Mendel says.

Japanese “dry landscapes.” Rocks and stones are fundamental to Asian gardens. The Japanese concept of karesansui, meaning “dry landscape,” has taken off globally as a way to use small spaces, reduce water consumption and provide a calm environment. Raked into ripples, sand or fine gravel represents ocean waves, while rocks symbolize islands. Moss is sometimes included, but no other plants or trees.

Water on the rocks. The alliance of rocks and water is key to Asian garden philosophy. It affirms the yin-yang concept of balancing opposite and complementary natural forces. Water is mercurial, filled with light and motion, while rocks are constant and immovable. Together, they create balance and unity.

Bring tranquillity and harmony to your garden by positioning rocks near water, whether it’s a small pond, a stone vessel or a bubbling water feature.

Water also intensifies subtle colors, sharpens contrast, and makes rocks and stones mirrorlike. Dull, dry rocks reveal their full beauty and character when wet, so submerge them or let droplets splash from a water feature to make them shine.

Sculptural rocks. When it comes to garden sculpture, nature does it best. Wind, water, earthquakes and time shape rocks into astonishing artworks. If you’re lucky enough to have an amazing rock, position it prominently to reveal its most interesting face.

Note: Landscaping outlets sell naturally sculpted rocks. Also keep an eye on construction sites — you may be able to get permission to haul away excavated rocks. Before removing any rock from private or public land like a beach or preserve, check to make sure that it’s allowed.

Bold boulders. A boulder is a large rock worn smooth by water. Transporting massive boulders for landscaping is expensive, but using lightweight ceramic versions is one solution.

Stacking stones. Humans have built piles of rocks and stones for eons; dry stone walls date back to Neolithic times. Rock walls have survived in many areas, including England, Ireland, Scandinavia and South America. The Peruvian Inca city of Machu Picchu is made entirely of dry stone construction.

“Currently in Australia one of the trends is … stone used in walling and paving rather than as a more sculptural element,” Mendel says. Local stones and no adhesive chemicals make dry stone walls an eco-friendly addition to a garden.

Cairns occur all over the world. In some places, they are primitive stone stacks; in others, elaborate hive-like monuments. They often have religious, memorial or ceremonial significance, though many were built as navigation aids for travelers.

Building a cairn is an absorbing way to spend time in nature. Play “rock Lego” and plant feathery grasses, such as the variegated Japanese silver grass (Miscanthus sinensis ‘Variegata’) that wave in the wind as a contrast.

A cairn can be as simple as a tower of rocks in decreasing sizes. Ensure that your rocks have a stable seat, or use a little help from cement. Practice on small ones until you get the idea. When you feel confident, go bigger.

Choose a spot where it shows to best advantage and where surrounding plants enhance it.

A liking for lichen. Moss and lichen add color and texture to rocks, and they bring the impression of age. Their amazing colors often occur naturally and turn a nondescript rock into a special attraction.

I’ve used a “moss milkshake” with some success — and a good dash of patience. Make a thick sludge of buttermilk or yogurt and live moss (many nurseries sell tubs of moss, or you could collect it), and then paint it on rocks and stones in a shady place. Mist with water daily until it’s established. Pitted rocks are a better medium than smooth ones.

Slab seat. Every garden should have a spot for sitting and enjoying the view. Make a pausing place into a fabulous feature with a custom bench.",Garden rocks give landscapes a luxe look,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/03/garden-rocks-give-landscapes-luxe-look.html

In fact, it’s one of the most beautiful aspects of the American spirit. But with every new national tragedy, it seems that unifying spirit is a little weaker than before.

On Sunday morning, tragedy struck our great country once again. A gunman opened fire in a place of worship killing at least 26 people and wounding 20 in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Even more heartbreaking, eight of the 26 victims were members of the same family. Yet somehow, as our country mourns the loss of innocent life, there’s a new wave of indignation directed at people who dare to pray for the victims.

That’s right. As well-intentioned Americans pray for their countrymen who were just gunned down while worshipping God, gun control advocates are bashing them for their expression of faith. Here are just a few examples from my Twitter feed:

Consider this from Keith Olbermann:

Or, this profane statement from Star Trek actor Wil Wheaton:

It’s one thing to hold strong opinions about gun control. But it’s entirely different to direct anger towards people of faith after such a horrific tragedy. Just because you might not believe in prayer, doesn’t give you the right to publicly insult those who do.

In some ways, this outrage against prayer is emblematic of national trends. As America grows increasingly hostile to Christianity, inappropriate and insensitive rhetoric regarding expressions of faith has become more acceptable. It seems the same people who pride themselves on advocating religious and cultural “tolerance” are the least tolerant when it comes to American Christians.

Prayer has been a staple of the American experience since the founding of our nation. It’s why George Washington “fervently beseech[ed] the Almighty” in his farewell address. It’s why Abraham Lincoln constantly invoked the name of God in our nation’s darkest moments. It’s why every session of Congress still opens in prayer.

Prayer is a unifying force, especially in a country entrenched in political polarization. It’s a way of humbly admitting that as mere humans, we do not have all the answers. Prayer is an expression of hope that someday all of the world’s evils will come to an end.

No matter how great gun control advocates think their policies may be, you can’t legislate evil away. Certainly, it’s important that policymakers engage in productive dialogue about methods to help mitigate future violence. But the most perfect legislation (if one ever existed), still leaves our country in need of the Almighty.

As long as there is evil in this world, Americans should continue to exercise their right to pray for a brighter day. This is—no doubt—a troubling time for our nation. But it’s times like these that often bring forth the best that our nation has to offer. Slandering the faithful among us isn’t the path to a unified, peaceful America.

Barth, 37, told The Wrap she decided to come forward with her accusations after another woman contacted her stating she was also drugged and assaulted by Guillod.

Barth said she went to the Los Angeles Police Department with the allegations for a second time, after attempting to press charges in 2012. Barth said she chose not to press charges after Guillod threatened to sue her.

However, Guillod’s attorney, Thomas M. Ferlauto, told The Wrap the case was dropped due to lack of evidence.

“Witnesses were interviewed whose version of events belied and completely contradicted Ms. Barth’s and LAPD determined the charges to be unfounded. No criminal or civil case was ever brought against Mr. Guillod,” Ferlauto said.

The Los Angeles Police Department declined to comment.

Barth said she was not aware of witnesses who may have contradicted her allegations and said her boyfriend at the time and now-husband Danny Cusumano, confirmed her statements.

Last week, Barth wrote in a blog post for The Wrap that she blacked out while having dinner with “Atomic Blonde” producer Guillod.

“The next thing I remember is waking up at home with six hickeys on my neck,” she wrote.

“I was horrified. I was completely and utterly confused and I was sick to my stomach. Through email, he tried to play it off as a silly make-out session between friends. He sent me message after message begging that we talk and letting me know how upset he was and that he couldn’t sleep because of the pit in his stomach,” Barth wrote.

The actress said she dropped Guillod as a manager immediately.

Barth claimed Guillod made sexual advances toward her on previous occasions and only went to the noted dinner because actress Felisha Terrell was going.

Terrell, whose manager is still Guillod, told The Wrap Barth’s recount of the dinner seemed to be inaccurate.

“There were some inaccuracies in the story as I recall it. If I felt these accusations were 100 percent true I would not have remained a client. As a woman in this business, I am both supportive and inspired by women speaking their truth,” Terrell said.

Barth said that after her blog post was published, another woman contacted her and named Guillod as a person who sexually assaulted her.

“She titled the email with his name. I immediately had shivers from head to toe,” Barth told The Wrap. “The woman said that she had a similar experience, which was horrific … She said it was about three years ago.” The woman asked not to be identified.

According to prosecutors, Morrissey moved into McNew’s home outside Trenton, N.J. in 2015.
For nearly two years, he bought her presents, paid her bills and even covered any court fees from previous legal woes.

The relationship between Jennifer Lynn Morrissey, a 33-year-old motorcycle mechanic with a checkered criminal past who has been charged with murder, and Michael McNew, a 64-year-old father and grandfather, was unconventional, but one that seemed to work for them – until it didn’t.

According to prosecutors, Morrissey moved into McNew’s home outside Trenton, N.J. in 2015. For nearly two years, he bought her presents, paid her bills and even covered any court fees from previous legal woes.

She referred to him as her “sugar daddy,” NBC 10 reported.

WOUNDED VIRGINIA OFFICER 'AWAKE AND TALKING' AFTER SHOOTING

But eventually the relationship soured. When McNew tried to end it, Morrissey killed him, prosecutors said.

In August 2017, McNew was found dead at his home with a bullet in his head. Morrissey was charged with criminal homicide.

Police said Morrisey staged the death to look like a burglary gone awry and even buried McNew's cellphone and laptop computer in her current boyfriend’s backyard. She also messaged McNew on Facebook after he died to make it look like she didn’t know what happened.

To allegedly remove any gun residue from her hands, her boyfriend urinated on her hands, prosecutors said.

Morrissey maintains the shooting death was accidental – a result of what her lawyer called a “kill or be killed” moment, NBC 10 reported.

""She came to her home to retrieve some belongings and struggled over a firearm and Mr. McNew unfortunately was shot and killed,"" Morrissey's lawyer, Phillip Steinberg, said at a two-hour preliminary hearing on Monday.

Her texting records, however, show a different story, officials said.

According to the Bucks County District Attorney’s Office, Morrissey sent threatening messages to McNews on Aug. 6 when he told her he was boxing up belonging she’d left at his house and that she was not welcome back in his home.

“Get the gun ready cause I’m coming. I already told you that I’ll be there tonight … guess your [sic] just gonna have to shoot me,” one of the texts read, the DA office said. “I’m gonna stab ya.”

McNew’s body was found Aug. 8 in his Washington Crossing home. An autopsy determined that he died from a single gunshot wound to the head.

“I don’t believe she’s a victim,” the prosecutor said in court on Monday.

“Nature Boy” a “30 for 30” documentary aired Tuesday on ESPN. It featured nearly 50 wrestling personalities, family members and friends discussing Ric Flair, whose real name is Richard Fliehr.

The documentary tackled the star’s notorious inability to stay monogamous. He’s had four wives and confessed in the documentary to being with an estimated 10,000 women, saying that monogamy made him ""miserable.""

“Let me tell you something, if you’re wrestling and you’re in Hutchinson, Kansas, and you’re gonna spend the night there, I’m gonna find something to do. I’m not going through that night by myself,” he says in the special.

In addition to women, Flair admits that alcohol played a big role in the demise of his personal life. Specifically, he recalls a time he met with a sports psychologist in the 1980s, at the height of his drinking.

“(He asked) ‘How much do you drink a day?’ I said, ‘I’ll drink at least 10 beers, and probably five mixed drinks.’ He said, ‘Well, how many days a week do you do that?’ I said, ‘Every day.’ He said, ‘Well, how do you mean every day?’ I said, ‘I work every day. I drink a beer in the car, I get to the hotel and I drink vodka.’ He came out of his chair and (he said), ‘You drink every day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, and you’ve been doing that for how long?’ I said, ‘Well, let me see. It’s 1989, I started in ’72, you do the math. Almost 20 years.’ He said, ‘That’s not possible.’ I said, ‘Oh yeah, it is.’ By the time I got through with that son of a b---h, he was laying on the couch and I was on the chair talking to him.”

“Nature Boy” covered the highs of the star’s career as well as how people around him, such as pro wrestlers Triple H and Shawn Michaels, dealt with his depression after he lost his son in 2013.

Flair, 68, was hospitalized in August and he had emergency surgery, and doctors gave him a 20 percent chance to live.

""People say it's a miracle,"" Flair said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.

He told the AP he's quit drinking.

The Saints organization was going to honor retired Cmdr. John Wells, the executive director of Military Veterans Advocacy, with the Peoples Health Champion award during last week’s game in New Orleans, according to The Advocate.

On Wednesday he told the organization he was unable to accept the award at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome because of the anthem protests. Saints players have been seen kneeling before the anthem and some continue to do so during the national anthem.

“Although I am touched and honored to be selected for such an award, the ongoing controversy with NFL players' disrespect for the national flag forces me to decline to participate in the presentation,” Wells said. ""I am unable, in good conscience, to enter an NFL stadium while this discourtesy prevails. Since this award is tainted with the dishonorable actions of the NFL and its players, I cannot accept it.”

Wells served in the Navy from 1972 to 1994 and afterward became an attorney concentrating in military and veterans law, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. He was set to receive the award given by Medicare to senior citizens who have made significant accomplishments.

The Saints said in a statement Thursday that they were disappointed by Wells’ decision.

“We will not allow Mr. Wells' decision and subsequent media appearances to distract our players and organization from continuing to honor and support our military and veterans,"" the statement read.

Now the New York Times is denouncing him for a ""grave betrayal.""

That turn of events marks a new frontier in the Harvey Weinstein case, one in which lawyers, publicists and private eyes are starting to be held accountable for high-pressure tactics against the media and those making the allegations.

In a remarkable piece in the New Yorker, Ronan Farrow exposes how some of these highly compensated people used deceptive tactics—including phony names and fabricated companies—to intimidate Weinstein’s accusers and the journalists reporting on him.

Farrow, who published allegations of sexual assault and harassment by numerous women against Weinstein, is especially dogged in delving into these dark corners. He went to the New Yorker after NBC, which employs him as a special correspondent, declined to air his earlier reporting, which broke open the scandal after a very strong piece in the New York Times.

It's the fact that the Times has been investigating Weinstein that made Boies' conduct in representing him so egregious, because he is also a lawyer for the newspaper.

As Farrow reports about Black Cube, an investigative outfit run largely by former Israeli intelligence agents: ""Boies personally signed the contract directing Black Cube to attempt to uncover information that would stop the publication of a Times story about Weinstein's abuses, while his firm was also representing the Times, including in a libel case.""

That brought this stinging statement from the Times:

""We learned today that the law firm of Boies Schiller and Flexner secretly worked to stop our reporting on Harvey Weinstein at the same time as the firm's lawyers were representing us in other matters. We consider this intolerable conduct, a grave betrayal of trust, and a breach of the basic professional standards that all lawyers are required to observe. It is inexcusable and we will be pursuing appropriate remedies.""

The paper promptly severed its relationship with Boies.

Boies made a weak attempt at spinning his way out of it, telling the New Yorker that he didn't have a conflict of interest because he didn't pick the investigative firms or direct their work. But, he acknowledged, ""We should not have been contracting with and paying investigators that we did not select and direct. At the time, it seemed a reasonable accommodation for a client, but it was not thought through, and that was my mistake. It was a mistake at the time.""

The magnitude of that mistake becomes clear only when you dive into what these investigators did to try to suppress the allegations against Weinstein. (His PR person calls it a ""fiction"" that any people were targeted or suppressed.)

An employee at Black Cube (whose contract was worth at least $600,000), posing as ""Diana Filip"" of ""Reuben Capital,"" was actually a former member of the Israeli Defense Forces, Farrow reports. He said the woman contacted him, Jodi Kantor of the Times and Ben Wallace of New York magazine in an attempt to extract information.

The same ""Diana"" repeatedly met with actress Rose McGowan, one of Weinstein's accusers, saying she was launching an initiative to combat discrimination against women in the workplace—and also that she was interested in investing in McGowan’s production company.

Farrow reports on a freelance journalist who called McGowan and two other Weinstein accusers and then communicated with Black Cube. This person called Farrow and New York's Wallace as well. The freelancer claims he was working on his own Weinstein story.

There's more:

--National Enquirer Editor Dylan Howard also played a role in a television production agreement between Weinstein and the tabloid's parent company, American Media Inc. One of his reporters dug up negative information on Rose McGowan, which Howard shared with Weinstein.

Howard said he was seeking ""truthful information about people who Mr. Weinstein insisted were making false claims against him."" He added: ""To the extent I provided 'off the record' information to Mr. Weinstein about one of his accusers—at a time when Mr. Weinstein was denying any harassment of any woman—it was information which I would never have allowed AMI to publish on the internet or in its magazines."" That still puts the Enquirer in the position of using its reporters to dig up stuff for Weinstein, who responded in one email: ""This is the killer. Especially if my fingerprints r not on this.""

--A California investigative firm that includes Jack Palladino sent Weinstein a report on McGowan with sections and subheds labeled ""Lies/Exaggerations/Contradictions,"" ""Hypocrisy,"" ""Potential Negative Character Wits"" [witnesses], and ""Past Lovers.""

--The Kroll investigative firm sent Weinstein background reports on New York's Wallace and the magazine's editor, Adam Moss (but found ""no adverse information"" on Moss).

Farrow told ""GMA"" yesterday that he was surprised by the sheer extent of what he found: ""This was a vast international campaign using high-level elite operatives, using fake identities, insinuating themselves into people’s lives, using front companies as cover.""",NY Times rips David Boies for 'betrayal' in secretly helping Harvey Weinstein,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/08/ny-times-rips-david-boies-for-betrayal-in-secretly-helping-harvey-weinstein.html

The memorial, which is accessible only by boat, straddles the wreckage of the battleship on which more than 1,000 Navy personnel lost their lives during the attack that drew the U.S. into World War II.

""We are going to visit very shortly, Pearl Harbor, which I've read about, spoken about, heard about, studied, but I haven't seen. And that is going to be very exciting for me,"" he said.

A total of more than 2,300 sailors, soldiers and Marines died as a result of the attack, as did 68 civilians, according to the National Park Service.

During his visit in Hawaii, Trump was expected to meet with the U.S. Pacific Command to discuss the escalating threat from North Korea. He was also scheduled to meet with the governors of Alaska, Hawaii and Pacific U.S. territories, which are all relatively close targets if North Korea opts for a missile strike aganst the U.S.

Trump will head to Japan on Saturday, then make subsequent stops in South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines, where the looming crisis in North Korea will likely remain a key topic of discussion.

The president plans to attend the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) conference in Vietnam and the East Asian Summit in the Philippines, for which he recently tacked on an extra day to his trip.

Ferrero, the Italian company that makes Nutella, confirmed the watchdog organizations suspicions. However, they said the consumer would notice no difference to the taste and quality of the product – despite the fact that the product is lighter due to more powdered milk and less cacao.

“The quality, the sourcing and all other aspects of Nutella ingredients remain the same,” Ferrero said, the Telegraph reported, ""The ingredients list is, as usual, displayed on the jar and on the Nutella webpage. All relevant aspects, from a diet perspective, are the same.”

According to an official menu obtained by Bloomberg, the “exquisite” condiment was used to make a “special sauce” served with the beef rib, which itself was made from a distinct breed of Korean cattle called Hanwoo.

It’s unclear if Trump — who preferred fast food on the campaign trail — actually ate the beef or the sauce, but he was also treated to a piece of grilled sole, which is reportedly one of his favorite dishes.

Another notable menu item was “shrimp caught in the waters of Dokdo,” an island that’s claimed by both South Korea and Japan. Its inclusion, according to Bloomberg, may have been an intentional to provoke discussion about the strained relationship between the two counties.

People often ask me what one word describes Billy Graham’s distinctive witness.","As renowned evangelist the Rev. Billy Graham celebrated his 99th birthday Tuesday, I thanked the Lord for Graham’s inspiration and influence on so many lives – including mine – and for God’s faithfulness and favor in continuing to preserve Graham to fulfill God’s purpose at this life-stage.

During more than 60 years of crusade ministry, Graham faithfully proclaimed a timeless message in a timely way at the intersection of faith and culture. But he did more than just preach the Gospel. He lived it daily in his walk with the Lord.

Over the nearly 34 years we worked together while I was privileged to serve as his personal media spokesman, Graham modeled for me and countless others that the principles of Jesus that one lifts up and lives out are far more powerful than the mere words one says. And that is the greatest sermon I have ever heard, and will always remember.

Over the past 10 days, I have been traveling with a delegation of American Evangelicals in Egypt and Jordan, the land of Abraham. For the Old Testament patriarch, his later years were arguably his most productive, as “…from that one man, so many people came that they were like stars in the sky” (Hebrews 11:12).

People often ask me what one word describes Billy Graham’s distinctive witness. I have to use three: faithfulness (to his calling,) authenticity (the same person one-on-one as in the pulpit) and integrity (doing the right thing, beyond doing things right).

Abraham first responded in obedience to God’s call on his life at the mature age of 75. When he was 99-years-old, as Graham is now, Abraham received some surprising news. God made a covenant with him in his advanced years that he would become the father of nations. What faith it must have required for him to trust God’s at that point in his life!

I am reminded of, and thankful for, the similar faith Graham has exhibited through the years, when it may have seemed that God was asking the impossible of him. But much like Abraham, time and again he stepped out in obedience, following God’s call when the way didn’t seem clear.

Just as Abraham had many physical descendants, Billy Graham’s passion for souls and devotion to his evangelistic calling has resulted in countless spiritual descendants who look to him as their father or grandfather in the faith.

Graham never veered from his calling to faithfully preach the Gospel. As someone who had a front row seat for more than three decades observing all God accomplished around the world through his faithfulness, there has been no greater representative for the Christian faith.

People often ask me what one word describes Billy Graham’s distinctive witness. I have to use three: faithfulness (to his calling,) authenticity (the same person one-on-one as in the pulpit) and integrity (doing the right thing, beyond doing things right).

One of the distinctive qualities of his ministry was his ability to make positive points for the Gospel in any media situation, and in doing so God honored his faithfulness.

Graham never sacrificed the long-term viability of his ministry for the short-term visibility of media publicity and promotion. Rather, he understood and cultivated the character and calling that came with his station. He sought platforms for his message, not publicity for his ministry, to communicate biblical truth beyond audiences that attended his crusades.

Hebrews 11 reminds us that the prophet Enoch was commended as “one who pleased God.” I can’t help but imagine that is what the Lord thinks of Graham, as a result of his “well-done” fidelity to God’s calling on his life for more than 60 years.

Like the other “great cloud of witnesses” who lived by faith, no doubt at this life-stage the evangelist is also longing for all God has planned and promised in his “heavenly country.” Meanwhile, our nation groans under the weight of the battle for its collective soul, and could benefit from his sage wisdom and spiritual insight as in years past.

Things of this world are measured in minutes, hours, days and years. But what a comfort it is to read in Psalm 31:15 that says “my times are in Your hands.…” We will have as many birthdays as the Lord planned for us from the beginning of eternity.

Everyone who knows Billy Graham’s name continues to pray that God will give him many more years, and that his extraordinary life and the transferable ministry principles of his unique legacy will continue to inspire current and future generations.",Billy Graham has many spiritual descendants as he turns 99,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/07/billy-graham-has-many-spiritual-descendants-as-turns-99.html

The Hermit Kingdom demanded the U.S. “withdraw the hostile policy toward” Kim Jong Un’s dictatorship and said a “decisive choice” needed to be made, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday.

""The U.S. must oust the lunatic old man from power and withdraw the hostile policy towards [North Korea] at once in order to get rid of the abyss of doom."" - KCNA statement

""The U.S. must oust the lunatic old man from power and withdraw the hostile policy towards [North Korea] at once in order to get rid of the abyss of doom,” the statement read. “The U.S. had better make a decisive choice…if it does not want a horrible nuclear disaster and tragic doom.”

Kim’s warning about the impending “abyss of doom” heading toward the U.S. — and every country joining in America's aim to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear program — comes after Trump issued a stark warning to Kim Jong Un during a speech in South Korea during Trump's five-country Asia tour.

""Do not underestimate us. And do not try us,” Trump said, directly addressing North Korea as Trump stood in a room full of South Korean lawmakers. ""The weapons you are acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger.”

He added: ""The world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens with nuclear devastation.”

Trump painted North Korea as a bleak country where citizens bribe government officials in order to leave the country, and poverty and desperation thrive instead of prosperity.

""North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned. It is a hell that no person deserves,"" Trump said.

The message came hours after Trump attempted to make a surprise visit to the Demilitarized Zone, the border separating North and South Korea, with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. But heavy fog prevented Trump’s helicopter from safely landing in the area.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the president was disappointed he couldn't make the trip. ""I think he's pretty frustrated,"" she told reporters. ""It was obviously something he wanted to do.""

Trump headed to China on Wednesday for a two-day visit — most likely to be, again, dominated by talks about the growing nuclear crisis in the Korean peninsula. A day before he arrived in Beijing, Chinese officials ordered tour operators to halt trips to North Korean capital Pyongyang, sources told Reuters.

“It was very unexpected, we had no idea this was going to happen until we received the notification [Tuesday],” a Chinese tour operator told Reuters. “This is devastating news for us.”

(Lennar is only opening up the lower parts of certain walls, the Post reports.) The couple also tried to sell the home back to Lennar, but their offer was rejected.

“Lennar seems to think it can get away with business as usual — by advertising luxury — while selling garbage — in Hudson County,” said the couple’s lawyer, Phil Chronakis. “I’m going to have a Hudson County jury look at what Lennar did — those jurors will be outraged as should all of us.”

According to Lennar's website, units in the Avenue residential complexes range from $1,399,000 to $3,750,000.

If you have allergies or asthma, or are sensitive to pollution, you may have considered purchasing an air purifier to clean the air inside your home. Now, with smoke from destructive wildfires still burning in Northern California affecting people as far as 100 miles away, even those without specific health concerns are thinking about ways to improve indoor air quality. But with so many types of filtration systems on the market (and prices ranging from $100 to nearly $1,000), it can be hard to know where to begin. Check out this quick guide to home air purifiers to figure out which are worth the cost.

Why use an air purifier? Indoor air pollution comes from a combination of particulate matter (dust, mold, pet dander and particles from smoke and cooking stoves) and gaseous pollutants (vehicle exhaust, smoke and chemical fumes) and can be far worse than the pollution outside, simply because it has no way to dissipate.

Those who suffer from asthma or allergies can be especially sensitive to air quality, and using an air purifier could be helpful, together with other methods of keeping out pollution and allergens.

Purify your home, not just the air. Air purifiers can do wonders for removing particulate matter from the air; the problem is that dust, pet dander and the like don’t stay in the air for long. Allergens drift to the ground and become embedded in rugs and soft furnishings — places an air purifier cannot reach. A combination approach will reduce indoor air pollution and allergens more than any one method alone. Here are a few strategies to try:

○ Remove wall-to-wall carpeting; go for easy-to-clean hard flooring and washable area rugs.

○ Vacuum and dust with a microfiber cloth regularly.

○ Ban smoking in and around the house.

○ Do not use a fireplace.

○ Do use the exhaust fans over the stove and in the bathroom.

○ Establish a no-shoes policy.

What to do if you are affected by wildfire smoke. Depending on wind direction and other atmospheric conditions, smoke from wildfires can drift 100 miles or farther from the source of the flames. If you are affected by wildfire smoke (but not in an evacuation area), the Centers for Disease Control recommends staying indoors when possible, with windows, doors, and fireplace dampers closed. Here are a few more things you can do:

○ Use your central air-conditioning system if you have one, but keep the fresh air intake closed to prevent smoke from getting inside.

○ Clean or replace the HVAC filter more frequently as long as you are experiencing smoky conditions.

○ Cut down on activities that contribute to indoor air pollution, including burning candles and using a fireplace, wood stove or gas stove.

○ Avoid vacuuming, as this can stir up large particles that have settled.

○ If you do not have an in-duct air filtration system, it can be helpful to use a portable air purifier with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to remove some of the particulate matter from the air.

○ If you have a medical emergency from smoke, you should call 911 or go to a hospital emergency room immediately.

How air purifiers work. There are a few different types of air purifiers on the market, and not all of them are especially effective or safe. It is important to know what you are buying, so read the fine print on your air purifier before purchasing. The main thing to check is how the purifier cleans the air. It will likely use one or more of these methods:

○ High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter: This is the most common and one of the most effective methods available.

○ Activated carbon: Usually used with a HEPA filter or another filter, activated carbon can help reduce pollution by attracting some chemicals, which bond to the surface of the carbon.

○ Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) cleaners: These use a UV light to kill viruses, bacteria, allergens and some molds. UVGI cleaners may not reduce allergy or asthma symptoms, because typical home cleaners have limited effectiveness.

○ Electrostatic precipitators: Particles entering the purifier are given a charge and then trapped on oppositely charged plates. These machines create a small amount of ozone, which is a lung irritant and pollutant itself, so this type of purifier is probably best avoided.

Not effective as an air purifier at all, ozone generators are being marketed as air cleaners, but they actually add lung-irritating ozone to your home, which can be hazardous. The Environmental Protection Agency does not recommend buying ozone generators.

When to choose a whole-house air cleaner: If you have a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in your home, you have the option of having a whole-house air cleaner installed right in the ductwork. The benefits of a whole-house system are that all of the air is cleaned and there are no bulky appliances to deal with. In-duct systems are expensive, and they must be professionally installed and maintained.

When to choose a portable room purifier: Room purifiers are a good choice for smaller spaces, and multiple units can be used to clean the air even in a larger home. They are portable, so they are a good solution for renters, and cost anywhere from $100 to $1,000 per unit.

Get to know the rating systems. For in-duct air filters, look for the minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) to tell how efficiently they pull particles from the air. MERV values range from 1 to 20; a system rated 7 or higher is about as effective as a HEPA filter. True HEPA filters, which have MERV values of 17 to 20, are not typically installed in HVAC systems. However, some newer homes may be specially designed with in-duct HEPA filtration.

When shopping for a portable air purifier, look for a clean air delivery rate (CADR) of at least 250, but the higher the better. This is a voluntary system developed by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), so not all appliances have a CADR.

An Energy Star label on any air purifier indicates better energy efficiency but does not necessarily mean it is more effective — so also be sure to check the MERV or CADR rating.

Want to be really sure your air purifier is doing its job? Look for the AHAM Verifide mark on your portable air cleaner, which indicates that the manufacturer’s claims have been independently tested and certified.",What to look for when buying air purifiers for your home,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/26/what-to-look-for-when-buying-air-purifiers-for-your-home.html

Hurst was in a relationship with Alison Parker when she and cameraman Adam Ward were murdered by a former co-worker while doing a live report for WDBJ-TV on the morning of Aug. 26, 2015.

The shooting and his relationship with Parker catapulted Hurst into the national spotlight as the public face of the grieving Roanoke station.

The Roanoke Times reported that both candidates spent more than $1 million on the race, with Hurst garnering support from donors in more than two dozen other states.

Corinna Slusser, 19, was reported missing on Sept. 20, the same day she was last seen leaving Haven Motel in Rego Park, Queens in the early morning, police said Monday. Police are investigating Slusser as a possible victim of sex trafficking, NYPD sources told Fox News on Wednesday.

Little is known about the Bloomsburg native, but Slusser reportedly filed a complaint against a 32-year-old man, possibly her pimp, about a month before she was last seen. She alleged the man grabbed her neck and pushed her against the wall when she demanded he hand over $300 that was allegedly stolen from her. NYPD sources indicated to Fox News the identification of Corrina Slusser as the assault victim was correct.

Slusser’s Facebook page showed she was studying marketing at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Relatives initially reported her missing on Sept. 12 when she didn’t show up at her grandfather’s funeral in Florida, the New York Daily News reported. Her last post on her Instagram page was Sept. 10 — a photo of herself with the location tag listed in the Bronx.

Relatives told the New York Daily News that Slusser moved to New York City after meeting her alleged pimp in March. She called the man “her daddy” and still kept in touch with her family until early September, when she was last seen and heard from.

“She's so sweet and so naive. She didn't know what she was getting herself into,” a relative told the newspaper. “She just needs to know that everybody wants her home. I can’t imagine what she's gone through or what she’s going through. I just want her to have an out.”

Slusser’s social media followers have posted on her pages, telling her to “stay safe” as police try to locate her whereabouts.

“stay safe! you have a lot of people that love you Corinna! i don’t know who you are but i am praying for you!” a woman commented on Instagram.

Another wrote: “Corina please be safe .xoxo I love you.”

Slusser was described as being about 5 feet 6 inches tall, 140 pounds with blond hair and blue eyes. She has a distinct tattoo on her chest — a large black flower.","Missing Pennsylvania teen feared to be sex-trafficking victim, police say",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/08/missing-pennsylvania-teen-feared-to-be-sex-trafficking-victim-police-say.html

Flanagan is an interesting woman. She has won medals in the Olympics and set records at world competitions. She and her husband are foster parents as well, providing a home for teenage twins. She also took time off after a back injury in late winter of last year and was unable to run the Boston Marathon.

Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.

Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.

This is a Republican plan that targets people wanting to adopt children, homeowners, small businesses and people with high medical bills.","In the world of conservative thought, few issues are as popular as tax reform. It's an accepted truth, by nearly anyone on the right, that the tax code is too complicated for an average citizen to understand and too laden with loopholes to be fair.

Beyond the structure of the code itself it's a fairly standard conservative view that taxes themselves are unjust, that government should not be confiscating a large chunk of our hard-earned pay and they certainly shouldn't then be helping themselves to additional taxes after that first take.

In a perfect conservative world there would either be no taxes at all or a tax which would be simple to understand, a flat tax or the Fair Tax. But we don't live in that perfect conservative world and so we recognize that tax policy, while still being burdensome, complicated and unfair, is used to achieve various societal objectives.

The marriage tax benefit, for example, is there to encourage people to get married. The electric vehicle credit exists to encourage people to reduce their oil consumption. The American Opportunity Tax Credit encourages people to go to post-secondary school such as colleges or trade schools. And so on.

What then can be seen as the point of the tax plan, called ""The Tax Cuts And Jobs Act” announced by the Republicans in the House of Representatives last Thursday? There are no obvious goals whatsoever in the convoluted plan.

This is a Republican plan that targets people wanting to adopt children, homeowners, small businesses and people with high medical bills.

The plan does absolutely nothing to simplify the process. No matter how many times Republican leadership promises that we’ll be able to do our taxes on a postcard, that’s not what the reality will be for nearly anyone. Credits and deductions will still exist though some have been targeted by this plan seemingly at random.

One such nonsensical target is the adoption tax credit. Where is the ideological sense in getting rid of a credit to ease the financial burden of adoption? Conservatives always suggest adoption as an alternative to abortion. But adoption is incredibly costly and the credit has been a boon to families looking to adopt, so why cut it?

“Who loses?” asked Laura Saunders in the Wall Street Journal. “Highly paid employees in high-tax states; future buyers of large homes or second homes; high-earning home sellers; people who take medical deductions; and future alimony payers, among others.”

Why get rid of the write-off for medical expenses? It’s practically an admission that single-payer is coming and Republicans don't plan to stop it. Why else not work to defray the costs of people paying for medical care out of pocket? How is that conservative?

Professionals will be hardest hit by the plan. People making $200,000-500,000 will see their taxes go up by 2023 according to a report released by Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation. Since when do Republicans want to disincentivize success? This isn’t targeting the super-rich, this is targeting the newly rich, families just achieving their American dream.

The mortgage interest rate deduction will drop from $1,000,000 to $500,000--an amount seemingly aimed specifically at people in blue states and the upper middle class.

The plan also doesn’t do anything for small businesses. It contains a provision to limit the tax burden to 25 percent for a small business. But as Josh Barro at Business Insider points out “More than 80 percent of tax filers with small-business income are already taxed at rates of 25 percent or less, so only the wealthiest business owners, who currently face high tax brackets, would get a tax cut.” The National Federation of Independent Business, generally a conservative group, said in a statement that they could not support the bill in its current form.

This is a Republican plan that targets people wanting to adopt children, homeowners, small businesses and people with high medical bills. The free-market organization Club for Growth put out a statement noting that the bill “effectively punishes success and caves to the Democrats’ class warfare rhetoric.”

That leads to the question of why it’s such an over-compromised bill in the first place.

Conservatives claim to want a real simplification of the tax code. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has spent years promising this. If now, with a Republican House, Senate and presidency, isn’t the time to make bold moves on tax policy then when would be the time? This whole plan is an admission that Republican leadership are too afraid to ever be bold and that there will never be a true conservative movement to simplify or reduce taxes, no matter how many Republicans are elected to office.

What do conservatives believe or represent in 2017?

Lt. Steven Arango was attending Bates College in Maine, when he read a New York Times article that inspired him.

The article profiled Captain George Whitney, 38, a Bates College alumnus and a C.I.A paramilitary officer who was killed in December in Afghanistan.

“After I read about him, I knew right away that Bates needed to honor him,” Arango said to ConnectingVets.com.

Whitney excelled both academically and athletically at Bates College; he graduated cum laude after playing football as the starting fullback. After college, Whitney joined the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, serving in Anbar, Iraq. He then joined the C.I.A, but was killed in action during an operation in Afghanistan.

Whitney, along with two others, was awarded stars from the C.I.A for dying in the line of duty.

“He epitomized selfless service and gave his life in protection of our country,” Arango said. “Simply put, he’s a hero.”

Inspired by Whitney’s heroism, Arango petitioned Bates College to honor his legacy.

Arango decided that a sculpted bust would be the perfect tribute to Whitney, and contracted the help of retired USMC Colonel and Alabama artist Lee Busby.

Also a University of Alabama graduate, Busby sculpts Alabamians who have been killed in Iraq of Afghanistan.

""I'm no Michelangelo, but I know the world that these people operate in, and I know what they went through,” Busby told Southern Living. “And, I do have some ability to sculpt. So, that's what I want to do.""

Now, Busby is nearly halfway done with the bust of Whitney and is ready to sculpt the finishing touches.

“We are flying Caryn Whitney into Tuscaloosa to put the final touches on the bust,” Arango said. “We want to make sure the likeness is exactly of her son.”

Busby expects to complete the sculpture by December, which then will be used for pouring — the process used to make a bronze bust.

Arango is funding this project completely alone, and hopes that Bates College can provide space for the memorial.

“I just want Captain Whitney to be honored,” Arango said. “For the next 100, 200 years with Bates students walking next to him and seeing him? I promise you Bates will turn out even better students than they are now.”

They all want what Seattle has: Amazon. The online retail giant confirming 238 cities from across North America submitted proposals to host its second headquarters. In the U.S. only seven states don't have cities in the running and the suitors are willing to spend millions to help Amazon feel at home.

Seattle's economy did get a boost from Amazon, more than $30 billion worth for the city's economy, just from the company's investments in the city, billions more from spinoff businesses and 40,000 jobs. The Bellingham Herald noting the city's unemployment rate is below the national average.

But keeping up with the growth is an issue, the city approving hundreds of millions of dollars in transportation and utility improvements. And the nation's fastest growing city is also one of the most expensive places to live. Rents in King County up 65 percent since 2009, though the rising renting has been an issue nationwide.

FOX's Lisa Brady speaks with Toledo Mayor Paula Hicks-Hudson, who says she isn't worried about the cost and says the city has a rail system and highways to make it viable, plus a seaport. Brady also chats with FOX News' Jeff Flock, who covered the story in Chicago.

At that point, the witness says the woman sat up in her seat, while the man attempted to apologize.

Police also said that the 48-year-old woman was reported to be “highly intoxicated” when they were dispatched to bring her and the 28-year-old into custody. Police had previously said the two were strangers before boarding the plane; she switched seats sometime into the flight to sit beside him.

Upon the flight’s arrival at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport, officers say the man attempted to explain that the woman had merely ""fallen asleep in his lap but that they did not have intercourse,"" and added that he only ""grabbed her breasts on the outside of her clothes.""

After the incident, the Press says the woman attempted to re-book her flight with Delta, but the airline stated that she “was not permitted to fly” with them. She left the next day on a different carrier.

While the 49-year-old TV host and producer was all too familiar with Joan’s mountainous collection, which reportedly included filing cabinets with 69,000 quips to ensure she never repeated a line, Melissa wasn’t expecting to share them with the world.

With enough convincing, Melissa, along with Joan’s friend and publicist Scott Currie, chose to share those rarely-seen archives in a coffee table book, titled “Joan Rivers: Confidential,” which was released earlier this year. It’s a loving homage to the raspy voiced, razor-sharp comedian who died in 2014 at the age of 81.

“We were having to go through everything in her apartment and start to close the whole thing after I sold it,” Melissa recalled to Fox News. “There was so much stuff in storage. My parents were these incredible record keepers. They also had files and scrapbooks.

A post shared by Melissa Rivers (@melissariversofficial) on Aug 8, 2017 at 5:24pm PDT

""Scott kept saying to me, ‘There’s something in here… There’s a book here.’ And I was like, ‘Oh God, no there’s not.’ And he kept on me, convincing me. And I said, ‘Fine. If you can put something together and prove to me that there’s a book here then I’ll think about it. And he put something together… [I] sent it to my agent and it sold in a day.”

When asked if going through her mother’s belongings helped her cope with the loss, Melissa joked, “I’m not sure the book helped me cope, but it certainly helped get my storage bills under control.”

While Melissa wasn’t surprised by the discovery, as it was far from a family secret, fans will be shocked to learn that Joan, who was recognized as one of America’s most successful female stand-up comics, originally dreamed of a different role for herself.

A post shared by Joan Rivers (@joanrivers) on Jul 12, 2017 at 12:58pm PDT

“Well, she wanted to be a very serious actress,” said Melissa. “My grandfather was very funny. And my mother was always funny. And her sister was funny. Apparently, her mother was just very formal and not terribly funny. But they definitely had my grandfather, her father’s sense of humor. And they would always just be laughing. That was such an innate, comfortable space for her that eventually, that’s just where she landed. But the big thing was that she was going to be a serious, dramatic actress.”

However, the change in career plans worked for the brassy Brooklyn native. Her no-nonsense approach to comedy left millions of viewers in stitches. And no one in Hollywood was off-limits, not even the queen of glamour. Joan’s files revealed there were about 850 jokes dedicated to Elizabeth Taylor alone.

“Elizabeth Taylor became a favorite because, you gotta remember, women of my mother’s generation, they all wanted to be her,” said Melissa. “Every girl wanted to be ‘National Velvet.’ Every little girl wanted to grow up and be beautiful and glamorous — and the diamonds and the men fighting over her. This was their fantasy... And I think that’s where that all began.”

A post shared by Elizabeth Taylor (@elizabethtaylor) on Feb 17, 2017 at 1:15pm PST

While many of Joan’s one-liners focused on Taylor’s weight gain over the years, the Oscar-winner didn’t seemed bothered by the seemingly vicious commentary. When mutual friend Roddy McDowall approached Taylor about Joan’s comedy, she gave a shocking answer.

“…The message that came back to my mom was ‘It doesn’t hurt me where I live,’” said Melissa. “Which is a pretty incredible answer. And as we saw the things that she did later in life, you get that. She always knew who she was, regardless of everything that was swirling around her.""

And while some of Joan’s infamous jokes could have easily offended her targets, Melissa insisted she was never out to hurt anyone. And if Joan was aware that any of her subjects or their families were genuinely upset by her puns, she would immediately remove them from her act.

A post shared by Joan Rivers (@joanrivers) on Oct 29, 2017 at 8:04am PDT

“You look at the bulk of the material, and I would say a good 98 percent is self-deprecating with her as the butt of the joke,” said Melissa. “Everyone used to ask if it would upset my dad (TV producer Edgar Rosenberg) that she made so many jokes about my dad. And my mom would always say, ‘You aren’t listening carefully. The jokes aren’t about Edgar. The jokes are about me!’… It was making fun of herself… She was never intent on hurting anyone.”

But Joan easily gained both fame and famous fans, including former President Ronald Reagan and Prince Charles. Melissa explained humor was the reason behind their lasting friendships.

“President Reagan was funny,” said Melissa. “You forget, he was an actor and a great storyteller… And my mother’s dear friend was Nancy Reagan. So that was a friendship that lasted through the years.

A post shared by Reagan Foundation & Institute (@reaganfoundation) on Aug 14, 2017 at 10:23am PDT

""The same with Prince Charles… He’s a big fan of comedy. And has a huge, hilarious sense of humor… A real friendship developed between my mother and Prince Charles and Camilla. … The bond was truly made through a mutual sense of humor… In private, the whole family has great, great humor.”

Joan earned a lasting career by mercilessly insulting nearly anyone, living or dead and happily criticizing the couture worn by celebrities on the red carpet. But when cameras stopped rolling, she made sure to keep every reminder that her comedy made someone laugh — especially when that praise came from the type of star she once dreamed of becoming.

“She never lost the feeling of being a fan,” said Melissa. “She would always save all her correspondences. My mother was just as excited to receive a letter from a Meryl Streep as you or I would be. And that translated so much on the red carpet. She never stopped being a fan.”",Melissa Rivers says late mother Joan Rivers 'was never intent of hurting anyone' with ruthless comedy,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/07/melissa-rivers-says-late-mother-joan-rivers-was-never-intent-hurting-anyone-with-ruthless-comedy.html

Host Chris Wallace pressed the Speaker on what it could mean for many, like those paying off student loans:

Plus, VP Pence explained how the tax reform plan being unveiled today will reduce taxes for all Americans and stated President Trump has been clear about his red line on the corporate tax rate being lowered to 20%.

Listen here for the full interview:

BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: And, joining us right now it's our privilege to bring the vice president of the United States. If there's somebody more respect on our Capital Hill or by the president I don't know who it is. Mr. Vice President, welcome back.

MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Brian, it's great to be on the program and congratulations on your book. I can't wait to get through it.

KILMEADE: Thank you very much and I'll definitely get it to you if you're allowed - I can never know what the rules are with politicians. If I can actually send it to you or not. I don't want to get you in trouble.

PENCE: Don't worry, I'll get one on my own. I've read a biography in the past of Andrew Jackson but I'm really looking forward to reading yours.

KILMEADE: Thanks so much. Mr. Vice President, I tell you I know you're as strong on terror as anyone when you were in Congress let alone now. Have we - have your policy now mirroring President Obama's policy of going through the legal system instead of putting him through the military system?

PENCE: Look, well first off let me - let me say as the president has said that our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of Tuesday's terrorist attack in New York City. We are bringing the full resources of the federal government to bear to support the efforts of the New York City Police Department to follow through on the investigation.

And, we're going to hold this assailant responsible and if there are any more involved we're going to hold them to the very strictest account. This was a barbaric act of terrorism and it will not stand. And, it is in a very real sense, Brian, we believe, of indication of aggressive posture President Trump has taken in taking the fight to ISIS on their soil on our terms.

As you reported very well on this radio program and on the airwaves of Fox and Friends as we speak thanks to U.S. Armed Forces and our allies ISIS is on the run. We have overtaken the so-called capital of their caliphate Raqqa. There's more fighting to be done but Tuesday was a grim reminder --

KILMEADE: Right.

PENCE: ... that our enemies are still - are still afoot. They're still inspiring violence that threatens our people and I can assure you President Trump and our entire administration, our Armed Forces will not rest, we will not relent until we destroy ISIS at its sore so it can no longer inspire or make possible these kinds of acts of violence.

KILMEADE: But, Mr. Vice President, he said -

PENCE: I would say that very clearly. But so there's nothing - I got to tell you there's nothing about President Trump's policies that mirror the last administration. I mean, ISIS came to life, was literally conjured out of the - out of the desert policies of the last administration -

KILMEADE: But they brought the battle here, Mr. Vice President and we're not treated like that.

PENCE: Well, they did.

KILMEADE: He's a - he say's he's a soldier of the caliphate. As Senator Lindsey Graham said, ""Why are we treating him like a criminal?"" Here is Ed Davis. He said the way the Boston bombers were treated he said this is the call he got after they got the Zarnia brother. The other one was dead. Cut 24.

ED DAVIS: There's a clause in the Patriot Act that takes the process out of the civilian courts into a military style process. So, in the case of (inaudible) I got a call from the United States Attorney who ordered me to give orders to my officers not to read the suspect their rights.

And, they brought a special team in of intelligence and military personnel because they thought that this may be an ongoing plot. So, there is - there is a possibility of doing that in the law.

KILMEADE: Why didn't we do that? This guy - yes go ahead.

PENCE: Well, Brian, the president made it clear that he was open to sending this assailant, this terrorist to Guantanamo. In fact I think he - the president tweeted this morning that he would have loved to send the New York terrorist to Guantanamo but the process takes longer and justice delayed is justice denied.

KILMEADE: But we Mirandize him. He's got a lawyer. Why did we -

PENCE: We want to see - we want to see - and the president has made it clear he believe this is a case where death penalty is warranted, I agree with that in the strongest possible terms. I mean running down innocent civilians, killing eight, injuring more than 11. This was a barbaric terrorist attack and we want to bring this person - we want to bring this person to justice as swiftly as possible. And, that's what informed the president's decision.

KILMEADE: Right. It's just that I want to question more (ph).

PENCE: I really want to take issue, Brian. I mean the truth is as I began to say moments ago, literally the precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq created the vacuum in which ISIS was created -

KILMEADE: Oh, I hear you.

PENCE: Literally overran more than half of Iraq. President Trump came into office and he said we are going to destroy ISIS, we're going to - we're going to allow our military to take the action there, take the fight to terrorists and if anything this vicious terrorist attack in New York is simply a confirmation that in President Trump we have the right leadership.

KILMEADE: Right.

PENCE: We have the right commander-in-chief who's taking the fight to the enemy.

KILMEADE: I just hope - I hope next time we get them, we don't Mirandized him. We hold onto him until our interrogators are - feel as though they understand what - who he's talked to and what he's capable of. I don't think, as much as I respect New York, I don't think they know everything he knows.

And, they - now has a lawyer and he's smiling with an ISIS flag and he's going to start using our legal system. Even though I know he's going to get convicted and maybe killed, I want to know what he knows and I'm not convinced we can do that now. Are you?

PENCE: Well, let me be - let me be - let me be very clear with all of your millions of listeners around the country, we are going to get to the bottom of this terrorist action, who inspired him, who worked with him. There are - there is an aggressive investigation underway. I was briefed again on it this morning.

I was at the CIA yesterday. As I said, your listeners should be confident. We are bringing the full resources of the federal government to bear in support of New York law enforcement. We're going to get to the bottom of this. We're going to hold him to the strictest and swiftest account and justice.

And, we're going to find if there were any others involved and I can't really speak at this moment about that, if there were any other involved, we will hold them to the strictest account. We're going to bring justice to these people. That's how we protect the American people.

KILMEADE: I want to talk about tax reform, I know you do, too. You're going to - later on you're going to be with Governor Scott in Florida but I also know that you have a - the House is finally ready to unveil tax reform. Can you let our listeners know what we - the takeaways?

PENCE: Well, it's been more than a generation since we've - we've passed the kind of tax cuts and tax reform to really liven the American economy. I mean, john F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan did it, and what really begins today in the House of Representatives, and we believe will - will be completed before the end of this year is going to be a historic tax cut that's going to building on the momentum that we already see in this economy, Brian, it really is remarkable. After eight years, of less than 2 percent economic growth, we just posted the second quarter in a row of over 3 percent growth because of the policies President Trump's been advancing in terms of rolling back red tape, unleashing American energy.

But this tax cut plan, will reduce taxes on individuals, it'll simplify the tax code and it'll lower business taxes in America like the business I'm visiting in Florida, to make it possible for American companies to compete with companies around the world. It is - it is remarkable to think that in the most powerful economy on earth, we have one of the highest business tax rates on the planet.

President Trump is committed to change that, bringing middle class tax relief to working families to simplify the tax code, and the great news for the America people is that all starts today with the introduction of the House tax cut bill.

KILMEADE: Some specifics, if I can. The 20 percent the president spoke about, is that a red line, and is it true that you're considering a phase in of it, a gradual decrease?

PENCE: Well, I think the president - I think the president's made it very clear to members of Congress that lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent is absolutely imperative. That puts us in a competitive position, the president - we were talking about going to 15 percent early on, the president made it clear we'll do 20, that's it.

So, people - people, I think, understand hoe firmly the president is committed to that. But the other part of this, don't forget, I grew up in a small business family. My family was in the gas station business, Brian, and - and my family, like - like literally millions of business around the country - my - my folks filed their taxes as individuals, that was business income. And we're going to make sure that we also lower the taxes on people that are reporting large incomes that are business income, we're going to lower that to 25 percent.

I mean, if you look back at 1980's, the majority of jobs that were created, the last time we - we passed historic tax relief, were created in small business America. I'm just saying (ph), 20 percent on big corporations, so called, C-corporations, but we're going to go to 25 percent on - on so called past through small businesses. And - and the combination of this, we - we think - we think the combination of this, it's going to be hard to calculate how - how much the American economy is - is - is going to rally around the tax cuts that we're going to fight to get on the president's desk before Christmas.

KILMEADE: Right, and I know you've got to run, you've got to do another interview, but I understand, Steve Scalise told us today, that it's going - the top bracket is going to stay at 39.5 percent. Would you actually say that too?

PENCE: Well, we'll - I know the House of representatives is going to be unveiling heir plan today, President Trump has made it clear that he wants to focus this tax relief on middle class Americans and on job creators and businesses across this country. And we think that what House Republicans unveil today is a great start in that direction, we're grateful for the leadership of Speaker Ryan, of Chairman Kevin Brady and all those that have been working tirelessly with the administration. The Senate will be moving very quickly on their version of the bill and in the weeks ahead, we're literally going to fight everyday to give the American people the kind of tax cuts and tax reform that will make the American economy great again.

KILMEADE: Mr. Vice President, thanks so much for putting us on your schedule, always appreciate it and you say they're going to get it done before the year's end, that will make a lot of people happy. Thanks so much.

But Weisman said yes to the job offer and became a close confidant, oftentimes acting as a therapist, until the singer’s death in 1998.

Weisman recently shared his accounts of what it was really like working with the iconic entertainer in a memoir titled “The Way It Was.”

The former manager told Fox News that when he met Sinatra, he didn’t see a suave, debonair crooner who casually kicked back with a glass of Jack Daniel’s. Instead, he witnessed an aging performer who was worried about the future.

“He was at the crossroads of the pressure he was receiving for his wife, his security and his children regarding the assets of his estate,” Weisman told Fox News. “They had started a couple of little businesses, none of which had really worked out… It was uncomfortable. Because I was the monkey in the middle… It started to make sense 2-3 years down the line.”

Sinatra was also reportedly paranoid about his safety. Not only did he carry an Uzi on his private jet, but he also kept a pistol hidden in his custom boots while on stage at all times, Weisman said.

“A lot of these habits were going on for years and I wasn’t even totally aware of them until I was told about them,” admitted Weisman. “… I guess it’s something that never really bothered me because I knew that... he always had security around him. So if God forbid something really happened, he wouldn’t be anywhere near it. But I wasn’t worried about it.”

However, there was one behavior that concerned Weisman. He claimed Sinatra allegedly overused an antidepressant known as Elavil, which can cause numerous side effects, including blurred vision, rapid weight gain, agitation and confusion.

The effects of the prescribed drug became so severe, the press suspected Sinatra, who struggled to remember lyrics to his iconic hits and repeated anecdotes, was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, Weisman said. His daughter Tina previously recalled how he became more forgetful and would at times lose his coordination and stumble.

“If you read about the antidepressant he was on, if you read the warnings, everything that could go wrong, like loss of vision, loss of hearing, loss of memory — all of those things he at one time or another was harmed by it,” Weisman explained. “The antidepressant he was on… I think you’re only supposed to be on it for 12-13 months, at most. Then you come off it for a while or change it to another antidepressant. He was on it for 10-15 years.”

Weisman hoped Sinatra’s regimen would change, but he claimed Sinatra's fourth and final wife Barbara was against it.

“Barbara decided that it was the wrong thing to do because sometimes when you go off one antidepressant and on to another, you could get violent,” he said. “She was concerned about that. It never happened. There’s no doubt in my mind that the antidepressant was responsible for a lot of his failing health.”

Weisman noticed that the alleged sour relationship between Barbara and Sinatra’s three children was a big concern.

“He didn’t like confrontation, period,” said Weisman. “Especially in his family. And everybody in his family was aware of it… From time to time, whether it was Barbara alone or the kids or a combination, some things would get out of whack.

""I think he became more upset, depressed about those things... It bothered him when there was confrontation about who’s getting what in the future after his death… He wanted his wife taken care of and his kids taken care of fairly.”

However, Weisman added Barbara truly cared for Sinatra and was always on top of what was best for him during his final years.

Despite his health woes, Sinatra dedicated his life to music. For more than 60 years, he performed for royalty, presidents, stars and millions of adoring fans across the world. In 1998, he died at age 82 from a heart attack.



That’s when Weisman received an unwanted surprise. In 2001, a woman who legally changed her name to Julie Sinatra came forward, claiming she was Sinatra’s secret daughter.

The Arizona native declared that if the family wouldn’t agree to a DNA test, she would want Sinatra’s body exhumed. But in 2002, Julie wrote to Weisman, stating she was willing to drop the case in return for financial assistance. The Sinatra estate offered $100,000, a decision that infuriated Tina.

“It drove Tina and I completely apart,” recalled Weisman. “I never really spoke to her after that because she felt I was letting her father be blackmailed by offering this lady a settlement.

""She said, ‘If my father were alive, he’d never let anybody blackmail us like that.’ I said, ‘No, he wouldn’t. He would offer twice as much to get rid of her in 24 hours.’ That was not a fun time… Nobody was happy.”

Today, Weisman lives in Parkland, Florida, far away from Hollywood. He spoke with Barbara on several occasions before her death at age 90 in July. Her son Robert Oliver Marx from her first marriage to actor Zeppo Marx is aware of the book.

“I didn’t speak to Tina,” said Weisman. “I felt the way things were left, that was the best thing, for me not to speak to her. But I did send through her attorney two books, one for him and one for Tina and told them that I hope they enjoyed the read.”",Frank Sinatra's manager says antidepressant was to blame for his failing health during his final years,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/08/frank-sinatras-manager-says-antidepressant-was-to-blame-for-his-failing-health-during-his-final-years.html

Other findings in Timna Valley include preserved leftovers from a mining camp called Slaves' Hill.","The skeleton of a pregnant woman, dating back around 3,200 years, has been found near a temple dedicated to the Egyptian goddess Hathor at a place that was once called King Solomon's Mines, archaeologists recently announced.

Located in the Timna Valley in Israel, ancient Egyptians and others in the region used the mines for copper mining. Early archaeologists and explorers believed that King Solomon, an ancient Israeli ruler, controlled the Timna mines. However, many scholars now think the claim is unlikely.

Archaeologists discovered the pregnant woman's skeleton buried in a tumulus (a tomb covered by rocks) near Hathor's temple. The people worshipped Hathor — the goddess of love, pleasure and maternity — at Timna, and considered her to be the protector of the miners. [See Photos of the Burial and Skeletal Remains in Timna Valley]

At the time the pregnant woman lived, Egypt controlled the mines at Timna, suggesting she was Egyptian. In addition, she may have been a singer at the Hathor temple, said Erez Ben-Yosef, the director of the Central Timna Valley Project and a senior lecturer in archaeology at Tel Aviv University. She was buried with beads whose design is similar to those found at the Hathor temple, Ben-Yosef told Live Science.

An examination of her remains indicates she was in her early 20s and in the first trimester of her pregnancy when she died. The cause of her death is unknown.

The woman likely accompanied one of the mining expeditions sent to the Timna Valley to extract copper; she would have served in the Hathor temple while mining operations were underway. The rituals and ceremonies performed at the temple were important, since Hathor was thought to protect the miners.

It's not known whether the woman traveled to Timna from Egypt while she was pregnant or whether she was impregnated while serving at the Hathor temple, Ben-Yosef said. ""Probably she wouldn't have traveled if she knew she was pregnant, but this is only a guess.

Egypt's power in the Timna area weakened in the century after the woman died, and Egypt eventually lost control of the mines to other groups in the region.

Other findings in Timna Valley include preserved leftovers from a mining camp called Slaves' Hill. Those leftovers suggested the metalworkers ate meals of sheep and goat, as well as pistachios, grapes and fish during the 10th century B.C. More recently at Slaves' Hill, scientists revealed the remains of a sophisticated gatehouse and donkey stables that suggested the settlement had a highly organized defense system. In another discovery, archaeologists reported in 2013 that they had dug up artifacts in the valley that dated to the time of the biblical King Solomon.

Other research is underway to get a better understanding of the history of Timna.

Scientists stumbled on the delicate watercolor of a bird in a hut on Cape Adare, a peninsula on the continent's far east side.

The almost perfectly-preserved artwork was painted by Dr. Edward Wilson, a British polar explorer who died in Antarctica with his expedition leader Capt. Robert Falcon Scott.

It was hidden among penguin excrement, dust and moldy papers in the hut he sheltered in on a 1911 expedition from which he never returned.

The delicate painting is labeled '1899 Tree Creeper,' and depicts a white-breasted tree creeper bird.

But how it ended up in the Cape Adare hut 12 years after Wilson painted it is a mystery.

Paper conservator Josefin Bergmark-Jimenez found the old artwork while clearing out the hut to ready it for restoration.

It was left in a portfolio sitting on the bed, but she was so surprised to find it that she jumped back in shock.

""I opened it and there was this gorgeous painting,"" she said. ""I got such a fright that I jumped and shut the portfolio again.

The results are in and New Jersey and Virginia have elected new Democratic governors.

In New Jersey, former Goldman Sachs executive and Ambassador to Germany Phil Murphy expectedly defeated Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno by an estimated margin of as many as 14 points, and in Virginia, Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam defeated former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie by an estimated 7-to-8-point margin.

Surely, New Jersey’s swing to a Democratic governor is a product of an unpopular outgoing Republican governor, Chris Christie, and President Trump’s unpopularity in the state as well.

Further, outgoing Republican Governor Christie has the dubious status as New Jersey’s least popular governor in recorded history, reaching all-time low approval ratings of 15 percent.

The president’s role in campaigns will clearly continue to be a critical issue as we approach the 2018 midterm elections.

This has greatly impacted Guadagno’s support in the campaign, as a recent Monmouth poll found that Guadagno’s association with Christie made 29 percent of voters less likely to vote for her, almost double the 16 percent who said her association made them more likely to vote for her.

To be clear, Murphy’s win will be an important pick up for the Democratic Party, but a win in what can be described as the Democrats’ backyard is not a major development in the national landscape.","Big Lessons Learned from Virginia, New Jersey Governor's Races",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/08/big-lessons-learned-virginia-new-jersey-governors-races

Service dogs are not pets.
Service dogs for those with post-traumatic stress disorder are often on point, keeping potential triggers that would raise stress or anxiety levels for their veterans at bay.
Service dogs are not pets.
So far, we’ve just addressed how people react to service dogs.","The relationship between a service dog and a veteran is akin to a team walking a tightrope. To succeed, they must focus on each other, intently. Distract one, and both can stumble. When they are in sync, the intricate teamwork going on can appear effortless to the outside world. And this partly explains why some people, often quite innocently, insist on being a distraction. Hence the ubiquitous question:

Can I pet your dog?

Uh, no, not now. Not ever. Keep your paws off, please.

Would you want someone to ask if they could rub your heart surgeon’s head while she was operating on you? Would you think it appropriate if someone offered to rub your lawyer’s belly while he was trying to convince a jury of your innocence?

Probably not, right? You'd think these were grossly inappropriate questions and certainly needless distractions in the midst of critical, sometimes life and death, situations.

And that’s exactly how you should think about service dogs when they are about their work. Note the key word: work.

But that’s the thing. Service dogs are not pets. When their vest is on, they have an extremely important job to do.

In public, vest on, these dogs are engaged in life-saving tasks for their veterans. Guide dogs prevent blind or vision-impaired veterans from wandering into the street when a light is red. For veterans with prosthetic limbs, their dogs open doors, keep watch for things easily tripped over, or act as a brace when vets are walking or standing up. Service dogs for those with post-traumatic stress disorder are often on point, keeping potential triggers that would raise stress or anxiety levels for their veterans at bay. For veterans prone to seizures, their dogs will alert them if they sense an episode coming on.

We get it. These dogs are irresistibly cute. And clearly just the sight of one in a store or restaurant can turn normally reserved adults into children. Disabled veterans have seen grown men crawl under tables, barking to get a dog’s attention. And while they’re down there, may as well pet the pup, right? If it were them, they’d no doubt welcome having their meal interrupted so people could show their pet some love.

But that’s the thing. Service dogs are not pets. When their vest is on — the garment often emblazoned with the words “Service dog: Do not pet” — they have an extremely important job to do. They have undergone months, sometimes years, of intense training that costs tens of thousands of dollars — an expense currently not covered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. They are there to watch for and react to dangerous situations and await commands from their veterans. If you call to these dogs, or insist on talking to them, then, despite all that training — they are, after all, still dogs — they are potentially paying attention to you, not the veterans they are supposed to serve and protect. In other words, you’re bouncing up and down on their tightrope.

Think about it this way: If the service dog turns its head or body to see what you want, the veteran with vision loss could wind up stumbling and falling. Prosthetic limbs can be seriously damaged in the twists and turns of a tumble. Or the dog might not catch the early signs of a seizure, or miss something that causes problems for a vet with PTSD.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) actually requires owners to maintain control of their animals. Don’t make a tough job more difficult.

So far, we’ve just addressed how people react to service dogs. But their behavior toward disabled vets can be even more bizarre — and quite rude. For example, people often say, “I know it’s a service dog and he’s working, so I won’t pet him.” This is so irritating. It’s as if they are magnanimously making the decision to pet or not pet without asking prior permission. An analogy would be: “I know you have a purse and I know I am not to steal it, so I won’t.” How generous.

Worse is when people just reach out to pet a service dog, seemingly from every direction imaginable. Then they will get angry when the surprised disabled veteran turns and says, “Please don’t pet him, he’s working.” Their disturbing response? “Well, what’s wrong with you? You don’t look disabled.” People seem to genuinely believe they have a right to know this. (Maybe so they can decide in their own mind if it’s OK to pet the animal with the vest that clearly says “Do not pet”?)

That’s just wrong. There is never a need for a stranger to know a veteran’s medical history. In fact, the ADA doesn’t even allow staff in stores or restaurants to ask people with a service animal what their disability is. They are permitted two questions: Is the service animal required because of a disability? and What work or task has it been trained to perform? If veterans don’t have to disclose their disabilities in those situations, why would they ever make themselves vulnerable by blurting it out to strangers on the street?

The disabled veteran community has a slogan, Paws Off Please (POP), designed to educate people about interacting with the service animals that are becoming more and more commonplace in public. So, lesson one: If a dog has a vest on, that means it’s working; don’t pay attention to it.

But, please, don’t ever ignore the veterans. Instead, be sure to thank them for their service.

Dean Winslow, a professor at Stanford University and retired Air Force colonel, made his remarks during his confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Armed Service committee, according to the Washington Examiner.

“I may get in trouble with other members of the committee just say how insane it is that in the United States of America a civilian can go out and buy a semi-automatic like an AR-15, which apparently was the weapon that was used,” Winslow said. “I think that's an issue not as much for this committee, but elsewhere.”

Winslow was responding to a question from Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who asked whether service members with domestic violence convictions, such as Devin Patrick Kelley, should receive a dishonorable discharge or bad conduct discharge from the military.

Kelley used a Ruger AR-55 rifle to kill 26 and wound more than a dozen at the First Baptist Church in Sunderland Springs on Sunday, police said.

The Air Force said Monday it failed to enter Kelley’s conviction for choking and kicking his wife and striking his young stepson hard enough to fracture his skill into a federal database. It could have prevented him from purchasing the firearm he used in Sunday’s massacre.

“It’s a combination of laziness and people being overworked,” a former Air Force Office of Special Investigations agent told Fox News.

The Air Force is required by the Pentagon to report the info. The Lautenberg Amendment, enacted by Congress in 1996, helps prohibit people convicted of domestic violence from purchasing firearms.

The president’s role in campaigns will clearly continue to be a critical issue as we approach the 2018 midterm elections.","The results are in and New Jersey and Virginia have elected new Democratic governors.

In New Jersey, former Goldman Sachs executive and Ambassador to Germany Phil Murphy expectedly defeated Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno by an estimated margin of as many as 14 points, and in Virginia, Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam defeated former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie by an estimated 7-to-8-point margin.

Surely, New Jersey’s swing to a Democratic governor is a product of an unpopular outgoing Republican governor, Chris Christie, and President Trump’s unpopularity in the state as well.

Further, outgoing Republican Governor Christie has the dubious status as New Jersey’s least popular governor in recorded history, reaching all-time low approval ratings of 15 percent.

The president’s role in campaigns will clearly continue to be a critical issue as we approach the 2018 midterm elections.

This has greatly impacted Guadagno’s support in the campaign, as a recent Monmouth poll found that Guadagno’s association with Christie made 29 percent of voters less likely to vote for her, almost double the 16 percent who said her association made them more likely to vote for her.

To be clear, Murphy’s win will be an important pick up for the Democratic Party, but a win in what can be described as the Democrats’ backyard is not a major development in the national landscape.

In Virginia, the race between Northam and Gillespie proved to be both close and contentious, and will be the 2017 gubernatorial contest that is more thoroughly scrutinized by analysts in both parties as the 2018 midterm elections approach.

In the now seemingly reliable blue state, the Real Clear Average in the days leading up to Election Day indicated that Northam held a more than 3-point advantage over Gillespie, which Northam seemingly more than doubled in the final tallies.

As the initial exit polls indicate, minorities turned out at higher than anticipated rates, coming out in support of Northam and, to the extent President Trump was a factor in the election, he was a major negative to Gillespie’s candidacy.

Further, Northam margined to limit his losses throughout the reliably red counties throughout Southern and Western Virginia.

Most encouragingly, Northam campaigned on a moderate platform and offered the type of alternative agenda that the Democratic party must advance in order to succeed in 2018 and beyond.

To be sure, this victory alone does not change the disorder that was made abundantly clear in Donna Brazile’s recent revelations about the relationship between the DNC and Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Throughout the course of the Virginia campaign, Northam was never beholden to the Democratic party’s loudest, most liberal voices, as evidenced by his shift on sanctuary cities just last week. In fact, he defeated the progressive base’s preferred choice in the June primary.

Northam put forward a well-structured economic plan, involving job training and re-training, as well as advancing the Democratic party’s tradition values in the areas of women’s issues and gun violence prevention.

In terms of Gillespie’s campaign, the injection of nationalist sentiment and features of a culture war contributed to the negative nature of the campaign.

The role of the Trump administration with the Gillespie campaign was a tenuous one, despite Gillespie at times trying to distance himself from the president, even though many of the president’s policies and law-and-order rhetoric are in line with his own.

After all, Gillespie did indeed receive a public endorsement from Vice President Mike Pence and consistent support via Twitter from President Trump.

The president’s role in campaigns will clearly continue to be a critical issue as we approach the 2018 midterm elections.

For the Democrats in particular, it is now time to embrace alternatives and centrism in the style of Ralph Northam. Otherwise, the party will struggle to build on these first steps toward regaining power.","Big lessons learned from Virginia, New Jersey governor's races",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/07/big-lessons-learned-from-virginia-new-jersey-governors-races.html

Tax reform is not about numbers.","Mothers have enough to worry about without being thrown into the ever-present Mommy Wars – those endless debates about whether being a stay-at-home mother is harder than being a mom who works outside of the home. Let us all agree that parenting is both rewarding and incredibly difficult.

While moms may spend more time discussing potty training or social media and phone privileges, the family tax bill is an ever-present issue due to its direct impact on the family budget. Why? Because kids are so darn expensive.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that it will cost about $234,000 in 2015 dollars to raise a child until he or she is 17 years old. That is not even including college. Child care costs are big-ticket items on this list.

Care.com, with New America, found the national average for the annual cost of child care is 31 percent of the median household income. The average cost of day care in the country is just under $200 per week per child. Hiring an after-school sitter for about 15 hours a week averages $214 per week. Employing a nanny is about $556 per week. This is the average – if you live in New York, California or Washington, D.C., you’ll likely pay more.

These are the kinds of costs that make families think twice about having more children – or any children at all. Mothers (and fathers) stay up at night worrying about the quality of care their children receive while they work to keep food on the table. And low-income and middle-class families are hit the hardest.

About three-quarters of all Americans believe it is better for families to have one parent home with children and just over 40 percent of American families strive to make that happen, either with a parent or close relative taking care of their young children. The word “strive” paints an accurate picture of the 10.4 million stay-at-home moms, because despite pervasive stereotypes, the majority of them are not wealthy women.

This is not about government coming to the rescue, but rather families keeping more of their hard-earned dollars. Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple. Abraham Lincoln stated: “The strength of a nation lies in the homes of its people.”

A pro-family tax structure encourages families to grow and allows parents the choice of staying at home to care for their children or getting a paying job. This freedom helps families build safe and secure homes, which in turn benefits the country as a whole.

On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.

Child care subsidies can help with the expensive costs of day care and the like. But their benefits are limited to a small subset of the families that use those facilities, and not families that have a parent who stays home or families that are able to rely on other family members for full- or part-time child care.

Both political parties should be commended for wanting to meaningfully work on the federal level to help enable families choose the best option for quality care for their children, while working towards prosperity and a better life. But the solution cannot be more money thrown at problems that instead need thoughtful and creative ideas to benefit as many Americans as possible.

By increasing the child tax credit – now up to $1,000 annually for each child 16 and under – to a maximum of $2,500 a year per child, hardworking lower-income and middle-class parents will get the relief they need, putting more of their own money directly into their pockets.

This money will not just be available for child care but also for food, shelter and educational options like supplemental tutoring or sports programs. This ultimately has a multiplied impact – helping more families and allowing parents more choices, while encouraging economic equality.

President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Both would like to ensure that this reform is pro-family, because they understand that tax relief for families is an investment in America’s future.

As a mother who has both stayed at home and worked part-time or full-time, it is obvious that the more choices we have to provide for our families the better. Sadly, some moms do not have the opportunity to choose.

Congress should seize this historic opportunity to truly reform the tax system and make it pro-family. As part of that effort, forgotten families with children should be allowed to keep more of their own paychecks. This is an opportunity to make a life-changing difference in the lives of American families that are working hard every day to make ends meet.

Families are the crucial social institution tasked with safety and security and the inculcation of skills and values that create healthy, productive citizens necessary for the future of a thriving nation.

The television plays a crucial part in our day-to-day lives, so it’s important to keep its placement in mind when planning out a room. Given the shape and massive size of today’s TVs, the big screen has become a massive eyesore without many places to go other than smack dab in the center of a wall. If this is sounds familiar, get ready to get inspired by these three inventive tricks to hide your TV in plain sight.

1. Camouflage it with a black wall. One lone rectangular block of black in a room can create a striking feature that is unfavorable in many designs. By extending the dark hue across a bigger space, you can create a fun accent wall and play down the glaring, shiny black electronic screen. All it requires is a bucket of paint from your local hardware store and a little know-how on basic painting techniques.

If a full black wall is too bold for your design taste, painting just the horizontal strip of the wall that the TV occupies is a nice compromise. Then, you can balance the room with black home decor pieces. Keep it minimal with a black-and-white palette or add some color to lighten the look.

2. Pair it alongside other appliances. If you’re faced with the scenario of having two or more gaping black holes in your room, the best solution may be to simply combine them as an intentional arrangement instead of an odd-one-out situation. For example, you can juxtapose a fireplace with a TV above the mantel. Get a gallery look by hanging similarly-sized pieces, such as a cabinet or oversized artwork. Alternatively, if you enjoy watching television in the kitchen while you prepare or eat dinner, nestle it in with other appliances, such as an oven or wine fridge.

Be sure to take some safety measures when displaying electronics above appliances. Protect your TV from rising heat by mounting it above a mantel or enclosing it in a well-ventilated cabinet. Also make sure the television is still at a comfortable viewing angle to reduce neck strain or consider investing in a flexible wall mount.

3. Invest in built-ins. This is a more customized approach to hiding a TV. Sliding doors, swiveling panels and folding cabinets are carefully measured to the device for a sleek disguise. One of the simpler strategies is to cover the TV with sliding doors that can be matched to the rest of your wall or stand out as an interesting focal point. Other popular ideas include a snug art panel that slides to reveal or conceal a TV. Or if you’d rather opt for a cabinet enclosure, you can conceal additional media components, like speakers or game consoles. Although these options are more expensive and time-consuming, they will completely conceal your TV from view. Do your research and consult an experienced cabinetmaker, electrician or media professional to make the job more manageable.",3 strategies for disguising your TV in plain sight,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/03/3-strategies-for-disguising-your-tv-in-plain-sight.html

On Monday, “The Voice” coach posted an image of text to her Instagram listing the victims of the attack. In her emotional caption, she laments how disgusting such an act is and highlights the shooter as a terrorist and “WHITE AMERICAN MAN!” She later notes that she’s both “disgusted” and “embarrassed” by her country for not taking action on gun violence.

The post received a lot of attention, prompting the star to write another. In the second one, she calls out Trump and his reaction to the tragedy.

“I'd like to believe that EVERY person who takes the life of another being is ‘mentally ill,’” she said, quoting the president’s words. “It's hard to conceptualize that a sane human could commit such a hideous crime. BUT I am sorry Donald Trump this absolutely is a ‘GUNS SITUATION.’”

The “Wrecking Ball” singer went on after the critics of her previous post who noted that the shooter’s skin color or sex shouldn’t matter. Cyrus noted that she believes things like skin color, gender and religion seem to matter when it comes to labeling terrorist activity.

“DONT START to be all innocent! Gender, race, & religion HAS and continues to matter for all the wrong reasons & that's only the beginning of how backwards this country is!”

Before knowing almost anything about Sunday’s mass public shooting, gun control advocates are once again calling for more gun control. The attack at the First Baptist Church in tiny Sutherland Springs, Texas, claimed 26 lives and left people with an understandable desire to “do something.” One thing is certain: the proposals put forward by gun control advocates wouldn’t have stopped this attack.

What they ignored was what stopped the killer was a good guy with a gun. As one witness said, without the good guy with a gun it “would have been much worse.” If more people were carrying guns, the attack might have been stopped even faster and more lives would have been saved.

Democratic Senators such as Dick Durbin (Ill.), Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), Bob Casey (Pa.), Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), and Kamala Harris (Calif.) all immediately made statements that were various versions of, “Congress must act.”

The media spent all day after the attack rhetorically asking whether now was the time for more gun control. CNN’s Jim Acosta repeatedly asked if President Trump is, “Content . . . with these mass shootings exploding every month or so.”","Texas Shooting: Liberal Media Fixates On Laws That Wouldn't Have Stopped Attack, Ignores Good Guy With Gun",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/07/texas-shooting-liberal-media-fixates-laws-wouldnt-have-stopped-attack-ignores-good-guy

Guests at the 40-seat eatery will reportedly be instructed to disrobe in a coat-check room (or more accurately, an everything-check room) before being brought to their tables. There, they’ll dine on fine French fare including duck foie gras and escargot.

The waiters and kitchen staff, meanwhile, will reportedly keep their clothes on for hygienic reasons.

Diners need not be concerned about curious gawkers out on the sidewalk, either. According to Le Parisien, a heavy curtain will obscure the restaurant’s large street-level windows entirely, and a second set of curtains will prevent people from sneaking a peek into the dining room should someone opens the restaurant’s front door in view of Parisian passersby.

A neighbor also told Le Parisien that the block has no qualms with O’naturel, because everyone knows it’s just a restaurant, and not a sex shop or anything like that.

Last week on “Dr. Oz,” Feldman alleged one of the men who abused him was Jon Grissom, an actor who had small parts in some of Feldman's ‘80s films including ""License to Drive"" and ""Dream a Little Dream.”

Activists recently urged the European Union to take action against Denmark over the Faroe Islands’ whale hunt.","Faroe Islanders have turned the sea red after slaughtering hundreds of whales as part of a centuries-old hunt, which has been harshly criticized by animal rights groups.

The hunts, or “drives” date back to the late 16th century. Authorities on the islands allow islanders to drive herds of pilot whales into shallow waters, where they are killed using a ‘spinal lance’ that is inserted through the animal’s neck to break its spinal cord.

The grisly image shows a hunt on June 16.

The first hunt of this year was on May 21, according to ocean conservation group Sea Shepherd, which claims that 84 pilot whales were killed in the hunt. Hundreds more whales have died in subsequent hunts according to Sea Shepherd, which describes the drives as “incredibly cruel.”

The Faroe Islands are located in the Atlantic Ocean between Iceland and Norway.

According to the Faroese Government, approximately 450 pilot whales have been killed in the Faroe Islands so far this year. Some 295 pilot whales were killed during hunts, which are known as “Grindadrap” in the local language, last year, according to official statistics. Some 501 were killed in 2015, according to official statistics.

A spokesman for the Faroe Islands government told Fox News that whaling in the islands is sustainable and conducted in accordance with international law. “There is no doubt that whale hunts in the Faroe Islands are dramatic and result in a lot of blood in the water,” he explained, via email. “They are, nevertheless, well organised and fully regulated.”

HUGE SEAL BATTLES OCTOPUS IN INCREDIBLE FIGHT TO THE DEATH

The ‘spinal lance’ used to kill the whales was designed by a Faroese veterinarian and ensures that the mammals lose consciousness and die within a few seconds. “Normally, the entire pod of whales is killed in less than fifteen minutes,” the spokesman said. “A rounded blowhole hook is used to haul the whales further up onto the shore.”

The government says that the pilot whale population in the eastern North Atlantic is approximately 778,000, of which around 100,000 are around the Faroes. The Faroese catch around 800 whales a year on average, it says. The long-term annual average catch of pilot whales in the Faroe Islands represents less than 1 percent of the total eastern North Atlantic whale population, according to the spokesman for the Faroe Islands government. “It has long since been internationally recognised that pilot whale catches in the Faroe Islands are fully sustainable,” he said.

The hunts can happen at any time of the year and are noncommercial - meat and blubber from each drive is shared among the local community. The whales are not an endangered species.

KILLER WHALES ARE TORMENTING ALASKAN FISHERMEN

The islands are a self-governing group of islands that is part of Denmark, but are not part of the European Union, where whaling is banned.

Last month officials in the Danish capital Copenhagen had to hose down the city’s famous Little Mermaid statue after it was found doused with red paint in an apparent protest at the Faroe Islands whale hunts. On the ground in front of the statue was written in red, in English, ""Denmark defend the whales of the Faroe Islands.""

Flanagan is an interesting woman. She has won medals in the Olympics and set records at world competitions. She and her husband are foster parents as well, providing a home for teenage twins. She also took time off after a back injury in late winter of last year and was unable to run the Boston Marathon.

She told ESPN in April that she was able to take her first vacation in seven years with her husband and foster children and that “when given lemons, you make lemonade – let’s celebrate the fact that I have time to do this with them. It’s one of the best vacations I’ve ever taken.”

As a wife, foster mother and professional athlete, Flanagan realized she needed the time to heal and take a break from the insane pace of her life. It’s an example of listening to her body, listening to her family, and taking the steps to heal what needed to be healed, instead of continuing to recklessly put pressure on those aspects of life that needed rest. She is working for balance.

But Kristaps said much of the comments were taken out of context and that fans shouldn't be concerned.","It was an end-to-end sequence that brought the crowd at New York’s Madison Square Garden to its feet.

With just under 5 minutes remaining in a Friday night win over the Phoenix Suns, New York Knicks center Kristaps Porzingis raced back on defense for an emphatic block of a shot by Suns rookie Josh Jackson, then raced forward on offense to execute a powerful dunk – and even draw a foul in the process.

""M-V-P! M-V-P!"" rang the chants from the Garden crowd.

Porzingis ended the game with 37 points as New York topped Phoenix, 120-107.

That was just one point shy of the career-high 38 that Porzingis scored just four nights earlier in a win against the Denver Nuggets. And it was his sixth 30-point performance in eight games this season for the 4-4 Knicks.

In other words, Porzingis has been getting the message out across the NBA:

A young star is becoming an even bigger star.

Just months ago, the Knicks seemed to be a team in disarray. Team president and failed messiah Phil Jackson had been jettisoned after an unexpectedly rocky tenure with the club, and hometown favorite player Carmelo Anthony had been shipped off to the Oklahoma City Thunder after nearly seven seasons in New York.

With the marquee names gone, the team was now in the hands of Porzingis, the 7-foot-3, 22-year-old import from Latvia whose arrival in New York via the fourth overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft initially drew groans from fans and the humbling question, “Who?”

But these days Porzingis No. 6 jerseys are an increasingly familiar sight around the streets of Gotham, beginning to replace the fraying No. 7 jerseys with Anthony’s name. (Last season, Forbes ranked Porzingis' jersey as the seventh-best seller, while Anthony's ranked 15th.)

Porzingis is now undeniably the face of the Knicks – and it’s a role he seems to relish. He even appears to enjoy razzing the cross-town rival Brooklyn Nets and their fans.

“Sometimes I see somebody with a Brooklyn hat on, I say, ‘What is that? You need a Knicks hat,’” Porzingis told the New York Daily News in 2015.

But Porzingis’ desire to stay in New York was recently called into question when a Latvian magazine published some comments by his brother, Janis Porzingis, who works for the firm that represents the Knick.

Janis Porzingis cited his brother's dissatisfaction with the Knicks last season, when he skipped his exit interview, and noted that Kristaps would need to be happy to re-sign with the team in the future, even if leaving meant taking less money.

But Kristaps said much of the comments were taken out of context and that fans shouldn't be concerned.

""I think the fans know I'm here in New York, I love New York and I see myself as a Knick for a long, long time,” Porzingis said.

“I don't think they should be worried about it.""

FLORIDA COUPLE GOES TO TACO BELL FOR POST-WEDDING PHOTOSHOOT

Now the cocked-head, wide-mouthed grin has gone viral on Facebook after the photographer, Tony Bendele, posted them to his Facebook.

“I honestly don’t mind having attention on her instead of me. Dutch and Cricket are such a big part of me, and I will always have a special place in my heart for them,” Womer tells Yahoo Lifestyle.

The two horses were a present from her father when she was 8 years old. Her close bond to the two animals and their connection to her father – who passed away in 2016 – prompted her to include them in her wedding. The two escorted Womer up to the ceremony. Dutch, her father’s horse, walked beside Cricket with an empty saddle.

“This just showed that my father was there with me through the whole thing,” Womer, an agriculture science major at Penn State University, said to Yahoo.

Bendele, who has photographed wildlife before, told Yahoo that he’s “never seen a horse doing the smile like that.”

“It actually caught my eye initially when we first started doing the photographs. As the bride was smiling the horse would look up and put its teeth just like that,” he said.

Womer concedes that Cricket isn’t exactly smiling for the cameras.

“Honestly, the horse is just shaking her head trying to get a fly off or something but with her showing her teeth, it looks like she is smiling,” she said.

But people on Facebook have still been enjoying the pictures and many have commented saying they would like to incorporate their own animals into their ceremonies.

To that, Bendele encourages people to make sure they know how their animals will react to large groups and loud sounds.

“We had an experience back in 2016 where we had a bride come down in a carriage and they were going to walk it down the aisle,” he recalls. “As soon as one of the horses got close to the people, somebody had their back turned to it and then turned around and scared it, so it took off and actually flipped the carriage.”

Amazon today (Oct. 25) unveiled the new Amazon Key, an exclusive for Amazon Prime subscribers. The service, which requires several hardware components to work, will allow delivery people to securely enter your home and deliver packages. You can also use Amazon Key to authorize certain people to get into your house, all while being monitored with the company's new Amazon Cloud Cam.

But is Amazon Key safe, and does it come with enough features to make it appealing? Here's what you need to know about Amazon's latest service.

What is Amazon Key?

Amazon Key is a new smart access technology developed by Amazon to allow you to invite people into your home without having to be there. Think of it like the technological equivalent of leaving a key under the mat. Only this time, people can only get in your house when you authorize it, and they'll do so with your smart lock technology.

How does Amazon envision Key working?

Amazon sees a few ways for this to work.

For one, Amazon thinks Key could be useful for delivery people, who instead of leaving your goods outside, can now slip them into your house. Amazon also believes it can be useful if you want to provide a handyman or other people who might be working on your house into the place without your supervision.

Do I need to be a Prime subscriber?

Yep. You'll need to have an Amazon Prime subscription.

What hardware is required?

Amazon Key requires a few things in order to work. For one, you're going to need the company's $120 Cloud Cam (Key Edition) indoor security camera. You'll also want to get an Amazon Key-compatible smart lock from companies like Kwikset or Yale. (Amazon has a guide on what's compatible.)

Finally, you'll need the Amazon Key app, which should be able to communicate with your Cloud Cam and the smart lock and give you full control over the door.

Expect the hardware to set you back $250 on top of that $99-a-year Prime membership.

Where is Amazon Key available?

Amazon isn't offering Key just anywhere. Instead, the company says that the service will be available in select areas to start and then roll out to more locations as time goes on. You can go to the Amazon Key In-Home Kit page to see if your area qualifies.

What kind of door do I need?

Amazon Key works with standard deadbolts that are mounted separately from the handle. However, be aware that your door must be between 1-3/8-inch to 2 inches in thickness in order to work with the smart lock.

Where do I place the Cloud Cam?

Amazon says that Key users should place Cloud Cam is direct view of the door at which people will enter. Ideally, the company said that the Cloud Cam should be within 25 feet of the door.

Should I use Amazon Key with a pet?

Amazon is apparently worried your dog might run away. So no — Amazon doesn't recommend you use Key if your pet can access and run through the door.

What happens on delivery day?

When it's time for a package to be delivered, you'll receive a notification in the morning with a 4-hour delivery window. Before your driver gets to your door, you'll receive an ""Arriving Now"" alert that will allow you to see what's happening in real time.

Once the driver is at your door, he or she will knock on your door and then place a request to unlock it with an Amazon-provided handheld scanner. Amazon will then ensure that the package belongs at your house and that the driver is near your door. Amazon will also turn on Cloud Cam and start recording.

If everything checks out, Amazon will unlock the door and give the driver access to your house to drop the package. The driver will alert Amazon to completing the delivery and will request the door be locked.

You will then receive a notification saying the door is locked, and you can watch the video clip to ensure everything went smoothly.

What's the Happiness Guarantee?

To allay some fears, Amazon is offering what it calls the ""Amazon Key Happiness Guarantee."" If for some reason the delivery wasn't completed to your satisfaction, Amazon will ""work with you to correct the problem."" Amazon will, however, need some proof and video from the delivery to verify whatever it is you might be claiming in the complaint.",Amazon Key lets delivery people in your house: Is it safe?,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/11/08/amazon-key-lets-delivery-people-in-your-house-is-it-safe.html

Before knowing almost anything about Sunday’s mass public shooting, gun control advocates are once again calling for more gun control.

What they ignored was what stopped the killer was a good guy with a gun. As one witness said, without the good guy with a gun it “would have been much worse.” If more people were carrying guns, the attack might have been stopped even faster and more lives would have been saved.

Democratic Senators such as Dick Durbin (Ill.), Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), Bob Casey (Pa.), Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), and Kamala Harris (Calif.) all immediately made statements that were various versions of, “Congress must act.”

The media spent all day after the attack rhetorically asking whether now was the time for more gun control.

People often ask me what one word describes Billy Graham’s distinctive witness.","As renowned evangelist the Rev. Billy Graham celebrated his 99th birthday Tuesday, I thanked the Lord for Graham’s inspiration and influence on so many lives – including mine – and for God’s faithfulness and favor in continuing to preserve Graham to fulfill God’s purpose at this life-stage.

During more than 60 years of crusade ministry, Graham faithfully proclaimed a timeless message in a timely way at the intersection of faith and culture. But he did more than just preach the Gospel. He lived it daily in his walk with the Lord.

Over the nearly 34 years we worked together while I was privileged to serve as his personal media spokesman, Graham modeled for me and countless others that the principles of Jesus that one lifts up and lives out are far more powerful than the mere words one says. And that is the greatest sermon I have ever heard, and will always remember.

Over the past 10 days, I have been traveling with a delegation of American Evangelicals in Egypt and Jordan, the land of Abraham. For the Old Testament patriarch, his later years were arguably his most productive, as “…from that one man, so many people came that they were like stars in the sky” (Hebrews 11:12).

People often ask me what one word describes Billy Graham’s distinctive witness. I have to use three: faithfulness (to his calling,) authenticity (the same person one-on-one as in the pulpit) and integrity (doing the right thing, beyond doing things right).

Abraham first responded in obedience to God’s call on his life at the mature age of 75. When he was 99-years-old, as Graham is now, Abraham received some surprising news. God made a covenant with him in his advanced years that he would become the father of nations. What faith it must have required for him to trust God’s at that point in his life!

I am reminded of, and thankful for, the similar faith Graham has exhibited through the years, when it may have seemed that God was asking the impossible of him. But much like Abraham, time and again he stepped out in obedience, following God’s call when the way didn’t seem clear.

Just as Abraham had many physical descendants, Billy Graham’s passion for souls and devotion to his evangelistic calling has resulted in countless spiritual descendants who look to him as their father or grandfather in the faith.

Graham never veered from his calling to faithfully preach the Gospel. As someone who had a front row seat for more than three decades observing all God accomplished around the world through his faithfulness, there has been no greater representative for the Christian faith.

People often ask me what one word describes Billy Graham’s distinctive witness. I have to use three: faithfulness (to his calling,) authenticity (the same person one-on-one as in the pulpit) and integrity (doing the right thing, beyond doing things right).

One of the distinctive qualities of his ministry was his ability to make positive points for the Gospel in any media situation, and in doing so God honored his faithfulness.

Graham never sacrificed the long-term viability of his ministry for the short-term visibility of media publicity and promotion. Rather, he understood and cultivated the character and calling that came with his station. He sought platforms for his message, not publicity for his ministry, to communicate biblical truth beyond audiences that attended his crusades.

Hebrews 11 reminds us that the prophet Enoch was commended as “one who pleased God.” I can’t help but imagine that is what the Lord thinks of Graham, as a result of his “well-done” fidelity to God’s calling on his life for more than 60 years.

Like the other “great cloud of witnesses” who lived by faith, no doubt at this life-stage the evangelist is also longing for all God has planned and promised in his “heavenly country.” Meanwhile, our nation groans under the weight of the battle for its collective soul, and could benefit from his sage wisdom and spiritual insight as in years past.

Things of this world are measured in minutes, hours, days and years. But what a comfort it is to read in Psalm 31:15 that says “my times are in Your hands.…” We will have as many birthdays as the Lord planned for us from the beginning of eternity.

Everyone who knows Billy Graham’s name continues to pray that God will give him many more years, and that his extraordinary life and the transferable ministry principles of his unique legacy will continue to inspire current and future generations.",Billy Graham has many spiritual descendants as he turns 99,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/07/billy-graham-has-many-spiritual-descendants-as-turns-99.html

When you’re getting dressed in the morning, you look for a shirt in your closet – not your refrigerator. When you want to go out to dinner, you look for a restaurant – not a dentist’s office. And when you’re a cop looking for radical Islamic terrorists … well, let’s just say you don’t look in a convent, a monastery or a rabbinical seminary.

But there’s also no question that a small subset of Muslims in this country don’t fit the above description, because they support the aims of radical Islamic terrorists.

Elizabeth Thomas disappeared from her home in Tennessee with her teacher, Tad Cummins, in mid-March, sparking the massive search, police said. Investigators received more than 1,500 tips from people following the case, and the two eventually were spotted in mid-April in a remote county in northern California.

Speaking at a fast-food restaurant in Columbia, Tenn. on Saturday, Thomas told The Daily Herald that “there’s been a lot of rumors about me I’d like to clear up.”

Thomas said she was in therapy after she returned home, but said it was for “way too long,” adding she “should not have been up there.”

Before Thomas was reported missing, emails discovered between the student and Cummins showed the two had what investigators labeled a “romantic interest in each other.”

The two were once caught kissing in school, according to reports. Both Thomas and Cummins denied kissing, according to the school’s investigative files.

Cummins has pleaded not guilty to charges including transporting a minor across state lines with the intent to commit illegal sexual acts. He's set to face trial in January, the Tennessean reports.

A significant detail was inadvertently included in a Vincent van Gogh painting, but with scholars and art lovers alike it was crickets for 128 years.

A grasshopper, that is.

Researchers looking closely at Vincent van Gogh’s “Olive Trees” painting have discovered part of a grasshopper that has been trapped in the paint for more than a century.

“Van Gogh worked outside in the elements,” Julián Zugazagoitia, director of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, which houses the painting, told the Kansas City Star. She added that “we know that he...dealt with wind and dust, grass and trees, and flies and grasshoppers.”

Van Gogh completed “Olive Trees” in St. Remy, France, and the grasshopper – which is missing its thorax and abdomen – was found after a researcher looked at the painting’s brush strokes under a microscope. The inspection was part of a project to analyze the museum’s 104 French paintings.

“But just go and sit outdoors, painting on the spot itself!” van Gogh wrote in an 1885 letter to his brother, Theo, according to the Kansas City Star. “Then all sorts of things like the following happen — I must have picked up a good hundred flies and more off the 4 canvases that you’ll be getting, not to mention dust and sand.”

LiAngelo Ball, brother of Los Angeles Lakers’ star point guard Lonzo Ball and son of the outspoken LaVar Ball, was one of three UCLA freshman basketball players arrested on Tuesday after allegedly stealing from a Louis Vuitton store in Hangzhou, China.

The players were in the city of Hangzhou preparing for their season-opener in Shanghai. It is unclear what the players allegedly stole. Louis Vuitton is world famous for its high-end bags and accessories.

Ball was arrested with teammates Cody Riley and Jalen Hill. They are being questioned by police for allegedly shoplifting from the store next to their hotel, according to ESPN. The players did not travel with the team on Wednesday, the report said.

Shoplifting in China can carry a prison sentence between three and 10 years in prison. It and could take prosecutors over a month to decide whether to press charges, reported Yahoo.

If that is the case, the three student athletes are in jeopardy of missing a handful of games regardless of whether they are indicted.

“We are aware of a situation involving UCLA student-athletes in Hangzhou, China. The University is cooperating fully with local authorities on this matter, and we have no further comment at this time,” UCLA said in a statement.

LaVar Ball, the player's father, was originally scheduled to address the media Tuesday, but was later advised not to comment publicly on the matter according to ESPN.

Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott released the following statement on the incident, “Whether in the United States or abroad, we expect our student-athletes to uphold the highest standards. We will continue to closely monitor the situation.""

Three players for the Yellow Jackets were also questioned regarding the incident, but were later cleared and have since rejoined the team.

The bike also features a rather novel, yet somewhat odd, piece of technology. At the front of the CB4 Interceptor Concept sits a fan, which uses wind power to generate energy. Said energy specifically powers a touchscreen unit embedded into the CB4 Interceptor's tank. Honda says the screen can handle GPS navigation, emergency phone calls, and general connectivity features. The brand also touts the wind-powered generator as green technology, though it seems a bit redundant if the bike already has a standard charging system. Nonetheless, it is neat, especially how designers integrated the unit into the front headlight.

From what Honda shared, the motorcycle is merely a design exercise and doesn't necessarily preview any future product or technology, so don't look for CB4 Interceptors on the road anytime soon.

""He loved to fly,"" Sheriff Chris Nocco said of Halladay, an eight-time All-Star and two-time Cy Young Award winner.
Halladay won the Cy Young Award twice, once in 2003 with the Blue Jays and again in 2010 with the Phillies.
During that 2010 season, Halladay went 21-10 for the Phillies with a 2.44 ERA.
In addition to winning the Cy Young Award, Halladay finished sixth in the voting for National League MVP.","Former Major League Baseball pitcher Roy Halladay was killed Tuesday when a small plane he was piloting crashed in the Gulf of Mexico off the west coast of Florida. He was 40 years old.

The Pasco County Sheriff’s Office said Halladay was the only person on board the ICON A5 when it went down in shallow water shortly after noon off New Port Richey. No mayday calls were made to Tampa air traffic controllers.

""He loved to fly,"" Sheriff Chris Nocco said of Halladay, an eight-time All-Star and two-time Cy Young Award winner. ""He talked about his family, baseball and flying.""

In a statement, the sheriff's office described Halladay as ""an incredible friend,"" noting that the former pitcher had donated money for the department to purchase a K9 officer. The dog was named ""Doc,"" a nod to Halladay's nickname.

Halladay was an amateur pilot who often posted on social media about small planes. ICON aircraft had posted a video with Halladay trying out a new plane.

Halladay pitched for 16 years in the major leagues with the Toronto Blue Jays and the Philadelphia Phillies before retiring following the 2013 season.

""We are numb over the very tragic news about Roy Halladay's untimely death,"" the Phillies said in a statement. ""There are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game.""

Current and former players responded with an outpouring of emotion on social media. Vernon Wells, a former Blue Jays teammate, called Halladay ""one of the best to ever do it.""

Halladay won the Cy Young Award twice, once in 2003 with the Blue Jays and again in 2010 with the Phillies. Only five other pitchers have won the award in both the American and National Leagues, and three of those – Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez and Gaylord Perry – are in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

During that 2010 season, Halladay went 21-10 for the Phillies with a 2.44 ERA. In addition to winning the Cy Young Award, Halladay finished sixth in the voting for National League MVP. He pitched the 20th perfect game in MLB history on May 29 of that year against the Marlins and followed that up with a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds in Game 1 of the National League Division Series.

In an era where starting pitchers went deep into games less frequently, Halladay threw 67 career complete games -- including 20 shutouts -- and was the active leader in that category when he retired.

Other baseball players to die in plane crashes included Pittsburgh Pirates star Roberto Clemente in a relief mission from Puerto Rico traveling to earthquake victims in Nicaragua on New Year's Eve in 1972; New York Yankees catcher Thurman Munson piloting his own plane near his home in Canton, Ohio, in 1979; and Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle piloting his own plane in New York City in 2006.

The move, beginning in 2015, allowed Apple to continue to avoid paying billions of dollars in taxes.
That is much less than the 12.5 percent Irish corporate tax rate and the 35 percent top US corporate tax rate.
That search led to the Jersey island offices of the Appleby law firm, a business whose main goal was to help wealthy individuals and companies legally avoid taxes.
“Apple believes every company has a responsibility to pay its taxes, and as the largest taxpayer in the world, Apple pays every dollar it owes in every country around the world,” the statement reads.","Apple quietly sidestepped a crackdown on its much-maligned Ireland tax avoidance practice by moving its overseas operation to the tax haven of the Channel Island of Jersey, documents leaked from an offshore law firm revealed.

The move, beginning in 2015, allowed Apple to continue to avoid paying billions of dollars in taxes.

Apple, the most valuable and most profitable company in the world, had been paying a corporate income tax of 5 percent or less thanks to a loophole in US and Ireland tax law, according to reports.

That is much less than the 12.5 percent Irish corporate tax rate and the 35 percent top US corporate tax rate.

The loophole, known as the “double Irish,” is perfectly legal.

The overseas operations of the Cupertino, Calif., company were based in Ireland and all of its non-US sales were funneled through that office.

But beginning in 2013, the European Union began an investigation of Apple’s “double Irish.”

So Apple quietly searched for a new tax-friendly home for its international HQ.

That search led to the Jersey island offices of the Appleby law firm, a business whose main goal was to help wealthy individuals and companies legally avoid taxes.

Apple, in several emails, asked the law firm about moving its Ireland headquarters to the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Mauritius, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey, according to the leaked documents, known as the Paradise papers.

In the emails, Apple made it clear it wanted to keep the move secret, according to the BBC, which reported on the leaked emails.

“For those of you who are not aware, Apple [officials] are extremely sensitive concerning publicity,” one email read.

“They also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know.”

The Channel Island of Jersey, a UK dependency, sets its own tax laws. The corporate rate for foreign companies is zero percent, the BBC reported.

In 2017, Apple earned $44.7 billion outside the US and paid just $1.65 billion in taxes, the BBC reported

Apple, in a statement on Monday, said it pays every tax dollar it owes.

“Apple believes every company has a responsibility to pay its taxes, and as the largest taxpayer in the world, Apple pays every dollar it owes in every country around the world,” the statement reads.

“We’re proud of the economic contributions we make to the countries and communities where we do business.”

A German newspaper was leaked more than 13 million documents from the law firm. They were reviewed and released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

Apple has more than $250 billion in profits on the island of Jersey.

“Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for. Don’t forget, Republicans won 4 out of 4 House seats, and with the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before!” Trump tweeted from Seoul, South Korea on Tuesday night, minutes after the gubernatorial race was called for Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam.

The president repeatedly had urged voters to support Gillespie leading up to Tuesday's vote. The Republican nominee, though, kept a certain distance from the president throughout the campaign, even as he adopted some of the president's tough immigration policies.

But while Gillespie tried to strike a balance in the swing state -- the only southern state Trump lost in last year's presidential election -- Democrats worked hard to tie Gillespie to the president at every turn.

One controversial ad showed minority children seemingly being chased by a driver in a pickup truck, decked out with a Confederate flag and a “Gillespie for governor” bumper sticker. The ad concluded with a scene of a Charlottesville-like rally, with a narrator asking: “Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the ‘American Dream?’”

The ad was removed after extensive backlash.

Other mailers from Northam’s camp boasted that he is “standing up to Trump and Gillespie’s politics of fear and hate.”

Northam campaigned with Democratic power players like former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden and even had a fundraiser headlined by Hillary Clinton.

Meanwhile, Gillespie garnered Republican support with a fundraiser hosted by former President George W. Bush. He was also joined by Vice President Pence on the campaign trail, but not Trump.

Parton addressed the allegations against her longtime publicist on Twitter late Thursday.

""I've worked with Kirt Webster for many years and he has done a wonderful job. I am hoping that the accusations are not true,"" she tweeted.

A rep for Kid Rock told Fox News the singer was no longer working with Webster days after a former client accused Webster of drugging and sexually assaulting him -- a claim Webster denies.

The rocker, whose real name is Robert Ritchie, told us in a statement he takes accusations of sexual assault and mistreatment of others ""dead seriously.""

""I never witnessed or heard about any of this outside that he was probably gay, which I could care less about.

He added, ""I believe sexual harassment is like cancer. We all know someone affected by it and it has to stop.""

Charlie Daniels told Fox News he had fired Webster.

""""I know absolutely nothing about Kirt Webster's personal life and am not by any means qualified to comment on it. All of our ties with Webster and Associates have been severed and I will have no further comment on the situation,"" he said.

A source close to Travis also told Fox News the country legend had dropped Webster.

Dolly Parton, Charlie Daniels, Billy Ray Cyrus and Justin Moore are no longer listed as clients on the Webster PR website.

Fox News was told Webster will take ""some time away from the business to focus on combating the egregious and untrue allegations made against him.""

While several artists have quietly fired Webster, they have not released statements.

Former client Austin Rick, who performed under the name Austin Cody, told Fox News he suffered months of abuse at the hands of Webster and a former intern told us Webster propositioned him for sex while at work.

Democrats win key gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey. What does this mean for Trump and next year's midterms?

President Trump warns North Korea in Seoul speech: ""Do not underestimate us.""

""Special Report"" interview: DNC Chairman Tom Perez vows to unite party after Donna Brazile allegations

Report: Manhattan DA to seek rape indictment against Harvey Weinstein

THE LEAD STORY: Democrats won Tuesday's hotly contested gubernatorial elections, as Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in Virginia and Phil Murphy beat Republican Kim Guadagno in New Jersey ... The victories -- especially the win in Virginia -- are a shot in the arm to the beleaguered Democratic Party, which has lost four special congressional elections to Republicans since Donald Trump was elected president a year ago. Trump reacted to the results by saying Gillespie, whom he supported, did not adequately embrace him during the race. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez and other Democrats celebrated the wins by saying voters in Virginia and New Jersey ""rejected a Trump-Pence agenda."" In Virginia, a state Trump did not win in the 2016 presidential election, his favorability is underwater: 42 percent favorable to 56 percent unfavorable. Fox News voter analysis found that Trump was an important factor for more than one third (38 percent) of voters, and those folks broke for Northam by a 39-point margin. Critics will debate the implications of Tuesday's election results for Trump and Democrats and Republicans for next year's midterms, but one thing is clear: The president’s role in campaigns will continue to be a key issue.

ELECTION ROUNDUP: Here is a look at other notable election results nationwide ... A former Virginia television news anchor whose reporter girlfriend was shot and killed during a broadcast two years ago won election to the state's House of Delegates Tuesday. Democrat Chris Hurst defeated Republican incumbent Joseph Yost and will represent Virginia's 12th House district in Richmond ... Bill de Blasio was re-elected to a second term as New York City mayor ... John Curtis, the Republican mayor of the Mormon stronghold of Provo, Utah, won a special election Tuesday to replace former U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz ... Democrat Danica Roem unseated Republican Del. Bob Marshall, one of Virginia's longest serving and most socially conservative lawmakers, and will make history as the first openly transgender person elected and seated in a state legislature ... Maine voters approved a measure allowing them to join 31 other states in expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare.

TRUMP TALKS TOUGH IN SEOUL: Speaking in front of South Korea’s National Assembly Wednesday morning, President Trump warned North Korea: ""Do not underestimate us"" ... ""Today, I hope I speak not only for our countries, but for all civilized nations, when I say to the North: Do not underestimate us. And do not try us,"" Trump said. ""We will defend our common security, our shared prosperity, and our sacred liberty,"" the president said. The comments contrasted remarks the Trump made earlier in the week, in which he appeared open to possible talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The speech in South Korea comes amid a 13-day trip to Asia that has already seen the president visit Japan and South Korea with stops in China, Vietnam and the Philippines still on the docket.

Judith Miller: Who worries Korea's leader the most -- Trump or Kim?

BRAZILE-CLINTON CLOUD HANGS OVER DEMS: Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez vowed to unite his party and told ""Special Report"" anchor Bret Baier that voters ""want to move forward"" from the allegations in former DNC boss Donna Brazile's new tell-all book … ""[I] haven’t gotten one question about Donna Brazile,"" Perez said. ""What I’ve gotten from voters is unity. They want to move forward."" Brazile, a former interim DNC chair, alleges in her book that the DNC had struck a deal with Hillary Clinton's campaign, giving it partial control over the party's financial resources. She implies that the agreement gave Clinton a major advantage over Bernie Sanders and other candidates in last year's primary race, though she has since denied claims by Sanders supporters that the primary was rigged against the Vermont democratic socialist. Despite key victories in Tuesday's election, Brazile's allegations, multiple scandals involving Clinton and a deep party divide may dog Democrats into the 2018 midterm campaign season.

CRIMINAL CHARGES IN WEINSTEIN'S FUTURE? The Manhattan district attorney reportedly will seek an indictment against Harvey Weinstein as early as next week — ignoring an NYPD plan to immediately slap the movie mogul in cuffs ... Police had been building a case against the predatory producer for allegedly raping actress Paz de la Huerta twice in 2010, The New York Post reported. Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said last week the department is sharing information with DA Cy Vance’s office and the next step would be to obtain an arrest warrant to pick up Weinstein in Arizona, where he is in rehab. Vance instead plans on presenting a case to a grand jury first and waiting for an indictment, law enforcement sources said.

“I promised myself after that day that I would not stop until I brought justice,” Bajoo said at the forum.
The two testimonials underscore what supporters say is the urgent need for the global community to assist in rebuilding, repopulating and stabilizing the region.
It has been estimated that a dozen Christian families fled Iraq each day during the ISIS occupation of the northern half of the country.","The Vatican is using its U.N. position to challenge the world to rescue Iraq’s and Syria’s Christians and Yazidis, victims of horrendous Islamic State persecution and now on the verge of extinction.

In a U.N. forum sponsored by the Holy See Mission last Thursday titled, “Peace, Reconciliation and Justice for the religious and ethnic minorities victimized by Daesh [ISIS],” two survivors retold the horrors they suffered at the hands of ISIS militants who devastated communities in Syria and in Iraq’s Nineveh Plain.

Ekhlas Khudur Bajoo, a now 17-year-old Yazidi survivor from Iraq, was kidnapped by ISIS when the terror group raided her village in August 2014. The girl, who watched ISIS murder her father, was raped repeatedly and faced humiliation every day during her six-month captivity. She was also sold as a sex slave. She attempted to escape three times and experienced horrific beatings after each time she failed. Finally, on her fourth try, she succeeded.

“I promised myself after that day that I would not stop until I brought justice,” Bajoo said at the forum. “I am fighting for all women, not just Yazidi women -- but for all women of all religions and all groups who are victims of ISIS.”

Bajoo is just one of many who have called on the international community to acknowledge that ISIS persecuted and committed genocide against Christians and Yazidis.

“We want justice and accountability for those perpetrators who raped me and my sisters and took our honor,” she added. “Come and hold my hand. I plead with you to stand with us. We want to feel humanity wipe our tears, to heal our wounds, to bring back the smiles on our faces, and to bring back the girls that are still in captivity.”

One man, who only gave his name as “Gabi” and wore a disguise during a video message because his family’s safety is still threatened in Syria, recalled his one month in ISIS captivity.

He was on a bus from Aleppo when he and two other Christian men were kidnapped, stripped, robbed and interrogated before being held captive where they were psychologically and physically tortured.

“They started beating and kicking me and afterward they scourged me for an hour,” he said during his video, which was recorded in Europe, where he has found refuge.

Four days into his captivity, he was taken to a nearby village where he was to be beheaded in front of a cheering crowd.

“[They were] rejoicing at the killing of an infidel Christian,” he said during the testimony. “I knelt and waited for over 10 minutes to be executed.”

At the last minute, the leader of the ISIS unit allowed him to live if he paid jizya, a tax that ISIS imposed on non-believers. ISIS often used jizya as a form of extortion.

Weeks later, Gabi, who was blindfolded, hands tied and an explosive belt tied around his waist, was finally freed after the ransom was received.

The two testimonials underscore what supporters say is the urgent need for the global community to assist in rebuilding, repopulating and stabilizing the region.

“While we tragically did not stop their sufferings, we can act to bring justice for them and other victims, help them to rehabilitate and rebuild, and do everything we can to prevent similar barbarity from happening to others,” Archbishop Bernardito Auza, permanent observer of the Holy See to the U.N., said in his opening remarks. “While we tragically did not stop their sufferings, we can act to bring justice for them and other victims, help them to rehabilitate and rebuild, and do everything we can to prevent similar barbarity from happening to others.”

The Nineveh Plain, also known as the Plain of Mosul, has been the ancestral homeland of Assyrian-Chaldean-Syriac Christians, Yazidis and other minorities -- all of whom were under attack from ISIS once the terror group started to control the region in 2014.

The Christian population in Iraq has plummeted to 275,000 from 1.5 million in 2003, according to current estimates. It is feared the population could be permanently gone within five years, if no action is taken, according to a November 2015 report from Aid to the Church in Need, an international Catholic charity.

It has been estimated that a dozen Christian families fled Iraq each day during the ISIS occupation of the northern half of the country. Christians who have managed to escape ISIS have fled to Europe and Lebanon. Others simply wandered the region avoiding U.N.-operated refugee camps for fear that Muslim refugees in the camps would target them.

Many of those who have been displaced want to return to their homeland and see the Nineveh Plain as the cradle of their faith. Now, approximately 100,000 are starting to return to villages throughout the region.

“Their history is millennia, but their presence in the region is even older,” Edward Clancy, director of outreach for The Aid to the Church in Need, which also presented at the forum, told Fox News.

Clancy also says that the key to stabilizing the region is an estimated $250 million, with $125 million to rebuild the villages and cities left decimated by ISIS and the other half going toward creating institutional structures like schools and hospitals and rebuilding infrastructure.","ISIS victims in Iraq, Christians and Yazidi, desperately need global aid, Vatican says",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/08/isis-victims-in-iraq-christians-and-yazidi-desperately-need-global-aid-vatican-says.html

The juror also asked U.S. District Judge William Walls for a transcript of the closing argument delivered by Menendez’s attorney.

Walls denied both requests and told the jurors to rely on their “individual and collective memories” of both the closing argument and the definition of a senator, Bloomberg reported.

In his closing arguments in the case, Menendez’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, argued that Menendez had not taken bribes from wealthy Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen.

While Lowell conceded that Menendez and Melgen did favors for one another as friends, he insisted that Menendez never advanced legislation or improperly took official acts for Melgen’s benefit.

Prosecutors charge that Melgen, who is not one of Menendez’s constituents, provided Menendez with luxury jet travel, extravagant vacations, and more than $750,000 in campaign funding in exchange for helping the eye doctor’s business through various official acts.

In August 2009, for example, prosecutors charged that Menendez emailed his chief of staff to see “who has the best juice” at the Department of Health to help Melgen out of an $8.9 million Medicare bill.

And prosecutors alleged that Menendez pressured officials to authorize visas for Melgen’s four girlfriends.

Maryland State Police reportedly found 50 photos and one video match the victims’ description on electronic devices they confiscated from Parker.

Parker taught family and consumer science at the school and was placed on administrative leave after the sheriff’s office received reports of her misconduct, Fox 5 DC reported. The school’s principal said she was then temporarily assigned to an administrative building.

Democrats rode to victory in Tuesday's hotly contested gubernatorial elections, as Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in Virginia and Phil Murphy beat Republican Kim Guadagno in New Jersey.

The victories -- especially the win in Virginia -- are a shot in the arm to the beleaguered Democratic Party, which has lost four special congressional elections to Republicans since Donald Trump was elected president a year ago.

Turner, who has been in the public eye thanks to her role as Sansa Stark since she was 15 years old, had a lot to say about adults camping outside the hotels of the cast, which consists mostly of children.

Contrary to popular belief, it's not just those who sit up front that get top-notch service.

One flight attendant has revealed that backseat passengers are likely to receive VIP treatment — purely due to their location on the aircraft.

5 EXPERT TIPS FOR GETTING THROUGH THE AIRPORT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

Air stewardess Annie Kingston says that passengers sitting at the front of the plane can disembark first, and have a better chance of securing their preferred meal option. But if you're seated at the back, you can expect the most attentive service.

Why? It's similar to giving one child a lollipop in full view of his or her playmates. Give one person a treat, and everyone wants one.

The passengers at the back of the plane are seen by less fellow travellers, so if they get slipped an extra drink or a set of earplugs, it's more likely to go unnoticed.

""We like to avoid responding to call bells from the front of the plane because answering one means potentially flaunting whatever item the passenger has requested to everyone else along the way,"" Kingston said in a blog post for Oyster.com.

LUGGAGE GO MISSING AT THE AIRPORT? HERE'S WHAT TO DO

""This can cause a problem since planes often don't have enough extra vodka, pillows, earplugs, and toothbrushes, or the time on shorter flights to deviate from the service schedule.

""For passengers sitting near the back of the plane, however, it's much easier to slip in that second mini bottle of wine.""

Flight attendant and author of FlyerTalk Amanda Pleva agreed in an interview with Sun Online Travel. ""Do passengers get better service at the back of the plane? Absolutely! Usually we end up having more of a rapport with the people seated in the last row or two because we have finished our service and things have slowed down.

The Lamborghini Terzo Millenio was unveiled in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and in the automaker’s hometown of Sant’Agata Bolognese, Italy. It is the first result of a partnership between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the exclusive carmaker.

It also represents the first solid step toward a future all-electric supercar from Lamborghini, although CEO Stefano Domenicali told journalists in March at the 2017 Geneva motor show that future may be some ways off.

“Electrification is an area of great attention for us, but I‘m not expecting it will happen in the short term,” Domenicali told Reuters. Domenicali also ruled out an all-electric car before 2025.

Trading batteries for supercapacitors and lightweight aluminum with self-healing, energy-storing carbon fiber, the Terzo Millennio is full of pie-in-the-sky technology promises, but its declaration is clear: some future Lamborghinis will run solely on electrons.

Supercar supercapacitors

According to the automaker, developing supercapacitors may be the key to unlocking rapid charging and discharging cycles for future supercars—perhaps skipping conventional batteries altogether.

Lamborghini is mum about the energy density required from supercapacitors to deliver enough storage to power a car like the Terzo Millennio, but it said that using body panels and other parts of the car to act as improvised energy storage panels may be the key.

“The new Lamborghini collaboration allows us to be ambitious and think outside the box in designing new materials that answer energy storage challenges for the demands of an electric sport vehicle,” MIT chemistry Professor Mircea Dinca said in a statement.

In addition to energy storing body panels, MIT professors and Lamborghini say that the carbon fiber structure in the Terzo Millennio may be able to identify and “heal” small cracks in its substructure, presumably with liquid-filled micro-channels in its construction. Little cracks can become big cracks, according to the automaker, and a small measure of self-healing can prevent sudden failure—a problem with carbon fiber.

But even Wolverine needs power, too, however, and for that Lamborghini said that the Terzo Millennio is equipped with four electric motors, one at each wheel. All-wheel drive will still be a hallmark with future electric vehicles, Lamborghini said in the statement.

Sooner than we think?

An element of the Terzo Millennio that may not take a generation to develop could be the car’s “Piloted Driving” systems.

So-called “roboracers” aren’t new, but Lamborghini said that its Terzo Millennio could be loaded with an ideal line around a racetrack such as Imola, shuttle its driver around the track first, then act as a virtual ghost car for successive laps.

The technology has appeared in other VW-parent products such as an Audi RS 7 that lapped the Hockenheimring in Germany and an Audi TTS that made an autonomous run up Pikes Peak in the U.S.

Neither car has the same low, menacing profile that the Lamborghini sports, a signal that the automaker’s avant garde shape will continue well into the “third millennium” that the Terzo Millennio purports to herald for the automaker.","Lamborghini Terzo Millennio concept electric car unveiled, hints at Lambo's future",https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/11/06/lamborghini-terzo-millennio-concept-electric-car-unveiled-hints-at-lambos-future.html

Director Rory Karpf, in a documentary, followed the career of Flair, 68, and revealed the lifestyle of one of the most influential men in the wrestling business.

Flair, who has been married four times, said that his public persona intertwined with his private life, resulting in sleeping with more than 10,000 women during his lifetime and having a strong alcohol addiction, the USA Today reported.

Flair said he used to consume as many as 10 beers and five alcoholic cocktails a day for decades while travelling from show to show. He recalled telling a psychiatrist that he drank “at least 10 beers, and probably five mixed drinks” every day – to which the medical professional replied saying, “That’s not possible.”

“I work every day. I drink a beer in the car, I get to the hotel and I drink vodka,” he told the psychiatrist in 1989.

He recalled his relationship with the doctor, “By the time I got through with that son of a (expletive), he was laying on the couch and I was on the chair talking to him,” Flair told the documentary makers.

The alcohol addiction almost proved to be fatal to the wrestler. In August, Flair was placed in a medically induced coma before going for surgery amid kidney failure prompted by excessive drinking over the years.

Doctors reportedly said he had only a 20 percent chance to survive, the New York Daily News reported. ""I wouldn't even begin to think about drinking,” he told the paper. ""If you ever hear that I'm out drinking again, say, 'Ric, you (dummy), you deserve whatever you get.""

Throughout the course of the Virginia campaign, Northam was never beholden to the Democratic party’s loudest, most liberal voices, as evidenced by his shift on sanctuary cities just last week.
The president’s role in campaigns will clearly continue to be a critical issue as we approach the 2018 midterm elections.","The results are in and New Jersey and Virginia have elected new Democratic governors.

In New Jersey, former Goldman Sachs executive and Ambassador to Germany Phil Murphy expectedly defeated Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno by an estimated margin of as many as 14 points, and in Virginia, Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam defeated former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie by an estimated 7-to-8-point margin.

Surely, New Jersey’s swing to a Democratic governor is a product of an unpopular outgoing Republican governor, Chris Christie, and President Trump’s unpopularity in the state as well.

Further, outgoing Republican Governor Christie has the dubious status as New Jersey’s least popular governor in recorded history, reaching all-time low approval ratings of 15 percent.

The president’s role in campaigns will clearly continue to be a critical issue as we approach the 2018 midterm elections.

This has greatly impacted Guadagno’s support in the campaign, as a recent Monmouth poll found that Guadagno’s association with Christie made 29 percent of voters less likely to vote for her, almost double the 16 percent who said her association made them more likely to vote for her.

To be clear, Murphy’s win will be an important pick up for the Democratic Party, but a win in what can be described as the Democrats’ backyard is not a major development in the national landscape.

In Virginia, the race between Northam and Gillespie proved to be both close and contentious, and will be the 2017 gubernatorial contest that is more thoroughly scrutinized by analysts in both parties as the 2018 midterm elections approach.

In the now seemingly reliable blue state, the Real Clear Average in the days leading up to Election Day indicated that Northam held a more than 3-point advantage over Gillespie, which Northam seemingly more than doubled in the final tallies.

As the initial exit polls indicate, minorities turned out at higher than anticipated rates, coming out in support of Northam and, to the extent President Trump was a factor in the election, he was a major negative to Gillespie’s candidacy.

Further, Northam margined to limit his losses throughout the reliably red counties throughout Southern and Western Virginia.

Most encouragingly, Northam campaigned on a moderate platform and offered the type of alternative agenda that the Democratic party must advance in order to succeed in 2018 and beyond.

To be sure, this victory alone does not change the disorder that was made abundantly clear in Donna Brazile’s recent revelations about the relationship between the DNC and Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Throughout the course of the Virginia campaign, Northam was never beholden to the Democratic party’s loudest, most liberal voices, as evidenced by his shift on sanctuary cities just last week. In fact, he defeated the progressive base’s preferred choice in the June primary.

Northam put forward a well-structured economic plan, involving job training and re-training, as well as advancing the Democratic party’s tradition values in the areas of women’s issues and gun violence prevention.

In terms of Gillespie’s campaign, the injection of nationalist sentiment and features of a culture war contributed to the negative nature of the campaign.

The role of the Trump administration with the Gillespie campaign was a tenuous one, despite Gillespie at times trying to distance himself from the president, even though many of the president’s policies and law-and-order rhetoric are in line with his own.

After all, Gillespie did indeed receive a public endorsement from Vice President Mike Pence and consistent support via Twitter from President Trump.

The president’s role in campaigns will clearly continue to be a critical issue as we approach the 2018 midterm elections.

For the Democrats in particular, it is now time to embrace alternatives and centrism in the style of Ralph Northam. Otherwise, the party will struggle to build on these first steps toward regaining power.","Big lessons learned from Virginia, New Jersey governor's races",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/07/big-lessons-learned-from-virginia-new-jersey-governors-races.html

She concedes it’s “not a very nice living situation,” but it also is not unusual. Until authorities told them to move, more than a dozen other RVs filled with people who can’t afford rent joined Saldana on a tree-lined street in Mountain View, parked between a Target and a luxury apartment complex.

Homeless advocates and city officials say it’s outrageous that in the shadow of a booming tech economy — where young millionaires dine on $15 wood-grilled avocado and think nothing of paying $1,000 for an iPhone X — thousands of families can’t afford a home. Many of the homeless work regular jobs, in some cases serving the very people whose sky-high net worth is the reason housing has become unaffordable for so many.

Across the street from Saldana’s camper, for example, two-bedroom units in the apartment complex start at $3,840, including concierge service. That’s more than she brings home, even in a good month.

Saldana and her three adult sons, who live with her, have looked for less rustic accommodations, but rents are $3,000 a month or more, and most of the available housing is distant. She said it makes more sense to stay in the camper near their jobs and try to save for a brighter future, even if a recent city crackdown chased them from their parking spot.

“We still need to eat,” said Saldana, 51. “I still want to bring my kids, once in a while, to a movie, to eat out.”

She cooks and serves food at two hotels in nearby Palo Alto, jobs that keep her going most days from 5 in the morning until 10 at night. Two of her sons, all in their 20s, work at a bakery and pay $700 toward the RV each month. They’re all very much aware of the economic disparity in Silicon Valley.

“How about for us people who are serving these tech people?” Saldana said. “We don’t get the same paycheck that they do.”

It’s all part of a growing crisis along the West Coast, where many cities and counties have seen a surge in the number of people living on the streets over the past two years. Counts taken earlier this year show 168,000 homeless people in California, Oregon and Washington — 20,000 more than were counted just two years ago.

The booming economy, fueled by the tech sector, and decades of under-building have led to a historic shortage of affordable housing. It has upended the stereotypical view of people out on the streets as unemployed: They are retail clerks, plumbers, janitors — even teachers — who go to work, sleep where they can and buy gym memberships for a place to shower.

The surge in homelessness has prompted at least 10 local governments along the West Coast to declare states of emergency, and cities from San Diego to Seattle are struggling to come up with immediate and long-range solutions.

San Francisco is well-known for homeless tent encampments. But the homeless problem has now spread throughout Silicon Valley, where the disparity between the rich and everyone else is glaring.

There is no firm estimate on the number of people who live in vehicles in Silicon Valley, but the problem is pervasive and apparent to anyone who sees RVs lining thoroughfares; not as visible are the cars tucked away at night in parking lots. Advocates for the homeless say it will only get worse unless more affordable housing is built.

The median rent in the San Jose metro area is $3,500 a month, yet the median wage is $12 an hour in food service and $19 an hour in health care support, an amount that won’t even cover housing costs. The minimum annual salary needed to live comfortably in San Jose is $87,000, according to a study by personal finance website GoBankingRates.

So dilapidated RVs line the eastern edge of Stanford University in Palo Alto, and officials in neighboring Mountain View have mapped out more than a dozen areas where campers tend to cluster, some of them about a mile from Google headquarters.

On a recent evening, Benito Hernandez returned to a crammed RV in Mountain View after laying flagstones for a home in Atherton, where Zillow pegs the median value of a house at $6.5 million. He rents the RV for $1,000 a month and lives there with his pregnant wife and children.

The family was evicted two years ago from an apartment where the rent kept going up, nearing $3,000 a month.

“After that, I lost everything,” said Hernandez, 33, who works as a landscaper and roofer.

He says his wife “is a little bit sad because she says, ‘You’re working very hard but don’t have credit to get an apartment.’ I tell her, ‘Just wait, maybe a half-year more, and I’ll get my credit back.'”

The plight of the Hernandez family points out one of the confounding problems of the homeless surge along the West Coast.

“This is not a crisis of unemployment that’s leading to poverty around here,” said Tom Myers, executive director of Community Services Agency, a nonprofit based in Mountain View. “People are working.”

Mountain View, a city of 80,000 which also is home to Mozilla and 23andMe, has committed more than $1 million over two years for homeless services, including money for an outreach case manager and a police officer to help people who live in vehicles. At last count, there were people living in more than 330 vehicles throughout the city.

Mayor Ken Rosenberg is proud of the city’s response to the crisis — focusing not on penalties but on providing services. Yet he’s also worried that the peace won’t last as RVs crowd into bike lanes and over-taxed streets.

Last week, Mountain View officials posted signs banning vehicles more than 6 feet high on some parts of the street where Saldana, Hernandez and others living in RVs were parked, saying they were creating a traffic hazard. The average RV is well over that height.

That follows similar moves over the summer by Palo Alto, which started cracking down on RVs and other vehicles that exceed the 72-hour limit on a busy stretch of El Camino Real.

In San Jose, officials recently approved an ordinance pushed by an interfaith group called the Winter Faith Collaborative to allow places of assembly — including gyms and churches — to shelter homeless people year-round.

Ellen Tara James-Penney, a 54-year-old lecturer at San Jose State University, parks her old Volvo at one of those safe-haven churches, Grace Baptist Church, and eats in its dining hall. She is paid $28,000 a year to teach four English classes and is carrying $143,000 in student debt after earning two degrees.

She grades papers and prepares lessons in the Volvo. At night, she leans back the driver’s seat and prepares for sleep, one of two dogs, Hank, by her side. Her husband, Jim, who is too tall for the car, sleeps outside in a tent cot with their other dog, Buddy.

The Bay Area native remembers the time a class was studying John Steinbeck, when another student said that she was sick of hearing about the homeless.

“And I said, ‘Watch your mouth. You’re looking at one.’ Then you could have heard a pin drop,” she said. “It’s quite easy to judge when you have a house to live in or you have meds when you’re depressed and health care.”

In response to growing wealth inequities, unions, civil rights groups and community organizations formed Silicon Valley Rising about three years ago. They demand better pay and benefits for the low-income earners who make the region run.

SEIU United Service Workers West, for example, organized roughly 3,000 security guards who work for companies that contract with Facebook, Google and Caltrain, the mass transit system that connects Silicon Valley with San Francisco.

One of those workers is Albert Brown III, a 46-year-old security officer who recently signed a lease for half of a $3,400 two-bedroom unit in Half Moon Bay, about 13 miles from his job.

He can barely afford the rent on his $16-an-hour salary, even with overtime, but the car that doubled as his home needed a pricey repair and he found a landlord willing to overlook his lousy credit. Still, Brown worries he won’t be able to keep up with his payments.

His feet have been hurting. What if a doctor tells him to rest for a few days or a week?

“I can’t miss a minute. If I miss a minute or a shift? No way, man. A week? Forget it, it’s over. It’s all downhill from there,” he said.

“It’s a sad choice. I have to decide whether to be homeless or penniless, right?”
