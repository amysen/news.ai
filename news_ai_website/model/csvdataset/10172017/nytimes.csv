tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

The president also said that he will try to talk Mr. Bannon out of at least some plans to field hard-right primary candidates to challenge virtually every Senate Republican seeking re-election next year.

“The relationship is very good. We are fighting for the same thing,” Mr. Trump said during wide-ranging comments to reporters that also touched on immigration, health care, the opioid crisis, Cuba, military deaths and other topics. “We are fighting for lower taxes, big tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts in the history of our nation.”

White House officials described Monday’s lunch with Mr. McConnell as largely focused on efforts to cut taxes, and they said it ended with both men engaged and relaxed — a remarkable feat for two politicians whose personal styles could not be more different.

He’s all about business.”

Mr. Trump mentioned in an aside at the news conference that he would soon outline an economic development plan, though he confessed that he had yet to tell Mr. McConnell about it.

Despite pledges by both men that they share the same agenda, any good will that may have once existed dissolved after the Senate twice failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. After the first defeat in July, Mr. Trump tweeted in August: “Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn’t get it done.”

In another tweet in August, he said, “The only problem I have with Mitch McConnell is that, after hearing Repeal & Replace for 7 years, he failed!”

Privately, Mr. Trump has repeatedly denigrated Mr. McConnell, most recently unloading about the Senate Republican leader during a dinner this month with a group of about a dozen conservative movement leaders in the Blue Room of the White House. According to two people with knowledge of the president’s remarks, he called Mr. McConnell “a weak leader” and said that he remained befuddled at Mr. McConnell’s inability to wrangle the votes needed to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

For his part, aides to Mr. McConnell say that he has been deeply frustrated by Mr. Trump’s willingness to lash out, even as the Senate leader successfully guided the chamber to confirm Mr. Trump’s cabinet and judicial nominations, including the president’s choice of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.

Soon after Mr. Trump took office, Mr. McConnell told associates that the new president had no clear sense of where he stood on most core issues, and he predicted that steering Mr. Trump — and taking the lead on policy — would be relatively easy.

The two disagreed early on political strategy: Mr. McConnell wanted the president to nominate a Democratic senator in a conservative state for a cabinet post to help Republicans pick up a seat. Instead, Mr. Trump plucked Ryan Zinke, a Republican representative from Montana, for the Interior Department, ending Mr. McConnell’s hopes that Mr. Zinke, a popular former Navy SEAL, would challenge Montana’s Democratic senator, Jon Tester, in 2018.

In the months since, Mr. McConnell and his aides have watched Mr. Trump buck the Senate, both publicly and privately.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly hectored Mr. McConnell to scrap Senate rules that require most legislation to clear a 60-vote hurdle before final passage, a demand that the leader has resisted, in part, for fear of a return to Democratic control.

Mr. McConnell has also been taken aback by Mr. Bannon’s decision to start a political crusade against establishment Republicans in the Senate by recruiting candidates who could put at risk the party’s control. So far, Mr. Bannon has backed conservative challengers to Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Dean Heller of Nevada, and could formally back a challenger to Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi.

Mr. McConnell said he was focused on keeping the Senate in Republican hands.

“The way you do that is not complicated,” Mr. McConnell said. “You have to nominate people who can actually win because winners make policy and losers go home.” He added a few moments later, “Our operating approach will be to support our incumbents.”

Mr. Trump said that Mr. Bannon “has been a friend of mine for a long time” and that his former strategist was doing “what Steve thinks is the right thing.”

But with Mr. McConnell standing next to him, the president hinted that he would not entirely support Mr. Bannon’s efforts to throw out of office Republicans who Mr. Bannon does not think are sufficiently supportive of Mr. Trump’s agenda.

“Some of the people that he may be looking at, I’m going to see if we talk him out of that,” the president said.

One person close to Mr. McConnell said Mr. McConnell has been very careful in his public comments about Mr. Trump in part because he did not want to put his wife, Elaine L. Chao — who serves as Mr. Trump’s secretary of transportation — in an awkward position with her boss.

Other advisers to Mr. McConnell said the two men both recognize that Republicans’ fate in 2018 hinges on whether Congress can pass the tax cuts that Mr. Trump is seeking.

“I feel like they are both under so much pressure to deliver — that’s what causes tension, real or imagined,” said Scott Jennings, a former adviser to Mr. McConnell who remains close to the majority leader. “They need to be able to jointly take something back to the voters next year to sell. I think winning on a major policy initiative like tax reform would allow for a further expansion of their relationship on politics.”

That level of cooperation — which has been so vital to the success of past presidents — was in danger of completely unraveling before Monday’s lunch. Over the objections of some of his advisers, the president had grown increasingly unwilling to set aside his insurgent tendencies to make Washington-style deals with Mr. McConnell.

Mr. Trump’s contempt grew even stronger after he backed Mr. McConnell’s preferred candidate last month in a special election in Alabama. That candidate — Senator Luther Strange — lost the election to Roy S. Moore, a defeat that Mr. Trump took personally.

And Mr. McConnell’s closest allies became increasingly aggrieved at the president’s treatment of the leader, especially because they view Mr. McConnell’s refusal to hold hearings for President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee as critical to Mr. Trump’s election.

On Monday, both men sought to minimize the conflict between them in the interest of sending a signal of unity of purpose that could soothe the despair of allies who fear the feud imperils any hopes for the tax and budget legislation before the end of the year.

Final approval is also expected to be given for an additional 459 housing units in the urban settlement of Ma’ale Adumim, east of Jerusalem, though in that case bids for construction still need to be issued.

Oded Revivi, the chief foreign envoy of the Yesha Council that represents the settlers, complained that the amount of building being approved “does not accommodate even the natural growth” of the settler population.

The Trump administration has been more accommodating than its predecessors when it comes to Israeli settlement activity. But it has also called for restraint as it tries to foster a resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process with regional support and a coalition against Iran’s regional ambitions.

“That’s the tension: a government that wants to satisfy, or not upset, the American administration,” Mr. Revivi said, “and the demands of citizens whose needs are not being kept.”

Based on several meetings he had with Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Revivi believes the Trump administration has not really drawn clear lines about what settlement it could live with.

“They said to the prime minister, ‘We are not going to put any limits on you, but just make sure that what you do doesn’t get us upset,’ Mr. Revivi said. “I think that’s where Prime Minister Netanyahu is: not knowing just how much he can pull the strings without getting the American administration upset.”

Most of the world considers the settlements, built in the territory that Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war — the heartland of any future Palestinian state — to be a violation of international law.

Hagit Ofran, who monitors construction for Peace Now, a leftist Israeli advocacy group that opposes settlement activity, said there had been a sharp acceleration in the promotion of plans compared with the last two years. The rate now, she said, is similar to that in 2014, which was a bumper year. (The relative slump in 2015 and 2016 might have been due to a glut.)

“The strategy is to confuse us,” Ms. Ofran said. And Israel, she said, is now allowing itself to build in places where it has held off for decades.

For example, approval is being given for 31 new apartments in the Jewish settlement in the heart of the contested and volatile city of Hebron, although that project is expected to be held up by a legal challenge by Hebron’s Palestinian-run City Hall.

And for the first time in 20 years, final approval is also being given for a new settlement, Amihai, to accommodate the families who were evacuated from the illegal Israeli outpost of Amona, which was built on private Palestinian land.

A bid for construction is expected to be issued for 300 units in the Beit El settlement that the government has been promising since 2012. And heavy machinery has been spotted in recent days carrying out soil-boring tests at Givat Hamatos, an area over the 1967 lines in southern Jerusalem. According to Peace Now, the infrastructure work is being done in preparation for the issuing of bids for the construction of 1,600 housing units in the area.

Anti-settlement groups say the construction in Givat Hamatos would drive a wedge between predominantly Palestinian East Jerusalem neighborhoods and Bethlehem, harming the contiguity of any future Palestinian state. The past promotion of plans there have prompted international condemnation.

In its official statement last week, the government declared: “During 2017, approximately 12,000 housing units in different stages of planning and construction will be approved, about four times the amount in 2016. Whoever claims that this is not a significant improvement is misleading the public.” But hinting at the need to take Israel’s broader interests into account, the statement also said, “Whoever believes that diplomatic considerations need not be taken into account is greatly mistaken.”

“There is nobody,” the statement concluded, “that does more for settlement, steadfastly and wisely, than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.”

Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, condemned the latest settlement plans. “Clearly, Israel is bent on entrenching the military occupation and its illegal settlement enterprise,” she said, “further reaffirming its intentions of displacing Palestine and replacing it with ‘Greater Israel.’”

Bezalel Smotrich, an Israeli lawmaker from the staunchly pro-settlement Jewish Home party, which sits in Mr. Netanyahu’s governing coalition, wrote a scathing online post accusing the prime minister’s staff of issuing “a sea of lying numbers.”

Mr. Smotrich blamed the Americans for not authorizing plans for industrial zones by the settlements, in part because they take up a lot of space. “Without industrial zones there is no employment, no livelihood and no existence,” he said.

The planning committee meeting this week convenes four times a year. Shaul Arieli, an Israeli expert on political geography who prepared maps for past negotiations with the Palestinians, and who is a strong advocate for the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, said final approval for about 600 units has become relatively “routine.”

But in the past, he said, about 75 percent of new building was inside the so-called settlement blocs, meaning areas mostly close to the 1967 line that Israel intends to keep in any future agreement with the Palestinians, possibly in return for land swaps. Over the last six or seven years, he said, up to half the new building has been deep in the West Bank, outside the blocs.","Israel Moves Ahead on West Bank Settlements, but Guardedly",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/world/middleeast/israel-west-bank-settlements.html

Last month, however, the Kurds voted for full independence from Iraq, prompting an angry rebuke from Baghdad and threats of military intervention.

Both Turkey and Iran fear that an independence move by Iraqi Kurds could set off unrest among their own Kurdish minorities. The United States and most of the international community had opposed the referendum, saying it could unleash ethnic conflict, break up Iraq and undermine the campaign against Islamic State militants.

On Monday, Iraqi forces said that they had reached the outskirts of Kirkuk, seizing oil fields and other sites from Kurdish forces.

How much oil is in Kirkuk?

The area around Kirkuk and the Kurdish region is one of the major oil-producing areas of Iraq. Analysts estimate that the region as a whole produces 750,000 barrels a day, of which around 400,000 comes from fields around Kirkuk that could be caught up in the conflict. The Kurdistan regional government exports about 640,000 barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris, with about 300,000 coming from Kirkuk.

View all New York Times newsletters.

Iraq produces a total of about 4.5 million barrels a day.

Most of the oil exported from the Kirkuk and Kurdistan area goes north, through a pipeline across the border with Turkey, and then to Ceyhan, a Turkish port on the Mediterranean. Turkey has threatened to cut off those exports, although Ankara has taken no action thus far.

Why have oil prices moved higher?

Oil prices recently have become more sensitive to supply threats, such as the situation in Kirkuk.

Strong global demand and the agreement between Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to curb production have tightened the market and helped soak up some of the surplus. That means further reductions because of global crises become more important.

“We have got a cocktail of geopolitical risks that can certainly keep supporting prices and probably — if demand stays strong — contribute to pushing them higher,” said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a market research firm based in London.

What will this do to the cost of gasoline?

Rising crude oil prices have translated into modestly higher prices for consumers. The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline in the United States is about $2.50, a little less than 10 percent more than a year ago, according to the Energy Information Administration, a government agency.

In Britain, prices for unleaded regular gasoline have risen by about 4 percent to about 544 pence, or about $7.20, per gallon, according to data from the AA, an auto services group. Because of the high tax component in European fuel prices, the prices are less sensitive to fluctuating costs of crude than are gasoline prices in the United States.

There seems a good chance that oil prices will push at least modestly higher over the next few years. Oswald Clint, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said prices of $60 to $70 a barrel, or even higher, were likely.

Mr. Clint said he doubted that modest increases would drive fuel prices high enough to slow major economies like those of the United States or Germany. “In the range I am talking about, I don’t think so,” he said.

It is one way to try to mollify some conservatives angered by the inability of the Republican-controlled Congress to deliver.

Mr. McConnell renewed that pitch Monday, reminding Americans that one of the Senate’s major responsibilities is what he called “the personnel business” — handling up to 1,200 executive branch nominations.

Standing alongside the president, he also took the opportunity to remind Mr. Trump that “the single most significant thing this president has done to change America is the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.” Mr. McConnell didn’t need to say that it was his own decision in 2016 to refuse to consider President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick B. Garland for the vacancy caused by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia that held the seat open for Mr. Trump to fill.

“But it’s not just the Supreme Court,” Mr. McConnell said. “There are a lot of vacancies at both the circuit court and district court level.”

At the moment, there about 150 openings on the federal bench – 21 at the influential appeals court level – with 50 nominations pending. Some of those vacancies are because of the refusal by Republicans to act on Obama nominations in the last two years of his administration or their failure to return blue slips when Democrats still held the Senate.

“Many, many are in the pipeline,” Mr. Trump said of his nominees, promising that “we will set records in terms of the number of judges.”

Given the abundance of opportunities, Mr. McConnell reiterated his view that a refusal by Democrats to sign off on home-state nominees should not be allowed to blackball appeals court nominees. He said if that was the case, individual Democrats would have say-so over more than 60 percent of the appeals court candidates.

“That’s simply not a tenable place to land in a Senate that now deals with judges with a simple majority,” Mr. McConnell said.

Mr. Trump was not inclined to get into the arcana of the blue slip process. “My attitude is I just want really capable people going to the courts,” the president said.

Besides blue slips, the other remaining impediment to a flurry of judicial confirmations is time – Senate floor time that is. Though Democrats can no longer block nominees by requiring Republicans to assemble a supermajority of 60 votes, they can require Republicans to follow a procedure that can take more than three days for each individual nominee. And if Democrats conclude Republicans are jamming through judicial nominees, they will no doubt drag their feet as they did earlier this year on executive branch candidates.

To step up the pace of confirmations, Mr. McConnell would probably need to keep the Senate in session for longer durations than the current Monday evening through Thursday afternoon schedule. That change could irritate some lawmakers but conservatives have been pressuring Mr. McConnell to extend the Senate workweek.

Some hard-line conservatives taking aim at Mr. McConnell were not won over by his Rose Garden bonding moment with Mr. Trump.

“Mitch McConnell’s bellyaching about all the time it takes to approve presidential personnel doesn’t hold any water when 1) every other Senate before his has managed to do this in a timely manner, and 2) his Senate works an average of 2.5 days per week,” David Bozell, president of ForAmerica, said in a statement calling for Mr. McConnell to step aside.

Still, Mr. McConnell and the president are both hoping that a parade of conservatives taking up lifetime appointments on the federal bench will make restless Republicans forget — at least for a while — their disappointment in both the Trump administration and their congressional leadership.",Trump and McConnell See a Way to Make Conservatives Happy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/us/politics/trump-mcconnell-judicial-nominees.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.

In a statement, Allergan said it was “carefully reviewing the court’s decision.”

The patent office is still reviewing the case, including the Mohawks’ argument that the patents are protected by the tribe’s sovereign immunity. The two legal processes operate independently of each other, although decisions in federal court typically supersede the administrative review, experts said.

“If a court overturns the patent, then that is game over for the patent,” said Michael Carrier, a professor at Rutgers Law School who studies patent law.

Brendan F. White, a spokesman for the tribe, said it was “in the process of reviewing the decision and its impact on our patent business.” Under the deal, Allergan paid the tribe $13.75 million, with the promise of $15 million in annual royalties as long as the patents remained valid.

Allergan’s arrangement with the Mohawk tribe had been greeted with outrage by members of Congress and consumer groups, who said it was just the latest tactic by drug makers to foil generic competitors and protect their profits.

The tribe had countered that it was within its rights and that further deals could serve as an added source of revenue for its community of more than 15,000 people in a rural, economically depressed region near the Canadian border.

Allergan has said it entered into the deal with the tribe to avoid what it described as the double jeopardy of having its patents challenged in both federal court and through the administrative review. Many patent holders have argued that the administrative process is unfair and unnecessary because patents already can be challenged in federal courts.

12,"['german', 'right', 'way', 'party', 'prophet', 'germanys', 'germany', 'volk', 'west', 'country', 'political', 'kubitschek']","Until recently, though, New Right thinking mostly remained on the fringes of German society, lacking grass-roots expression or a viable manifestation in party politics.
But the German New Right has other influences as well.
“The old structures are to be kept intact.”Kubitschek was born in Ravensburg, a wealthy southern town in what was then West Germany.
He now speaks of the former West Germany in derisive terms.
This seemed like the right moment to ask him about a concept often discussed in New Right circles: thymos — an ancient Greek word use to signify a sense of prideful, righteous indignation.","The human being, he told me as he took a restrained sip, is a “very difficult type.” It is not in our nature to adhere to some strict political ideology like communism or Nazism, he said; rather, human beings ought to be raised according to their inclinations. “There’s something the human being can achieve, something he can be. It’s in this direction that he ought to be raised. And we ought never to pull him away from that.” Is this a dark knight or a Montessori schoolteacher, I asked myself, but Kubitschek had already moved on to the topic of Germanness. “The idea that there is such a thing as a pure German is wholly absurd,” he said — populations migrate and absorb other influences. Naturally, he said, an immigrant could also become a German, just as long as that person “is willing to give everything for this country and is ready to identify with it.”

I asked Kubitschek to define “Germanness” for me. He seemed eager to discuss the subject. Few other people, he said, are so thoroughly preoccupied with the question of who they are: Germany is both Catholic and Lutheran, he said, both Prussian and Bavarian; Germany is the sensitive, cultured nation that produced poets like Goethe and Schiller and the historically militaristic one that produced the Waffen-SS. “Germanness is a fissure,” he said. “Germanness is a question without an answer.”

This, I thought, was hardly the kind of positivist vision of German greatness upon which you might build a right-wing nationalist movement. I was, for the moment, having a bit of difficulty conjuring the version of Kubitschek who had, with an almost apocalyptic fervor, warned of the looming demise of the German Volk (literally the “folk,” but often used to indicate a national identity in ethnic terms), the man who had argued at an anti-immigration rally that Germans are being “replaced and exchanged” by migration, the man who had suggested that the “pathological” manner with which Germany processes the crimes of the Nazi past leads to a corrupting strain of national self-hatred. Kubitschek promulgates these ideas not only through books and in seminars but also through his connections to some of the most radical politicians in Alternative for Germany, or the AfD, a far-right party that won nearly 13 percent of the national vote in September, making it the most successful nationalist party to sit in the German Parliament since the Second World War. Alternative for Germany has become ever more radical since it was founded in 2013 — increasingly portraying itself as the defender of the Volk and of German identity — a transformation that Kubitschek, behind the scenes, has been instrumental in bringing about.

As Kubitschek nursed his beer at the table, however, he was sounding pretty measured. Before I got around to asking him about his connection to Alternative for Germany, a young girl in a white dress, the daughter of a visitor, approached our table. She had been outside playing with some of Kubitschek’s younger children (he has seven). “Mr. Kubitschek!” she said. “One of the rabbits got out and is running around the garden.”

“What?” replied Kubitschek with feigned, playful drama. “Then catch it and put it back in the cage!”

“O.K.!” the girl said, hurrying back out.

A few minutes later, a young woman quietly informed Kubitschek of another problem. A newborn baby goat was “very agitated.” Kubitschek, who decries modern man’s disconnectedness from the sources of his food, promptly excused himself and rushed out, returning a few minutes later to explain that his newborn goats sometimes have trouble digesting their mother’s milk. He rubbed the distressed newborn’s belly, he said, and it passed a stool. All was well at the manor again.

Kubitschek does not officially belong to the AfD — he and his wife applied and were rejected as too radical in 2015, when the party’s leadership was more moderate — and he doesn’t see party politics as his domain. (His wife has since joined the party.) He prefers to promote his ideas in what he calls the meta-political realm, where he can sway a culture that, in his view, is dominated by leftist thinking. Kubitschek does not hesitate to provoke in the service of his New Right cause, but he also has a talent for couching his illiberal ideology in innocuous-seeming, even liberal-sounding precepts that keep him within the bounds of acceptable discourse even as he expands them. The idea, for instance, that no one should be forced to abide by a strict ideology sounds wholly unobjectionable. But for Kubitschek and his fellow New Right thinkers, the roster of strict ideologies includes liberalism, multiculturalism, egalitarianism and feminism, all of which are “social experiments” (as Kubitschek puts it) imposed by the political elite on the unwilling Volk.

Kubitschek’s views are reaching a growing audience. Despite the unique cultural taboos arising from the historical memory of Nazism, Germany has joined a long list of European countries — Austria, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy and Slovakia among them — where far-right, sometimes explicitly racist political parties command significant minorities in national elections. This ethno-nationalist renaissance presents an odd paradox. European nationalists who at one time might have gone to war with one another now promote a kind of New Right rainbow coalition, in which sovereign states steadfastly maintain their ethnic and cultural identities in service of some larger “Western” ideal. This “ethno-pluralism,” as New Right activists call it, is not based on Western liberal notions of equality or the primacy of individual rights but in opposition to other cultures, usually nonwhite, that they say are threatening to overtake Europe and, indeed, the entire Western world by means of immigration. The threat to the West is also often cast in vague cultural terms as a kind of internal decay. When President Trump visited Poland, he argued in a speech that the United States and Europe were engaged in a common cultural battle. “The fundamental question of our time,” he said, “is whether the West has the will to survive.”

That question has deep roots in Germany. In 1918, the German philosopher Oswald Spengler published the first volume of “The Decline of the West,” arguing that cultures decline as regularly and predictably as any other organic entity — and that Western civilization was near the end of its cycle. Germany had just lost a war, and Spengler’s book struck a chord with disillusioned Germans looking to explain their sense of downfall. Spengler belonged to a loosely defined group of German thinkers called the Conservative Revolutionaries, who argued that Western decline was the inevitable result of materialism and soulless democracy. They opposed the fractious parliamentary democracy of the time, the liberal values of the French Revolution and ultimately modernity itself. They called for national revival by way of an authoritarian leader who could bring about an almost-mystical regeneration of the Volk — in part by pitting them against the Volk of other nations. “A people is only really such in relation to other peoples,” Spengler wrote, “and the substance of this actuality comes out in natural and ineradicable oppositions, in attack and defense, hostility and war.”

The German New Right portrays itself as the contemporary reincarnation of the Conservative Revolution. Kubitschek regularly echoed Spengler in our conversations and on more than one occasion told me that Germany was a “tired” nation in its twilight years. The New Right’s efforts to reclaim this dated political and intellectual movement serve a purpose. Despite their unmistakable ideological overlap with the National Socialists, many Conservative Revolutionaries were ambivalent toward them and rejected Hitler as a proletarian brute. That apparent distance provides New Right thinkers not just with a nationalist, antiparliamentary tradition rooted in German history but also with a useful argument: National Socialism is a deviation from their chosen ideology, not its inevitable conclusion.

The ideas of the Conservative Revolutionaries, however, cannot be separated from the rise of Hitler. In 1923, one of the movement’s most prominent thinkers, Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, published “The Third Reich” — another critique of Western liberalism. As the title suggests, Moeller van den Bruck had some influence on the Nazis (Goebbels said his book was “very important for the history of National Socialist political ideas”), though they later repudiated the author himself. The Conservative Revolutionaries’ more consequential influence, however, was on the wider population. Their despair over modernity contributed to the “debility of democracy” and fueled a “politically exploitable discontent,” the historian Fritz Stern wrote in “The Politics of Cultural Despair.” In other words, their ideas helped pave the way for the arrival of a Führer, even though the one who arrived was not necessarily to their liking.

After World War II, Armin Mohler, a Swiss-born writer who had tried unsuccessfully to join the Waffen-SS, took on the project of disentangling the Conservative Revolutionary ideology from Nazism. Mohler, a self-described fascist who had an early and profound influence on Kubitschek, sought to create a more palatable tradition for the postwar era, and he is considered the father of the German New Right. Until recently, though, New Right thinking mostly remained on the fringes of German society, lacking grass-roots expression or a viable manifestation in party politics. But the German political climate changed in 2015, when Angela Merkel allowed nearly a million refugees and migrants to enter the country over the Bavarian border. While many Germans celebrated their arrival, others were angered, feeling that their worries about “Islamization,” criminality and the erosion of German identity were being ignored by the political establishment. For New Right activists, that anger is good. It is the ineradicable opposition that will bring about the political transformation they seek.

But the German New Right has other influences as well. Nils Wegner, a young writer who translates English-language books into German for Kubitschek’s publishing house, follows the American alt-right scene with great interest — listening, for example, to podcasts by Richard Spencer, the white-supremacist leader who once declared before a crowd of acolytes: “Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!” Wegner told me that the American idea of a “racially defined ethno-state” would “come across as pretty weird over here,” because Europeans are not comfortable putting identity matters in racial terms. I asked him if this discomfort was substantive or merely semantic, and his answer was surprisingly forthright. “I would say that the main difference is the semantic difference,” he said. “Also, the modus operandi is not really the same.” Unlike alt-right activists in the United States, he went on to explain, activists on the European New Right tend to avoid appearing alongside “orthodox” right groups — neo-Nazis — because “the look” would impede their effort to appear as a “new kind of postmodern” patriotic movement.

Wegner said another difference was a matter of intensity. The Americans, he said, see their country as collapsing, and therefore they advocate revolutionary action — the creation of a white ethno-state in the Pacific Northwest, for example. European New Right activists don’t see their circumstances as that dire, he continued. They would be content with a “roll back” on immigration.

“It’s not yet a revolutionary situation,” he said. “The old structures are to be kept intact.”

Kubitschek was born in Ravensburg, a wealthy southern town in what was then West Germany. It was a traditional society, he recalls, one where women stayed home and raised children and people voted for the center-right Christian Democratic Union, currently the party of Angela Merkel. He and his friends learned Latin and Greek in high school, and they preferred fencing or horseback riding to soccer, which was considered a “prole” activity. This halcyon way of life was gone, he told me — a victim of society’s leftward progression.

He now speaks of the former West Germany in derisive terms. He sees “Wessis” — the people who live there — as having been indoctrinated into a form of hyper-moralistic mass thinking. Its cities, he believes, are “lost” to immigrants. His wife, Ellen Kositza, who writes polemics against what she calls “hyper-feminism,” also hails from the West — from a working-class city near Frankfurt that, she said, has become almost completely “foreignized.” The former East Germany, where they’ve made their new home, has experienced comparatively less immigration; it’s the place where, as Kubitschek put it, “Germany is still Germany.”

Kubitschek told me his political awakening came in high school, when a group of classmates put together a presentation about the Nazi period in their state. Kubitschek loathed the presentation, he said, because it unjustly placed guilt for the Nazi crimes on his grandparents’ entire generation. Kubitschek, who was an editor at the school newspaper, wrote an article criticizing the presentation, and it set off a community debate. The younger teachers, products of 1960s counterculture, took the side of the students who put on the presentation. The older teachers, including the rector, who helped operate an antiaircraft gun in the war, sided with him. One sympathetic teacher suggested that Kubitschek read the work of the historian Ernst Nolte, known for a controversial essay he wrote around that time titled “The Past That Won’t Go Away.” Nolte portrayed Nazism as a reaction to the “existential threat” posed by Bolshevism and suggested Bolshevik “class murder” was comparable to the Holocaust, calling it the “logical and factual predecessor to the Nazi ‘racial murder.’ ” Nolte’s revisionism sparked a divisive debate in Germany known as the “historians’ dispute,” and though Nolte was denounced as a Hitler apologist, several conservative German historians and journalists supported him. For Kubitschek, Nolte’s work has been a lifelong influence.

After high school, Kubitschek joined the German Army, becoming part of a special reconnaissance unit, and later joined the reserves. His company was “very right,” he said. It drew from an “unbroken historical tradition” that reached back at least as far as the Brandenburgers, a Nazi covert-intelligence unit, and symbols like the “swastika and so on” hung on the company walls. Several of the men I met in Kubitschek’s circle also served in the military; in postwar pacifist Germany, one of them told me, it is attractive to a lot of rightists who saw German demilitarization as an emasculating development. In 2001, Kubitschek himself was discharged from the reserves for “right-wing-extremist endeavors,” but the decision was later revoked after supporters petitioned the Army.

Kubitschek now keeps close contact with a faction of Alternative for Germany politicians who refer to themselves as der Flügel, or “the Wing.” It is led by some of the most extreme politicians in the party, including a former history teacher named Björn Höcke, a head of the party in the eastern state of Thuringia. Kubitschek and Höcke have known each other for nearly two decades, and Kubitschek speaks very highly of the party leader, calling him an “idealist” and a “romantic.” But in Germany, few politicians have done more to blur the already-fuzzy line between the New Right and the old right. In March 2015, it was Höcke who initiated an internal party revolt against the party’s founder, an economist named Bernd Lucke, releasing a resolution that accused the party’s leadership of unduly embracing the “establishment” and failing to resist “the further erosion of Germany’s sovereignty and identity.”

The resolution, which set into motion Lucke’s downfall as party leader, read like something Kubitschek could have written. In fact, Kubitschek told me, he drafted it in his library in Schnellroda. What Lucke had failed to grasp, Kubitschek said, was the degree to which Alternative for Germany represented an emotional “outbreak” that went way beyond the economist Lucke’s “technocratic dissatisfaction” with the euro.

Flügel politicians are now ascendant within the party — and they are increasingly mixing their nationalism with the antiliberalism agenda of the New Right. Before the election, I attended an Alternative for Germany rally in Artern, a depressed-looking town not very far from Schnellroda. There, I was struck by how Flügel politicians devoted much of their speeches to a number of economic issues traditionally though of as leftist — low wages, poverty in old age, insufficient social benefits, rhetoric designed to shift the party away from its roots in economic liberalism. One of the politicians, a man named Jürgen Pohl, who was subsequently elected into Parliament, denounced the claim that Germany is doing “better than ever” economically. Should Angela Merkel and “our new African citizens” come to the former East Germany, he said, they’d see the “poor house of Germany.” Another speaker, André Poggenburg, the head of the party in Saxony-Anhalt, declared Alternative for Germany to be “the new party of social justice.” The message was simple enough: more benefits for the Volk, and fewer foreigners to take those benefits away. In the former East, where unemployment remains higher and salaries remain lower than in the former West, that message seems to resonate, helping the party peel away hundreds of thousands of voters from die Linke, the descendant of the East German Communist Party.

The shift is not entirely surprising. New Right thinkers often entertain the idea of establishing a querfront, or a “cross front” that would unite opponents of liberalism on both extremes of the political spectrum. During my talks with Kubitschek, I often found myself detecting what at first seemed to me a perplexing leftist bent, an aversion to American-style materialism. You had only to go the shopping center on a Saturday morning, he once told me, and observe people in their “consumption temple” to see how there is “nothing at all there, spiritually.” For Kubitschek and other New Right thinkers, American liberalism — with its emphasis on individual rights and the individual pursuit of happiness — is perhaps the most corrosive force eating away at the identity of the Volk, replacing a sense of “we” with individualism and profit-seeking self-interest.

One evening, as we sat in the gloaming dimness of his library, Kubitschek delivered a long lament about what he perceived to be the ills of modernity: banal consumption, the decline of Christian belief (Kubitschek is a Catholic), mechanization that is making workers superfluous. These forces were undermining the Volk, he told me, and there was very little that could be done to stop it.

I asked him then what was left for him to do. Despair?

I was half joking, but he nodded in all seriousness.

“You’re desperate?” I asked.

“Yes,” he said.

What, I asked, does political victory look like for a movement of despair?

The best that could be done, he said, was “to prevent the worst.”

On the Monday after my first visit to Schnellroda, I went to see Kubitschek speak at a demonstration in Dresden. The event had been organized by “Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West” — known by the German acronym Pegida — which had been holding rallies in Dresden on Monday evenings since 2014. By the following year, as the global refugee crisis arrived in Germany with full force, the demonstrations often drew more than 10,000 people, but attendance has since dwindled, and on this night only a few thousand people were expected.

The rally took place in a central square near an unostentatious memorial marking the spot where thousands of corpses were burned after the 1945 Allied bombing that destroyed the city. Before the event began, I found a group of demonstrators — mostly men and women of retirement age — huddled around an accordion player. They were singing folk songs like “Holy Fatherland,” a tune once favored by the Hitler Youth. “In dangerous times, your sons cluster around you. Surrounded by danger, Fatherland, we all stand hand in hand.” One silver-haired man who placed a bellowing emphasis on the word “Fatherland” every time it came up handed me a lyric sheet so I could follow along. I asked him what kind of songs they were.

“Forbidden songs!” he said, almost hollering.

“Really?” I asked.

“Almost,” he said more gently. “People don’t listen to German folk songs.” Raising his voice again, he added, “Nationalism is out!”

In that moment, I was reminded that before the fall of the Iron Curtain, while West Germans were still struggling to comprehend and expose Nazi crimes, East Germans were taught a different version of World War II history, one that depicted them as heroes in the global fight against fascism. Some scholars suggest that the East German deflection of blame reverberates today in the form of a greater willingness to accept far-right nationalism. It’s perhaps no coincidence, then, that Pegida demonstrations are more prominent in the former East Germany, and that Alternative for Germany won 22 percent of the Eastern vote in the recent election.

After enough demonstrators gathered, they went on a short march around the town hall, with its soaring clock tower, and back to the square. Anti-fascist counterdemonstrators, most of them young, many of them university students, held a banner that said “Make Borders History” and yelled, “Nazis out!” Pegida demonstrators, many of them old enough to be the counterdemonstrators’ grandparents, retorted: “You’re the Nazis!”

Soon after the Pegida demonstrators returned to the square, Kubitschek hopped onto a makeshift stage and clutched a microphone. The center of his speech was an extended metaphor featuring a cat and its avian prey, a dove that can’t get away because it has a broken wing.

“Now, it is dragged down the stairs,” he said, staring into the crowd. “It does not flutter anymore. It does not defend itself. Its head bangs against every step, and there’s a long way to go until we reach the cellar.”

The dove with the broken wing was, of course, the Volk, while the cat was the “political class.”

“Actually, we are way too big for this cat that is dragging us behind it,” Kubitschek continued, “and yet for some reason, we do not get on our feet. But we must get back on our feet ... and climb up again step by step.”

The crowd cheered and chanted: “Resistance! Resistance!”

Kubitschek paused, as if to collect his thoughts. There was a way for the Volk to escape the cat’s paws — it must demand the re-institution of “law and order” through the sealing of the German border, and it must demand that the political parties putting their own interests above the country’s be reined in by restricting their public financing. He mocked Angela Merkel. She presides over a party called the Christian Democratic Union, he said, but would have gladly opened Vienna’s city door to Ottoman Muslim invaders in 1683. “Why does our establishment despise its own people?” he asked.

The source of the contempt, according to Kubitschek, was Germany’s “memory politics,” the effort by Germans to confront their Nazi past, which involves tempering any nationalist urges. New Right thinkers see that restraint not as a virtue but as a symptom of a deeply ingrained self-hate — a hatred that must be overcome for Germany to be great again.

In January, Björn Höcke, the AfD leader, voiced a similar lament in a speech at a beer hall in Dresden, and much more caustically. Germans are “the only people in the world who have planted a monument of disgrace in the heart of their capital,” he said, referring to the Holocaust memorial near the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. German history was being made “rotten and ridiculous,” he said. “It cannot and must not go on like this! There is no moral duty to dissolution!” The speech provoked a national uproar, and even some politicians within AfD criticized it.

Kubitschek saw it as a tactical error. Höcke’s comments, he said, were “correct in substance but wrong in tone.”

Kubitschek has had greater success advancing the “self-dissolution” theme in the meta-political realm. Recently, he published a book called “Finis Germania,” written by Rolf Peter Sieferle, an environmental historian. Sieferle warned that shame over Nazi crimes is driving a neurotic German belief that the “Earth will be cleansed from the shameful mark of the eternal Nazis only when the Germans have completely disappeared.”

In June, “Finis Germania” was selected for a prominent book-of-the-month list, an entry into the mainstream of public opinion that itself stoked another major controversy. How could such a book, deemed anti-Semitic and extremist by many within the media and literary establishments, be so readily accepted into the public discourse? Kubitschek called the reaction a “panic.” Expanding the boundaries of discourse was precisely what Germany needed, precisely what the Volk required. This was the way to heal its broken wing.

My last visit to Kubitschek’s home was on a Saturday evening, some hours after he had hosted a book reading. We sat in a room next to the offices of his publishing house, joined by several of his friends, all men. Kubitschek lit several candles, and a warm breeze from the open window whipped the flames. The other men popped open bottles of beer; Kubitschek stuck to juice. In the company of his friends, he spoke more openly than he had in our previous talks. The topic of the night was mostly the refugee influx since 2015.

Kubitschek casually mentioned that he would not mind at all if a strongman came to replace Merkel, if that was the only way to correct her decision to allow the migrants to enter Germany. In a time of great peril, he noted soberly, a leader must act beyond the law. He cited Carl Schmitt, the conservative political theorist who criticized parliamentary democracy and aligned with the Nazis after they took power: “Sovereign is he who decides on the exception.” Merkel herself had acted outside the law by opening the border, Kubitschek said, and that proved she was sovereign. And yet, he continued, “I’d have absolutely nothing against it if someone came along and with the same sovereignty did the opposite. Someone who would say: ‘The experiment is over. The Parliament won’t be consulted. I will prop up with my power the administration, the organs of the state, the police’ — who would in any case be supportive — ‘the border patrol, the military, and we will end this experiment.’ That means: borders shut. Test to see who can be assimilated; they can stay. Those who can’t be assimilated, they’ve got to go.”

It was clear the Kubitschek considers “refugee” a misnomer. These were not, for the most part, refugees fleeing persecution or war, but opportunists — mostly “hungry young men,” as he put it — acting “very rationally” to improve their lot. These migrants arrived in an “insecure” country, he said, where the people “don’t know who they are or what belongs to them.” The migrants, he said, therefore begin to think, Doesn’t everything here belong to everyone? “And then the waves are set into motion, and they say: ‘All right, here we have a country, a fallow country, and it’s a country that must be conquered, and it can be conquered. And it won’t be conquered with ladders for storming fortresses or with machetes, but with sheer presence.’ ” Everyone at the table seemed to agree that the consequences of this conquering were dire. Crime, they argued, was on the rise; women could no longer feel safe walking alone outside at night. “We all know the dystopian stories,” Kubitschek said. Matters might get “supercharged in a hyper-identitarian way,” he added. “If it once again becomes really brutal or cruel, we don’t know. It can also transition over into a country that is no longer Germany.”

Kubitschek put a few new candles in the candelabrum, pressing them into the molten red wax of the old ones. This seemed like the right moment to ask him about a concept often discussed in New Right circles: thymos — an ancient Greek word use to signify a sense of prideful, righteous indignation. Marc Jongen, a philosopher and Alternative for Germany functionary who was once an assistant to one of Germany’s best-known contemporary philosophers, Peter Sloterdijk, argues that Germany lacks the thymos necessary to defend itself from cultural erosion. Kubitschek addresses Jongen’s idea in his own writing, referring to lacking German thymos — which Kubitschek has defined more simply as “rage” — as tantamount to the “emasculation of our Volk.” Kubitschek writes that it is valid to question whether a revolt, an eruption of mass rage, can be controlled. Yet, he writes, the consequences of a revolt are less troubling than the threat of what would happen if the Volk’s thymotic energy became insufficient to fuel the “successful defense of what belongs to it.”

I asked Kubitschek about the sharp rise of right-wing violence in Germany since the refugee influx. “It’s a reaction that someone can have who really has the feeling that his country is being taken,” Kubitschek said, “that everything he knows and what he grew up in is changing, and who sees that something totally alien is spreading and he doesn’t want it.”

“Is violence justified?” I asked.

“I don’t see it as justified,” he said. The migrant is “ultimately only the figure that we can see, so to speak, but behind him is much bigger development.” He said that the young male migrants who come to Germany as asylum-seekers must be frustrated — they are being treated like kindergarten kids, given enough to eat and a place to sleep, but they have no real chance to become part of the society. “They want to work,” he said. “They want to meet a few women. They simply want to take their lives into their own hands. And it’s not at all possible here,” he said. “This country doesn’t need these people.”

Kubitschek mentioned an article he read about a small village in Saxony-Anhalt where a large number of asylum seekers had been settled. “That is also a form of violence,” he said.

“Clearly!” said one of the men at the table.

“The village is being changed in its substance,” said Kubitschek. “Or perhaps even being destroyed.” The question, he added, is: “Why must we be O.K. with that?”

“Why then isn’t violence justified?” I asked. If these refugees were conquerors, and their presence was destroying a way of life, couldn’t a person justifiably claim self-defense?

“The refugee is the false opponent,” Kubitschek said.

After a pause, he added an amendment. “Actually, if it’s going to come to violence, we ought to storm the Parliament. We have no replacement to offer, but this woman can’t govern any longer. We must go on from here in a different way.”

Then Kubitschek announced that there had been too much talking. “Everything is clear, isn’t it?” he said, inspiring a round of laughs from the table.

He and a friend picked up guitars, and they began to sing old German folk songs, some of them with beautiful, baroque melodies. The first was a martial homage to Georg von Frundsberg, a German mercenary who fought for the Holy Roman Empire and was famed for his brilliant infantry maneuvers. Von Frundsberg hailed from a town not far from where Kubitschek grew up, and in 1525 he helped Emperor Charles V secure the imperial throne with a decisive victory at Pavia, in what is today Italy. Everyone at the table sang along.

“Georg von Frundsberg, lead us, tra la la la la la,” the men sang, their voices deep. I sank back into my chair and listened.

Twice now, a dozen or so 11- to 16-year-olds gathered at the Ngari Hill Eco-Lodge for five days to talk about images and the place of women in society. Ms. Sinclair shares her long-term project, which helps the participants understand that it’s a global issue affecting one girl every two seconds; that it’s the result of women not being valued as they should; and that what they’d been through is not their fault. She also introduces basic photographic concepts using examples of work done by or on strong African women. The goal is to inspire them while also teaching them photo skills before they pair off with another participant and are joined by a student-mentor from the previous workshop to make pictures in the surrounding hills.

“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Many, this year, even re-enacted what happened to them. We didn’t tell them to do this.” In one, Jackline holds out her beaded necklace while dressed in her school uniform, an effort to demonstrate how beading interrupts education. In another, Nachaki leans against a branch off the ground. “I was worried they’d fall when I first saw them climbing, but then they told me how, when they fled their marriage and hid in the forest, they’d sleep in trees to protect themselves from the animals in the wild,” Ms. Sinclair recalled.

Others hint at the bonds developing among the girls, like in the picture of Linnet and Eunice laughing in their room, or Susan and Silvana walking arm in arm, as well as in the portraits they’ve made of each other. Only when sitter and photographer are in sync do you get images that capture both vulnerability and strength.

The workshop culminates in a community exhibition and presentation where they speak about what matters most to them. Both times, Ms. Sinclair said, they felt compelled to share what they’d been through, how it affected them, why girls’ lives matter, and why they should have the same opportunities as boys. In short, how “girls can do anything,” a line they often repeated in their remarks. The message resonated powerfully with those in attendance. Not only did it come from those who lived through the ordeal, but also from community members, female relatives, and young women who speak the same language and share the same cultural background.

“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Though we’ve only had 22 students so far, slowly those number add up.”

She hopes to hold more workshops, in Kenya and elsewhere, as long as her not-for-profit “Too Young to Wed” continues receiving the financing and logistical support to do its work without taking any shortcuts.

“You want these workshops to be intimate, because therapy isn’t a mass process,” she said. “It’s not just the act of photography that helps; it’s bringing together girls who have all experienced a similar type of trauma for what really is a retreat, a time to be nurtured, to grow, and to build community.”

They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry.
They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

That doesn’t mean a return to the glory days of private offices, but it does mean workers have more space and more places to seek solitude than in the neo-Dickensian workbench settings. The new designs often include “isolation rooms,” soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.

And it’s meant to be tweaked as needs change. “This continues to be iterated,” said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM — and whose use of the word “iterated” hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.

“It’s not something we’re going stop and say, ‘This is it,’” he said.

The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work — or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce’s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.

Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.

“These workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.

The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called “activity-based workplace design,” tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.

“Office geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,” said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.

“You have to collaborate more,” said Michael Ford, Microsoft’s general manager of global real estate. “We absolutely have to change.”

For decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.

Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to “do a turtle,” researchers say, and retrench and communicate less — colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example

Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. “That’s the sweet spot for Microsoft,” Mr. Ford said.

The company thinks it is working. Microsoft’s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company’s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.

Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.",Don’t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/the-office-gets-remade-again.html

More than 100 people were evacuated to hospitals and other nursing homes.
On Monday, Geoffrey D. Smith, a lawyer for the nursing home, said the home could not comment on the 911 calls because it had not yet heard them.
In the past, nursing homes have resisted similar measures, citing cost, and several industry groups have filed legal challenges to the new rule.
“Yes, a defibrillator, get a defibrillator for her,” the woman told someone else, then returned to the phone.","The audio of the emergency calls, released by the Hollywood Police Department on Monday, gives a sense of the growing crisis that unfolded at the nursing home, Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills. Eight residents, including Ms. Hibbard, died that day and six more died in the days and weeks that followed. More than 100 people were evacuated to hospitals and other nursing homes.

The callers, sometimes nurses or nursing assistants, attempted to remain calm, but often sounded pressured, exhausted and overwhelmed as they answered questions about the conditions of the patients. All were reported to be having severe difficulty breathing.

“Oh my God, this is crazy,” a woman making the fourth call said at around 6:15 a.m. as she struggled to find a patient’s age in the nursing home’s computer system, which had a separate power source. “We are initiating CPR at this moment,” she said. Then, sounding flustered, she gave the phone to another woman.

“They have a crash cart there, they’re working on her now as we speak,” the second woman said, referring to the wheeled supply cart used for resuscitations.

Gov. Rick Scott has criticized the nursing home for failing to call 911 on behalf of its residents, and the deaths remain under police investigation. The newly released audio demonstrates that the nursing home staff did indeed call 911 for patients that Wednesday morning, as well as for two patients the previous two days.

But by the time the calls were made, the residents were suffering respiratory distress, and in some cases dying.

According to information provided by the police, a call was made on Monday, Sept. 11, a day after Hurricane Irma made landfall in Florida.

That call was made for an 81-year-old woman on the second floor who was experiencing breathing problems. A second 911 call was made around midday on Tuesday, on behalf of a 93-year-old man. “He had a fever,” a woman told the 911 operator. “We started, you know, ordering the tests for him and stuff, but he’s getting short of breath now.”

The 911 audio was released by the police after two local newspapers, The Sun-Sentinel and The Miami Herald, went to court to demand them under the state’s public records statutes.

“Investigators have now completed witness interviews related to the 911 calls and have determined that the audio can be released without jeopardizing the ongoing investigation,” the police said in a news release.

Several families of residents who died have sued the home. The governor, through the state’s health agency, moved to shut down the nursing home. The home has filed a legal challenge.

Hollywood Hills, one of many nursing homes in South Florida that lost power after the hurricane, has noted that state officials and the power company were repeatedly called for help in restoring electricity to the air conditioning. In one of the 911 calls made on Sept. 13, a worker at the Broward County emergency operations center noted that the day before, a psychiatric facility that shared the same building as the nursing home, and also had no air conditioning, had called the county for assistance.

On Monday, Geoffrey D. Smith, a lawyer for the nursing home, said the home could not comment on the 911 calls because it had not yet heard them. “We have been asking for these records since the incidents occurred,” he said in an email. “To date, we have not had access to the 911 calls and are still waiting for responses to our multiple public record requests.”

After the deaths, the governor released an emergency rule that will require all nursing homes and assisted living facilities, by Nov. 15, to have generators and enough fuel to keep their facilities at safe temperatures. In the past, nursing homes have resisted similar measures, citing cost, and several industry groups have filed legal challenges to the new rule. Last week, the state’s health care agency said that homes could request extensions “under extreme circumstances.”

Inside the overheated nursing home that Wednesday, the calls, over the space of just a few hours, became more frequent and urgent as the situation turned dire.

“I have another patient that’s in respiratory distress,” one caller said.

“Make sure to check on the patient, please! I’m on this call,” she said to someone else in the home. “I’m on the phone for the next patient.”

“She’s not breathing!” she said to the operator, who told her to locate a defibrillator. “Yes, a defibrillator, get a defibrillator for her,” the woman told someone else, then returned to the phone.

She is survived by two sisters, Sohaila and Soraya Wali, and four brothers, Ahmad, Jahed, Zia and Abdul Wali.
Ms. Wali was married at one time, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1987, her family said.
In 2002, she spoke at the United Nations’ celebration of International Women’s Day in New York.","The Taliban had stripped women of basic human rights and of previous gains by strictly enforcing Shariah, or Islamic religious law. In the introduction to “Invisible History: Afghanistan’s Untold Story” (2009), by Paul Fitzgerald and Elizabeth Gould, Ms. Wali wrote of Afghan women:

“Traumatized and desperate, they constantly spoke of severe poverty, suicide and the growing hopelessness that saw their dreams for a free Afghanistan swallowed by an army of Islamist mercenaries from all over the world armed and supplied by Pakistan.”

She added: “I still hear their cries. During this entire time I carried with me their pleading voices and ultimately their screams, while the world looked away.”

She concluded, “Afghan women were the canaries in the mine shaft, bearing witness to the inhumanity of a regime against its own citizens.”

When she visited Afghanistan in 2005 under a program financed by the National Endowment for Democracy, a Washington foundation, Ms. Wali barely escaped being taken hostage near the Pakistani border by what she described as a mob of armed Taliban insurgents and other fundamentalists.

Still, she insisted that the problem in Afghanistan was not Islam but the Taliban.

“The Taliban is using culture and religion to keep women down,” she said in 1998 at a seminar for Afghan refugees in Pakistan, “but there is nothing in my religion that teaches keeping women at home, not educating them, starving them and withholding medical treatment from them so they die.”

She added, “Islam teaches us to care for and protect women.”

Earlier in the 20th century, the royal family of Afghanistan guaranteed universal suffrage and civil rights to women during one of several experiments with democracy.

The 1978 Communist coup was followed by a Soviet invasion and a 10-year struggle to resist it, then by a civil insurgency that culminated in the withdrawal of Soviet forces and a Taliban victory in 1996. The Taliban regime was overthrown during the American-led assault in 2001, but the war against the guerrillas goes on.

Ms. Wali often criticized the United States for supporting the guerrillas who had fought against the Soviet takeover and then morphed into the Taliban.

Sima Wali was born on April 7, 1951, in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Her father, Mohammad Wali, was manager of the Afghan National Bank and a cousin of King Amanullah Khan, who championed women’s rights in the 1920s. Her mother, the former Shafiqa Sharifi, supervised a clothing factory.

Sima spent her early childhood in India, where her father was posted and where she was educated in English. After the family returned to Afghanistan, she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Kabul University.

She earned a master’s in international relations from the School of International Service at American University in Washington. Her parents joined her in Washington after escaping from a Communist jail, where they had been held for a month.

She is survived by two sisters, Sohaila and Soraya Wali, and four brothers, Ahmad, Jahed, Zia and Abdul Wali. Ms. Wali was married at one time, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1987, her family said.

She received the Amnesty International Ginetta Sagan Fund Award in 1999 and the Gloria Steinem Women of Vision Award from the Ms. Foundation for Women in 1989.

In 2001, Ms. Wali was one of three female delegates to a meeting in Germany, sponsored by the United Nations, that led to the Bonn Agreement, which formed a new Afghan government after the American-led invasion and, as she had called for, created a Ministry of Women’s Affairs.

In 2002, she spoke at the United Nations’ celebration of International Women’s Day in New York. She was also a founder of the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, a feminist think tank, based in Montreal.

Ms. Wali was profiled in a 2004 documentary film by Paul Fitzgerald and Elizabeth Gould, “The Woman in Exile Returns: The Sima Wali Story.”

“I no longer fear that Afghanistan will again be abandoned,” she wrote in 2009. “My fear today is that despite all the initial good intentions, America’s overreliance on military methods, targeted missile strikes, chemical spraying, and imprisoning and torturing suspected militants has turned popular opinion in the wrong direction.

“Combined with an inability to improve the lives of the average Afghan by even a small measure,” she added, “America is now viewed as an occupier, instead of the friend and ally we want her to be.”

A peripatetic self-described “voice for the politically voiceless,” Ms. Wali learned of her degenerative neurological disorder in 2005.

It will also build an unspecified number of fast chargers along roadways, each of which will have several charge units.
ChargePoint, the largest installer of vehicle charging stations in the United States, plans to install 400-kilowatt sites in the coming months.
According to ChargePoint, 80 percent of vehicle charging is currently done at home, and industry executives argue that it’s wrong to think about charging electric cars in the way they envision filling up a gasoline or diesel vehicle.
“Electric vehicles are more like horses than gasoline cars,” said Mr. Romano of ChargePoint.","Two levels of charging are typically available in residential settings. Level 1 is a standard AC outlet that provides between 1 and 1.5 kilowatts of electricity. It takes a Level 1 charger about 30 hours to fully charge the electric version of the Ford Focus, which has a range of 115 miles. Level 2 uses a professionally installed charger connected to a 240-volt AC outlet — the kind used by some large appliances — and delivers between 7 and 9 kilowatts, lowering the charge time to about 5.5 hours.

Some commercial charging locations offer more advanced technology, employing so-called fast chargers. These offer about 50 kilowatts of DC power, enabling the same Ford Focus to reach 90 miles of range in 30 minutes (battery chemistry causes charging to go more slowly after a battery is 80 percent full). The electric carmaker Tesla has a proprietary “supercharger” for its vehicles that provides 120 kilowatts of power, adding 300 miles of range in 75 minutes.

A new generation of charging points, the first of which are being installed in Europe this year, offer 350 kilowatts of power. Such a jump would slash charging times to 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the vehicle’s range, according to Charlie Yankitis, director of business development for the German manufacturer Bosch’s electric vehicle unit. Elon Musk, Tesla’s founder, has hinted that charging at even faster rates was being studied.

Several companies are making big bets on the technology.

Electrify America, the Volkswagen subsidiary, is planning on installing such high-capacity chargers along highway corridors throughout the United States. It is investing $2 billion in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and education nationwide, $800 million of which is earmarked for California alone.

By the end of 2020, Electrify America plans to have built 350 Level 2 charging sites in urban areas in California, like workplaces and apartment buildings. It will also build an unspecified number of fast chargers along roadways, each of which will have several charge units. A further 540 are to be built elsewhere in the country in that time.

ChargePoint, the largest installer of vehicle charging stations in the United States, plans to install 400-kilowatt sites in the coming months. But its chief executive, Pasquale Romano, did not specify how many.

Similar pushes are being made elsewhere. In Europe, the German automotive giants BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen have joined with Ford in a joint venture to install 350-kilowatt chargers across the Continent. They will start installing them this year, initially planning to get 400 fast-charging sites up and running, with “thousands” in place by 2020.

“We’re looking for similar solutions across the globe,” said Mike Tinskey, Ford’s global director of electrification and infrastructure.

There are, however, hurdles that need to be overcome.

For one, standards differ across manufacturers and regions. Today’s commercial chargers use three different kinds of plugs that are not entirely compatible. In practice, a Chevrolet, Nissan or Volkswagen cannot be charged at a Tesla charger. A Tesla, however, can use an adapter plug to charge at standard commercial stations, and Electrify America says its charging stations will be compatible with a variety of plugs.

Another issue: No vehicle on the road today is able to use the 350-kilowatt fast-charging stations. It is not a simple upgrade: High-speed charging requires thicker cables that won’t get too hot.

No automakers have indicated when they will sell cars equipped to accept such fast charges. Porsche’s Mission E electric vehicle is expected to be available by 2020, and will be able to charge to a 250-mile range in 15 minutes, according to the carmaker. Electrify America and ChargePoint say they expect vehicles capable of accepting 350-killowatt chargers to be available by 2019.

Utilities will also have to upgrade their infrastructure, a change for which California is already preparing.

Under the state’s zero emission regulations, every manufacturer must sell a certain number of emission-free vehicles, calculated as a proportion of overall sales. Consequently, California has become the hub for the mass installation of fast charging points. One of the state’s utility companies, Southern California Edison, estimates that 25 percent of its network must be upgraded to support new chargers.

“We hope we’ll be ready for fast charging when Electrify America is ready to install it,” said Caroline Choi, the utility’s senior vice president of regulatory affairs.

For now, the number of charging stations remains relatively low. According to the Department of Energy, there are just over 16,000 public electric vehicle charging points in the United States, offering about 44,000 individual outlets of varying charging speeds. By comparison, there are 120,000 gas stations nationwide, many of which have 10 or more pumps.

So customers will have to stick to charging an electric vehicle whenever it’s not being used, much as they already do with smartphones and tablets.

According to ChargePoint, 80 percent of vehicle charging is currently done at home, and industry executives argue that it’s wrong to think about charging electric cars in the way they envision filling up a gasoline or diesel vehicle.

“Electric vehicles are more like horses than gasoline cars,” said Mr. Romano of ChargePoint.

So what else is needed to be able to do the job?

Basketball I.Q. “When something happens on the court, I’m the first to react to it,” Mr. Sedra said, “so you have to have knowledge of the game.”

Quick judgment. “You’ve got to know timing,” he told us, likening it to improv. “It’s really important to feed off what’s happening.”

Good chemistry. He described himself as a conduit between the crowd and the court. “I’m supposed to emit a certain type of energy to the crowd, but at the same time I feed off the crowd and reciprocate the energy they feel.”

Stage presence. While there’s no acting involved, Mr. Sedra said his demeanor and pronunciation of words change behind the mic. He does not, however, recite “how now brown cow” to loosen up; “I rehearse in my mind.”

Mr. Sedra is a Montreal native who started in radio and television, covering college basketball in Canada. He spent 11 seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers before coming to the Nets.

Hundreds of games later, he still gets nervous before taking the mic.

Boston draft resisters, for example, were mostly middle to upper -middle class, the children of Democrats who presumably voted for Johnson in 1964.

Fifty years later, it is worth remembering the place of draft resisters in the American tradition of dissent.","If the president had been better briefed, he would have known that the week’s theme of moving “from protest to resistance” came in large part from the expectation that thousands of draft-age men would deliberately defy draft laws. And he knew enough about the draft that he should have seen these protests coming.

By 1967, it made sense for protesters to target the Selective Service System. Nearly everyone agreed that the draft did not operate fairly. Since the 1950s, the government faced a fundamental problem administering a peacetime system of conscription: The baby boom produced too many draft-age men. Even during the Vietnam War, the military enlisted or drafted fewer than 11 million draft-age men out of a pool of nearly 27 million. Under the direction of Gen. Lewis Hershey, the Selective Service fashioned a system of deferments and exemptions that local draft boards awarded to registrants for pursuing certain activities outside the military, such as going to college or medical, dental or divinity school; serving in the reserves; or working for a defense contractor.

By 1966, as draft calls increased dramatically, the system of deferments came under intense criticism. In response, President Johnson appointed a commission that confirmed the inequities of the system. In effect, the draft turned the Vietnam War into a “working-class war,” as the historian Christian Appy has labeled it, with disproportionate numbers of the poor and working-class sent to Vietnam while everyone else seemed to go off to college.

Meanwhile, revelations from a 1965 Selective Service training kit exposed the draft not only as unfair, but as a vast social engineering project. In the so-called “channeling memo,” first published in New Left Notes in January 1967, General Hershey wrote to draft board officials that the process of delivering a few thousand men to induction centers “is not much of an administrative challenge,” Rather, General Hershey declared, “it is in dealing with the other millions of registrants that the System is heavily occupied, developing more effective human beings in the national interest.” Too bad no one told the American public that the real point of the draft was to develop “more effective human beings.”

Yet, through the use of “channeling” — of wielding the threat of induction to push young men into activities the Selective Service saw as advancing the “national interest” — the draft produced a “psychology of granting wide choice under pressure.” This, General Hershey claimed, was “the American or indirect way of achieving what is done by direction in foreign countries where choice is not permitted.”

The channeling memo exposed a coercive draft system that took a generation of men and threw them into an arena to compete with one another, in a competition few of them would have chosen for themselves. Getting a deferment meant survival. For the men who became draft resisters and for their supporters, the realization that they were compelled to play an undemocratic game that privileged some Americans over others only reinforced their sense that the United States had strayed from its most cherished values.

They did not take their decision to resist the draft lightly. As children of the Second World War generation, they had thought of their country as a leader of nations: The United States had defeated fascism abroad, prosecuted Nazi war criminals and brought the United Nations to New York.

As they came of age, however, they saw Lyndon Johnson escalate the war in Vietnam almost unilaterally, killing hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese civilians and tens of thousands of Americans. Instead of being a model nation, the United States now faced international condemnation, even from allies, over its use of overwhelming military power. After years of signing petitions, writing to their congressmen and turning out for large-scale demonstrations, to no avail, draft resisters now upped the ante.

A loose coalition of “Resistance” organizers planned the national draft card turn-in. They were inspired by the civil rights movement, the Berkeley Free Speech Movement (during which one of its leaders, Mario Savio, described having to “put your bodies upon the gears, and upon the wheels, and upon the levers” in order to stop the operation of an odious “machine”) and the precedent of resisters such as Muhammad Ali. By risking indictment, they thought that they could put the Johnson administration — and the war itself — on trial in court proceedings all over the country.

Tens of thousands of Americans supported draft resisters by signing their names to complicity statements. The most prominent of these, “The Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority,” was written by intellectuals and first published in The New York Review of Books and The New Republic. The “Call” emphasized documented incidents of American war crimes in Vietnam, and called on Americans to support draft resisters, whom signers saw as “courageous and justified.”

Few were radicals. Boston draft resisters, for example, were mostly middle to upper -middle class, the children of Democrats who presumably voted for Johnson in 1964. Most important, 82 percent of them held deferments that protected them from being drafted. By breaking the law, they willfully made themselves vulnerable to prosecution and to being called for induction. These were hardly the acts of cowards.

“There was something of the flying trapeze in these maneuvers now,” Norman Mailer reported when the draft cards were returned to the Justice Department. The commitment to an uncertain future that might involve a prison sentence was like a “moral leap which the acrobat must know when he flies off into space,” he wrote. “One has to have faith in one’s ability to react with grace en route, one has,” he concluded, “to believe in some kind of grace.”

Neither President Johnson nor General Hershey saw any grace in draft resistance. Hershey responded enthusiastically to the president’s order to act on draft resistance by instructing draft boards to reclassify and call for induction anyone who turned in their draft cards — actions that the Supreme Court later ruled (in the case of James Oestereich, among others) unconstitutional.

And although draft resisters expected to be arrested and prosecuted, Attorney General Ramsey Clark surprised them by indicting only a handful of ringleaders, including the famed pediatrician Dr. Benjamin Spock. (The convictions in that trial were overturned on appeal.)

The draft resisters’ mass civil disobedience strategy did not work out the way they planned; they did not get the chance to put the war on trial in hundreds of federal court proceedings all over the nation. But Johnson administration papers show that the president did not grant General William Westmoreland’s request for 206,000 additional troops in part because so many administration officials predicted more draft resistance, on an unprecedented scale.

Fifty years later, it is worth remembering the place of draft resisters in the American tradition of dissent.

As it happens, his analysis bears pretty much directly on Howard Gleckman’s critique of Kevin Hassett’s disgraceful performance at the Tax Policy Center.

As Setser notes, Puerto Rico used to be a major tax haven for manufacturing corporations. Much of this tax advantage has now ended, but its legacy is still visible in trade statistics. Specifically, PR runs, on paper, a huge trade surplus in pharmaceuticals – $30 billion a year, almost half the island’s GNP. Yes, “N” not “D” – very important in this case, as in Ireland.

But the pharma surplus is basically a phantom, driven by transfer pricing: pharma subsidiaries in Ireland charge themselves low prices on inputs they buy from their overseas subsidiaries, package them, then charge themselves high prices on the medicine they sell to, yes, their overseas subsidiaries. The result is that measured profits pop up in Puerto Rico – profits that are then paid out in investment income to non-PR residents. So this trade surplus does nothing for PR jobs or income.

What does this have to do with Hassett? Well, he told TPC – while insulting the institution and impugning its integrity – that transfer pricing driven by high nominal US corporate taxes is responsible for half the U.S. trade deficit, and that cutting these taxes would therefore be a big job creator. Never mind whether his estimate is right: even if it were, as Gleckman says, changing the transfer pricing would affect the accounting, but nothing real. It would be exactly like Puerto Rico’s pharma surplus: a phantom improvement, statistically impressive to the uninformed but signifying nothing.","Puerto Rico, Trump and Taxes",https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/puerto-rico-trump-and-taxes/

New infrastructure to support the mine — a rail line to the coast and an expanded port — would also make it economically feasible to extract coal from at least eight additional sites in the Galilee Basin.

That could more than double coal output in Australia, which already produces more coal than any other nation except China, the United States and India. About 88 percent of the 487 million tons of coal mined annually in Australia is exported.

For many environmentalists, what happens in this mining case is a test of the world’s commitment to fighting climate change. Its failure would register as an unmistakable sign of an international shift away from the fossil fuels behind climate change. But if Australia agrees to subsidize the mine — even though several commercial banks have shunned it — the project would demonstrate the lasting allure and influence of the coal industry.

“How it can be constructed — at a time when the whole world is committed to move away from fossil fuels — is madness that most people just can’t understand,” said Geoffrey Cousins, president of the Australian Conservation Foundation.

The project, known as the Carmichael mine, has provoked strong resistance in part because of its proximity to the Great Barrier Reef, a natural wonder that is already dying because of overheated seawater blamed on climate change. Adani plans to deliver most of the coal to India on shipping routes that critics say would further damage the ecosystem of the world’s greatest system of reefs.

The debate over the mine has dominated headlines in Australia for months and fueled one of the most fervent environmental campaigns in the nation’s history. Protests have grown in size and frequency, and polls show Australians who oppose the mine outnumber those who support it by more than two-to-one.

A group of Indigenous Australians is also challenging Adani’s claim to the land.

But Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull supports the project, and it just needs financing to proceed. A government agency established to support private-sector infrastructure investment is reviewing Adani’s loan request, and the company has said it is also lining up money overseas.

“This is a tipping point,” said Maree Dibella, a coordinator of the North Queensland Conservation Council, referring to the mine’s role in the global campaign against coal.

Around the Galilee Basin, where a population of less than 20,000 is scattered across an area the size of Britain, opinion is divided.

Bruce Currie, a cattle farmer who lives near the site and has traveled to India to investigate Adani’s record, said he is worried the mine will drain too much groundwater, calling it “yet another burden our small business has to bear.”

Several hours drive north in Collinsville, one of the area’s oldest mining communities, Roderick Macdonald, 57, a retired miner, said Adani had come to the town promising to build mining camps and employ local people.

“From what I can hear and see, Mr. Adani’s going to do nothing for this town,” Mr. Macdonald said, referring to Gautam Adani, the billionaire founder and chairman of the company.

But others in the region are more hopeful. Mining accounts for as much as 7 percent of the Australian economy, and the northeastern state of Queensland, where the Galilee Basin lies, has suffered a downturn in recent years because of slowing demand for natural resources, especially from China.

“I need jobs for Queenslanders,” said the state’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, of the Adani proposal.

Towns along the coast have been vying for potential contracts with the mine for maintenance work, construction and other services. “People are really rooting for this because of the economy,” said Stephen Smyth, a local union leader, who started working in underground mines at 17.

The Carmichael mine, he added, is “offering that thing of hope, hope for a better life, secure employment and better wages so people can live a reasonable life.”

Adani has said the project will create as many as 10,000 jobs in the region. But a consultant hired by Adani said the employment claim was overstated in court testimony given in a case where a conservation group was looking to block the mine. Critics have also noted that other mines in Australia may need to scale back production if Carmichael opens, meaning job losses elsewhere.

A host of Australian celebrities — including the rock band Midnight Oil — and international groups have urged Mr. Turnbull to kill the project, arguing that such a large mine would violate Australia’s commitment in the Paris climate accord to work to prevent temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.

In April, Mr. Turnbull met with Mr. Adani and later told reporters that the mine “will create tens of thousands of jobs,” adding, “Plainly, there is a huge economic benefit from a big project of this kind, assuming it’s built and it proceeds.”

If Adani and other mines in the Galilee Basin go ahead and reach maximum production, coal from the region would release as much as 700 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year, or nearly as much as Germany generates in emissions, according to a study by Greenpeace.

Australia has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, but the coal it sells to India and other countries would not be counted in its total.

It is unclear if India even needs the extra coal. After years of big increases in coal consumption, the growth rate slowed last year as the nation has improved energy efficiency and shifted to solar, wind and hydropower. India’s coal-fired power plants are running below 60 percent of capacity, a record low, experts say.

That has raised questions about the economics of the Carmichael mine. Australia’s four largest banks have publicly ruled out financing it, and analysts have argued that the mine would face stiff competition from local sources of coal in India and elsewhere.

Globally, coal consumption actually decreased by 1.7 percent in 2016, according to a BP report on energy trends, leading the company to declare that “the fortunes of coal appear to have taken a decisive break from the past.”

Critics worry Adani could default on the government’s loan or flood the market, lowering prices worldwide and allowing coal to make a comeback as an energy source.

The Adani Group’s business record has also drawn scrutiny. The conglomerate, whose interests span natural resources, logistics, energy and agriculture, has faced allegations in India of environmental degradation, money laundering and bribery, but it has denied any illegal activity.

Adani leased about 460 square miles of land in the Galilee Basin nearly a decade ago. It can take two to three days to get to the site from the coast, with the last leg of the trip on unpaved roads. Surveying, soil testing and design work has begun, including on an airstrip, mining camp, access roads and the rail link, said Ron Watson, a spokesman for Adani Australia.

Coal from the mine would be transported by rail about 240 miles through grazing land to Abbot Point, the nation’s most northern deep water coal port, which is already used to ship coal to China, Japan and South Korea. Adani has signed a 99-year lease of the port and plans an expansion that would allow it to double the amount of coal going through.

From the air, the piles of coal and equipment at Abbot Point are a striking contrast with the turquoise waters of the Coral Sea. The closest coral of the Great Barrier Reef is just 12 miles away.

A 30-minute drive southeast from Abbot Point is the seaside town of Bowen, where parts of the Nicole Kidman epic “Australia” was filmed a decade ago during better times. Now, the streets are dotted with “For Sale” signs beyond the main drag.

“We had miners living in the high parts of town,” or the most expensive neighborhoods, said Mike Brunker, who represents Bowen in the Whitsunday regional council and is a supporter of the mine for the jobs it is projected to bring. “That was the boom time. They had to leave, they had to go to other mines, or they’ve just gone broke.”

Further up the coast is Townsville, home to Adani’s headquarters in Australia, where protesters sometimes congregate and residents exemplify the conflicts felt by many in the region.

“You don’t know what’s good for us,” one man snapped at an environmental activist conducting a survey recently.

Not too long after, another resident told the activist, “I oppose the mine even though I applied for a job.”",Australia Debates: Does a Warming Planet Really Need More Coal?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/world/australia/australia-adani-carmichael-coal-mine.html

And therein lies the rub: It is not clear that the intent of these “headline” valuations is to trick anyone.","And if the special side deals that most unicorn companies offer to certain investors — more on this sleight of hand in a moment — are taken into account, almost half of the companies would fall below the $1 billion threshold.

“These financial structures and their valuation implications can be confusing and are grossly misunderstood not just by outsiders, but even by sophisticated insiders,” Mr. Strebulaev and Mr. Gornall wrote in a report on their research, describing most private investments as a “black box.”

That black box increasingly has relevance not just to gossips in Silicon Valley, but also to public investors. Big mutual fund companies like T. Rowe Price and BlackRock have aggressively begun investing in unicorn companies in recent years on behalf of public investors — yes, you may own a stake in Uber and not even know it — helping to increase the valuations even further.

And even the big public mutual funds, the researchers contend, are not properly valuing the assets. “It is inappropriate to equate post-money valuations and fair values,” the professors said, explaining how, more often than not, public funds use the headline price that comes after a round of financing, and don’t distinguish between various types of shares.

One of the many ways that some companies inflate their valuations, for instance, is by offering certain investors guaranteed valuations in an initial public offering. In other words, if a company doesn’t reach a certain valuation at the time of an I.P.O., it will issue the investor more shares to make up the difference between the guaranteed price and the one that was attained. Effectively, all the other common shareholders end up paying the difference — and often don’t know it.

“Shares issued to investors differ substantially not just between companies but between the different financing rounds of a single company, with different share classes generally having different cash flow and control rights,” the researchers said.

Mr. Strebulaev said he was shocked when he dug into the contracts of the different fund-raising rounds. “The overvaluation is so large because many of these companies use sophisticated contracts that benefit some investors at the expense of other investors,” he said. Without identifying a particular company, he said some of the deals were “mind boggling.”

Worst of all, he said, he believes that “the people who are hurt the most are employees.” He said that in many cases employees didn’t understand that the value of the options they had been granted were disconnected from whatever the latest headline valuation of their employer might be.

When Mr. Strebulaev first circulated a draft of his paper, he said, “a number of companies contacted me, or, rather, their general counsels contacted me.” He encouraged them to point out mistakes or factual errors. “I haven’t heard back from them,” he said.

To cite one example from the research: In 2015, Appdynamics issued a Series F round with special terms for certain investors, including “a provision offering a 20% bonus in down I.P.O.s,” meaning one that fell in price. Legg Mason, already an investor, then revalued its shares in the company at a higher price, “despite not being eligible for the 20% bonus,” the professors wrote. “These examples are representative of common industry practices.”

In another example, the professors found that sometimes a fund-raising round painted an overly “rosy picture.” As an example, the professors used a particular fund-raising round from nearly a decade ago for SpaceX, arguing that “SpaceX’s value actually fell in 2008” while its reported valuation went up. The researchers said investors that year “were promised twice their money back in the event of a sale, with that claim senior to all other shareholders.”

“That guarantee increased the price those investors were willing to pay for SpaceX shares,” the professors said, “but did not alter its true value.”

Still, the professors were quick to say they did not believe that these terms were meant to manipulate investors.

“After achieving a turnaround of the People’s Party, Mr. Kurz must achieve a turnaround for Austria.”","With nearly all ballots counted, the Socialists, with 26.9 percent of the vote, edged ahead of the Freedom Party, with 26 percent. They are believed to be the most likely partner for Mr. Kurz as he tries to create a majority needed to form a government.

The road to that goal could be said to begin when Mr. Kurz, at age 16, called up the People’s Party office in the working-class neighborhood of Vienna’s 12th District where he grew up, the only son of a teacher and a technician. In one of the professionally produced videos on his home page, Mr. Kurz tells how he offered them his services.

“It didn’t go too well,” he recalled, pacing and looking pensive in an open-collared shirt. “They gave me the sense that I should get back to them in a couple of years. That experience left me with the idea that politics should actually be something where everyone can participate. Where anyone who wants to can get involved.”

Mr. Kurz persisted, eventually joining the party and working his way up through the youth wing to become its leader in 2009. Two years later, he became a political appointee in the Interior Ministry and in 2013 won a seat in the national Parliament and became the country’s integration minister. The following year, he became Austria’s youngest foreign minister, at 27, and a figure on Europe’s international stage, in his trim navy suits, often worn without a tie.

Freimut Dobretsberger, a longtime member of the People’s Party, claims to have met every Austrian chancellor stretching back to Bruno Kreisky, a legendary figure in the country’s political scene who took over in 1970, ushering in a leftward shift in Austrian politics that has remained virtually unbroken since. The center-left Social Democrats were relegated on Sunday to third place, the first time in a century that they have not been one of the two largest political parties.

Instead of viewing Mr. Kurz’s youth as a liability, Mr. Dobretsberger, an 80-year-old former banker, believes that is the young candidate’s strength.

“In Austria, we have strong, but old-fashioned industries,” Mr. Dobretsberger said. “Unlike in Silicon Valley or in Korea, we are too reliant on the service sector and that needs to be changed. I think not him as a person, but the momentum he has generated, will make that possible.”

Analysts of Austria’s political landscape have compared Mr. Kurz’s achievement of sensing a societal shift to the right, and harnessing a desire for change. When he took over his political party, he rebranded it a movement, creating a website and an app that made it easy for people to get involved, attracting 200,000 new supporters, the party said.

But as Alexandra Siegl, a Vienna-based political analyst, points out, Mr. Kurz understood how to capitalize on Austrians’ fears over the arrival of thousands of immigrants from the Middle East from 2015 to 2016. From the strain they placed on the country’s welfare system to the threat that Islamic extremists may be among them, his position seemed ripped from the populist playbook.

“Mr. Kurz took on similar, if not exactly the same position as the Freedom Party,” Ms. Siegl said. Members of the far-right party complained that the young minister had copied their ideas.

He also sold himself as having closed the so-called Balkan route, after having defied the promise by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany of a “welcoming culture,” by reaching agreements with countries in Austria’s southwest to close their borders.

Some Austrians disparaged the swing to the right that the election represented and that is likely to continue under Mr. Kurz. Among them was Jörg Heiser, an Austrian who teaches as the Berlin University of Arts, who in a Facebook post called Mr. Kurz “a sort of Orban in Macron clothing,” a reference to Viktor Orban, the populist Hungarian leader who has exhibited strong authoritarian leanings, and Emmanuel Macron, the centrist, technocratic young president of France.

Ms. Merkel congratulated Mr. Kurz on Sunday, after it became clear his party had emerged as the winner. On Monday she praised his “modern” campaign style, but with an eye to the likelihood that Mr. Kurz will build a coalition with the Freedom party, she cautioned that she would not be trying to copy it for Germany.

Mr. Kurz also has his critics at home, where the speed at which he rose through the party’s ranks and the seeming unwillingness of many local media outlets to sufficiently challenge him.

“The party saw him as a Messiah, a young man who was going to come and be their savior,” said Josef Redl, an economics reporter for the left-leaning weekly Falter. “All he campaigned on was immigration, and he got away with it.”

On the morning after the election, as the country chewed over the outcome and waited for the final result to be announced, most likely on Thursday, many were quick to point out that governing may prove more challenging than campaigning.

“Mr. Kurz promised many things, these promises demand upholding,” wrote Dietmar Neuwirth in the Austrian newspaper Die Presse. “After achieving a turnaround of the People’s Party, Mr. Kurz must achieve a turnaround for Austria.”","For Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s 31-Year-Old New Leader, a Swift Rise",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/world/europe/sebastian-kurz-austria.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

TENS Unit

O.K., so yes, these kind of look like those gimmicky electronic muscle stimulators from the ’90s that promised abs without the work, but the similarities end there. A TENS unit is designed to help with the kind of acute pain you might get from a sports injury or workout soreness.

“Think of using one like popping an Advil, or taking an ice bath: It won’t fix a permanent problem and is not a replacement for long-term treatment, but it might feel good,” Wirecutter writes in its recommendation.

Wirecutter’s pick is the TechCare Massager Plus.

Compression Socks

Some people — including yours truly — slip on a pair of compression socks after an especially tough run, or after it’s been a while since hitting the trail, to help with calf soreness. (And many runners swear by them even during a run, though the science is still out on their helpfulness on that front.)

Wirecutter’s favorite are the Sockwell Elevation Firm Socks.

Yoga Mat

We all know we should stretch more after working out, but it truly can be one of the things that keeps you going and will get you to the next workout. If you’re looking for some tips on working those sore muscles, our beginner’s guide to yoga is a great place to start.

Last November, news of the “Mud Men” chat spread like wildfire.

Students started noticing the racist chat on the morning of Nov. 11 when freshmen who were targeted posted screenshots of the threats on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat, forcing students inside the Penn bubble — and plenty outside of it — to pay attention. Black organizations sent a barrage of emails and texts to their constituencies about the situation and began to plan for an emergency town hall. By the afternoon, the news had been picked up by national civil rights activists, including Shaun King and DeRay Mckesson. The news was trending on Twitter for hours before the school issued an official response.

There was a palpable uncertainty in the air that day. Was the chat to be taken as a serious threat to the well-being of Penn’s black freshmen and in turn, Penn’s black community? Or was it a joke that got too serious to take back? The motive is still unclear, but the incident certainly made students fearful.

The university was clear in its condemnation of hate and hate speech on Penn’s campus, but the official response came after news had spread to local law enforcement and the media, and after students of color had already met to debrief and discuss the situation.

That problem is not exclusive to the University of Pennsylvania: Many schools are unable to keep up with how quickly the world moves in this digital era.

Don’t get me wrong: Some of the key supporters of black student groups were faculty members who were instrumental in making sure that everyone felt safe and supported and that proper resources were being applied to figuring out who was responsible for the chat’s existence. I just wish that the university had taken steps publicly to support its black students much sooner than it did.

Maybe it sounds unreasonable to expect a college administration to keep up with the speed of internet discourse. But when several campus groups organized walkouts, demonstrations, rallies and marches to signal solidarity with black students, it took the Penn administration several days to publicly join and support the actions.

Black and brown students need more than official statements of concern to feel safe and welcome in college. The GroupMe incident provides a pretty good example of how amorphous online threats can still be powerfully targeted at us in terrifyingly specific ways.

The racist chat appeared to have been created in Oklahoma, but for the creator to have known so many members of the black freshman class, he or she would have to have been at Penn. So black students immediately assumed it was coming from somewhere on campus. There were multiple individuals who were taunting students on this chat, and all were anonymized by pseudonyms. So the big questions were: How many people were involved? Would they act on their covert threats? How much of the population of the school did they speak for? The chats also included a racial taunt that invoked the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, some chapters of which have been shut down at other campuses for racist behavior. (The Penn S.A.E. chapter immediately denounced the online attacks.)

Working with the F.B.I., the administration was able to identify the creator of the GroupMe chat within a few weeks — a student at the University of Oklahoma who had been accepted to Penn but chose not to attend. The student was suspended, and both the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Oklahoma issued condemnations of his actions. Ultimately, the investigation found that no Penn students were involved in the chat. But these kinds of incidents make black and brown students increasingly wary.

GroupMe is an important method of communication among hall mates, study group partners, band members, fraternity brothers and sometimes entire classes. It’s not as if we can just stop using the app to avoid racism.

An anonymous attack on GroupMe doesn’t feel that different from racist propaganda in “real life.” Just a few months ago, someone put up neo-Nazi recruitment fliers around campus. They were promptly removed, but the incident had an important thing in common with the GroupMe disaster: anonymity.

The creator of the GroupMe and the people who hung the fliers hid their names and faces, putting the students they were targeting in the precarious position of questioning who to trust.

In an interview with the BBC published early Sunday, the director Woody Allen addressed the wave of allegations against Harvey Weinstein, calling it “tragic for the poor women” but also warning against a “witch hunt atmosphere.”

Those comments drew harsh criticism on social media, and on Sunday night Mr. Allen released a statement calling Mr. Weinstein “a sad, sick man.”

Mr. Allen’s initial comments to the BBC were published on the heels of Mr. Weinstein’s expulsion from the Motion Picture Academy on Saturday. The director and producer worked together on several films in the 1990s, and Mr. Allen denied knowledge about any misconduct: “No one ever came to me or told me horror stories with any real seriousness,” he said. “And they wouldn’t, because you are not interested in it.

How is Billy doing?

He’s doing well. He’s going to have another operation coming up soon, and another when he’s around 8 to 10 years old. But he’s doing well.

Thinking back to that first monologue where you talked about him and the circumstances of his birth, was that difficult for you to perform? Did you hesitate to share that with your audience?

No, but in retrospect, perhaps I should have. Because what I didn’t think through was that, everywhere I went, every day of my life, people would be asking me how my son is doing.

As I just did.

But thank God I can say he’s doing well. If that wasn’t the case, each day would be very, very painful. But I also felt like I had to say something. Because I’d been talking about the fact that my wife [Molly McNearney, the co-head writer of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”] was pregnant for six months. I left for paternity leave and then I didn’t come back. That was something I had to address.

Looking at the totality of these monologues, the ones that have dealt with health care and gun control, do you feel that you, or how you approach the show, have been changed in a way that can’t be undone?

It does make you think a little bit more about what you say and maybe you choose your words a bit more carefully. I don’t ever want to get in a situation where I feel compelled to speak about every tragedy, every natural disaster, every murder or car accident or whatever horrible things are going on in the world. If I do that, no one will be interested. You can overdo it.

One of the criticisms you faced for your monologues about health care was that you’d gotten some of your information from Senator Schumer. Is that correct that you did, and is this a fair criticism?

I did, but I will say I talked to Chuck Schumer three times for, probably, a total of less than eight minutes. As I’ve said, I didn’t know anything about health care and I wanted to educate myself beforehand. I reached out to a lot of people so I could get my facts straight and find out what the arguments would be.

This notion that they were pulling my strings is one created by right-wing media outlets. It’s just a way of putting a pin in something that scares them. I don’t know why the idea of making sure every American is taken care of should scare a politician. It certainly doesn’t scare the average guy who’s got a job that he doesn’t like and is afraid to quit it because he’s got a pre-existing condition and he may well not get another good job with insurance.

I think some of them are. I think some of them are just trying to get Fox News to hire them as on-air commentators. It’s sad. You see people try to engage me in battle that are just trying to give their careers a boost. I won’t be a part of that. With the rare exception.

Like your back-and-forth on Twitter with Donald Trump Jr.?

I think he’s just trying to position himself as someone of importance, and he seems to be looking for high-profile media figures to fight with. If you go through his Twitter feed, it’s one desperate cry for attention after another. For whatever reason, I decided to give some to him.

Has there ever been a moment over these recent months, as you’ve waded further into these politicized debates, where ABC stepped in and said, “You can’t do that”?

No, never. They had more concerns about my beard.

Some people have looked back to the comedy you were doing on “The Man Show,” which was often crude and chauvinistic, and said, who is he to get up on his high horse? Does that past work invalidate what you’re saying now?

Of course not. One has nothing to do with the other. It is almost impossible to offend me when your intent is to make a joke. Sometimes people go too far, and that is one of the perils of being a comedian, and if you don’t ever go too far, you’re probably not a particularly interesting comic. Comedians need a place to experiment, to try things, to bounce things off the wall. Comedy will be worse for it if we don’t allow it.

You hosted “The Man Show” with Adam Carolla and “Win Ben Stein’s Money” with Ben Stein, who are both more politically conservative than you. Are you still close with them?

To this day, they’re two of my best friends. I’ve had 15 email interactions with Ben Stein over the last 96 hours. Not quite as many with Adam, he’s not a big emailer. It helps me to figure out what I believe. It teaches me and it teaches them how to have a real conversation without just declaring someone the enemy and retreating to your corner.

For viewers who perhaps once thought of you as a more all-around host — a political centrist, or a refuge from politics altogether — does it concern you if some of these viewers drift away from the show?

It concerns me, but not enough to change what I’m doing. Of course, you want as many people to watch your show as possible. But some things are more important than bringing in a big audience. I hope that we, as a nation, get back to a time where I can have a normal, well-rounded show, that’s more focused on Beyoncé and Jay-Z than Donald and Ivanka. But for the time being, this is what’s at the forefront of people’s minds.

Jimmy Fallon said in a recent interview that he doesn’t care as much about politics and is not trying to do so many Trump jokes. Is that even possible anymore as a late-night host? Does every comedian have to have a political point of view now?

I don’t think so. Jimmy Fallon, he’s just being true to himself. There are people who don’t care about politics. I certainly know people who care much more about football.

Small fires seemed to pop up everywhere. As I raced down narrow country roads to meet deadlines, I caught glimpses of smoldering embers on tree stumps a few feet away. I felt vulnerable while driving through tunnels of vegetation — it would be easy to be surrounded by fire and trapped.

Everything smelled of smoke: my clothes, my car, my bag, my fingers.

I feel enormously grateful to the dozens of people who took the time to articulate their grieving, some while standing in the rubble of their homes. The fires stripped away their privacy. Their kitchens, their exercise equipment, their hobbies — their lives — were in cinders at our feet.

I think back to meeting Lisa Layman, her azure eyes staring at the ashes of her home at Coffey Park in Santa Rosa. She was recovering from cancer and recently had a kidney removed. The night before, she had escaped with her Bible and a scrapbook of her son’s early years. That is all she had.

It is a reporter’s job to bring empathy to disasters like this. But I wondered how I could ever comprehend the magnitude of her loss.

To battle the scourge of wildfires this past week, planes and helicopters have dropped several millions of gallons of fire retardant ahead of the flames. Unlike water, retardant is not distributed directly onto a fire.

“It’s not actually intended to put the fire out,” said George Matousek, the product steward for Phos-Chek, which makes the retardant used by government agencies. “It’s intended to reduce the intensity of the flame so a firefighter with a shovel or hand tool doesn’t get burned up.”

The key ingredient in retardant is ammonium phosphate, which produces nonflammable carbon — think of a diamond or pencil lead — when it chemically reacts with plant cellulose, Mr. Matousek said.

Fire retardant is essentially high-quality fertilizer and is not considered dangerous for people or plants. But it can be toxic to fish, Mr. Matousek said, by causing underwater plant life to grow and choke the oxygen from the water. The United States Forest Service bans its use within 300 feet of a waterway unless human life or property is threatened.

“When you dump that type of nutrient load on a landscape, it’s going to change a lot of dynamics,” said Richard Halsey, director of the California Chaparral Institute, which seeks to preserve native shrubland habitats. “It does cause significant harm to aquatic organisms.”

Where fire retardant lands is also important for its efficacy. Because it needs to be applied in a continuous line, it is typically dyed red or pink.

“In modern times this has got be an unprecedented event, and a major hazard for the public and for property owners,” said Dr. Alan Lockwood, a retired neurologist who has written widely about public health. He said an apt comparison might be the environmental cleanup after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in New York, as debris and dust swirled through Lower Manhattan.

As could well happen too in California, Dr. Lockwood said, the health and environmental effects were felt long after the attack, in the chemicals or pollutants workers and responders at the site, and the public at large, may been exposed to as the cleanup went on.

Household building materials are obviously different from the components of a concrete tower. But they pose risks too. Treated wood in a house’s frame, for instance, put there to prevent bacteria growth, can contain copper, chromium and arsenic. Consumer electronics contain metals like lead, mercury and cadmium. Older homes might have asbestos shingles. Even galvanized nails are a concern because when they melt they release zinc. All are potentially harmful.

“It’s a completely complex mixed bag of different stuff that’s there,” said Geoffrey S. Plumlee, associate director for environmental health with the United States Geological Survey.

Dr. Plumlee led a study after several Southern California wildfires in 2007 that found that ash from burned-out residential areas contained elevated levels of arsenic, antimony and metals including lead, copper and chromium. In most cases the levels were above federal Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for soil remediation.

After a fire in Slave Lake, Alberta, in 2011 that destroyed about 400 homes, the city landfill was found to be leaching toxins after fire debris was deposited there.

In California, the road ahead to cleanup and the safe return to properties will probably not be smooth or fast, public health officials and cleanup experts said. The sheer number of communities affected and properties destroyed creates a greater challenge than any the state has faced in recent history.

Local and state agencies, focused on active fires, have not yet sorted out who will take the leadership roles. Even determining how severely lands are affected and the estimated costs of remediation lay ahead in the weeks and months to come.

At a packed public meeting in the basketball gym at Santa Rosa High School on Saturday, some residents said they worried that the cleanup could go on for years and asked state officials if they could proceed on their own.

The answer they got was a qualified yes. An approved contractor can be hired, if one is available. Otherwise the cleanup should be free in most cases, residents were told, paid for with taxpayer money or private insurance if a homeowner has a debris-removal clause in the insurance policy on the house.

But state and federal officials said on Monday that many of the details of how this cleanup would work remained unsettled. That is partly because the focus has been on response to the fires and the fatalities, and the 40,000 people still evacuated from their homes, but also because of the complex mix of properties affected on both public and private lands.

“There are more questions than answers,” said David Passey, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He said, for example, that FEMA, the federal government’s lead disaster response agency, typically concentrated on public property, not private, unless individual counties declare the private properties a public health and safety risk. Counties and cities can also take the lead on cleanup, he said, and that too has not been fully sorted out.

“We don’t know yet which of those solutions, or mixture of those solutions, the cities and counties will choose,” Mr. Passey said.

Mark Oldfield, a spokesman for the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, which administers state-managed waste handling and recycling programs, said a typical situation for cleanup would include a kind of triage, with the most hazardous materials as a site handled first, typically by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control. That agency would evaluate and remove hazardous debris, which can range from asbestos siding or pipe insulation to paints, batteries, flammable liquids and electronic waste like computers and monitors.

After that, contractors under CalRecycle’s auspices could focus on remaining debris removal for recycling (metals and concrete) or disposal (ash and contaminated soil), Mr. Oldfield said. Then the land could be prepared for potential rebuilding. But, he added, “With fires still active in many areas, there is not yet a timetable for cleanup efforts to begin.”

Dr. Relucio, Napa County’s public health director, said that in the meantime, people who go back to their properties should protect their eyes, lungs and skin, with long sleeves and pants, boots, glasses, and a good quality N95-rated mask available in most hardware stores.

Dr. Lockwood said a secondary caution for anyone entering a burned site is human idiosyncrasy, in the things people store in garages, use in their hobbies or just never got around to throwing away.

That’s pretty slow: it will take a dozen years to achieve even half the adjustment to the long run.","These days, what passes for policymaking in America manages to be simultaneously farcical and sinister, and the evil-clown aspects extend into the oddest places. Hence the tale of the Mnuchin Treasury’s incompetent attempt to suppress an internal analysis – to send it down the mnemory hole? — on the incidence of corporate taxation. This paper reached the inconvenient conclusion that most of the tax stays where it’s applied – with the owners of corporate capital – with only a small share falling indirectly on workers. In general, attempts to suppress stuff like this fail thanks to leaks. But in this case the paper has already been published in a peer-reviewed journal, so that even if the Treasury were locked down tight everyone could read it anyway.

But let’s leave that story on one side; I want to talk a bit about the actual economics of corporate tax incidence. This is not usually my subject, but there’s an intersection with international economics that seems relevant, and which – as far as I can tell, although I’m not as familiar as I should be with the literature – isn’t being appreciated in the current discussion. Specifically: while global capital markets should tend to equalize after-tax rates of return in the long run, the imperfect integration of goods markets implies that the long run is pretty darn long – not enough for us to be all dead, but long enough that return equalization should take decades.

Oh, and a warning: I try to tell readers when something is going to be wonkish and incomprehensible, but this is going to be really, really, really wonkish and incomprehensible, unless you spent years doing perfect-foresight dynamic models. Actually, maybe this is being written for Olivier Blanchard and three or four other people. Whatever.

Anyway, to set the stage: this whole literature goes back to Harberger, who envisaged a closed economy with a fixed stock of capital. He showed that in such an economy a tax on profits would fall on capital, basically because the supply of capital is inelastic.

The modern counterargument is that we now live in a world of internationally mobile capital; this means that for any individual country the supply of capital, far from being fixed, is highly elastic, because capital can move in or out. In fact, for a small economy facing perfect capital markets, the elasticity of capital supply is infinite. This means that the after-tax return on capital is fixed, so any changes in corporate tax rates must fall on other factors, i.e. labor.

Most analysis of tax incidence nonetheless allocates only a small fraction of the corporate tax to labor, for three reasons.

First, a lot of corporate profits aren’t a return to capital: they’re rents on monopoly power, brand value, technological advantages, and so on. Inflows of capital won’t compete those profits away, so the international capital market isn’t relevant to the incidence of taxes on those profits.

Second, America isn’t a small country. We are, instead, big enough to have a strong effect on worldwide rates of return.

Third, imperfect integration of both capital and goods markets is a reality. Rates of return probably aren’t equalized even in the long run; anyway, if a corporate tax cut brings in more capital, this will drive down the relative price of US products, which will limit the return on additional capital and hence keep workers from getting the full benefit of the tax cut.

I’m fine with all that. But I think it’s also important to ask exactly how inflows of capital that equalize rates of return are supposed to happen. Once you ask that question, you see that long run analysis may not be good enough for policy purposes.

Suppose the US were to cut corporate tax rates. This would initially raise the after-tax rate of return on capital, which would provide an incentive for foreign capital (or overseas assets of US firms) to move into the country. This would, in turn, drive the after-tax rate of return back down. How would it do this? By increasing the U.S. capital stock, reducing the marginal product of capital (and raising that of labor).

But how would the capital stock be increased? One does not simply walk into Mordor unbolt machines in other countries from the floor and roll them into America the next week. What we’re talking about is a process in which U.S. investment exceeds U.S. savings – that is, we run current account deficits – which increases our capital stock over time.

There’s an immediate irony here: the rhetoric calling for corporate tax cuts is all about “competitiveness”, yet the initial impact would be bigger trade deficits. But never mind that: think about what it takes to have a bigger trade deficit.

I’ve spent three decades pointing out the fallacy of the doctrine of immaculate transfer – the notion that international flows of capital translate directly into trade imbalances. Exporters and importers don’t know or care about S-I; they respond to signals from prices and costs. A capital inflow creates a trade deficit by driving up the real exchange rate, making your goods and services less competitive. And because markets for goods and services are still very imperfectly integrated – most of GDP isn’t tradable at all – it takes large signals, big moves in the real exchange rate, to cause significant changes in the current account balance.

So, a U.S. corporate tax cut should lead to a stronger dollar, which affects the current account deficit that is the counterpart of an inflow of capital. But how much stronger does the dollar get? The answer, familiar to international macroeconomists, is that the dollar rises above its long-run expected value, so that people expect it to decline in the future – and the extent of the rise is determined by how high the dollar has to go so that expected depreciation outweighs the rise in after-tax returns compared with other countries.

The point is that the knowledge that we’re looking at a one-time adjustment limits how high the dollar can go, which limits the size of the current account deficit, which limits the rate at which the U.S. capital stock can expand, which slows the process of return equalization. So the long run in which returns are equalized can be quite long indeed.

Suppose we assume rational expectations. (I know, I know – but for a benchmark it may be useful.) Then we can think of the adjustment process I’m describing as a little dynamic system in e, the exchange rate, and K, the capital stock. High K means a low rate of return compared with r*, the foreign rate of return, so e must be rising. High e means large trade deficits. The phase diagram looks like this:

Photo

where the saddle path is the unique path along which expectations about the future exchange rate are fulfilled. You can solve for that path by linearizing around a steady state; the solutions to that system have two roots, one negative, one positive, and the negative root tells you the rate of convergence along the saddle path.

At any given time the capital stock K is given; the exchange rate e jumps to put the system on the saddle path, and then it converges over time to the long run equilibrium.

So the story of a corporate tax cut is as follows: initially we’re at a point like A. Then the tax cut raises the long-run equilibrium capital stock. But it takes time to get there: first we get a currency appreciation, as shown by the jump from A to B, and then over time we converge to C.

The question is, how fast is this convergence? And we do have enough information to put in some stylized-fact numbers. I assume Cobb-Douglas production, with a capital share of 0.3. The capital-output ratio is about 3, implying an initial rate of return of 0.1. And the modelers at the Fed tell us that the impact of the exchange rate on net exports is about 0.15 – that is, a 10 percent rise in the dollar widens the trade deficit by about 1.5 percent of GDP.

When I plug these numbers in, assuming I’ve done the algebra right, I get a rate of convergence of .059 – that is, about 6 percent of the deviation from the long run eliminated each year. That’s pretty slow: it will take a dozen years to achieve even half the adjustment to the long run.

What this says to me is that openness to world capital markets makes a lot less difference to tax incidence than people seem to think in the short run, and even in the medium run. If you’re trying to assess the effects of tax policies over the next decade, a closed-economy analysis is probably closer to the truth than one that assumes instant equalization of returns across nations.",The Transfer Problem and Tax Incidence (Insanely Wonkish),https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/the-transfer-problem-and-tax-incidence-insanely-wonkish/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog Main&contentCollection=Opinion&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body

As many people have been pointing out, Trump’s decision to cancel cost-sharing subsidies for health plans is a rare policy trifecta: it raises prices, reduces the number of people with insurance, and costs taxpayers money. Nor is there evidence of any political strategy worthy of the name. This is policy driven by sheer spite: Trump can’t get what he wants from Congress, so he’s going to punish innocent people.

There are many lessons to be drawn from this sorry spectacle, but here’s one point I haven’t seen people making: my estimation of the odds that Trump will blow up the North American Free Trade Agreement have just gone way up.

Until now, I’ve been fairly complacent about NAFTA’s fate. It’s not that I imagine that Trump, or for that matter any of his senior advisers, has any understanding of what NAFTA does or the foreign-policy implications of tearing it down. But I thought sheer interest-group pressure would keep the agreement mostly intact. Thirty years of US-Mexico economic integration — because the process began before NAFTA, with the big Salinas trade liberalization — have created a deeply integrated North American manufacturing system. The US imports a lot from Mexico, but it exports a lot too, and much of the trade is in intermediate goods — Mexican components assembled into U.S.-assembled cars, U.S. textiles used to produce Mexican garments, and so on.

Decades of investments, not to mention choices by workers about where to live and what skills to develop, have been based around the assumption that this system will continue. So breaking it up would be hugely disruptive, and the losers would include major industrial players who tend to have the ear of even Republican administrations. So I thought we’d likely get a few cosmetic changes to the agreement, allowing Trump to declare victory and walk away.

But look what just happened on health care. Never mind the millions who may lose coverage: Trump demonstrably doesn’t care about them. But his decision will also cost insurers and health care providers, the kind of people you might expect him to listen to, billions. And he did it anyway, evidently out of sheer spite — perhaps made more intense by his sense that his presidency is rapidly failing.

So is it safe to assume that he won’t screw over much of U.S. manufacturing in the same way? At this point, the answer has to be “no.”

Look, at this point reasonable people are worried, I think rightly, that Trump’s rage and spite might lead him to start a war. So why not worry that he’ll start a trade war instead (or as well)?","Subsidies, Spite, and Supply Chains",https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/10/15/subsidies-spite-and-supply-chains/

So new economic thinking since the crisis has proved, for the most part, to consist of bad ideas that serve a conservative political agenda.

But insults aside, he offered a new analysis of corporate tax incidence – an approach that is novel, innovative, and completely boneheaded. Oh, and it just happens to say what his political masters want to hear.

As I see it, this is part of a broader pattern.

When the financial crisis struck, there were many calls for new economic ideas – even an Institute for New Economic Thinking. The implicit story, pretty much taken for granted as true, was that the crisis proved the inadequacy of economic orthodoxy and the need for fundamental new concepts. Pretty obviously, too, supporters of calls for new thinking had a sort of Hollywood script version of how it would play out: daring innovators would propose radical ideas, would face resistance from old fuddy-duddies, but would eventually win out through their superior ability to predict events.

What actually happened was very different. True, nobody saw the crisis coming. But that wasn’t because orthodoxy had no room for such a thing – on the contrary, panics and bank runs are an old topic, discussed in every principles book. The reason nobody saw this coming was an empirical failure – few realized that the rise of shadow banking had done an end run around Depression-era bank safeguards.

The point was that only the dimmest of free-market ideologues reacted with utter bewilderment. The rest of us slapped our foreheads and said, “Diamond-Dybvig! How stupid of me! Diamond-Dybvig!”

And post-crisis, pretty standard macro worked pretty well. Both fiscal policy and monetary policy did what they were supposed to (or, in the case of money, didn’t do what they weren’t supposed to) at the zero lower bound. Plenty of room for refinement, lots of opportunities to use the mother of all natural experiments for empirical work, but no huge requirement for radical new thinking.

Nonetheless, there was a proliferation of radical new concepts: contractionary fiscal policy is actually expansionary, expansionary monetary policy is actually deflationary, terrible things happen to growth when debt crosses 90 percent of GDP. These ideas instantly got huge amounts of political traction – never mind the fuddy-duddies in the economics establishment, the policy establishment leaped at the chance to apply new ideas.

What did the ideas they leaped at have in common? All of them had, implicitly or explicitly, conservative ideological implications, whether the authors intended that or not. (I’m quite sure that Reinhart-Rogoff weren’t operating out of any political agenda. Not equally sure about others.) And all of them proved, quite quickly, to be dead wrong.

So new economic thinking since the crisis has proved, for the most part, to consist of bad ideas that serve a conservative political agenda. Not exactly the script we were promised, is it?

Once you think about it, it’s not too hard to see how that happened. First of all, conventional macro has worked pretty well, so you’d need really, really brilliant innovations to make a persuasive major break with that conventionality. And really, really brilliant innovations don’t come easy. Instead, the breaks with conventional wisdom came mainly from people who, far from transcending that wisdom, simply failed to understand it in the first place.

And while there are such people on both left and right, there’s a huge asymmetry in wealth and influence between the two sides. Confused views on the left get some followers, provoke a back-and-forth on a few blogs, and generate some nasty tweets. Confused views on the right get mainlined straight into policy pronouncements by the European Commission and the leadership of the Republican Party.

Which brings me back to Hassett. Tax incidence, like macroeconomics, is a technical subject with a mainstream consensus that faces challenges from left and right. But a lot of hard work went into creating that consensus; this doesn’t mean that it’s right, but you have to come up with a really good idea to challenge it effectively.

On the other hand, you can get a lot of political traction with a really bad idea challenging the consensus, as long as it serves the interests of big money and the political right.

“The concentration of power in the hands of a few companies has the potential to hurt the economy and consumers in the long run,” said Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat who is the ranking member of the subcommittee that oversees antitrust matters. He raised concerns over Amazon’s $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods over the summer, noting that antitrust laws may need an update to account for the power internet companies have over the economy.

Amazon, which declined to comment for this article, has said that its online retail business makes up a minority of all commerce and that it is producing tens of thousands of jobs in regions that have long been in decline. The company had 180,000 full-time employees in the United States at the end of 2016, nearly double its head count five years earlier. The company has said those gains help make up for the job losses from struggling brick-and-mortar retailers.

In the span of a few weeks this summer, Linda McMahon, head of the Small Business Administration, visited Amazon’s headquarters in Seattle, where the company had small retailers on hand to talk about how Amazon had helped their businesses. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, attended the opening of a new fulfillment center in Edwardsville, Ill. And Senator Rob Portman, a Republican, visited a new fulfillment center in his home state of Ohio.

“Got to meet some of the 3,000+ Ohioans employed at this plant. #Jobs,” Mr. Portman wrote on Twitter at the time.

“They are doing all this reputation stuff around how it is creating jobs and that’s helped it generate a lot of media attention,” said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of Institute for Local Self Reliance, a nonprofit group that promotes community economic development. Last year, her organization published a paper that argued the company was making it harder for smaller retailers to make money from selling on Amazon.

Amazon has also decided in recent years to spend more money in the broader influence ecosystem of Washington. In 2016, Amazon gave more than $10,000 each to 66 think tanks, lobbying groups and political organizations. More than a dozen organizations were new to its sponsorship roster, like the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Foundation and the conservative Law & Economic Center at George Mason University.

Financing Washington’s ecosystem of research and lobbying groups is a common practice for tech companies such as Google and Microsoft, but Amazon had not been as active until recent years. Last month, it donated $50 million to a White House plan to promote computer science in classrooms.

Amazon is racing to catch up. Yet even with similar lobbying armies, Google and Facebook have not escaped criticism — in their cases over their platforms’ potential to shape public opinion.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — I’m going to do something a bit different today. I’ve spilled a few clues, but I want you to get through the puzzle yourself, mostly so you will appreciate the rest of the column. I’ve been looking for an opportunity to develop my Lewis Black impression, and this is it.

Sometimes, when I’m feeling like I haven’t yet had enough pain and humiliation in my life, I take a Zumba class. No, don’t write me letters about how I’m doing it wrong and if I would just relax I’d learn to enjoy it. No one on the entire planet has ever convinced another human being to do anything that way, especially when it comes to tripping over their own two feet. I’ve accepted my fate when it comes to Zumba.

At other times, I solve puzzles by Byron Walden. It has largely the same effect as the Zumba, minus the muscle pain. Mr. Walden, who is one of the nicest people you would ever want to meet, quietly takes his aggressions out by writing the kind of clues that make many solvers, myself included, feel a lot like this dog:

That’s called misdirection. Misdirection is when you look at a clue like 20D’s “One who tries to avoid being touched” and your brain starts to run through the names of disorders where people don’t like being touched because that’s got to be what the constructor is thinking, right, and then the answer winds up being an odd word like EPEEIST. (A “touch” is when your fencing opponent scores against you.)

It’s when you see a clue like “Fabulous speaker?” and think O.K., maybe it’s AESOP, because you’ve been trained, I mean trained, to think AESOP’s fables whenever you see the word “fabulous” in a clue, but the answer turns out to be LIAR. And he’s not wrong. Someone who tells tales is a LIAR.

As many people have been pointing out, Trump’s decision to cancel cost-sharing subsidies for health plans is a rare policy trifecta: it raises prices, reduces the number of people with insurance, and costs taxpayers money. Nor is there evidence of any political strategy worthy of the name. This is policy driven by sheer spite: Trump can’t get what he wants from Congress, so he’s going to punish innocent people.

There are many lessons to be drawn from this sorry spectacle, but here’s one point I haven’t seen people making: my estimation of the odds that Trump will blow up the North American Free Trade Agreement have just gone way up.

Until now, I’ve been fairly complacent about NAFTA’s fate. It’s not that I imagine that Trump, or for that matter any of his senior advisers, has any understanding of what NAFTA does or the foreign-policy implications of tearing it down. But I thought sheer interest-group pressure would keep the agreement mostly intact. Thirty years of US-Mexico economic integration — because the process began before NAFTA, with the big Salinas trade liberalization — have created a deeply integrated North American manufacturing system. The US imports a lot from Mexico, but it exports a lot too, and much of the trade is in intermediate goods — Mexican components assembled into U.S.-assembled cars, U.S. textiles used to produce Mexican garments, and so on.

If you use a product long or often enough, you can become vulnerable to an allergic reaction.
But these “are not necessarily unlikely to cause a reaction and may not be very effective,” Dr. Xu said.
They evaporate quickly on the skin and do not leave a greasy feeling that many consumers dislike.
Ultimately, the team concluded, “patient adherence and willingness to use a moisturizer is more important than a specific formulation or vehicle.”Ideally, moisturizers are best applied on damp skin within minutes of bathing, after patting the skin dry, to lock in moisture.","One of the most frequent complaints about skin care products like moisturizers is their all-too-common ability to trigger an allergic reaction, resulting in itchy, red, inflamed skin.

Dr. Xu and colleagues recently evaluated 174 best-selling moisturizers of different types across a price range of 10 cents an ounce to $9.51 an ounce, with special attention to the presence of allergenic ingredients. Two professional groups, the North American Contact Dermatitis Group and the American Contact Dermatitis Society, maintain reasonably up-to-date lists of moisturizers and their allergenic potential.

Lotions were by far the most popular, accounting for 59 percent of moisturizers sold, followed by creams at 13 percent, oils at 12 percent, butters at 8 percent and ointments at 2 percent. Based on the North American group’s list, the team found that only 12 percent of the best-selling moisturizers were free of allergens. The three most common allergens were fragrances, parabens and tocopherol.

Even among products labeled “fragrance-free,” 45 percent had at least one fragrance-related ingredient, the team reported. Dr. Xu said that if a company uses an ingredient that is both a preservative and a fragrance, it can still claim the product to be “fragrance-free” if preservation is the ingredient’s primary purpose.

Also, a product labeled “fragrance-free” or “unscented” could contain a masking agent (a fragrance that counters a chemical odor), a cross-reactive chemical that acts like a fragrance, or a botanical ingredient that is an allergen, Dr. Xu said.

“Fragrance labeling in the United States is really a nightmare,” he remarked. “It’s hard for dermatologists to guide patients to products that are truly fragrance-free.”

Among the 15 products claiming to be hypoallergenic, 83 percent had at least one ingredient on the allergen list, and 24 products contained five or more such ingredients. Interestingly, products that lacked any allergenic ingredients, costing on average 83 cents an ounce, “were not statistically more expensive per ounce (median, 60 cents) than products with one or more allergens,” the team found.

Furthermore, as Dr. Jonathan I. Silverberg, who directs Northwestern’s Contact Dermatitis Clinic and Eczema Center, explained, “Much of the labeling of products as hypoallergenic is nonsense. If you use a product long or often enough, you can become vulnerable to an allergic reaction. It’s not that the product is mislabeled – it’s that you can become allergic to almost anything, especially if you have a predisposition.”

An initial mild allergic reaction of itching and redness can progress to a profound reaction of stinging, burning, swelling and pain, Dr. Silverberg said. “With each exposure, the reaction gets stronger,” he said. Thus, the wise consumer with an allergic tendency might consider switching periodically to a different product and should certainly stop using any moisturizer that seems to be setting off an untoward reaction.

The American Academy of Dermatology suggests that in choosing a moisturizer, consumers wishing to avoid common allergic sensitizers pick one that is free of additives, fragrances and perfumes, though the new study showed this is clearly a challenge, even for knowledgeable physicians.

Cost is no guarantee of safety or effectiveness, the new study showed. Products labeled “dermatologist-recommended” are more expensive, but Dr. Xu said “the label doesn’t mean anything – is it 100 dermatologists, 10 dermatologists or one dermatologist?” The most expensive moisturizer his team analyzed contained the most allergens – a total of eight on the North American group’s list.

Health-conscious consumers sometimes turn to products labeled “organic” or “all-natural” for moisturizing in hopes of avoiding synthetic chemicals. But these “are not necessarily unlikely to cause a reaction and may not be very effective,” Dr. Xu said.

Olive oil, for example, increases water evaporation from the skin, he said, adding that the oils likely to be most protective and free of allergens are sunflower oil, coconut oil and shea butter.

However, for most people, moisturizing lotions, which contain more water than creams or ointments, are effective and least expensive. They evaporate quickly on the skin and do not leave a greasy feeling that many consumers dislike.

Nonetheless, people with very dry skin might invest in a cream or ointment, the cost of which is reduced by the need to use less of the product. Creams contain more water than ointments and offer what the team called “a middle ground” for people who dislike the greasiness of ointments. Ultimately, the team concluded, “patient adherence and willingness to use a moisturizer is more important than a specific formulation or vehicle.”

Made-up sob stories about family farms broken up to pay inheritance taxes, magical claims about self-financing tax cuts, and so on go all the way back to the 1970s. But the selling of tax cuts under Trump has taken things to a whole new level, both in terms of the brazenness of the lies and their sheer number. Both the depth and the breadth of the dishonesty make it hard even for those of us who do this for a living to keep track.

In fact, when I set out to make a list of the bigger lies, I thought there would be six or seven, and was surprised to come up with ten.

So I thought it might be useful, both for myself and for others, to put together a crib sheet: a fairly long-form description of ten big lies Trump and allies are telling, what they’ve said, and how we know that they are lies. I’m probably missing some stuff, and for all I know some new big lie will have been tweeted out by the time this is posted. But we do what we can. So here we go.

Lie #1: America is the most highly-taxed country in the world

This is a Trump special: he’s said it many, many times, most recently just this past week. Each time, fact-checkers have piled on to point out that it’s false. Here’s taxes as a percentage of GDP, from the OECD:

Photo

The blue bar is the US; the red bar the average for advanced countries.

Why does Trump keep repeating what even he has to know by now is a flat lie? I suspect it’s a power thing: he enjoys showing that he can lie repeatedly through his teeth, be caught red-handed in his lie again and again, and his followers will still believe him rather than the “fake news” media.

Lie #2: The estate tax is destroying farmers and truckers

Tales of struggling family farms disbanded because they can’t afford the taxes when the patriarch dies have flourished for decades, despite the absence of any examples. I don’t mean examples are rare: I mean that advocates of estate tax repeal haven’t been able to come up with a single example at least since the late 1970s, when exemption levels were raised to the equivalent of around $2 million in today’s dollars.

Lately Trump has added a new twist, portraying the estate tax as a terrible burden on hard-working truckers. For who among us doesn’t own an $11 million fleet of trucks?

The reality, as this graphic from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows, is that only a small number of very large estates pay any tax at all, and only a tiny fraction of those tax-paying estates are small businesses or family farms:

Photo

In fact, since transportation and warehousing are only 3 percent of GDP and farming less than 1 percent, it seems quite possible that this year only 2 or 3 truckers and not a single farmer will pay any estate tax.

Lie #3: Taxation of pass-through entities is a burden on small business

Most businesses in the United States, at least for tax purposes, aren’t what we normally think of as corporations subject to profits taxes. Instead, they’re partnerships, sole proprietorships, and S corporations whose earnings are simply “passed through”: counted as part of their owners’ personal income and taxed accordingly.

Trump wants to change that, and let owners simply pay a 15 25 percent tax on the earnings of pass-through entities, with no further taxes owed. This is being billed as a reduction in the burden on hard-working small business owners.

But as the Tax Policy Center explains, many middle-income households who own pass-through entities aren’t running businesses; they generally derive only a small fraction of their income from these entities:

Rather, they may receive occasional income from the rental of a vacation home, or from the sale of odds and ends on eBay, that they report as business income.

High-income owners of such entities, by contrast, get a lot of money from them – but they’re not struggling small business people:

This high-income group is made up of doctors, lawyers, consultants, other professionals, and, at the very highest end, partners in hedge funds or other investment firms.

And these are, of course, the people who would gain massively from the Trump proposal. The vast majority of Americans are in a tax bracket of 15 percent or less, so even if they control a pass-through entity, the Trump tax break is worth nothing to them:

Photo

High-income individuals, however, would gain a lot by paying 15 25 percent instead of the much higher rates they pay at the margin – 39.6 percent right now. And they’d also have a strong incentive to rearrange their affairs so that more of their income pops up in their pass-throughs. This wouldn’t be small-business creation; it wouldn’t add jobs; it would just be tax avoidance. That’s what happened when Kansas tried something similar, and played a big role in the state’s fiscal disaster.

So this isn’t a tax break for small business, it’s a tax break for, surprise, wealthy individuals.

Lie #4: Cutting profits taxes really benefits workers

Tax incidence is a headache-inducing subject at best, and my sense is that even the tax policy experts have gotten behind the curve in thinking through the implications of global capital markets for the subject. But I think there’s a way to cut through at least some of the confusion.

Think about what happens if you cut the taxes on corporate profits. The immediate impact is that (duh) corporations have more money. Why would they spend that extra money on hiring more workers or increasing their wages?

Not, surely, out of the goodness of their hearts – and not in response to worker demands, because these days nobody cares what workers think.

Now, they might be inclined to invest more, increasing the demand for labor and therefore raising wages indirectly while competing pre-tax profits down. But there are a couple of major slippages in this story.

First, a lot of corporate profits aren’t a return on physical capital and won’t be competed down if capital gets cheaper. Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others derive their profits from technological advantages, brand name, and market power; cutting the taxes on those profits just leaves their owners with more money.

Second, to raise wages a tax cut must raise the overall stock of capital, which means it must lead to higher total investment spending. Where does the money for that increase in investment come from? The tax cuts are unlikely to raise national saving.

The money might come from abroad, via capital inflows. But the flip side of those capital inflows would be a bigger trade deficit – hardly what the proponents of tax cuts are advertising – and in any case running trade deficits on the required scale is a much more problematic thing than people seem to realize. The dollar would have to rise sharply – and the strength of the dollar would itself deter foreign investment, very much slowing the process of wage rise.

So for an extended period – at least 5 years, probably much more — cutting profits taxes is good for owners of corporations. Workers, not so much.

Lie #5: Repatriating overseas profits will create jobs

For tax reasons, corporations hold a lot of money in overseas tax shelters. Tax cutters always claim that lower rates and/or an amnesty will bring that money home and create a lot of jobs.

So, first of all, there isn’t really a Scrooge McDuck-type pile of cash hidden overseas, ready to be put to work if the taxman will let it. Those overseas accounts are just an accounting device, which have very little real effect. Many of the companies with big overseas hoards also have plenty of idle cash at home; what’s holding them back is a lack of perceived opportunities, not cash flow. And even those who don’t have surplus cash can easily borrow at near-record low interest rates; remember, they can always use the overseas cash to secure their loans.

And we have solid empirical evidence here. In 2004 the U.S. enacted the Homeland Investment Act, which offered a tax holiday for repatriation of foreign earnings by U.S. multinationals. Careful study of its effects tells us that

Repatriations did not lead to an increase in domestic investment, employment or R&D — even for the firms that lobbied for the tax holiday stating these intentions and for firms that appeared to be financially constrained. Instead, a $1 increase in repatriations was associated with an increase of almost $1 in payouts to shareholders.

Lie #6: This is not a tax cut for the rich

Trump says it isn’t, so that’s that, right? Oh, wait.

Actually, if you look at the major provisions of the Unified Framework, the big items are (i) Cuts in corporate taxes (ii) Pass-through tax cut (iii) elimination of the estate tax (iv) cut in top marginal rate. All these strongly favor very high incomes – and everything else is small change. Hence the Tax Policy Center estimate:

Administration flacks and defenders are accusing TPC of reaching conclusions without adequate information; but the administration is making lots of assertions about what its plan will do, with apparently no more information than the center. Furthermore, given the general shape of the plan there’s no way it can fail to be very much a gift to the already very rich.

Lie #7: It’s a big tax cut for the middle class

See Lie #6 above. All the big provisions benefit the rich, not the middle class. What’s left is mostly small change – and some of it, like ending deductibility of state and local taxes and other deductions, actually raises taxes on a substantial number of middle-class Americans.

In total, by 2027, according to TPC, 80 percent of the tax cut goes to the top 1 percent; only 12 percent to the middle three quintiles.

Lie #8: It won’t increase the deficit

OK, we’re looking at big cuts in corporate taxes, elimination of the estate tax, lower rates on high-income individuals, and a massive new tax-avoidance loophole. How can this not increase the budget deficit?

The only answer would be if the tax proposal eliminated vast swathes of the existing set of tax deductions, massively broadening the tax base. It doesn’t. The only even halfway biggish thing here is the state and local deductibility end – and that is already in very big political trouble. This is a multi-trillion-dollar budget buster, unless it summons up deep voodoo. But …

Lie #9: Cutting taxes will jump-start rapid growth

Insistence in the magical power of tax cuts is the ultimate zombie lie of U.S. policy discussion; nothing can kill it. And we know why: there’s a lot of money behind the proposition that great things will happen if you cut the donors’ taxes. It’s difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.

Still, for the record: Reagan cut taxes, and although his administration began with a terrible recession, there was a fast recovery thereafter. Some of us think Paul Volcker had more to do with both the recession and the recovery than anything coming from the White House; but in any case we have more evidence.

For Bill Clinton raised taxes, amid cries from the right that he would destroy the economy. Instead he presided over a boom that surpassed Reagan in every dimension. For what it’s worth, I don’t think this boom was Clinton’s doing. But it certainly refuted the proposition that cutting taxes is both necessary and sufficient for prosperity.

Then Bush the younger cut taxes, and there were many hosannahs about the “Bush boom.” What he actually got was a lackluster recovery, followed by an epic crash.

Finally, Obama inherited the aftermath of that crash, and despite scorched-earth opposition from Republicans the economy gradually clawed its way back. Then in 2013 Obama first raised taxes substantially, then implemented the Affordable Care Act, again amid cries of disaster from the right. The economy did fine.

Oh, and there were the recent state-level experiments. Sam Brownback slashed taxes in Kansas, promising an economic miracle; all he got was a fiscal crisis. Jerry Brown raised taxes in California, amid predictions of – you guessed it – disaster; the economy boomed, and the main problem is a housing shortage.

There is nothing, nothing at all, in this history that would make any open-minded person believe that the Trump tax plan will cause dramatically accelerated growth.

Lie #10: Tax cuts will pay for themselves

If tax cuts don’t generate an economic miracle, it’s hard for them to generate a revenue surge that makes up for lower rates. True, some hidden money may come out of the woodwork and show up as taxable income, even if GDP doesn’t rise. But this effect hasn’t historically been anywhere big enough to offset the direct losses from lower taxes. Reagan’s tax cuts led to deficits, Clinton’s tax hike to surpluses; Jerry Brown presided over California’s fiscal revitalization, Sam Brownback over a fiscal crisis that eventually prompted the legislature to overrule him and raise taxes again.

So there we are: ten big tax-cut lies. That was pretty exhausting, actually – and as I said, I’ve probably missed a few, and/or Trump will invent some new ones. But I hope this ends up being a useful reference.","Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies",https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/lies-lies-lies-lies-lies-lies-lies-lies-lies-lies/

Right now it looks as if tax “reform” — actually it’s just cuts — may go the way of Obamacare repeal. Initial assessments of the plan are brutal, and administration attempts to spin things in a positive direction will suffer from loss of credibility on multiple fronts, from obvious lies about the plan itself, to spreading corruption scandals, to the spectacle of the tweeter-in-chief golfing while Puerto Rico drowns.

Now, it ain’t over until the portly golfer sings. But still, it’s worth spending a few minutes on why a fresh debacle seems likely.

The important point is that there are crucial links between the health care faceplant and the bad news (for the GOP) on taxes — links both causal and, you might say, cultural.

Republicans took power in January determined to cut taxes on the wealthy, bigly. That has, after all, been the GOP establishment’s overriding priority for four decades; it’s what donors demand.

But they’re somewhat constrained by concerns about deficits. It’s not that they themselves care about red ink: nobody with influence in the GOP has ever cared about federal debt, least of all the deficit peacocks who preened and posed as apostles of fiscal responsibility. But all that posturing makes budget-busting tax cuts awkward. And procedural issues in the Senate also make it hard to do too much budget-busting without 60 seats.

One important goal of ACA repeal was to loosen those constraints, by repealing the high-end tax hikes that paid for Obamacare, hence giving a big break to the donor class. Having failed to do that, Rs are under even more pressure to deliver the goods to the wealthy through tax cuts.

But deficits are a constraint, even if not a hard one. Now, Republicans have always claimed that they can cut tax rates without losing revenue by closing loopholes. But they’ve always avoided saying anything about which loopholes they’d close; they promised to shift the tax burden away from their donors onto [TK], some mystery group. It was magic asterisk city; it was “Don’t tax you, don’t tax me, tax that fellow behind the tree” on steroids.

But as they sidle up toward actual legislation, they need to start getting specific: the shifts need to get real. So where will the money come from?

The bright answer in Trumpcuts is, end the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT). This probably sounded like a good idea: hey, it will punish blue states, which foolishly collect a lot of taxes to do things like feed people and treat their illnesses.

But there are a lot of Republican voters in blue states, and even a significant number of Republican Congressmen. And who are these voters? By and large, affluent but not super-rich households — hence with relatively high marginal tax rates — for whom deductibility of SALT is a big deal. As the details of the plan sink in, these people will scream bloody murder, and their representatives will become a big problem for the leadership.

So what were they thinking? My guess is that they weren’t thinking. What we learned from health care was that after 8 years, Republicans had never bothered to learn anything about the issues. There’s every reason to believe that the same is true for the distribution of tax changes, which Paul Ryan called a “ridiculous” issue and presumably nobody in his party ever tried to understand.

So now the lies and willful ignorance are catching up with them — again.",Shifts Get Real: Understanding the GOP’s Policy Quagmire,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/09/30/shifts-get-real-understanding-the-gops-policy-quagmire/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog Main&contentCollection=Opinion&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body

This is where Alan Jacobs’s absolutely splendid forthcoming book “How to Think” comes in. If Thaler’s work is essential for understanding how the market can go astray, Jacobs’s emphasis on the relational nature of thinking is essential for understanding why there is so much bad thinking in political life right now.

Jacobs makes good use of C. S. Lewis’s concept of the Inner Ring. In every setting — a school, a company or a society — there is an official hierarchy. But there may also be a separate prestige hierarchy, where the cool kids are. They are the Inner Ring.

There are always going to be people who desperately want to get into the Inner Ring and will cut all sorts of intellectual corners to be accepted. As Lewis put it, “The passion for the Inner Ring is most skillful in making a man who is not yet a very bad man do very bad things.”

People will, for example, identify and attack what Jacobs calls the Repugnant Cultural Other — the group that is opposed to the Inner Ring, which must be assaulted to establish membership in it.

Other people will resent the Inner Ring, and they will cut all sorts of intellectual corners in order to show their resentment. These people are quick to use combat metaphors when they talk about thinking (he shot down my argument, your claims are indefensible). These people will adopt shared vague slurs like “cuckservative” or “whitesplaining” that signal to the others in the outsider groups that they are attacking the ring, even though these slurs are usually impediments to thought.

Jacobs notices that when somebody uses “in other words” to summarize another’s argument, what follows is almost invariably a ridiculous caricature of that argument, in order to win favor with the team. David Foster Wallace once called such people Snoots. Their motto is, “We Are the Few, the Proud, the More or Less Constantly Appalled at Everyone Else.”

Jacobs nicely shows how our thinking processes emerge from emotional life and moral character. If your heart and soul are twisted, your response to the world will be, too. He argues that by diagnosing our own ills, we can begin to combat them. And certainly I can think of individual beacons of intellectual honesty today: George Packer, Tyler Cowen, Scott Alexander and Caitlin Flanagan, among many.

But I’d say that if social life can get us into trouble, social life can get us out. After all, think of how you really persuade people. Do you do it by writing thoughtful essays that carefully marshal facts? That works some of the time. But the real way to persuade people is to create an attractive community that people want to join. If you do that, they’ll bend their opinions to yours. If you want people to be reasonable, create groups where it’s cool to be reasonable.

Jacobs mentions that at the Yale Political Union members are admired if they can point to a time when a debate totally changed their mind on something. That means they take evidence seriously; that means they can enter into another’s mind-set. It means they treat debate as a learning exercise and not just as a means to victory.

How many public institutions celebrate these virtues? The U.S. Senate? Most TV talk shows? Even the universities?

“We believe the Cuban government could stop the attacks on our diplomats,” John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, told reporters last week when asked about Cuba’s role. Administration officials said on Monday that Mr. Trump had merely been making the same point when he said that Cuba was “responsible” for the misdeeds.

Some of the people targeted worked for the Central Intelligence Agency’s station in Havana, according to former and current United States officials. As recently as last week, officials said, the United States government had not determined who was culpable for the attacks, in which some victims reported hearing a piercing sound and others experienced symptoms consistent with traumatic brain injury.

The president also appeared to diverge from his staff on Monday regarding his coming trip to Asia.

The White House announced that Mr. Trump would travel next month to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines, where he is to meet with President Rodrigo Duterte, who has been accused by human rights groups of extrajudicial killings. Asked about the trip, Mr. Trump appeared to hedge over his willingness to visit the Philippines.

“We’ve been invited to the Philippines; I may be going to the Philippines,” Mr. Trump said, hours after his itinerary had been announced. “We haven’t set the details as of this moment.”

The remarks suggest that Mr. Trump is not satisfied with the outcome of an internal White House debate over whether he should visit the Philippines for an annual meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

His aides had been reluctant to schedule the trip because it would entail a meeting with Mr. Duterte, an authoritarian leader who is prone to outbursts. But they ultimately decided the stop was worthwhile, partly to avoid undercutting a longstanding alliance with the Philippines, and to ensure the United States plays a role at the summit meeting, rather than allowing China to dominate the gathering.

Still, Mr. Trump, who initially lavished praise on Mr. Duterte, has soured on him in recent months, after the Filipino leader said he might be too busy to accept an invitation to the White House and called the United States “lousy.” Mr. Trump has told advisers he does not want to meet with Mr. Duterte, according to a person familiar with the plans.

Among the other issues to be ironed out with his trip to Asia, Mr. Trump said on Monday, was whether he would go to the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea, a traditional stop for American presidents who have visited Seoul since the Korean War.

Mr. Trump, asked whether setting foot there would provoke Pyongyang, said he did not know.

Jimmy Kimmel Goes Home to New York City

Jimmy Kimmel on Monday began a week of broadcasts from the Brooklyn Academy of Music. He usually tapes “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” in Hollywood, but decided to do his show this week from the town where he was born. He could hardly get started without taking a jab at Brooklyn’s reputation for liberal pretentiousness — something it didn’t have during his childhood.

“In honor of our show being here in Brooklyn, all of the jokes you will hear tonight were written in small batches, by hand, on biodegradable hemp parchment, using natural ink that was made from sustainably harvested lingonberries. So rest assured, this is all artisanal tonight.” — JIMMY KIMMEL

Mr. Kimmel is making the broadcasts even more special by having Paul Shaffer, David Letterman’s former musical director and sidekick, sit in with the house band all week. On Monday, Mr. Shaffer took a car ride with Mr. Kimmel — and some very surprised passengers.

Mr. Kimmel also welcomed his fellow comic Amy Schumer, who reminisced about her own childhood in Brooklyn.

... And Trevor Noah Goes to Chicago

Mr. Kimmel isn’t the only late-night host on the road this week. Trevor Noah is hosting “The Daily Show” from Chicago. (Meanwhile, most other hosts are taking the week off.) Mr. Noah started his show on Monday wondering why President Trump and many conservatives seem to relish bemoaning Chicago’s high murder rate.

“People in politics, especially on the right, they always point fingers at Chicago. And it’s weird, because there are other cities with higher murder rates: St. Louis, Baltimore, Memphis, Cleveland. But no one’s ever like, ‘Oh, don’t go to Cleveland.’ Well, they are, but not because of murder.” — TREVOR NOAH

Mr. Noah played clips from Fox News in which commentators suggest that President Barack Obama bears the blame for Chicago’s violence.

In absolute numbers, the population of immigrants in Los Angeles, Oakland and other California metropolitan areas dwarfs that of Sonoma County. But immigrants play a significant role here: nearly one-fifth of the residents in Santa Rosa’s metropolitan area are foreign-born, according to an analysis by Manuel Pastor, a professor at the University of Southern California who studies immigration. Latin American immigrants, mainly from Mexico, dominate the blue-collar work force.

Immigrant enclaves straddle Sebastopol Road, a thoroughfare in Santa Rosa lined with Latino-owned restaurants, supermarkets and gown shops catering to teenage girls celebrating their quinceañeras. Coffey Park, a Santa Rosa neighborhood that is home to many foreign-born residents, was devastated by blazes lit by flaming embers that flew across a six-lane highway.

Immigrants make up a majority of the 55,000 people employed by the wine industry and are also ubiquitous in the kitchens of farm-to-table restaurants and ritzy resorts that make the region a magnet for affluent tourists.

Sonoma County also has some of the highest rents in the country, on a par with the San Francisco Bay Area. But pay here tends to be lower than in the city.

In San Francisco, housekeepers at unionized hotels earn about $23 an hour, compared with $11 to $13 an hour in Sonoma County, according to Unite Here, the union that represents room cleaners in those areas.

“It’s extremely expensive to live in Sonoma County, and rents keep going up,” said Wei-Ling Huber, president of Unite Here in the region, “The fire is only going to exacerbate the housing crisis.”

Indeed, it is not uncommon for immigrants who earn $40,000 annually to pay $1,800 a month in rent in Santa Rosa, and anecdotal evidence suggests that prices have been rising since the fires swept through.

Manuel Vieyra was paying $1,650 a month to rent a three-bedroom house. Having endured a traumatic escape as his house went up in flames last week, his family is now struggling to find a place they can afford.

“They’re asking $2,000, even $2,800 a month,” he said. “I don’t know what we’ll do.” The family, which lost everything, also needs to scrounge up the money to replace their car, which his wife used to reach her housekeeping job, and his work truck.

Mr. Vieyra, a 51-year-old father of three, works in high-end residential construction and has lived in Sonoma County since he crossed the border as a teenager to work in the vineyards of Sebastopol.

His family is camping out at a friend’s small house, rather than in one of the shelters, out of concern that Mr. Vieyra and his wife, Fabiola, who are both undocumented Mexicans, could be arrested.

Spanish-language media and advocacy groups have publicized that federal immigration authorities will not be conducting enforcement actions in areas affected by the fires. Senator Kamala Harris, the California Democrat, tweeted over the weekend that she had “personally confirmed” that policy with the acting Homeland Security secretary, Elaine Duke.

But at a tidy, comfortable shelter at the Finley Community Center in Santa Rosa, there appeared to be no Latinos in sight on Sunday, not even in the semiprivate “family suites.”

Even those who did not lose their homes have had their lives upended.

For years, Manuel Correa has tended the gardens of 40 homes in an exclusive subdivision in Santa Rosa. At least 10 of the houses were destroyed, and another 25 were evacuated. Mr. Correa and his crew have not worked for a week.

“I’m worried about how we’ll manage; there are so many bills,” said Mr. Correa, 29, who has two young children and another on the way. His monthly rent is $2,000.

No one expects a prolonged work shortage, as cleanup and reconstruction will create a demand for cheap labor, and the vineyards were largely untouched.

The question is whether the workers can find places to stay.

Unlike other victims of the wildfires, undocumented immigrants do not qualify for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. They also do not qualify for unemployment and welfare benefits.

A coalition of immigrant-service providers and advocates on Sunday started Undocufund, a fund-raising effort for undocumented families affected by the fires. By Monday, it had raised about $44,000. The Sonoma County Grape Growers Foundation plans to announce a fund on Tuesday to help farmworkers pay their rent, find housing and refurnish their dwellings.

Duff Bevill, head of Bevill Vineyard Management, which harvests his vineyards and those of 30 other growers in Sonoma County, was already planning to build a dormitory to house 38 seasonal workers that he hopes to bring in from Mexico. He intends to use a visa program for farmworkers that requires employers to provide housing.

In the past, that rule and other red tape have led many farmers to bypass the visa program and hire workers who overwhelmingly are undocumented. But more farms in the wine country could soon be forced to consider providing housing.

Mr. Bevill attended a meeting on Sunday with county supervisors, Hispanic community leaders, business representatives and farmers to discuss rebuilding Sonoma County. One of the biggest risks they identified was the loss of workers.

“The first thing that will start happening is, people who work in vineyards, hotels and restaurants will lose access to affordable housing and start leaving,” Mr. Bevill said. “At some point, workers are going to say they can’t find a place to live, and they’re going to leave.”","As Fires Move On, Wine Country Wonders Whether Immigrants Will, Too",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/us/california-fires-immigrants.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

We who are gathered here tonight in an unconsecrated theater in Brooklyn have been asked to join in a holy invocation, beginning with “Oh, Lord,” as we raise cups filled with – not communion wine – but sacred Coca-Cola. Of course, if our faiths lean in other directions, we are told, we may substitute “Oh, goddess,” “Oh, goodness” or, if we believe in nothing, “O.K.”

“It’s the greatest fireworks show in the universe,” said David Reitze of the California Institute of Technology and the executive director of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO.

Daniel Holz, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago and a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, a larger group that studies gravitational waves, said, “I can’t think of a similar situation in the field of science in my lifetime, where a single event provides so many staggering insights about our universe.”

The key to the discovery was the detection of gravitational waves, emanating like ripples in a pond vibrating the cosmic fabric, from the distant galaxy. It was a century ago that Albert Einstein predicted that space and time could shake like a bowl of jelly when massive things like black holes moved around. But such waves were finally confirmed only in 2016, when LIGO recorded the sound of two giant black holes colliding, causing a sensation that eventually led this month to a Nobel Prize.

For the researchers, this is in some ways an even bigger bonanza than the original discovery. This is the first time they have discovered anything that regular astronomers could see and study. All of LIGO’s previous discoveries have involved colliding black holes, which are composed of empty tortured space-time — there is nothing for the eye or the telescope to see.

But neutron stars are full of stuff, matter packed at the density of Mount Everest in a teaspoon. When neutron stars slam together, all kinds of things burst out: gamma rays, X-rays, radio waves. Something for everyone who has a window on the sky.

“Joy for all,” said David Shoemaker, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is the spokesman for the LIGO Scientific Collaboration.

This is the story of a gold rush in the sky.

It began on the morning of Aug. 17, Eastern time. Dr. Shoemaker was on a Skype call when alarms went off. One of the LIGO antennas, in Hanford, Wash., had recorded an auspicious signal and sent out an automatic alert. Twin antennas, in Washington and Livingston, Louisiana, monitor the distance between a pair of mirrors to detect the submicroscopic stretching and squeezing of space caused by a passing gravitational wave. Transformed into sound, the Hanford signal was a long 100-second chirp, that ended in a sudden whoop to 1000 cycles per second, two octaves above middle C. Such a high frequency indicated that whatever was zooming around was lighter than a black hole.

Checking the data from Livingston to find out why it had not also phoned in an alert, Dr. Shoemaker and his colleagues found a big glitch partly obscuring the same chirp.

Meanwhile, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, which orbits Earth looking at the highest-energy radiation in the universe, recorded a brief flash of gamma rays just two seconds after the LIGO chirp. Fermi sent out its own alert. The gamma-ray burst lasted about two seconds, which put it in a category of short gamma ray bursts, which astronomers suspect are neutron stars colliding.

“When we saw that,” Dr. Shoemaker said, “the adrenaline hit.”

Dr. Kalogera, who was in Utah hiking and getting ready for August’s total solar eclipse when she got the alarm, recalled thinking: “Oh my God, this is it. This 50-year-old mystery, the holy grail, is solved.”

Together the two signals told a tale of a pair of neutron stars spiraling around each other like the blades of a kitchen blender.

But where?

Luckily the European Virgo antenna had joined the gravitational wave network only two weeks before, and it also showed a faint chirp at the same time. The fact that it was so weak allowed the group to localize the signal to a small region of the sky in the Hydra constellation that was in Virgo’s blind spot.

The hunt was on. By then Hydra was setting in the southern sky. It would be 11 hours before astronomers in Chile could take up the chase.

One of them was Ryan Foley, who was working with a team on the Swope telescope run by the Carnegie Institution on Cerro Las Campanas in Chile. His team made a list of the biggest galaxies in that region and set off to photograph them all systematically.

The fireball showed up in the ninth galaxy photographed, as a new bluish pinprick of light in the outer regions of NGC 4993, a swirl of stars about 130 million light-years from here. “These are the first optical photons from a kilonova humankind has ever collected,” Dr. Foley said.

Within 10 minutes, another group of astronomers, led by Marcelle Soares-Santos of Brandeis University and using the Dark Energy Camera, which could photograph large parts of the sky with a telescope at the nearby Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory, had also spotted the same speck of light.

Emails went flying about in the Chilean night.

When it was first identified, the fireball of 8,000-degree gas was about the size of Neptune’s orbit and radiating about 200 million times as much energy as the sun.

Nine days later, the orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory detected X-rays coming from the location of the burst, and a week after that, the Very Large Array in New Mexico recorded radio emissions. By then the fireball faded from blue to red.

From all this, scientists have begun patching together a tentative story of what happened in the NGC 4993 galaxy.

“It’s actually surprising how well we were able to anticipate what we’re seeing,” said Brian David Metzger, a theorist at Columbia University who coined the term kilonova back in 2010.

As they tell it, the merging objects were probably survivors of stars that had been orbiting each other and had each puffed up and then died in the supernova explosions in which massive stars end their luminous lives some 11 billion years ago, according to an analysis by Dr. Kalogera. Making reasonable assumptions about their spins, these neutron stars were about 1.1 and 1.6 times as massive as the sun, smack in the known range of neutron stars.

As they approached each other swirling a thousand times a second, tidal forces bulged their surfaces outward. Quite a bit of what Dr. Metzger called “neutron star guts” were ejected and formed a fat doughnut around the merging stars.

At the moment they touched , a shock wave squeezed more material out of their polar regions, but the doughnut and extreme magnetic fields confined the material into an ultra-high-speed jet emitting a blitzkrieg of radiation, the gamma rays.",LIGO Detects Fierce Collision of Neutron Stars for the First Time,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/science/ligo-neutron-stars-collision.html

Both right and left are dividing into upswinger and downswinger camps. Among Republicans the upswingers embrace capitalist dynamism, global engagement and the open movement of people and ideas. The downswingers embrace ethnic and national cohesion and closed borders.

On the left it’s between those who believe the only realistic path is to reform existing structures and those who think they are so broken we need to start over.

The downswinger mind-set is similar across left and right. Because of the loss of faith in progress downswingers have a baseline mood of pessimism, protest and anger. They are marked by a deep social distrust and a bent toward conspiracy thinking. They disrespect codes of etiquette that traditionally regulate public life and crack down on opposing speech.

Politics gets nasty in these “hatchet” periods because downswingers have a tropism toward ethnic and identity politics. If you’ve lost faith in universal progress, if you think everything is a zero-sum scramble for slices of a stagnant or shrinking pie, then of course you are going to see your ethnic identity marker as essential and all defining. You are going to embrace a sense of victimhood and feel that the great parade of historic wrongs is going to determine what comes next. History controls the future.

Politics also gets nasty in these periods because personal grievance gets intermingled with social grievance. If you feel aggrieved about your own personal status in society then political life is not just a disagreement about means, it’s perceived as a status war against those who seem to think they are better than you. Downswinging populists are taking over the Republican Party. Regular Republicans like Ed Gillespie in Virginia have to adopt the tone and poses of the downswingers to try to win votes.

The Democrats are a bit behind. But the center-left parties have collapsed all over Europe. There’s no reason to think that won’t happen in the U.S.

In 1994, 65 percent of Democrats believed “most people who want to get ahead can make it if they’re willing to work hard.” Now only 49 percent of Democrats believe that. That’s a 16 point shift from an optimistic, progress-embracing view toward a pessimistic, system-doubting view.

The best thing upswingers can do in these times is to respect the downswinger critique — we’re in this moment for a reason — without falling for its ultimate pessimism. But the global populist tide is not going to be held off just by passing a new tax cut or a few other bills. There has to be economic, social and political solidarity with those left behind, as well as penance from those who did the leaving. There has to be a convincing story of where we are in history. There has to be a new moral order that affords dignity to those who feel insulted. Upswingers will have to conserve our basic institutions that continue to produce real benefits, while reforming them with what Glenn Tinder once called a hesitant radicalism.

Intel said its intent “was to convey the performance capabilities of our processors through the visual metaphor of a sprinter,” but acknowledged, “Unfortunately, our execution did not deliver our intended message and in fact proved to be insensitive and insulting.”

In 2011, Dove was criticized for another ad: this one showing three women standing side by side, each with lighter skin than the woman next to her. Behind them were signs reading “before” and “after”; the “before” sign, positioned behind an African-American woman, showed cracked skin, while the “after” sign, behind a white woman, showed smooth skin.

The fact that the most recent ad was Dove’s second to cause offense was not lost on social media users.

Popchips, May 2012

Popchips drew fire in 2012 for an ad in which Ashton Kutcher played several characters — including a Bollywood producer named Raj, complete with brownface and an Indian accent.

Popchips initially urged viewers to watch the ad in the humorous “spirit it was intended.” Later, its chief executive, Keith Belling, said in a statement: “Our team worked hard to create a lighthearted parody featuring a variety of characters that was meant to provide a few laughs. We did not intend to offend anyone. I take full responsibility and apologize to anyone we offended.”

Qiaobi, May 2016

In a 2016 commercial for the Chinese company Qiaobi’s laundry detergent, an Asian woman shoves a detergent pod into a black man’s mouth and puts him in a washing machine, from which he emerges as a light-skinned Asian.

A spokeswoman for Qiaobi, Xu Chunyan, was unapologetic. “We did this for some sensational effect,” she said at the time. “If we just show laundry like all the other advertisements, ours will not stand out.”

In April, the skin care company Nivea released a deodorant ad that read, “White is purity.” White supremacists on the internet took note, with one 4chan user writing, “Nivea has chosen our side.”

A representative of Nivea’s parent company, Beiersdorf, said it had “never intended to hurt anybody or to raise any wrong interpretation.”

“His advocacy for this legislation demonstrates that Congressman Marino either does not fully understand the scope and devastation of this epidemic or ties to industry overrode those concerns,” Mr. Manchin wrote. “Either option leaves him unfit to serve as the head of the” drug office.

Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, said she was introducing legislation to repeal the law that Mr. Marino helped pass. “Media reports indicate that this law has significantly affected the government’s ability to crack down on opioid distributors that are failing to meet their obligations and endangering our communities,” Ms. McCaskill said.

Right now it looks as if tax “reform” — actually it’s just cuts — may go the way of Obamacare repeal. Initial assessments of the plan are brutal, and administration attempts to spin things in a positive direction will suffer from loss of credibility on multiple fronts, from obvious lies about the plan itself, to spreading corruption scandals, to the spectacle of the tweeter-in-chief golfing while Puerto Rico drowns.

Now, it ain’t over until the portly golfer sings. But still, it’s worth spending a few minutes on why a fresh debacle seems likely.

The important point is that there are crucial links between the health care faceplant and the bad news (for the GOP) on taxes — links both causal and, you might say, cultural.

Republicans took power in January determined to cut taxes on the wealthy, bigly. That has, after all, been the GOP establishment’s overriding priority for four decades; it’s what donors demand.

But they’re somewhat constrained by concerns about deficits. It’s not that they themselves care about red ink: nobody with influence in the GOP has ever cared about federal debt, least of all the deficit peacocks who preened and posed as apostles of fiscal responsibility. But all that posturing makes budget-busting tax cuts awkward. And procedural issues in the Senate also make it hard to do too much budget-busting without 60 seats.

One important goal of ACA repeal was to loosen those constraints, by repealing the high-end tax hikes that paid for Obamacare, hence giving a big break to the donor class. Having failed to do that, Rs are under even more pressure to deliver the goods to the wealthy through tax cuts.

But deficits are a constraint, even if not a hard one. Now, Republicans have always claimed that they can cut tax rates without losing revenue by closing loopholes. But they’ve always avoided saying anything about which loopholes they’d close; they promised to shift the tax burden away from their donors onto [TK], some mystery group. It was magic asterisk city; it was “Don’t tax you, don’t tax me, tax that fellow behind the tree” on steroids.

But as they sidle up toward actual legislation, they need to start getting specific: the shifts need to get real. So where will the money come from?

The bright answer in Trumpcuts is, end the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT). This probably sounded like a good idea: hey, it will punish blue states, which foolishly collect a lot of taxes to do things like feed people and treat their illnesses.

But there are a lot of Republican voters in blue states, and even a significant number of Republican Congressmen. And who are these voters? By and large, affluent but not super-rich households — hence with relatively high marginal tax rates — for whom deductibility of SALT is a big deal. As the details of the plan sink in, these people will scream bloody murder, and their representatives will become a big problem for the leadership.

So what were they thinking? My guess is that they weren’t thinking. What we learned from health care was that after 8 years, Republicans had never bothered to learn anything about the issues. There’s every reason to believe that the same is true for the distribution of tax changes, which Paul Ryan called a “ridiculous” issue and presumably nobody in his party ever tried to understand.

Only once did a snake manage to sink its fangs in a rat deep enough to inject venom, and it wasn’t enough to stop the rat from getting away and recovering.

The rats also seemed to be able to prevent strikes, by so-called “predator deterrent” actions like kicking sand at the snake, drumming its foot, jumping back or going up to investigate the snake. According to some thinking about how prey and predator interact, these actions are ways for a prey animal to show off how quick or strong it is, essentially saying, “Forget about trying to catch me, you don’t have a chance.”

Mr. Trump had campaigned against Mr. Moore and headlined a rally for the incumbent who lost, Senator Luther Strange.

Disaster Relief

‘The Puerto Rico situation — it’s been outstanding’

Mr. Trump said he spoke to Gov. Jerry Brown Jr. of California about the devastating fires that ravaged Northern California last week. He also cited “an A-plus” approval rating that James Lee Witt, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency under President Bill Clinton, gave to the Trump administration’s response in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.

Mr. Trump spoke of “tremendous amounts of water” and “massive amounts of food” being distributed across Puerto Rico by FEMA workers and the military.

“You look at the governor of Puerto Rico — he himself has said we’ve done an outstanding job,” Mr. Trump said. “Most people have said we’ve done an outstanding job.”

The president has been harshly criticized for what many see as a lackluster and delayed response to the island’s devastation — especially after he lashed out at the mayor of San Juan, who questioned Mr. Trump’s leadership.

Mr. Trump has said that Puerto Rico’s poor infrastructure and debt was partly to blame for the crisis. He later reassured the island territory, where more than 80 percent of the population remains without power, that he would “always be with them.”

Hillary Clinton

‘Hillary, please run’

In the final moments of the news conference, Mr. Trump said he hoped Mrs. Clinton, his opponent in the 2016 presidential campaign, would run again in 2020. It was a repeat of a tweet he posted in the morning.

“Oh, I hope Hillary runs,” he said. “Hillary, please run again.”

Asked about Mrs. Clinton’s defense of N.F.L. players kneeling during the national anthem, the president blamed her argument — that the players were protesting the criminal justice system, not the American flag or national anthem — as a reason she lost the election.

“There’s plenty of time to do knees and there’s plenty of time to do lots of other things,” Mr. Trump said. “But when you take a knee — well, that’s why she lost the election. Honestly, it’s that thinking. That is the reason she lost the election.”

He also urged the N.F.L. to suspend players who knelt during the anthem for multiple games.

“The people of our country are very angry at the N.F.L. All you have to do is look at their ratings and look at their stadiums. You see empty seats where you never saw them before,” Mr. Trump said. “A lot of people are very angry at it. It is highly disrespectful.

Photo

At the same time, craft distillers, like chefs, are thinking more about the sources of their raw ingredients, the stories behind what they’re making and their relationships to their communities.

That’s why some of the country’s more forward-thinking distillers are looking toward regionalization, creating new subspecies like Pacific Northwest single malts or mesquite-smoked whiskey in the Southwest.

But no one has gone as far as the people behind Empire Rye.

The idea began three years ago at a craft-spirits conference in Denver. Mr. Williams was up late drinking with a who’s who of New York craft distilling — including Tom Potter, a founder of New York Distilling Company in Brooklyn; Nicole Austin, then a distiller at Kings County Distillery, also in Brooklyn; and Brian McKenzie, an owner of Finger Lakes Distilling in Burdett, N.Y. — when the conversation turned to their state’s exploding whiskey scene.

New York is one of the leading states for craft distilling, thanks to a 2007 law, championed by Ralph Erenzo, the founder and owner of Tuthilltown Spirits in Gardiner, that eased fees and other regulations on new operations that use mostly New York grains and fruits. Today the state has more than 100 distilleries — which is good news for craft spirits fans and the farmers who supply ingredients, but worrisome for a distiller looking at all that undifferentiated competition.

The discussion in Denver soon settled on the need for a distinguishing set of standards, a way to define New York rye and an incentive for other distillers to follow suit. “We shook hands, bleary-eyed, and decided to do something,” Mr. Potter said.

Photo

Before a distillery can put an official Empire Rye sticker on its label, its whiskey must meet four criteria. At least 75 percent of its grain must be New York-grown rye. It must be distilled to no more than 160 proof; put into a barrel at no more than 115 proof (which is below the industry standard of 125 proof); and aged at least two years in charred, new oak barrels.

That may sound strict, but it leaves a lot of room to play around. This month, each of the original six members of the Empire Rye consortium — Coppersea, Tuthilltown, Black Button Distilling, New York Distilling, Kings County Distillery and Finger Lakes Distilling — will release a different take. Coppersea’s, for example, is made with 100 percent malted rye; Black Button’s contains 95 percent unmalted rye and 5 percent malted barley. (Three more distilleries have since signed on.)

“Every distillery has a chance to hit the standards,” Mr. Potter said, “but also to experiment.”

To get out the word on Empire Rye, the distilleries have declared this week New York Rye Week, and are staging numerous events in New York City. It doesn’t hurt that William Grant & Sons, the company that makes Glenfiddich and the Balvenie single malt whiskies in Scotland, just bought Tuthilltown — and is eager to promote Empire Rye as well.

Why rye? The distillers say that, for all its current cachet among bartenders and whiskey fans, rye remains largely unappreciated by most Americans, and thus especially ripe for innovation.

Photo

Rye was once a dominant American spirit, especially on the East Coast, where the hearty grain grew better than corn or barley, and where many drinkers knew regional styles like Maryland Rye or Old Monongahela, from Pennsylvania, by name.

But during Prohibition, Americans lost their taste for the spirit’s robust, spicy notes, and until recently almost all rye was made in Kentucky, with barely enough of the grain to qualify. (By law, at least 51 percent of the grain in rye whiskey must be rye; the rest is usually corn.)

“A lot of knowledge was lost in Prohibition,” said Jason Barrett, the head distiller and president of Black Button. “It set American whiskey back a hundred years.”

Over the last decade, American palates have once again embraced rye’s strength, but the lack of variety in craft ryes leaves a door open for initiatives like Empire Rye.

Empire Rye is a rare effort to define a regional identity for a whiskey, but New York is far from the only place with an emerging whiskey style. There is increasing talk about a Pacific Northwest style of single malt made with malted barley, from producers like Westland Distillery in Seattle and House Spirits Distillery in Portland, Ore.

Photo

Matt Hofmann, the master distiller at Westland, has been working with university agriculture departments to identify barley varietals that will flourish in the Northwestern climate; he has also used a regional variety of oak, the Garry or Oregon white oak, to make barrels for aging.

“We live in a time when you can make a good copy of anything anywhere,” Mr. Hofmann said. “But the places I get excited about are the ones that aren’t just copying, but taking the influence of what’s around them and applying it to what they’re doing.”

In some cases, it’s less a matter of innovating than excavating. Herman Mihalich, the founder of Mountain Laurel Spirits in Bristol, Pa., spent years researching the history of Old Monongahela, a style of rye once popular in the Mid-Atlantic states that largely disappeared after Prohibition.

“It was made with rye and malted barley, no corn, with a sweet mash on a pot still,” Mr. Mihalich said. He has recreated that style with Dad’s Hat, a sweet and supple rye that he sells in the United States and Europe.

“That sort of regionalization is going to be the future,” said Steven Baird, an owner of Cardiff Giant, a Brooklyn bar that specializes in New York food and drink. “They’re taking hints from the wine industry and giving consumers a sense of place.”

It remains to be seen whether consumers will take to the new regional styles. But the fact that regionalization is part of the conversation among craft distillers shows how far, and how rapidly, the industry has moved — and how far it wants to go.

“Bourbon means something the world over,” said Mr. Barrett, of Black Button. “My hope is that in 20 years people will say, ‘Empire Rye, I know that, too.’”

We have separate Morning Briefings for Asia, Australia and Europe, as well as an Evening Briefing, and the team of writers shares ideas, approaches and occasionally language. The editor overseeing the briefings, Andrea Kannapell, describes us as being on the “front line” of news. “If we can’t sort through it,” she said, “how can we expect readers to?”

Although the internet offers unlimited space, we try to be true to the briefing’s name and keep it short, as well as forward-looking. (A majority of our readers scroll through on a mobile device, and we respect both their time and their thumbs.)

I aim to include only four or five stories at the top. They’re usually hard news, with occasional features about serious subjects that have broad appeal, such as a recent essay by a woman whose adult son has autism.

The Times covers the world, and the briefing reflects that. But my mix of stories often tilts toward the United States. A story’s proximity is an important part of how people view its newsworthiness; for many readers, a plane crash on the other side of the globe isn’t as big a deal as one in their hometown.

Then there are sections dedicated to business news, the always popular Smarter Living features and something we call Noteworthy, a selection of often lighter offerings, including arts and sports news. The final note: a Back Story, usually written ahead of time by colleagues, which commemorates a historic anniversary or provides more background on a topic in the news.

From start to finish, the process takes a little more than four hours, and we aim to have the briefing in your email inbox as close to 6 a.m. Eastern as possible.

Through the briefings, I try to provide as full a picture of Times journalism as I can, but capturing its breadth and variety can be difficult. The briefing represents only the tip of the iceberg of our coverage, which comprises hundreds of stories a day. Regrettably, I have to leave out far more than I keep. (Every day, the list of stories that almost made the briefing is usually as long as the list of ones that did.)

Complicating the job, the news has just been busier lately. For example, August — when a lot of people, including Congress, are on vacation — used to be a slow time for newsrooms (it’s called the “silly season” here in Britain). But this year, the month started with the firing of Anthony Scaramucci, the White House communications director, and ended with Hurricane Harvey slamming into Texas. In between, stories that would normally dominate headlines for weeks were sometimes crowded out by other news: North Korea, Charlottesville, Barcelona. And a total solar eclipse.

I try to think about not just what readers need to know but simply about what they might need. A particularly grim briefing on Thursday — think California wildfires, mass slaughter in Myanmar and sexual harassment allegations in Hollywood — left me wondering for a way to leaven the news. The solution? A picture of a young giant panda.

Both right and left are dividing into upswinger and downswinger camps. Among Republicans the upswingers embrace capitalist dynamism, global engagement and the open movement of people and ideas. The downswingers embrace ethnic and national cohesion and closed borders.

On the left it’s between those who believe the only realistic path is to reform existing structures and those who think they are so broken we need to start over.

The downswinger mind-set is similar across left and right. Because of the loss of faith in progress downswingers have a baseline mood of pessimism, protest and anger. They are marked by a deep social distrust and a bent toward conspiracy thinking. They disrespect codes of etiquette that traditionally regulate public life and crack down on opposing speech.

Politics gets nasty in these “hatchet” periods because downswingers have a tropism toward ethnic and identity politics. If you’ve lost faith in universal progress, if you think everything is a zero-sum scramble for slices of a stagnant or shrinking pie, then of course you are going to see your ethnic identity marker as essential and all defining. You are going to embrace a sense of victimhood and feel that the great parade of historic wrongs is going to determine what comes next. History controls the future.

Politics also gets nasty in these periods because personal grievance gets intermingled with social grievance. If you feel aggrieved about your own personal status in society then political life is not just a disagreement about means, it’s perceived as a status war against those who seem to think they are better than you. Downswinging populists are taking over the Republican Party. Regular Republicans like Ed Gillespie in Virginia have to adopt the tone and poses of the downswingers to try to win votes.

The Democrats are a bit behind. But the center-left parties have collapsed all over Europe. There’s no reason to think that won’t happen in the U.S.

In 1994, 65 percent of Democrats believed “most people who want to get ahead can make it if they’re willing to work hard.” Now only 49 percent of Democrats believe that. That’s a 16 point shift from an optimistic, progress-embracing view toward a pessimistic, system-doubting view.

The best thing upswingers can do in these times is to respect the downswinger critique — we’re in this moment for a reason — without falling for its ultimate pessimism. But the global populist tide is not going to be held off just by passing a new tax cut or a few other bills. There has to be economic, social and political solidarity with those left behind, as well as penance from those who did the leaving. There has to be a convincing story of where we are in history. There has to be a new moral order that affords dignity to those who feel insulted. Upswingers will have to conserve our basic institutions that continue to produce real benefits, while reforming them with what Glenn Tinder once called a hesitant radicalism.

Other research published in the journal Health Economics supports the pollution hypothesis. In their analysis of the Great Recession in Europe, José Tapia Granados of Drexel University and Edward Ionides of the University of Michigan found that a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a one percent lower mortality rate for respiratory illnesses, as well as reductions in mortality for cardiovascular disease and heart conditions, which are known to be sensitive to air pollution. In countries where the recession was more severe — the Baltic States, Spain, Greece and Slovenia — respiratory disease mortality fell 16 percent during 2007-2010, compared with just a 3.2 percent decline in the four years preceding the recession.

Other factors contribute to rising mortality during expansions. Occupational hazards and stress can directly harm health through work. Some studies find that alcohol and tobacco consumption increases during booms, too. Both are associated with higher death rates. Also, employed people drive more, increasing mortality from auto accidents.

During recessions, people without jobs may have more time to sleep and exercise and may eat more healthfully. One study found that higher unemployment is associated with lower rates of obesity, increased physical activity and a better diet. On the other hand, suicides increase during economic downturns.

Some recent work suggests that economic booms may have become less deadly and busts more so in recent years. This could be a result of less polluting production in modern, expanding economies, or of better medical care for those with conditions sensitive to pollution. Safer roads and cars, and less driving under the influence of alcohol and other substances, could also play a role.

“It’s also possible that opioids and other drugs may have made recessions more harmful to health than they used to be,” Mr. Cutler said.

Other analysis shows that although smaller economic booms increase mortality, larger ones decrease it. Japan’s economic booms in the 1960s and 1970s are associated with longer life spans there, for example. Serious and lengthy downturns — like the Great Depression — are associated with shorter lives, even as smaller ones lengthen them.

Wealthier nations are healthier nations, an effect seen across generations. People in their formative years — children and teenagers — are particularly sensitive to the economic environment. Conditions in utero can have lasting health and economic effects. Graduating from college during a recession can depress one’s earnings for a decade. People growing up during a strong economy are more likely to have access to resources and to develop skills and opportunities that promote health. These benefits can last a lifetime, increasing longevity.

What we are moving are the Ys at the end of the first word of each of the theme entries, like the original phrase GRAVY TRAIN at 23A. The Ys (or their sound) move to the end of the second word of each theme phrase and are then pluralized to make an entirely different phrase, which is clued in a punny way. That changes the phrase to GRAVE TRAINEES, clued as “Interns at a cemetery?”

Please remember to lift with your knees and set the Ys down gently.

Nor is Mr. Vance the only faux reformer.

The New Orleans district attorney, Leon Cannizzaro, claims that his office “has worked aggressively to reform New Orleans’s criminal justice system.” But his actions indicate that he values convictions over his community. He has locked up rape victims who refused to testify against their assailants and has served fake subpoenas to pressure witnesses to talk. Mr. Cannizzaro defended a sentence in which a 17-year-old was sent to prison for 99 years for an armed car robbery, even though no one was injured during the crime. His office tried to sentence a man to 20 years in prison for stealing $31 worth of candy.

The Los Angeles district attorney, Jackie Lacey, is a Democrat who has benefited from the public’s perception that she is a reformer. This is something she has fed herself, bragging to a Los Angeles Sentinel reporter that she has read “The New Jim Crow” by Michelle Alexander and has seen Ava DuVernay’s documentary “13,” about the connection between slavery and mass incarceration. But Ms. Lacey’s values have consistently lagged behind those of her constituency.

In ballot initiatives, Los Angeles County residents supported shorter sentences for low-level and nonviolent property and drug crimes and wanted to legalize recreational marijuana use for adults. Ms. Lacey opposed both. And although the county voted in favor of abolishing the death penalty, she continues to support it. Last year there were just 31 death sentences nationwide. Ms. Lacey’s office secured four of them.

Philadelphia’s former district attorney R. Seth Williams was once identified as a rising political star. But it turns out he wasn’t much of a leader at all. By the end of his tenure, which was cut short after he pleaded guilty to bribery and resigned, Philadelphia had locked up more of its residents per capita than any other major city. One in four defendants was being held in jail simply because of an inability to pay bail.

Mr. Williams had also won praise for agreeing not to pursue life-without-parole sentences again for 300 juvenile offenders. The Supreme Court has ruled they were unconstitutionally sentenced to such punishments and entitled to new sentencing hearings. But less than a year later, he reneged on his promise and denied ever making it.

America incarcerates more people than any other country, and it is prosecutors who are largely responsible.

So it’s especially frustrating that many of those who are praised as change-makers are at best making bite-size improvements. And because they say the right things, the public gives them a pass: Mr. Vance is running unopposed for a third term, and Ms. Lacey also ran unopposed in her last election.

The progressive bombast is meaningless if prosecutors continue to promote the same harsh practices behind the scenes. Instead, voters must look closely at their policies and hold them to high and specific standards. We should ask: Are prosecutors opposing new mandatory minimum sentences during legislative debates?

Of course there’s humor in sex-related subjects. But there should be sensitivity too, so my reporting approach didn’t waver from its normal course: Be respectful and nonjudgmental. It’s possible to be considerate, empathetic and amused at the same time.

Since custom condoms were new to America, it was challenging to find people with firsthand experience. So I asked the company to ask if any customers would allow me to contact them. Two men did, answering my questions with admirable candor.

I also wanted to find men independently. After various efforts, I heeded a sex researcher’s advice to contact a Reddit group for men who call their penises small. Some members were wary. “Who are you bro, I doubt your legitimacy,” one wrote, adding, “What articles have you written pertaining to the issues of sex and other taboo topics?” But when I described some of my stories, he replied, “Thanks for clearing my concerns up.”

Another suggested I was fishing in a shallow pond, saying that “most of us here don’t suffer from too much sex.” But several men gave unvarnished answers via private message.

When interviewing condom creators or users by phone, I found private spaces in the newsroom. Not that I was embarrassed, but conversations about penis dimensions and sex might sound startling or funny to colleagues, and I worried interview subjects might hear someone’s inadvertent chuckles.

When writing the story, my goal was to be straightforward but not racy. Sex stories have occasionally made some editors squeamish, and sometimes sexual vocabulary has been sanitized. But discussing sexual health with clarity can help people learn things they may be uncomfortable asking about. It can help remove tinges of shame or salaciousness from a basic human behavior.

In the condom context, even anodyne sentences can contain unintentional double entendres. Ron Frezieres, a longtime expert, said “there’s a lot of gymnastics involved in doing condom research.” Davin Wedel, the custom condom company president, said, about poor condom fit, “We’re trying to address it head on.”

An incorrigible punster, I tried to be corrigible, refraining (mostly) from wordplay. I did suggest the following headline — because of its high-minded allusions to Plato and Martin Luther King Jr., of course: “Will Custom-Fit Condoms Take the Measure of a Man?”

“Well, I’m getting evicted,’” Mr. Zolfo replied. He said he had been subletting from another actor, who, to his surprise, “had apparently decided that paying rent was optional.”

5A: Hi, kids! I wasn’t around for ADLAI Stevenson’s presidential campaign either, but I got this and I’ll explain how I did it.

In the mid-20th century, it was apparently fashionable among campaign slogan writers to try to make their slogans rhyme, primarily because it would have been considered laughable at the time to suggest that the candidate might want to have a beer with anyone who wasn’t at least a governor. Slogan writers would sit in small, smoke-filled offices with long lists of words that rhymed with their candidate’s name (“Badly for Adlai?” “No. ...” “Sadly for Adlai?” No!”), and they were released only when they hit on something that was not terrible and could fit on a campaign button. My point is, if you see a clue like “‘Madly for ___’ (1952 campaign slogan),” you have enough information to know that you should be thinking about a midcentury candidate whose name rhymed with “madly.”

42A: The holy Kaaba is a CUBE-shaped mosque in the town of Makka.

Sanctions offer no useful response, since a raft of sanctions are already imposed.

“Cyber is a tailor-made instrument of power for them,” said Chris Inglis, a former deputy director of the National Security Agency, who now teaches about security at the United States Naval Academy. “There’s a low cost of entry, it’s largely asymmetrical, there’s some degree of anonymity and stealth in its use. It can hold large swaths of nation state infrastructure and private-sector infrastructure at risk. It’s a source of income.”

Mr. Inglis, speaking at the Cambridge Cyber Summit this month, added: “You could argue that they have one of the most successful cyberprograms on the planet, not because it’s technically sophisticated, but because it has achieved all of their aims at very low cost.”

It is hardly a one-way conflict: By some measures the United States and North Korea have been engaged in an active cyberconflict for years.

Both the United States and South Korea have also placed digital “implants” in the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the North Korean equivalent of the Central Intelligence Agency, according to documents that Edward J. Snowden released several years ago. American-created cyber- and electronic warfare weapons were deployed to disable North Korean missiles, an attack that was, at best, only partially successful.

Indeed, both sides see cyber as the way to gain tactical advantage in their nuclear and missile standoff.

There is evidence Pyongyang has planted so-called digital sleeper cells in the South’s critical infrastructure, and its Defense Ministry, that could be activated to paralyze power supplies and military command and control networks.

But the North is not motivated solely by politics: Its most famous cyberattack came in 2014, against Sony Pictures Entertainment, in a largely successful effort to block the release of a movie that satirized Mr. Kim.

What has not been disclosed, until now, is that North Korea had also hacked into a British television network a few weeks earlier to stop it from broadcasting a drama about a nuclear scientist kidnapped in Pyongyang.

Once North Korea counterfeited crude $100 bills to try to generate hard cash. Now intelligence officials estimate that North Korea reaps hundreds of millions of dollars a year from ransomware, digital bank heists, online video game cracking, and more recently, hacks of South Korean Bitcoin exchanges.

One former British intelligence chief estimates the take from its cyberheists may bring the North as much as $1 billion a year, or a third of the value of the nation’s exports.

The North Korean cyberthreat “crept up on us,” said Robert Hannigan, the former director of Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters, which handles electronic surveillance and cybersecurity.

“Because they are such a mix of the weird and absurd and medieval and highly sophisticated, people didn’t take it seriously,” he said. “How can such an isolated, backward country have this capability? Well, how can such an isolated backward country have this nuclear ability?”

From Minor Leaguers to Serious Hackers

Kim Jong-il, the father of the current dictator and the initiator of North Korea’s cyberoperations, was a movie lover who became an internet enthusiast, a luxury reserved for the country’s elite. When Mr. Kim died in 2011, the country was estimated to have 1,024 IP addresses, fewer than on most New York City blocks.

Mr. Kim, like the Chinese, initially saw the internet as a threat to his regime’s ironclad control over information. But his attitude began to change in the early 1990s, after a group of North Korean computer scientists returned from travel abroad proposing to use the web to spy on and attack enemies like the United States and South Korea, according to defectors.

North Korea began identifying promising students at an early age for special training, sending many to China’s top computer science programs. In the late 1990s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s counterintelligence division noticed that North Koreans assigned to work at the United Nations were also quietly enrolling in university computer programming courses in New York.

“The F.B.I. called me and said, ‘What should we do?’ ” recalled James A. Lewis, at the time in charge of cybersecurity at the Commerce Department. “I told them, ‘Don’t do anything. Follow them and see what they are up to.’”

The North’s cyberwarfare unit gained priority after the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States. After watching the American “shock and awe” campaign on CNN, Kim Jong-il issued a warning to his military: “If warfare was about bullets and oil until now,” he told top commanders, according to a prominent defector, Kim Heung-kwang, “warfare in the 21st century is about information.”

The unit was marked initially by mishaps and bluster.

“There was an enormous growth in capability from 2009 or so, when they were a joke,” said Ben Buchanan, the author of “The Cybersecurity Dilemma” and a fellow at the Cyber Security Project at Harvard. “They would execute a very basic attack against a minor web page put up by the White House or an American intelligence agency, and then their sympathizers would claim they’d hacked the U.S. government. But since then, their hackers have gotten a lot better.”

A National Intelligence Estimate in 2009 wrote off the North’s hacking prowess, much as it underestimated its long-range missile program. It would be years before it could mount a meaningful threat, it claimed.

But the regime was building that threat.

When Kim Jong-un succeeded his father, in 2011, he expanded the cybermission beyond serving as just a weapon of war, focusing also on theft, harassment and political-score settling.

“Cyberwarfare, along with nuclear weapons and missiles, is an ‘all-purpose sword’ that guarantees our military’s capability to strike relentlessly,” Kim Jong-un reportedly declared, according to the testimony of a South Korean intelligence chief.

And the array of United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang only incentivized Mr. Kim’s embrace.

“We’re already sanctioning anything and everything we can,” said Robert P. Silvers, the former assistant secretary for cyberpolicy at the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration. “They’re already the most isolated nation in the world.”

By 2012, government officials and private researchers say North Korea had dispersed its hacking teams abroad, relying principally on China’s internet infrastructure. This allowed the North to exploit largely nonsecure internet connections and maintain a degree of plausible deniability.

A recent analysis by the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future found heavy North Korean internet activity in India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nepal, Kenya, Mozambique, and Indonesia. In some cases, like that of New Zealand, North Korean hackers were simply routing their attacks through the country’s computers from abroad. In others, researchers believe they are now physically stationed in countries like India, where nearly one-fifth of Pyongyang’s cyberattacks now originate.

Intelligence agencies are now trying to track the North Korean hackers in these countries the way they have previously tracked terrorist sleeper cells or nuclear proliferators: looking for their favorite hotels, lurking in online forums they may inhabit, attempting to feed them bad computer code and counterattacking their own servers.

Learning From Iran, Growing Bolder

For decades Iran and North Korea have shared missile technology, and American intelligence agencies have long sought evidence of secret cooperation in the nuclear arena. In cyber, the Iranians taught the North Koreans something important: When confronting an enemy that has internet-connected banks, trading systems, oil and water pipelines, dams, hospitals, and entire cities, the opportunities to wreak havoc are endless.

By midsummer 2012, Iran’s hackers, still recovering from an American and Israeli-led cyberattack on Iran’s nuclear enrichment operations, found an easy target in Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil company and the world’s most valuable company.

That August, Iranian hackers flipped a kill switch at precisely 11:08 a.m., unleashing a simple wiper virus onto 30,000 Aramco computers and 10,000 servers that would destroy data, and replace it with a partial image of a burning American flag. The damage was tremendous.

Seven months later, during joint military exercises between American and South Korean forces, North Korean hackers, operating from computers inside China, deployed a very similar cyberweapon against computer networks at three major South Korean banks and South Korea’s two largest broadcasters. Like Iran’s Aramco attacks, the North Korean attacks on South Korean targets used wiping malware to eradicate data and paralyze their business operations.

It may have been a copycat operation, but Mr. Hannigan, the former British official, said recently: “We have to assume they are getting help from the Iranians.”

And inside the National Security Agency, just a few years after analysts had written off Pyongyang as a low grade threat, there was suddenly a new appreciation that the country was figuring out cyber just as it had figured out nuclear weapons: test by test.

“North Korea showed that to achieve its political objectives, it will take down any company — period,” Mr. Silvers said.

Protecting Kim’s Image

A chief political objective of the cyberprogram is to preserve the image of the North’s 33-year-old leader, Kim Jong-un. In August 2014, North Korean hackers went after a British broadcaster, Channel Four, which had announced plans for a television series about a British nuclear scientist kidnapped in Pyongyang.

First, the North Koreans protested to the British government. “A scandalous farce,” North Korea called the series. When that was ignored, British authorities found that the North had hacked into the television network’s computer system. The attack was stopped before inflicting any damage, and David Abraham, the chief executive of Channel Four, initially vowed to continue the production.

That attack, however, was just a prelude. When Sony Pictures Entertainment released a trailer for “The Interview,” a comedy about two journalists dispatched to Pyongyang to assassinate North Korea’s young new dictator, Pyongyang wrote a letter of complaint to the secretary general of the United Nations to stop the production. Then came threats to Sony.

Michael Lynton, then Sony’s chief executive, said when Sony officials called the State Department, they were told it was just more “bluster,” he said.

“At that point in time, Kim Jong-un was relatively new in the job, and I don’t think it was clear yet how he was different from his father,” Mr. Lynton said in an interview. “Nobody ever mentioned anything about their cyber capabilities.”

In September 2014, while still attempting to crack Channel 4, North Korean hackers buried deep into Sony’s networks, lurking patiently for the next three months, as both Sony and American intelligence completely missed their presence.

The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, was even in Pyongyang at the time, trying to win the release of a detained American, and had dinner with the then-chief of the Reconnaissance General Bureau.

On Nov. 24, the attack on Sony began: Employees arriving at work that day found their computer screens taken over by a picture of a red skeleton with a message signed “GOP,” for “Guardians of Peace.”

“We’ve obtained all your internal data including your secrets and top secrets,” the message said. “If you don’t obey us, we’ll release data shown below to the world.”

That was actually a diversion: The code destroyed 70 percent of Sony Pictures’ laptops and computers. Sony employees were reduced to communicating via pen, paper and phone.

Mr. Lynton said the F.B.I. told him that nothing could have been done to prevent the attack, since it was waged by a sovereign state. “We learned that you really have no way of protecting yourself in any meaningful way,” he said of such nation-state attacks.

Sony struggled to distribute the film as theaters were intimidated. (Ultimately it was distributed for download, and may have done better than it would have.) In London, outside investors in Channel Four’s North Korea project suddenly dried up, and the project effectively died.

The Obama White House responded to the Sony hack with sanctions that the North barely noticed, but with no other retaliation. “A cyberbattle would be a lot more risky for the United States and its allies than for North Korea,” said Mr. Silvers.

Robbing Banks, Pyongyang Style

Beyond respect, and retribution, the North wanted hard currency from its cyberprogram.

So soon the digital bank heists began — an attack in the Philippines in October 2015; then the Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam at the end of the same year; and then the Bangladesh Central Bank. Researchers at Symantec said it was the first time a state had used a cyberattack not for espionage or war, but to finance the country’s operations.

Now, the attacks are increasingly cunning. Security experts noticed in February that the website of Poland’s financial regulator was unintentionally infecting visitors with malware.

It turned out that visitors to the Polish regulator’s website — employees from Polish banks, from the central banks of Brazil, Chile, Estonia, Mexico, Venezuela, and even from prominent Western banks like Bank of America — had been targeted with a so-called watering hole attack, in which North Korean hackers waited for their victims to visit the site, then installed malware in their machines. Forensics showed that the hackers had put together a list of internet addresses from 103 organizations, most of them banks, and designed their malware to specifically infect visitors from those banks, in what researchers said appeared to be an effort to move around stolen currency.

More recently, North Koreans seemed to have changed tack once again. North Korean hackers’ fingerprints showed up in a series of attempted attacks on so-called cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, and were successful in at least one case, according to researchers at FireEye.

The attacks on Bitcoin exchanges, which see hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin exchanged a day, offered Pyongyang a potentially very lucrative source of new funds. And, researchers say, there is evidence they have been exchanging Bitcoin gathered from their heists for Monero, a highly anonymous version of cryptocurrency that is far harder for global authorities to trace.

The most widespread hack was WannaCry, a global ransomware attack that used a program that cripples a computer and demands a ransom payment in exchange for unlocking the computer, or its data. In a twist the North Koreans surely enjoyed, their hackers based the attack on a secret tool, called “Eternal Blue,” stolen from the National Security Agency.

In the late afternoon of May 12, panicked phone calls flooded in from around Britain and the world. The computer systems of several major British hospital systems were shut down, forcing diversions of ambulances and the deferral of nonemergency surgeries. Banks and transportation systems across dozens of countries were affected.

Britain’s National Cyber Security Center had picked up no warning of the attack, said Paul Chichester, its director of operations. Investigators now think the WannaCry attack may have been an early misfire of a weapon that was still under development — or a test of tactics and vulnerabilities.

“This was part of an evolving effort to find ways to disable key industries,” said Brian Lord, a former deputy director for intelligence and cyber operations at the Government Communications Headquarters in Britain. “All I have to do is create a moderately disabling attack on a key part of the social infrastructure, and then watch the media sensationalize it and panic the public.”

It ended thanks to Marcus Hutchins, a college dropout and self-taught hacker living with his parents in the southwest of England. He spotted a web address somewhere in the software and, on a lark, paid $10.69 to register it as a domain name. The activation of the domain name turned out to act as a kill switch causing the malware to stop spreading.

British officials privately acknowledge that they know North Korea perpetrated the attack, but the government has taken no retaliatory action, uncertain what they can do.

A Cyber Arms Race

While American and South Korean officials often express outrage about North Korea’s cyberactivities, they rarely talk about their own — and whether that helps fuel the cyber arms race.

Yet both Seoul and Washington target the North’s Reconnaissance General Bureau, its nuclear program and its missile program. Hundreds, if not thousands, of American cyberwarriors spend each day mapping the North’s few networks, looking for vulnerabilities that could be activated in time of crisis.

At a recent meeting of American strategists to evaluate North Korea’s capabilities, some participants expressed concerns that the escalating cyberwar could actually tempt the North to use its weapons — both nuclear and cyber — very quickly in any conflict, for fear that the United States has secret ways to shut the country down.

The director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Mike Pompeo, said last week that the United States is trying to compile a better picture of the leadership around Kim Jong-un, for a report to President Trump. Figuring out who oversees cyber and special operations is a central mystery. The Japanese press recently speculated it could be an official named Jang Kil-su. Others are curious about Gen. No Kwang-chol, who was elevated to the Central Committee of the North’s ruling party in May 2016, and is one of the only members whose portfolio is undisclosed.

The big question is whether Mr. Kim, fearful that his nuclear program is becoming too large and obvious a target, is focusing instead on how to shut down the United States without ever lighting off a missile. “Everyone is focused on mushroom clouds,” Mr. Silvers said, “but there is far more potential for another kind of disastrous escalation.”",The World Once Laughed at North Korean Cyberpower.

Last month, however, the Kurds voted for full independence from Iraq, prompting an angry rebuke from Baghdad and threats of military intervention.

Both Turkey and Iran fear that an independence move by Iraqi Kurds could set off unrest among their own Kurdish minorities. The United States and most of the international community had opposed the referendum, saying it could unleash ethnic conflict, break up Iraq and undermine the campaign against Islamic State militants.

On Monday, Iraqi forces said that they had reached the outskirts of Kirkuk, seizing oil fields and other sites from Kurdish forces.

How much oil is in Kirkuk?

The area around Kirkuk and the Kurdish region is one of the major oil-producing areas of Iraq. Analysts estimate that the region as a whole produces 750,000 barrels a day, of which around 400,000 comes from fields around Kirkuk that could be caught up in the conflict. The Kurdistan regional government exports about 640,000 barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris, with about 300,000 coming from Kirkuk.

Iraq produces a total of about 4.5 million barrels a day.

Most of the oil exported from the Kirkuk and Kurdistan area goes north, through a pipeline across the border with Turkey, and then to Ceyhan, a Turkish port on the Mediterranean. Turkey has threatened to cut off those exports, although Ankara has taken no action thus far.

Why have oil prices moved higher?

Oil prices recently have become more sensitive to supply threats, such as the situation in Kirkuk.

Strong global demand and the agreement between Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to curb production have tightened the market and helped soak up some of the surplus. That means further reductions because of global crises become more important.

“We have got a cocktail of geopolitical risks that can certainly keep supporting prices and probably — if demand stays strong — contribute to pushing them higher,” said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a market research firm based in London.

What will this do to the cost of gasoline?

Rising crude oil prices have translated into modestly higher prices for consumers. The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline in the United States is about $2.50, a little less than 10 percent more than a year ago, according to the Energy Information Administration, a government agency.

In Britain, prices for unleaded regular gasoline have risen by about 4 percent to about 544 pence, or about $7.20, per gallon, according to data from the AA, an auto services group. Because of the high tax component in European fuel prices, the prices are less sensitive to fluctuating costs of crude than are gasoline prices in the United States.

There seems a good chance that oil prices will push at least modestly higher over the next few years. Oswald Clint, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said prices of $60 to $70 a barrel, or even higher, were likely.

Mr. Clint said he doubted that modest increases would drive fuel prices high enough to slow major economies like those of the United States or Germany. “In the range I am talking about, I don’t think so,” he said.

Others say that higher prices could just encourage more supply, for example by shale oil producers in the United States, which would keep prices from escalating.",Are the Days of Low Oil Prices Receding?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/business/energy-environment/iraq-oil-kirkuk.html

Ms. Delgadillo and a constellation of other activists have been fighting for an independent attorney general, someone who would have no political allegiance who could lead a justice ministry staffed by a professional prosecutors and investigators using science and data to pursue cases.

Three years ago, the Mexican Congress approved the broad outlines of an independent ministry, but the overhaul stalled after human rights and anti-corruption groups argued that the legislation’s fine print did nothing to assure the agency’s autonomy.

It was Mr. Peña Nieto’s appointment of Mr. Cervantes, dubbed the “buddy prosecutor,” and the likelihood that he would remain in office after next year’s election, that galvanized groups as diverse as women’s rights organizations and the conservative employers federation.

“His resignation is a victory of civil society, and a direct result of all the pressure and opposition and power they have built up,” said Alonso González-Villalobos, a lawyer and advocate of criminal justice reform.

Mr. Cervantes’s fate may have been sealed last month by a report in the newspaper Reforma that he had registered his Ferrari to a house in a low-income neighborhood in a neighboring state, a move that allowed him to avoid paying Mexico City taxes. His personal lawyer told Reforma that it had been an administrative error by the auto dealership.

In announcing his resignation on Monday, Mr. Cervantes said that he supported the goal of an independent chief prosecutor and that he was leaving to clear the air for Congress to move forward with legislation that would create an autonomous ministry. “Some legislators and politicians have used my name and my supposed ambitions as an excuse not to advance the approval of laws that would improve the conditions and tools to secure justice,” he said.

Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October.
They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying.
“Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook.
I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled.","Trees can live without us, but we cannot live without trees.

With a history dating back to the dinosaurs, trees are the planet’s documentarians, watching us cycle through life while providing oxygen, shade and shelter. Trees, the oldest of which, according to Peter Wohlleben’s “The Hidden Life of Trees,” has 9,500 years, are a critical part of the human experience. We rely on them, from their deep roots to fluttering leaves.

But — at least when we’re not cutting them down — how do we influence trees? Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October. Traveling to more than 70 locations, they found trees that represent “landscapes of complexity where nature and humanity converge.” In other words, trees with stories, like the young sycamore that witnessed the Civil War, or the elm that survived the Oklahoma City bombing. These photos show how events have shaped trees, their energy, and sometimes, literally, the shape of their limbs.

“Forty-million trees are being lost every day,” said Mr. Jenshel. “We love the environment and wanted to do something that would make people think differently about trees.”

Though Mr. Jenshel and Ms. Cook — who are married, collaborate on all their projects and frequently finish each other’s sentences — have a long history of photographing trees, a much more personal seed for their project was planted in the spring of 2012. They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying. Struggling to process the information, she found herself watching the fragile petals of the cherry blossoms slowly drift to the ground, one by one.

“We did what the Japanese have been doing for centuries,” said Ms. Cook. “To take in that beauty, appreciate its ephemeral nature, and know that life does go on.”

Her father died soon after, but a new project was born, influenced by the cherry blossoms and a National Geographic magazine commission. “Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook. “And the importance trees have had throughout history in so many cultures.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, search and rescue workers were looking for human remains among the rubble, when they found part of a Callery pear tree, which traditionally is the first tree to bloom in spring and the last to change leaves in autumn. Though its trunk was scorched and many branches missing, the tree had survived the attacks. Now a symbol of strength and survival, the pear tree was nursed back to health at a Bronx nursery and, nearly a decade later, replanted at the World Trade Center memorial.

Other trees have been a part of unspeakable cruelties. From 1846 to 1870, in Goliad, Tex., an oak known as “The Hanging Tree,” provided shade for court sessions and branches for lynching.

“It’s not always a happy story,” said Ms. Cook.

One of the rain or monkeypod trees in Cambodia (imported from South or Central America), was isolated from the others as “The Killing Tree.” In 1975 when Pol Pot’s murderous rule started, the tree was used to bash children’s heads while their mothers were forced to watch.

“It took us days to recover from that experience of photographing that tree,” said Ms. Cook. “That left the deepest scar on us.”

Other trees seem to travel, and quite far. It is not clear how the adansonia gregorii (or boab) tree got to Western Australia. Perhaps it was the result of seeds dropped from the fruits by early migrants. It was a good thing, though, for the local aboriginals who used the tree as a spiritual home and lifeline, since it can hold up to 26 gallons of water.

In India, from the ancient tree deities to current bodhis of enlightenment, most trees are seen as sacred. In a Varanasi sweet shop, they found a neem tree, said to cure all ailments. Long after they shot the photo, Ms. Cook noticed her spouse’s anxiety.

“Len kept saying, ‘I don’t think we got the picture. I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled. “I totally knew it was about the sweets.”

Small fires seemed to pop up everywhere. As I raced down narrow country roads to meet deadlines, I caught glimpses of smoldering embers on tree stumps a few feet away. I felt vulnerable while driving through tunnels of vegetation — it would be easy to be surrounded by fire and trapped.

Everything smelled of smoke: my clothes, my car, my bag, my fingers.

I feel enormously grateful to the dozens of people who took the time to articulate their grieving, some while standing in the rubble of their homes. The fires stripped away their privacy. Their kitchens, their exercise equipment, their hobbies — their lives — were in cinders at our feet.

I think back to meeting Lisa Layman, her azure eyes staring at the ashes of her home at Coffey Park in Santa Rosa. She was recovering from cancer and recently had a kidney removed. The night before, she had escaped with her Bible and a scrapbook of her son’s early years. That is all she had.

It is a reporter’s job to bring empathy to disasters like this. But I wondered how I could ever comprehend the magnitude of her loss.

To battle the scourge of wildfires this past week, planes and helicopters have dropped several millions of gallons of fire retardant ahead of the flames. Unlike water, retardant is not distributed directly onto a fire.

“It’s not actually intended to put the fire out,” said George Matousek, the product steward for Phos-Chek, which makes the retardant used by government agencies. “It’s intended to reduce the intensity of the flame so a firefighter with a shovel or hand tool doesn’t get burned up.”

The key ingredient in retardant is ammonium phosphate, which produces nonflammable carbon — think of a diamond or pencil lead — when it chemically reacts with plant cellulose, Mr. Matousek said.

Fire retardant is essentially high-quality fertilizer and is not considered dangerous for people or plants. But it can be toxic to fish, Mr. Matousek said, by causing underwater plant life to grow and choke the oxygen from the water. The United States Forest Service bans its use within 300 feet of a waterway unless human life or property is threatened.

“When you dump that type of nutrient load on a landscape, it’s going to change a lot of dynamics,” said Richard Halsey, director of the California Chaparral Institute, which seeks to preserve native shrubland habitats. “It does cause significant harm to aquatic organisms.”

Where fire retardant lands is also important for its efficacy. Because it needs to be applied in a continuous line, it is typically dyed red or pink.

Tricky Clues

1A: “Agcy. for Kennedy and Reagan” is TSA because the clue is referring to the airports, not the presidents after which they are named.

28A: PREGGERS makes its New York Times crossword debut today, clued as “With child, informally.”

122A: This was too good to pass up. At first, I thought these were the kind of chocolate cups you make using a balloon and melted chocolate, but it turns out that we’re talking about the universe’s gift to personkind, the REESE’s peanut butter cup. And the man who first got peanut butter in his chocolate was H.B. REESE. I made sure to indulge in a few of these cups, just to make absolutely sure they were still a thing. No need to thank me. I’m happy to do the research so you don’t have to.

11D: A pun that rhymes. “Divine bovine?” is a SACRED COW.

39D: I think this clue is a nod to Brendan Emmett Quigley’s 2001 debut of the entry “WHY, YOU LITTLE ...” and it’s a great one. The answer, “SON OF A ...,” is also fairly unique, as it was used once in a 1965 puzzle as a fill-in-the-blank clue referring to a biblical quote.

43D: Clue of the Day, in my opinion. “Several quarter turns?” does not refer to actually turning something manually or screwing something in. It refers to the action of a COIN TOSS, when a quarter is turning in the air. I love visually evocative clues like that.

80D: A “System of roots?” sounds on the surface like it refers to a plant. Today it refers to ETYMOLOGY, the study of the origins of words, their roots, and how language has changed over time.

“Happy Death Day,” the latest microbudget movie from Blumhouse Productions, the Universal Pictures-affiliated studio behind runaway original hits like “Split” and “Get Out,” arrived to a strong $26.5 million in ticket sales in North America. That total was easily enough for No. 1.

In keeping with the Blumhouse model — find gifted but undervalued directors, give them little money but lots of creative control — “Happy Death Day” cost about $4.5 million to make and was directed by Christopher Landon. It received mostly positive reviews, amounting to a comeback for Mr. Landon, who wrote most of the “Paranormal Activity” films but had a misfire as a director in 2015 with “Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse.”

A horror comedy that mixes hints of the “Scream” movies with “Groundhog Day”-style repetition, “Happy Death Day” managed to turn out younger audiences. Universal, which distributed the film, said on Sunday that 63 percent of ticket buyers were under the age of 25.

How is your job different from that of a designer at a fashion company?

I am in charge of, and help lead, inspire, direct and orchestrate over 1,000 creative designers at Nike. It’s not a line by me for everybody. It’s a shared vision that I have with lots of people. I like to think we’re more of a Bauhaus. We have a clear point of view, it’s distributed to parts of our design world, and we all pursue a common aesthetic.

What is your role in the design process?

With me, it starts up front with my heads of footwear and apparel design, Andy Caine and Kurt Parker. We announce the season, we announce a clear creative direction. And that creative direction is imparted to all 1,000 people with toolboxes and events.

Then I catch up with rough sketches. From there we move into three-dimensional models and design review. We really scrutinize. Is this product right for the marketplace, the price point, the kit, the region and distribution that it’s going to? Then we have a couple rounds of iterations and we see the final samples, which include all the details, all the color, and we get final signoff.

Do egos ever get in the way?

Whenever you deal in the designer creative arts, you are dealing in the realm of ego. Of course egos play a role because we’re passionate and we’re dedicated to seeing our work come to life. I think for the most part our egos get set aside for the greater good.

Are you ever at your desk?

I sit at my desk occasionally, but mostly I’m up and out. We have a handful of studios, and so I spend a lot of time walking, biking, cruising around trying to engage and interact with our creative group.

What is this car model you have here on your shelf?

The car is a Porsche 356 Speedster Cabriolet, one of my all-time favorite cars because the form never changed over multiple decades, but the performance just kept getting better and better and better. And I think it’s a gorgeous model, and I love the shape and I love the stance of the car and I love the details. To me, it just looks like it’s fast, it’s beautiful, it’s luxurious.

What do you see in Nike’s future in terms of design?

I’m intrigued by designers that go deeper and go almost to the level of the atom, where we’re co-creating with data. I’m thinking about materiality and assembly, where products are moving more harmoniously, more symbiotically on your body so that it’s almost like a secondary skin.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

I’m really intrigued by how technology can give us a great head-start. But a head-start is a rough draft. We know data can’t dream. That’s where designers come in. The job of the designer tomorrow is to take that head-start, take that information and then imbue on top of that their intellect, their imagination, their heart and their hand.

What’s an example of your designers running with their imagination?

Our creative community decided to print out three-dimensional prints of grass, and then they duct-taped them to their feet and ran on the street. So we just said, “What if you actually married real grass or fake grass to the bottom of your shoe?” It’s not a real shoe, but it’s a sort of wonder experiment about where we can take cushioning, and how we can give that unique underfoot feel and sensation of running on grass, even in the concrete canyon.

How has new technology affected products that already exist, like the Hyperdunk sneaker?

Some things that we’ve designed were just ahead of their times, that we just couldn’t get to, either materially or construction-wise. And now, with new technologies, new construction, we can actually get to it.

Five seasons ago, the Hyperdunk didn’t have the best in-shoe feel, it didn’t have the best traction. The upper really didn’t lock you down perfectly onto the platform. Between then and now, we’ve improved. We have new ways of creating that wiper effect that creates an even stickier traction on the court. We’ve got new upper materials and new ways to sit into the actual platform that really lock the athlete. So the athlete has better contact with the floor and, I think, can therefore move quicker and pivot side to side and front to back in even better ways.

What is that woven, wooden shoe you have sitting on your shelf?

It’s a Yugoslavian dance shoe. It’s made out of birch bark. Hopefully when it’s done, it goes back to the earth. Zero waste. So I just use that as a way of thinking about using form and shape and being responsive to the planet around us. How can we take things that we might not think about as shoe materials and bring them in to create new forms and new ideas?",Nike’s Chief of Design Doodles All Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/fashion/nike-nba-uniform-golden-warriors-hyperdunk.html

Nicki Minaj is also coming down with a cold.
I am getting Nicki Minaj figured out with this album and I’m loving her.”Amy Adams Greats Cover Nicki Minaj is featured on one of the covers of T's Oct. 22 Greats issue.
I don’t know that anyone but her inner circle knows who Nicki Minaj really is.
At this point in her career, Minaj is able to reconcile, somewhat, her struggles.","THROUGHOUT HER CAREER, Minaj has demonstrated a discipline and intelligence that is rare among other pop stars of her generation. She has what she describes to me as “the X-factor, which is just the thing you can’t put into words.” Onika Tanya Maraj was born in Saint James, Trinidad and Tobago, in 1982, and immigrated to Queens, N.Y., with her family at the age of 5. She began her music career singing with various rappers and working odd jobs. When she waitressed, she wrote lyrics constantly on the notepad she used to take orders. There is genuine pleasure in her voice as she reminisces about this. “I would take people’s order and then a rap might come to me just by what they’re wearing or what they said or did, and I would go in the kitchen and write it down, put it in the back of my little thing or my apron, and by the time I was done I would have all of these sheets of paper thrown around everywhere with raps.”

Since then, her career has been a checklist of milestones. In 2009, she was the first woman artist signed to Young Money, the label founded by Lil Wayne. Three mixtapes and three studio albums — “Pink Friday” in 2010, “Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded” in 2012 and “The Pink Print” in 2014 — followed, and in March 2017, Minaj surpassed Aretha Franklin for the most appearances (76) by a woman on the Billboard Hot 100, a record Franklin had held for almost 40 years. She is the rare hip-hop artist who has successfully and sustainably crossed over into pop music. Minaj, M.I.A. and Madonna performed their single, “Give Me All Your Luvin,” at the 2012 Super Bowl. Days later she performed solo at the Grammy Awards. Her dance song “Starships” went platinum six times over. She even collaborated with Ariana Grande on 2016’s song “Side to Side,” and while the pairing was unexpected given Grande’s previously wholesome image, the song went triple platinum. Minaj does not temper her swagger or sexuality. Sometimes, when I am daydreaming, I marvel at the phrases “dick bicycle” and “If you wanna ménage I got a tricycle” from “Side to Side,” which are so damn clever and funny and vulgar but also accurate as hell for a song Grande once described as being “about riding leading to soreness.”

Minaj’s music is characterized by urgent lyrics, spitting in a range of voices and accents. Her rhymes range from bold and aggressive, to coquettish, to wanton and sultry, with a soupçon of women’s empowerment. The pace of her rapping is often breathless but her diction is impeccable. There is wit and sly humor in her work. Take the 2014 single “Only” where Minaj raps, “My man full, he just ate, I don’t duck nobody but tape/ Yeah, that was a setup for a punch line on duct tape.” She quite simply broadened the definition of hip-hop, making it more joyful, energetic and robust.

Nicki Minaj is also coming down with a cold. Yes, I know what I did there, but it also happens to be true. When we meet, she has just missed a rehearsal for an upcoming performance at Philipp Plein’s runway show because of the encroaching sickness, and is medicating herself with Theraflu, NyQuil and rest. Having to fly to New York did not help. Minaj was in Miami (where she now spends most of her time) working on her fourth studio album, the title of which is, for now, a well-kept secret but is “super, super iconic.”

That studio time begot the beginnings of her cold — the air-conditioning always blasting, shutting off, blasting again — a vicious cycle of climate control. Minaj ended up spending two nights in the studio because it was one of those sessions where she was able to “write and record and listen back and have excitement in all three of those stages.”

It took a long time to get to that place, Minaj tells me, and now, “sonically, I know what the album’s about to sound like. I know what this album is gonna mean to my fans. This album is everything in my life coming full circle and me being truly, genuinely happy. It feels almost like a celebration. The last album, ‘The Pink Print,’ was almost like my diary, closing the chapter on certain things and not knowing if I was happy or sad about beginning new chapters. I was really writing about feeling unsure. Now, I can tell you guys what happened for the last two years of my life. I know who I am. I am getting Nicki Minaj figured out with this album and I’m loving her.”

Amy Adams Greats Cover Nicki Minaj is featured on one of the covers of T's Oct. 22 Greats issue. See the other six covers

MINAJ’S PUBLIC IMAGE and personas are carefully curated. The tabloids have assiduously tracked her professional and personal lives and I restrain myself from asking about her ex Safaree Samuels, who appears on “Love & Hip Hop,” a reality television series about the music industry, and if she would ever give Drake a shot. (I restrain myself greatly.) I don’t know that anyone but her inner circle knows who Nicki Minaj really is.

This elusiveness is compounded by her fascinating catalog of performative alter egos, including Harajuku Barbie (a fashionista obsessed with pink and Minaj’s longest-running persona), Nicki Teresa (known as “The Healer”) and the sexually explicit Nicki Lewinsky — there is even a male persona, Roman Zolanski, a slightly exaggerated version of Minaj herself. She has a vocal range that can go from a high-pitched twittering to a growl in a few bars. In both music and regular conversation, she enjoys playing with accents, offering up valley girl-speak or island patois. During our time together, she switched to a British accent a couple of times and then effortlessly returned to her normal voice, a slightly affectless cadence that recalls her Queens upbringing. In public, she often wears dramatic makeup, dramatic outfits and a rainbow of dramatic wigs, which is to say she performs both on- and offstage. There is no point during our conversation where Minaj demonstrates anything but absolute self-awareness. She pauses briefly before she answers my questions, as if calculating every possible outcome to everything she says. By the end of the interview, I am impressed by her fierce intelligence.

But she’s at her most animated and unguarded when she’s talking about music, and she thinks about music in deep and complex ways. She has strong opinions on what’s necessary to make a great rapper: “Do you sound intelligent? Does your flow switch up? Are you in command of the beat? I listen for things like that.” Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Foxy Brown — “Those are the three I keep in my head when I’m writing because they’ve influenced me so much,” she says. “I feel like I’m a part of all of them.”

I’m curious about whom Minaj thinks she’s influenced herself. She tells me that around two years ago, Kanye West said to her, “ ‘Every girl I hear rap, I can hear Nicki in her rap.’ I didn’t ask him who, but that was such a great compliment. Because sometimes you think you’re the only one that can hear those types of things.”

It feels like Minaj is on the verge of another big moment in her career, and she knows it. “This is definitely the most inspired and free and excited I’ve been since I started releasing albums through a label,” she says. She is also deeply reflective about her evolution as an artist. I ask if the transition from making mixtapes to studio albums compromises the joy of creation and she answers, “Yeah, because ... artists do it to themselves. I’m not going to blame a label. You just overthink. When you’re doing your own little thing, you feel like, I can be myself, I can be crazy. When you start working with a record company, you start thinking you need a bigger sound. I wanted to get back to the place where I wasn’t second-guessing things so much. Sometimes simple is O.K.”

I ask her what it has taken to get to this place of newfound confidence and trusting her instincts. “I believe in my gift wholeheartedly,” she says. But this self-assurance was not easy to come by. “Sometimes I wake up and say, ‘I don’t know if I can do this anymore,’ you know? I’ve had those times. I’ve had those years where I’m just like, ‘Am I good enough?’ ” But she believes in her “ability to withstand what would break the normal girl,” she says.

At this point in her career, Minaj is able to reconcile, somewhat, her struggles. “I kind of love that I’ve had to go through so many hurdles to get where I am because I feel like I deserve it.” She is frank about what she has been up against. “I had so much going against me in the beginning: being black, being a woman, being a female rapper. No matter how many times I get on a track with everyone’s favorite M.C. and hold my own, the culture never seems to want to give me my props as an M.C., as a lyricist, as a writer. I got to prove myself a hundred times, whereas the guys that came in around the same time as I did, they were given the titles so much quicker without anybody second-guessing.”

I am struck by these words because I’ve heard similar sentiments from other successful women in male-dominated industries — this sense that their endurance and perseverance contribute to their greatness. But, above all, Minaj has persevered because she is always in control of her craft. Neither her work nor her success are accidental. When we finish talking and I make my exit, there are more people in the hallway, waiting for their time with her. She remains in command of the beat.","Nicki Minaj, Always in Control",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/t-magazine/nicki-minaj.html

All of Japan’s major carmakers — Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota — are looking into their use of Kobe Steel materials.
The improperly certified metals had been shipped to about 200 companies, but Kobe Steel declined to reveal their names.","Last week, Nissan Motor said unqualified staff members had carried out inspections at its factories, prompting the carmaker to recall 1.2 million vehicles, though it was not clear if the quality of the vehicles had been affected. Mitsubishi Motors and Suzuki Motor both admitted last year that they had been exaggerating the fuel economy of their vehicles by cheating on tests.

Perhaps the biggest blow to Japan’s reputation for quality has come from Takata, the airbag maker that was at the center of the largest auto safety recall in history, involving tens of millions of vehicles. Its faulty airbags have been blamed for more than a dozen deaths. Takata declared bankruptcy in June.

Toshiaki Oguchi, director of Governance for Owners Japan, a corporate watchdog, said that Japanese companies were generally diligent about quality, but that when cheating occurred — because of competitive pressure or other factors — it could too easily go unchecked. Japanese companies, he said, tend to discourage thorough examination or criticism, either from employees or from independent outsiders.

“When something goes wrong, companies always hire a committee of outsiders to examine what happened,” Mr. Oguchi said. “But why not be proactive? Why not have people reviewing procedures all the time?”

The extent of the problems at Kobe Steel are still unfolding.

Kobe Steel said on Sunday that employees at four of its factories had altered inspection certificates on aluminum and copper products from September 2016 to August this year. The changes, it said, made it look as if the products met manufacturing specifications required by customers — including for vital qualities like tensile strength, a measure of material’s ability to withstand a load without breaking when being stretched — when they did not.

On Wednesday, the company said it was investigating possible data falsification involving another product, powdered steel, which is used mostly to make gears. The company said the powdered steel it was examining had been sold to one customer it did not name.

Kobe Steel added that it was examining other possible episodes of data falsification going back 10 years. The company did not provide significant details on the discrepancies, making it difficult to immediately determine if they posed a safety threat. No deaths or safety incidents have been attributed to Kobe Steel.

The company’s share price dropped sharply on Tuesday, the first day of trading after a holiday, and as of Wednesday morning in Tokyo had lost about one-third of its value since last week.

“The falsification problem has become an issue that could destroy international faith in Japanese manufacturing,” the Japanese financial newspaper Nikkei said in an article on Tuesday.

Even as Japan has given up its lead in technologies like televisions, cellphones and computers, it still excels in highly valued products used behind the scenes, including precision machinery, specialty chemicals, sensors and cameras.

Quality helps Japan preserve its markets overseas despite intense competition. Although China is the world’s largest steel maker, Japan still exports large amounts of iron and steel there.

One of the products at the center of the scandal, rolled aluminum, is widely used in the transportation industry because it is light. The lighter a car, train or airplane, the less fuel required to propel it.

Global manufacturers are now trying to assess their exposure, as they dig through an extensive supply chain.

A big car company like G.M. buys millions of tons of steel a year from a dozen or two dozen producers, in a variety of grades and forms. Steel can be sourced from different mills and shipped to any number of plants worldwide. G.M., for example, has 12 vehicle assembly plants and six stamping plants in the United States alone, all of which take deliveries of steel from many different producers.

All of Japan’s major carmakers — Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota — are looking into their use of Kobe Steel materials. Toyota called the data falsification a “grave issue” and said it was looking into the problem and considering how best to respond, a statement echoed by other carmakers. Ford and General Motors are trying to determine whether they have used the company’s products.

Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which makes equipment for Shinkansen high-speed trains in Japan, said it was investigating. JR Tokai, a railway company that operates the busiest Shinkansen route in Japan, between Tokyo and Osaka, said that the data discrepancies “do not present a problem in terms of design standards,” but that it was nonetheless considering whether to replace certain train components.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries uses aluminum from Kobe Steel in a midsize aircraft it is developing, the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, as well as aircraft components it supplies to Boeing. Mitsubishi Heavy said it was investigating. Boeing said in a statement, “Nothing in our review to date leads us to conclude that this issue presents a safety concern, and we will continue to work diligently with our suppliers to complete our investigation.”

Kobe Steel’s problem points to “a common organization issue,” said Shin Ushijima, a lawyer who serves as president of the Japan Corporate Governance Network. He drew parallels between Kobe Steel and Takata and Mitsubishi, as well as with financial-reporting improprieties at Toshiba, which admitted to overstating profit in 2015.

“Boards aren’t doing their jobs,” he said. “This isn’t an issue that can be solved by the president resigning. There needs to be wholesale change.”

He added, “The Kobe Steel case is a test of whether we’ve learned anything from Toshiba and these other issues.”

Kobe Steel said it had confirmed data falsification affecting roughly 19,300 tons of flat-rolled and extruded aluminum products, 19,400 units of aluminum casting and forgings, and 2,200 tons of copper products. The amount was about 4 percent of the company’s output of those products from September 2016 to August.

The company said that it had received no reports from customers of problems with the affected products, and that the falsification had been discovered during an internal review. The improperly certified metals had been shipped to about 200 companies, but Kobe Steel declined to reveal their names.

It said “tens” of employees and managers had been directly involved in the falsification, although no penalties against the employees were immediately announced.

“Our players are used to this field,” said Manager Joe Girardi, who will send Sonny Gray to pitch against the Astros’ starter, Lance McCullers Jr., in Game 4 on Tuesday at 5:08 p.m. “They know how to hit here and our fans — our fans are great. I’m watching them in the first inning in left field and they’re banging on the wall. And I love it.”

The Yankees also loved that they were getting a break from Dallas Keuchel and Justin Verlander — the Astros’ two former Cy Young Award winners who dominated them over the weekend. Still, they did not exactly strafe the Astros’ starter on Monday, the right-hander Charlie Morton.

Three of their six hits off Morton did not leave the infield, and two others barely did: a bloop single by Aaron Hicks in the second and a bloop double by Greg Bird in the fourth. But they hurt just the same.

With two outs in the second, Starlin Castro reached on dribbler to third and Hicks followed with a flare into left field. That brought up Frazier, who lunged at a 95-mile-per-hour fastball that was low and off the plate, and lifted it toward right field.

The swing was so awkward that right fielder Josh Reddick broke in on the ball before realizing how hard it had been hit. Reddick retreated and gave chase, but the ball landed in the bleachers for a three-run shot.

As it did, Frazier, who grew up in Toms River, N.J., let out a yell from the basepath and pointed to some friends and relatives who were marooned in right field instead of the family section in the second deck behind the Yankees’ dugout. (“I got yelled at today,” he said.)

Frazier then pointed down to his wrist. “I’m pointing to them and saying, ‘What time is it?’ ” Frazier said. “It’s my time.”

But the lead did not look any sturdier than Frazier’s swing did as the Astros loaded the bases with two outs in the third after Sabathia walked George Springer and Jose Altuve around a single by Alex Bregman. That brought up Carlos Correa, who had homered and doubled to account for both Astros runs on Saturday.

But Sabathia’s 0-1 cutter got in on Correa’s hands, and he popped out to end the threat.

“He likes to get his hands extended,” said Sabathia, who had the first scoreless outing of his playoff career. “I was trying to get something in on him and made a good enough pitch where he popped up to short.”

In the fourth, it was Judge’s turn to thwart the Astros.

Judge, who had stolen a two-run home run from Francisco Lindor in a 1-0 win over the Indians in Game 3 of their division series, brought the crowd to its feet again — by leaving his feet again.

This time he crashed into the wall to catch a drive by Yulieski Gurriel to begin the fourth inning. Judge slammed into the wall with his left shoulder, which he had been treating with ice for after games for much of the second half of the season. After the catch, he tumbled to the warning track, the crowd roared and Sabathia threw both arms into the air.

“There’s not much give in any wall,” Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner said. “It may help if you hit it somewhere where there’s not any stands behind them, but that pad is only a couple of inches thick, and right behind that is not moving, even as big as he is. Even though it’s padded, it’s a pretty good hit he took.”

In the fifth, Judge came to Sabathia’s aid again, racing in to make a diving catch of Cameron Maybin’s liner, again lifting the crowd off its seats.

It was those types of contributions that had left Girardi heartened even though Judge, even after the home run, was 3 for 30 with 21 strikeouts since the start of the division series. While he acknowledged Judge might be pressing, Girardi also praised his attitude, his work ethic and his defense.

Judge said he remained committed to the approach he used during the regular season, when he led the A.L. with 52 home runs, a major-league rookie record.

“A big change I wanted to make this year was just prepare the right way, prepare the same way and see how it works,” Judge said. “It works during the regular season, and why would I come in the postseason and try to change something even though I’m struggling for three or four games, five, six games?”

When the Yankees took command in the fourth, their rally again had modest roots against Morton. Bird led off with a bloop double that Maybin, the left fielder, shied away from catching. After Morton retired Castro and Hicks — Bird advancing to third on the latter’s fly ball to right — Frazier drew a walk.

Chase Headley then hit a grounder up the middle that Altuve snagged with a dive, but he had no play as Bird crossed the plate. It was the first hit of the playoffs for Headley and the first by a Yankees designated hitter. After Gardner was hit by a pitch to load the bases, Manager A. J. Hinch called on the right-hander Will Harris to relieve Morton.

Harris threw Judge a 2-2 fastball up and in, but Judge turned on it and lashed a line drive that carried over the head of Maybin and landed in the first row of the left-field bleachers. Suddenly, the Yankees’ lead was 8-0.

If that ended any suspense, there were still a few moments of agitation in the ninth. Dellin Betances walked two batters, Tommy Kahnle allowed a walk and a single, and closer Aroldis Chapman was getting loose in the bullpen before Altuve grounded into a double play to end the game.

“We just couldn’t get back in the game,” Hinch said after the Yankees, with a lift from their big right fielder, managed to get back in the series.","With His Bat and His Glove, Aaron Judge Lifts Yankees Past Astros",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/sports/baseball/yankees-astros-game-3-alcs.html

The CSeries received a significant endorsement last year, when Delta Air Lines ordered 75 of the planes, which are slightly smaller than the A320 or Boeing’s 737. Although Boeing did not bid on Delta’s purchase, it undertook a trade action against Bombardier, arguing that loans and investments in the CSeries by the governments of Canada and Quebec would allow the company to sell the planes at artificially low prices. Bombardier has rejected that claim. Noting that Boeing has received help from the United States, it called its competitor’s complaint “pure hypocrisy.”

Boeing’s trade action has angered the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which immediately suspended plans to buy fighter jets from Boeing worth about 6 billion Canadian dollars ($4.8 billion). The wings of the CSeries are made at a Bombardier factory in Northern Ireland, prompting Theresa May, the British prime minister, to join Mr. Trudeau in urging President Trump to ask Boeing to drop its case. But they have not found a receptive audience in Washington.

Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, declined to comment, saying the government did not yet know enough about the development to determine its impact.

On Oct. 6, it announced an additional 79.82 percent duty for selling the aircraft at an artificially low price.

The Commerce Department will announce final rulings on the duties in December, then the United States International Trade Commission will uphold or overturn the tariffs early next year.

In a statement, Boeing called the announcement “a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidized competitors to skirt the recent findings of the U.S. government.” “Our position remains that everyone should play by the same rules for free and fair trade to work,” it said.

The assembly line in Alabama may solve the tariff problem, but it could raise political tensions in Quebec, which had bailed out the program through an investment of about 1 billion Canadian dollars. But Mr. Bellemare said the sales power of Airbus should mean that far more CSeries airplanes will be made, which will guarantee — and possibly expand — employment at the factory northwest of Montreal that now builds the plane.",Bombardier Turns to Airbus to Salvage Imperiled Airliner,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/business/bombardier-airbus.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

10A: It’s midweek, so read those clues carefully. “It’s found by the radius” sounds like it might be a math question, but it’s not; what other kind of “radius” exists? The radius we’re looking for today is a bone in the forearm. It is parallel to the ulna, a fabulous piece of osteocrosswordese (Yes, I made that up).

15A: A clue like “Brought home” evokes the childhood habit some of us might have had for bringing home stray animals and begging our parents to let us keep them. Not me, of course. But some of us. In a midweek puzzle, however, tricks are afoot, and today the clue is referring to how much money you’ve EARNED.

30A: #TIL the word MANUMIT, and it’s very interesting. To manumit is not merely to SET FREE, but to set someone free from slavery. It’s derived from the Latin manus, or hand, and means to “set forth from one’s hand,” or release from control.

Constructor Notes

I’m 20 years old, a junior at Brandeis University, majoring in Chemistry and American Studies. I started writing crosswords my freshman year of college. My school newspaper, the Justice, was using some very underwhelming syndicated crosswords, and I said to myself, “I could write better crosswords than that!” I couldn’t. At least, not at first. I still shudder to think of some of my very early crosswords. But, as I got more and more practice, I started to get decent at it. I continue to write a crossword for them each week. But when I write what I think is a really good puzzle, I send it off to The Times instead. This time, it seems Will agreed with me, and I got in. Not without a number of revisions beforehand, though. It’s a real honor to be in The New York Times for the first time, and I hope it won’t be the last! As for this puzzle’s construction, I don’t have all that much to say about it. The idea had been rattling around in my brain for a while before I got around to making it. I ended up brainstorming by thinking of all the spatial words I could muster, seeing which ones had phrases associated with them, and then seeing what I could come up with for words that fit those phrases. BENEATH ME was by far the answer I was most pleased with. I really learned a lot from the revision process, but I know I’ve got a lot left to learn about making crosswords.

Welcome to the party, Mr. Mahnken. I hope we get to see more from you soon, and 100 percent on your debut.

In August 2011, after a Chinook military helicopter was shot down over Afghanistan, killing 38 people, including 25 Special Forces troops, Mr. Obama consoled the families of all those killed, according to Jeremy B. Bash, a former chief of staff to Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, who attended the ceremony.

In the Niger episode, three American soldiers were killed while on patrol on the border between Niger and Mali this month. The body of a fourth American soldier was recovered later.

While he did not explain why he had not called their families, Mr. Trump said he had written letters to the family members over the weekend, which he said would be mailed later in the day or on Tuesday. He said he also planned to call them.

“I felt very, very badly about that,” he said. “The toughest calls I have to make are the calls where this happens. Soldiers are killed. It’s a very difficult thing,” he said. “Now, it gets to a point where, you know, you make four or five of them in one day. It’s a very, very tough day. For me, that’s by far the toughest.”

A senior official said Mr. Trump had planned to speak sooner to the families, but the White House had to wait until the Pentagon’s paperwork was completed.

Pentagon officials said the military’s Africa Command was putting together a detailed timeline of the attack and of the response by French helicopters that first provided air cover for the badly outnumbered American and Nigerian forces, and eventually medical evacuation.

On Monday, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, joined a growing chorus calling for a review of the circumstances leading to the ambush.

After he answered the question about his response to the attack, Mr. Trump was pressed later in the news conference about his claim that Mr. Obama had never called bereaved families. This time, he seemed to soften his tone.

“I don’t know if he did,” the president said. “I was told he didn’t often, and a lot of presidents don’t. They write letters.”

“President Obama, I think, probably did sometimes and maybe sometimes he didn’t,” Mr. Trump continued. “That’s what I was told.

That doesn’t mean a return to the glory days of private offices, but it does mean workers have more space and more places to seek solitude than in the neo-Dickensian workbench settings. The new designs often include “isolation rooms,” soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.

And it’s meant to be tweaked as needs change. “This continues to be iterated,” said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM — and whose use of the word “iterated” hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.

“It’s not something we’re going stop and say, ‘This is it,’” he said.

The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work — or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce’s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.

Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.

“These workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.

The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called “activity-based workplace design,” tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.

“Office geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,” said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.

“You have to collaborate more,” said Michael Ford, Microsoft’s general manager of global real estate. “We absolutely have to change.”

For decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.

Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to “do a turtle,” researchers say, and retrench and communicate less — colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example

Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. “That’s the sweet spot for Microsoft,” Mr. Ford said.

The company thinks it is working. Microsoft’s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company’s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.

Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.",Don’t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/the-office-gets-remade-again.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

TENS Unit

O.K., so yes, these kind of look like those gimmicky electronic muscle stimulators from the ’90s that promised abs without the work, but the similarities end there. A TENS unit is designed to help with the kind of acute pain you might get from a sports injury or workout soreness.

“Think of using one like popping an Advil, or taking an ice bath: It won’t fix a permanent problem and is not a replacement for long-term treatment, but it might feel good,” Wirecutter writes in its recommendation.

Wirecutter’s pick is the TechCare Massager Plus.

Compression Socks

Some people — including yours truly — slip on a pair of compression socks after an especially tough run, or after it’s been a while since hitting the trail, to help with calf soreness. (And many runners swear by them even during a run, though the science is still out on their helpfulness on that front.)

Wirecutter’s favorite are the Sockwell Elevation Firm Socks.

Yoga Mat

We all know we should stretch more after working out, but it truly can be one of the things that keeps you going and will get you to the next workout. If you’re looking for some tips on working those sore muscles, our beginner’s guide to yoga is a great place to start.

That’s especially true when you consider the real origin of Wonder Woman, the warrior with the indestructible bracelets and slightly kinky magic lasso who burst into comics in 1941. As it happens, there was more kink to her story than suggested by that golden lasso, which she uses to force her captives to tell the truth and looks like something from a bondage emporium. “On Paradise Island where we play many binding games,” she says in an early comic while roping another woman, “this is considered the safest method of tying a girl’s arms!”

There are some exceedingly delectable questions posed in “Professor Marston and the Wonder Women,” and a few frisky binding games on tap too. A sly and thoroughly charming Trojan horse of a movie, “Professor Marston” tells the story of the man who created Wonder Woman and the women who inspired him, both in and out of bed. The movie gleams and has all the smooth surfaces and persuasive detail of a typical period picture — the fedoras, the rides, the Katharine Hepburn trousers. All that luster, which too often in movies suggests polite manners and drowsily safe entertainment, proves to be a seductive, glossy way into something more satisfyingly complicated.

If nothing else, “Professor Marston” is another reminder that once upon a time people had sexual appetites and relationships as complex as those of today (or of 18th-century France), something else the movies don’t always like to admit. Occasionally, grandpa might have even visited a dusty, mysterious shop with sexy specialty items in front and something naughtier in back. Dr. William Moulton Marston (a winning Luke Evans) finds out just how special those items could be when he pops into a store where a man calling himself the G-string King (J.J. Feild) opens up a world of consensual power play and pleasure.

At that point, life has already become interesting for Marston. The writer-director Angela Robinson lays out just how, well, knotty it all is with wit, sympathy and economy. Spanning decades, the story takes flight in 1928 with Marston teaching young lovelies at Radcliffe. “Are you normal?” he asks of a beaming, receptive audience that serves as an amusing stand-in for the viewer. Marston has answers to that and other questions, along with a theory he calls DISC — for dominance, inducement, submission and compliance — which sounds terribly complex and slightly ridiculous. (“D, I, S and C,” the real Marston wrote, “represent nodal points in the integrative emotion series.”)

Ms. Robinson borrows Marston’s theory, using it as a clever if somewhat schematic framing device as she spins her story. There are moments of domination, psychological as well as physical. There are also interludes of inducement, submission and compliance mixed in with a sweet, soft-focus romance that initially involves Marston and his wife, a frustrated academic, Elizabeth Holloway Marston (Rebecca Hall, tart, brisk, essential), and soon includes a third, Olive Byrne (a very good Bella Heathcote). A student, Olive cracks open the Marstons’ marriage, but instead of destroying it helps it grow into a shared, liberating adventure that settles into something cozily domestic.","Review: ‘Professor Marston,’ With Kinks!

I liked Binyamin Appelbaum’s historical comparison of the Trump tax cut with Reagan and Bush, although such a comparison risks suggesting that the previous rounds made sense. They didn’t. The Reagan tax cut caused a sharp reversal in the long-run trend toward a declining debt-GDP ratio, the Bush tax cuts undid the fiscal progress of the Clinton years. And conversely, the Clinton tax hike helped produce surpluses even as the economy experienced a large boom, totally the opposite of what the usual suspects on the right predicted.

That said, Trumpcuts are an even worse idea than Reaganomics, and not just because we start from much higher debt, the legacy of the financial crisis, which cut deeply into revenue and temporarily boosted spending. It also matters that we start from a much lower top tax rate than Reagan did.

Here’s the modern history of the top marginal rate:

Photo

So Reagan was cutting taxes with a starting rate of 70%; Trumpcuts would start from only a bit more than half that. Why does this matter?

Actually, two reasons. First, tax cuts are supposed to spur growth by increasing the amount of an increment in income someone can keep for himself or herself. When you start from 70% taxation, cutting the rate 1 percent raises the take-home component by 1/30, or more than 3%. When you start from 39.6%, the same size cut raises the take-home slice by 1/60, or half as much. In other words, we’d expect the incentive effects of a given tax cut now to be only half what they were under Reagan.

And suppose for the sake of argument that you do get some extra growth. How much of this feeds back into higher revenue? That depends on the marginal tax rate — which is much lower now, only a bit more than half, than it was in 1981.

So even if you believed that voodoo economics worked under Reagan — which it didn’t — it would take a lot more voodoo, in fact around 4 times as much, for it to work now.

This is where Alan Jacobs’s absolutely splendid forthcoming book “How to Think” comes in. If Thaler’s work is essential for understanding how the market can go astray, Jacobs’s emphasis on the relational nature of thinking is essential for understanding why there is so much bad thinking in political life right now.

Jacobs makes good use of C. S. Lewis’s concept of the Inner Ring. In every setting — a school, a company or a society — there is an official hierarchy. But there may also be a separate prestige hierarchy, where the cool kids are. They are the Inner Ring.

There are always going to be people who desperately want to get into the Inner Ring and will cut all sorts of intellectual corners to be accepted. As Lewis put it, “The passion for the Inner Ring is most skillful in making a man who is not yet a very bad man do very bad things.”

People will, for example, identify and attack what Jacobs calls the Repugnant Cultural Other — the group that is opposed to the Inner Ring, which must be assaulted to establish membership in it.

Other people will resent the Inner Ring, and they will cut all sorts of intellectual corners in order to show their resentment. These people are quick to use combat metaphors when they talk about thinking (he shot down my argument, your claims are indefensible). These people will adopt shared vague slurs like “cuckservative” or “whitesplaining” that signal to the others in the outsider groups that they are attacking the ring, even though these slurs are usually impediments to thought.

Jacobs notices that when somebody uses “in other words” to summarize another’s argument, what follows is almost invariably a ridiculous caricature of that argument, in order to win favor with the team. David Foster Wallace once called such people Snoots. Their motto is, “We Are the Few, the Proud, the More or Less Constantly Appalled at Everyone Else.”

Jacobs nicely shows how our thinking processes emerge from emotional life and moral character. If your heart and soul are twisted, your response to the world will be, too. He argues that by diagnosing our own ills, we can begin to combat them. And certainly I can think of individual beacons of intellectual honesty today: George Packer, Tyler Cowen, Scott Alexander and Caitlin Flanagan, among many.

But I’d say that if social life can get us into trouble, social life can get us out. After all, think of how you really persuade people. Do you do it by writing thoughtful essays that carefully marshal facts? That works some of the time. But the real way to persuade people is to create an attractive community that people want to join. If you do that, they’ll bend their opinions to yours. If you want people to be reasonable, create groups where it’s cool to be reasonable.

Jacobs mentions that at the Yale Political Union members are admired if they can point to a time when a debate totally changed their mind on something. That means they take evidence seriously; that means they can enter into another’s mind-set. It means they treat debate as a learning exercise and not just as a means to victory.

How many public institutions celebrate these virtues? The U.S. Senate? Most TV talk shows? Even the universities?

That’s why social media and mainstream news outlets are invested in promoting it; they can both fuel and produce desires by tailoring their content to suit individual tastes. The red and blue newsfeeds and the “click bait” that proliferate on them produce profits, but they have also helped to make our time one of deep divisions and reactionary hatred, with a radicalization of both sides in a culture war that risks deepening into a civil war, with militarized armies of fascists and anti-fascists fighting in the streets.

In a culture that increasingly values raw emotions uncontaminated by scholarly analysis, the uncritical legitimation of feelings as the basis for moral authority becomes a form of political leveling. If unexamined outrage is the new truth, then we are moving dangerously close to a form of reactionary politics that closes down difficult discussions and prevents us from distinguishing between sexism or racism and critical discussions of them. Certainly, as Pascal said, “the heart has its reasons of which reason knows not,” but we have arrived at a point where we need to analyze what they are in order to better understand ourselves and others.

Privileging raw feelings over the cooked analysis of them not only fuels anti-intellectualism, but also conceals the socio-historical context that produces those feelings. In other words, feelings are never completely raw, but always already cooked. So, too, analysis is never completely devoid of emotion. Pathos and logos aren’t polar opposites. Yet to authorize outrage (whether on the left or the right) as foundational and beyond analysis is to deny the ways in which race, class, gender, politics, upbringing, culture and history shape our emotions.

When outrage becomes an end in itself, it also becomes a form of fundamentalism and part of a dogma of purity that can be potentially aggressive, hostile and violent. When political activism becomes dogmatic and punishing, it uses the same techniques of exclusion and oppression that it rejects — only now in the name of liberation.

While political purity and fundamentalism are expressions of real distress, they close down self-critical examination of that distress, and our own investments in violence. And, they produce a need for ever more and stronger outrage. Furthermore, if unexamined feelings and outrage always trump arguments and analysis, then the unhappy consequence is that white nationalists and on-campus rapists will be as justified in their claims to victimhood and safe spaces as black men and women abused by police or women who’ve been raped. We need ways of distinguishing between calling in and calling out to fight oppression-based violence.

Leveling violence and harm, and ignoring socio-historical context, risks undermining the voices of victims of the worst abuse and oppression. Comparing the suffering of perpetrators of racial or sexual violence and hate speech to the suffering of their victims is an unacceptable consequence of accepting outrage as the source of moral authority. Comparing the pain and suffering of being raped to the pain and suffering of being accused of rape not only belittles the experiences of the rape victim, but also coops the discourse of victimhood in ways that demand analysis. So, too, comparing teachers and scholars criticizing sexism and racism to perpetrators of violence and hate speech closes down discussions necessary to address — and hopefully overcome — those very harms.

Obviously, as teachers and scholars, we make mistakes and need to be open to interminable education. But the conditions for critical teaching and learning are undermined when feelings are equated with reasons in call-out culture.

Certainly, outrage has a place in the academy and in politics. But when emotional pain and suffering are taken as the foundation of moral authority and cannot be analyzed because they are viewed as absolute truths or obvious facts, the mission of higher education — to examine unquestioned assumptions about the world and the self — becomes a mission impossible.

Although social media can be effective for organizing, and for forming communities (on both the left and the right), it is also often fueled by emotional reaction rather than thoughtful response. Life is flattened to fit the screen, and cute cat videos play next to photographs of the latest atrocity. Social media works by leveling and ripping bits of life from their contexts as a form of entertainment or news — the more outrageous, the better. As consumers, we engage in the virtual performance of pathos and moral virtue with our likes, crying or angry Emojis, and the circulation of outrage or sympathy through sharing petitions or calls for donations.

In academia, social media has become not just a way to disseminate research, or engage in debate, but also a way to close it down by shaming and cyberbullying. Outrage may be the first word in social transformation, but it shouldn’t be the last.

You might say that by withdrawing their labor, subsidized workers reduce the overall size of the economic pie, which is true.
Why do you care how much other people work?
So yes, reduced labor supply adds modestly to the true cost of health reform, although it also adds to the benefits.
Should you care how much other people work?","The brouhaha over the CBO report – I don’t want to call it a debate, because that would suggest that people on both sides are making sense, or even listening – continues. But there is a massive lack of clarity. This is, no doubt, in large part because incoherence serves the interests of some parties. But I think there’s also some genuine intellectual confusion that might, for a few players at least, actually be reduced by careful analysis.

So let me try this, by asking: why should anyone be upset if some workers take advantage of Obamacare to reduce their working hours, or even drop out of the labor force? That’s a real question, by the way, not a rhetorical one. There are, it turns out, some reasons to be concerned, although they’re much weaker than the rhetoric would lead you to believe.

It helps, I’d argue, if you think of the American population as comprising two groups: those who receive subsidies toward their health insurance and those who don’t – the subsidized and the subsidizers. In reality these categories are arguably a bit more complex than a mere matter of monetary transfers, since Obamacare also in effect subsidizes those in poor health by charging them the same premiums as the healthy. But I don’t think this changes the point.

So, we know that Obamacare has costs to the subsidizers, in the form of the subsidies that must be paid – about 0.9 percent of GDP — and that eventually must be reflected in higher taxes or lower spending than would otherwise take place. These subsidies correspondingly represent benefits to the subsidized; yes, Virginia, it’s redistribution, although many people who end up subsidizing rather than subsidized were at risk of being on the other side, and will therefore gain from the insurance aspect.

The question, however, is how those costs and benefits are affected if a significant number of the subsidized take advantage of their new freedom from health insurance fear to reduce hours or leave the work force.

For those who choose to work less, this is a clear gain – otherwise they wouldn’t do it! It’s likely to be especially beneficial because our pre-Obamacare system created so much “job lock”, trapping people in full-time employment because health insurance was an all-or-nothing affair.

What about the subsidizers? Don’t say that it’s obvious that they are hurt – remember, we’re talking about additional costs over and above the cost of the subsidies.

You might say that by withdrawing their labor, subsidized workers reduce the overall size of the economic pie, which is true. However, they also take a smaller share of the economic pie, because they earn less in wages and salaries. And if you believe to a first approximation in the marginal productivity theory of income distribution (as free-market advocates should), this means that the reduction in GDP from reduced labor input should be approximately equal to the reduced wages of those working less. In other words, the amount left over for everyone else should be unchanged. Why do you care how much other people work?

OK, what’s wrong with this story? The answer is that it’s a story about pre-tax wages. When someone chooses to work less, he or she imposes a hidden cost on everyone else, because he or she ends up paying less in taxes – or in some cases gets to collect more in means-tested benefits.

How big is this effect? I argued in an earlier post that if we believe the CBO estimate, labor withdrawal should reduce GDP by slightly over 0.5 percent. If we assume a marginal tax rate of 40 percent for the relevant workers (which seems in the ballpark for ordinary workers in the 15 percent bracket, paying 15 percent payroll tax, and some state and local taxes on top), this is a bit over 0.2 percent of GDP.

So yes, reduced labor supply adds modestly to the true cost of health reform, although it also adds to the benefits. But the key word is “modestly”.

Why, then, are the usual suspects so incensed? Partly because they don’t understand any of this. Beyond that, there’s a moralistic streak: people should be forced to work, for their own good, you see (are there no poorhouses?). And of course, there’s the underlying rage that a disproportionate share of the beneficiaries (though by no means a preponderance) will be Those People.

But when you take paternalism and prejudice out of the picture, what you’re left with is some pretty prosaic economics. Should you care how much other people work? Yes, a little – but not so much that it should change anyone’s views about health reform.",Why Do You Care How Much Other People Work?,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/why-do-you-care-how-much-other-people-work/

Adams, however, didn’t frame it that way: “I can’t blame anything other than I did not do my best at that point.
“I feel partially responsible for the tone that’s on set,” Adams said.
Adams speaks up when she wants, how she wants, and she is saying yes — and no — on her own terms.
These days, instead of telling her daughter “Don’t be bossy,” Adams asks her little girl who she is the boss of.","A pointillist, she creates pinpricks of emotion, but can easily go bigger than life, as she did to play Sydney, a con artist in the lollapalooza “American Hustle” (2013), a loose take on the Abscam scandal of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Slipping in and out of accents as well as plunging necklines, Adams — a virtuoso of complicated, seemingly contradictory moods — takes this shiny, flashy character and turns her into the most electric person in the movie. Adams studied acting for years and can cry at the drop of a dime, as she’s proved on more than one talk show. She has learned how to play the celebrity game: She knows how to chat up Jimmy Fallon, smile on the red carpet and keep cool when the paparazzi pounce. Significantly, she doesn’t give the gossip websites much material, even if she made a guest appearance in them this summer. “Fans freak that she’s pregnant after she wears flowy sundress,” one item exclaimed (erroneously). Adams seemed amused by the speculation. Stardom for women involves constant surveillance; shaking off these intrusions is crucial to maintaining and defending a private self.

A PARADOX OF stardom is that it depends on the appearance of an ordinary life. Some of this is about relatability, but it’s also about how actors fill performances up with their own humanity. In person, Adams seems nice, thoughtful, a touch vulnerable, which is how she sometimes appears on camera. (Big eyes help.) She also conveys appealing resilience. When she arrived for our interview she wasn’t accompanied by anxious handlers; when she left, she drove herself. She seems of our earth, not one of those exotic creatures whose celebrity becomes so otherworldly that it edges into camp. Yet like all stars, this palpable humanity comes with an ineluctable facility for both holding the screen and your attention. Adams seemed reluctant to see this in herself. When I mentioned Charlize Theron in passing, she lit up. “She can just sit on the couch, and you’re like, ‘That! That thing, what is it?’ That’s not me.”

I insisted that Adams was wrong, because while her appeal is different from Theron’s — Adams draws you to her, Theron keeps you at a distance — each makes you want to watch her and only her for as long as she’s on screen. Adams waved off the compliment. In someone else this might have read as false modesty, but she came across as someone who knows better than to trust other people’s admiration. It’s skepticism that feels grounded in experience. Adams found a manager soon after moving to Los Angeles in 1999 from Minnesota, where she had been working in dinner theater and dancing in regional musicals like “Brigadoon.” She was 24, with one movie credit (the 1999 beauty pageant satire “Drop Dead Gorgeous”), but she was also just another pretty young hopeful on a very crowded assembly line.

“I would go into auditions and it would be me and three model versions of me,” she said, “and I would never get the job.” It was the era of “Dawson’s Creek” and Katie Holmes. Adams did a lot of television (“I guest-starred on every WB show that was ever made”), but stripping down to a bikini to win a part wasn’t working for her. “I always thought it’s an ‘it’ factor and I just don’t have ‘it,’ ” she said. She credited her manager with helping her overcome self-doubt. “You get to decide what you want to be,” Adams recalled her manager telling her. “You get to decide that, Amy.”

She was still figuring it out when she landed the delectable role of an early 1960s candy striper in Steven Spielberg’s “Catch Me if You Can,” a 2002 biographical caper starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the con artist Frank Abagnale Jr. As Brenda, Adams weeps through much of her first scene with DiCaprio, her eyes red and watery, a hand hovering over her mouth as her character tries to hide her metal braces. DiCaprio is playing the seducer, and Adams is a stand-in for us, the soon-to-be seduced. Later, after Brenda’s braces come off and she clambers into Frank’s lap, Adams complicates the character’s innocence with heat, letting you see the clumsy girl and desiring woman at once.

Critics singled out Adams’s performance, but she was a supporting player in a Leonardo DiCaprio vehicle and, as she put it, the girl in braces: “It’s not like I had a beautiful gown with him walking down the steps of the Titanic.” The role brought her different kinds of auditions, but it was more a break than a breakthrough. When a writer friend pitched Adams to a studio for another project, the limits of Spielberg’s largess became conspicuous. The studio’s response, as Adams described it to me, was: “Oh, the homely girl from ‘Catch Me if You Can.’ ” That’s preposterous and offensive, and typical of the industry’s sexism. Adams, however, didn’t frame it that way: “I can’t blame anything other than I did not do my best at that point. I don’t think I inspired confidence.”

Confidence is a thread that wends through many stories about successful women who need to overcome not only their own insecurities but also a world that greets female achievement with ambivalence at best. When we spoke, Adams largely narrated her history in personal terms, but it was clear that the industry played its part. “I was getting ready to turn 30,” she said of the period that followed “Catch Me if You Can.” “I was tired of being unhappy and tired of chasing something that might not belong to me, like a career in film and television.” She was ready to let go of what she thought “being an actress was, or this idea of being a movie star, this idea of being ‘it,’ of being The Girl.” She was thinking of moving to New York to focus on her craft and start over. And then “Junebug” happened.

Adams’s role as a pregnant innocent, Ashley, in this little-seen 2005 independent movie was part of what became a slow-moving career trifecta. If “Catch Me if You Can” indicated that she was a fresh talent, “Junebug” suggested the richness of her range, showing her gift for moving from emotional lightness to darkness and back again. With crystalline sensitivity, Adams makes you care deeply about Ashley, whose virtue carries great narrative weight; even for those who didn’t respond to “Junebug” and its contrived hokum, the performance was a reminder of how a single actor can nearly redeem a movie. (It led to her first Oscar nomination.) Adams’s next leap forward came with the Disney hit “Enchanted,” which depends entirely on her to transform a high concept — a cartoon princess becomes human — into a delightful fairy story. Adams, who studied dance, sweeps into the movie with grace, tremulous feeling and fluttering hands, delivering an extraordinary performance that established that she had arrived at last.

SINCE THEN THERE have been juicier roles and steady acclaim and, of course, more Oscar nominations. In 2015, Adams married her longtime boyfriend, Darren Le Gallo, an artist she met in acting class, with whom she has a daughter, Aviana, named after Aviano, the Italian city where Adams, a military brat, was born. (Adams is one of seven children in a family that was Mormon until her parents’ divorce.) Having Aviana led Adams to again rethink her relationship to work. “I had to learn how to shut the door when I walk off the set. It’s hard and it doesn’t always work, but more often than not it does now,” she says. Long hours and location shoots can be tough on families, but having a husband who is willing to pack up with Adams helps. “We’ve realized we can be happy in an apartment in Detroit or a house in Hollywood or a hotel room,” she said. “It’s a good feeling, but I’m protective of it — very protective.”

It can be tricky shutting that door on a project like “Sharp Objects,” where she plays a reporter chasing a grisly story and where, for the first time, she has an executive producer credit. “What was exciting for me was being part of the creative development,” Adams said, “getting to feel comfortable speaking, feeling like that was my role now. Like, oh wait, I have an opinion and I’m going to share it!” She enjoyed it, but is unsure how much more producing she wants to do. “I can multitask,” she said, “it’s just an intense experience. And especially when you’re working every day of production, all day every day, in a dark character, and then trying to manage the other stuff — for me it was challenging.”

Those challenges extended to the set, including one day when, for a tricky single take, she had to crawl on a bathroom floor while weeping and drinking fake vomit she then had to spit up. As she was crawling and weeping and vomiting, a male crew member kept whispering the location of a prop until she finally barked, “I’ve got it, I’ve got it!” She apologized, explaining that she’d been staying in character. “He was trying to be helpful,” she told me. It’s the kind of response that I’d expected from Adams — but I had misunderstood her. I thought she was illustrating how she had gone to a psychologically dark place, but the point was that she knew she was right to call this man out. “I feel partially responsible for the tone that’s on set,” Adams said. “I’m sorry for how he felt, but I knew why I was doing that.”

Adams was standing up for herself, which is what we demand of women. What we sometimes forget, however, is that not every woman is going to speak up on her own behalf — or for other women — in exactly the same way or necessarily as a political declaration, and that she shouldn’t have to, either. What happened after Sony Pictures Entertainment was hacked in 2014 offers a good feminist case in point. Among all the ugly, embarrassing information that the hack revealed was that both Adams and Jennifer Lawrence had been paid less than their male co-stars in “American Hustle.” Lawrence went public with her feelings about the wage gap and was by turns praised and condemned for doing so. Adams said she was proud of Lawrence but made it repeatedly clear she didn’t want to discuss it in detail, if at all.

“I don’t want to talk about my own experience because I fight my own fight and I feel comfortable doing that,” Adams said when I mentioned the hack. And, as she admitted, “There’s not a lot of empathy out there for celebrities.” But the disparity that the Sony hack revealed made her curious. Years earlier, to prepare for some of her period movies, she had started reading books like “The Feminine Mystique.” (“I didn’t go to college. I didn’t do women’s studies. I had no idea.”) After the hack, she dug in again. “I spent a lot more time educating myself about what women executives get paid.” She read about C.E.O.s and teachers, the sociology and cultural conditioning.

“It’s important to talk about inequality,” Adams said. “But for me, where I feel most empowered is in educating myself and being, hopefully, a mentor for younger women. That’s more important. I offer any young actress I work with my phone number. I’ll tell them on set, ‘You don’t have to do that. You can say no.’ ” It seems like a modest gesture, but less so when you consider that the movie industry has long profited from female submission, from women acquiescing because their only choice is exploitation or unemployment. This is what makes women saying no powerful, and why it’s heartening that many are speaking up. Adams speaks up when she wants, how she wants, and she is saying yes — and no — on her own terms. These days, instead of telling her daughter “Don’t be bossy,” Adams asks her little girl who she is the boss of. “And she says, ‘Me.’ And I say, ‘That’s right. And you get to choose who you are.’ ”",The Versatile and Resilient Amy Adams,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/t-magazine/amy-adams.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Earlier this year, the Ryerson Image Center in Toronto received a donation of 24,804 images from a collector, Chris Bratty, who had purchased the collection with the intention of donating it. Selected by a team led by two gallerists, Steven Kasher and Stephen Bulger, the pictures range from World War I to the late 1990s, from hockey players to lumberjacks. A selection is currently on view in an exhibition at the center and in a book, both entitled “The Faraway Nearby.”

“When I heard of the collection, I immediately wanted to acquire it,” said Paul Roth, an American who is the center’s director. “For all the strengths of our holdings — including the Black Star and the Berenice Abbott archives — we don’t have a tremendous amount of Canadian photojournalism. This helps us fill that gap. And, since it comes from a major U.S. newspaper, it brings up the question of how one country covers another, which fits within our mandate of interrogating different aspects of the medium.”

The expected tropes are there: Canada as a winter wonderland; as a safe, polite neighbor who reveres hockey. But there are also images that challenge them: Canada the diplomat having lighthearted meetings with America’s foes. In one photo, Nikita S. Khrushchev laughs at a joke told by Mr. Pearson — the opposite of the famous “Kitchen Debate” moment by Elliott Erwitt, in which then-Vice President Richard Nixon castigates the Soviet leader. In another, Fidel Castro holds Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau’s youngest son, Michel Charles-Émile, during a four-day state visit. Or, Canada the troubled young nation deploying the Army to confront Quebec’s sometimes-violent calls for independence.

“The type of coverage we see speaks of a dual fascination between how familiar Canada feels, and yet how unfamiliar it sometimes appears,” Mr. Roth surmised. “I suspect that The New York Times had to ponder how to cover a country that was so close. Should they concentrate on the differences or highlight the similarities? When stories involved people or goods crossing the border, which was often the case, were they to be considered national or international news?”

Besides snow and hockey, evidence of Canada’s subordination to the British monarchy seemed of particular interest. The New York Times dedicated space daily to Princess Elizabeth’s first tour of Canada in 1951 (Slide 9) and continued to chronicle the royal family’s subsequent visits.

Mr. Trudeau also drew a lot of attention, more than any of his predecessors and successors, that is, until his son Justin ran for the same office and won in 2015. A reproduction of a spread published during the 1972 election is revealing. Within “The World” section, the article isn’t under a rubric with the country’s name, as is customary, but simply “Trudeau,” and a headline declaring “A Swinger Shows His Sober Side.” A full column is dedicated to a collage of images showing the candidate dancing, riding a motorcycle, playing hockey and pedaling a unicycle before concluding with a somber close-up portrait.

Mounting the exhibition, Denise Birkhofer — an American who recently settled in Toronto and co-curated the show with Gerald McMaster, an Indigenous Canadian of Plains Cree and Blackfoot descent — pondered how The New York Times’s fondness for certain subjects and visual archetypes might have shaped a national identity. That’s hard to answer, partly because of the variety of photographers who contributed to the paper’s Canadian coverage.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said. “Not all were Americans. Sometimes staff photographers were sent to cover a story, but other times it came from local publications or freelancers. There were also images made by Canadian agencies or corporations, such as the National Film Board and the Canadian Pacific Railway.”

Most surprisingly, during World War I, the images the paper used to showcase Canada’s participation in the war effort were supplied by Canadian entities, whose work had to be vetted by the nation’s official censors. Its goal was to avoid criticism of military endeavors by showing the conflict in a romanticized light. In other words, said Gaëlle Morel, the Ryerson Image Center exhibitions curator, “The New York Times — a private commercial enterprise — obeyed the censorship requirements of a foreign country.” In other words, the country’s image, as seen in The Times, reflected an official, sanitized perspective.

Mr. Roth said the collection has greater meaning given Canada’s sesquicentennial this year. “More than a time for celebration and patriotism, it is an occasion to think about complicated questions relating to the identity of the nation,” he said. “All countries should be interested in how they’re viewed by other states. We should strive to get past the mythologies that are created to promote tourism or to reinforce patriotic values, especially nowadays. Doing so requires unpacking widely held cultural assumptions. And that’s exactly what we can do thanks to this archive. While it doesn’t tell a single story, it does help us understand what the Canadian mythologies are.”

But some longtime media investors, noting the seriousness of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein, questioned what could be done with such a toxic asset.

“I don’t think you can sell this company with all the litigation you’re looking at,” said Amir Malin, the founder of Qualia Capital, a media investment firm. Mr. Malin was referring to both pre-existing commercial lawsuits and the vast number of potential lawsuits related to Harvey Weinstein’s sexual behavior.

Work has been underway in Hollywood to end partnerships with the studio. Amazon pulled the plug late Friday on a major television deal. At the same time, agents say they have been pressing the Weinstein Company to sell finished or near finished films like “The Upside,” a comedy starring Kevin Hart and Nicole Kidman, and “Mary Magdalene” starring Rooney Mara; many of the stars involved with those projects want nothing to do with the Weinsteins.

The Weinstein Company, already struggling in recent years because of box office misfires, has been imploding since investigations by The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed sexual harassment and rape allegations against Harvey Weinstein going back decades. Over the last week and a half, more than 30 women have come forward publicly with harrowing stories of encounters with him. Police in New York and London have started looking into some claims against Mr. Weinstein, who has denied “any allegations of nonconsensual sex.”

Four board members have resigned in recent days, leaving only Mr. Ammar, Bob Weinstein and Lance Maerov.

As a private company — the brothers each own about 23 percent — the Weinstein Company has never been particularly forthcoming about its revenue or debt load. In recent years, as talk of unpaid bills and an inability to finance marketing campaigns has occasionally surfaced, the Weinsteins insisted their company was, in fact, rolling in money.

But certain financial problems surfaced that Harvey Weinstein was unable to refute. Facing bankruptcy in 2010, for instance, the Weinstein Company sold rights to 200 older films to Goldman Sachs and an insurance company, Assured Guaranty. The exact titles that were sold are not publicly known. Goldman, in turn, sold its portion to AMC Networks in 2015.

The Weinstein Company now has assets that fall into three groups: the remaining library of old movies, upcoming films and television. All three are problematic.

Given the 2010 sale, much of the value of the library has “already been extracted,” Mr. Malin said.

The Weinstein Company has seven completed movies, but some of those are art films with limited box office potential, especially without Harvey Weinstein’s hard-knuckled efforts to strengthen audience interest through awards campaigns. Others are potentially tainted by the scandal that has settled over the studio.

One movie on the Weinstein Company’s release schedule is “Paddington 2,” for instance. The first “Paddington” took in a solid $76.3 million in North America in 2015. But marketing a family movie is going to be hard for a company associated with harassment allegations.

Anchored by “Project Runway,” the Weinstein Company’s television unit has been a bright spot recently. Upcoming series include three projects for the Paramount Network, the Viacom-owned channel formerly known as Spike. (A Paramount spokesman confirmed on Monday that those were moving forward.) But other television projects have died over the last week as networks have scrambled to sever ties with the studio.

“The question is whether the television division is a going concern or a liquidation,” Mr. Malin said. “Some will argue that the major asset of the television division was Harvey Weinstein’s ability to be a rainmaker — to line up deals.”

Colony Capital is the private equity arm of Colony NorthStar, an investment firm that controls $56 billion in assets. Mr. Barrack, its chairman, has gained attention recently for his longtime friendship with President Trump. Mr. Barrack was a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign and served as chairman of his inaugural committee.

Mr. Barrack, the grandson of Lebanese immigrants who owned a grocery store in the suburbs of Los Angeles, made his money by betting on out-of-favor assets. In the 1990s, Colony Capital bought bad loans during the savings-and-loan crisis and bet on Asian assets after the Asian currency crisis. The same strategy was used following the 2008 financial crisis. Colony Capital acquired billions of dollars of distressed commercial and residential property mortgages and loans that had been seized from failed banks by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

But Colony has also made a number of investments in distressed entertainment assets.

In the spring of 2008, Colony bailed out Michael Jackson, who was on the verge of default over a $24.5 million mortgage for Neverland Ranch, his 2,500-acre playground in Santa Ynez, Calif. When Jackson died in 2009, the ranch wound up in Colony’s hands. Renamed Sycamore Valley Ranch, the property was relisted this year for $67 million. That’s down from the $100 million original listing price two years ago.

In 2010, Colony acquired the debt of the celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz after she was unable to make payments on a $24 million loan.

Colony’s biggest play in the entertainment industry also came in 2010, when it was part of a consortium that acquired Miramax Films and its 700-film library for $660 million. The Weinstein brothers founded Miramax in 1979 and sold it to Disney in 1993. Ironically, Colony was then a Weinstein foe: Harvey Weinstein desperately wanted Miramax back, and Mr. Barrack’s group outbid him.

The Miramax deal was criticized as exorbitant, but Mr. Barrack benefited from the unexpectedly fast rise of streaming services like Netflix, which licensed old Miramax films like “Pulp Fiction” and “Chicago.” “We have made more money than we ever imagined,” Mr. Barrack told The New York Times in 2013 about the deal.",Weinstein Company Agrees to a Rescue Investment From Colony Capital,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/business/media/weinstein-colony-capital.html

Who rules the American right? I fairly often find myself talking with people who see either the nation as a whole or at least the right side of the political spectrum as a pure oligarchy, where the big money controls everything. And money definitely plays an outsized and generally malign role in policy. Usually, however, it’s only the root of some evil, not all evil: the vileness of a Roy Moore or Joe Arpaio comes from very different sources,

But one area where the simplistic view is close to correct is tax policy. There really is no clamor, even among Republicans, for tax cuts on the wealthy and corporations. And overall public opinion is strongly against.

Nor is there a technocratic case for these cuts. There is no evidence whatsoever that tax cuts produce great economic outcomes — zero, zilch, nada. The “experts” who claim otherwise are all hired guns, and notably incompetent hired guns at that.

Distribution tables—estimates of who wins and who loses from changes in tax law—are central to any debate about tax reform. Such analyses frequently show the plans put forward by Republican politicians to be severely regressive, delivering large income gains for high-income families and little for the overwhelming majority of families. The blueprint for tax reform released by House Republicans in 2016, for example, would increase after-tax incomes for the top 1 percent of families by 13 percent in the first year after enactment but would increase incomes for the bottom 95 percent of families by less than half of 1 percent.

If U.S. tax reform delivers equitable growth, a distribution table will show it

Read the full PDF in your browser

In response, proponents of regressive tax plans often assert—either implicitly or explicitly—that distribution analysis is flawed and fails to account for the benefits of the additional economic growth that the plans would purportedly generate. This view is mistaken. A traditional distribution analysis provides an approximation of the change in economic well-being resulting from a change in tax law. Distributional analysis is thus useful precisely to determine whether tax reform delivers gains for people across the income distribution or only for those at the top.

In the special case of revenue-neutral tax reform—an ostensible target for current reform efforts—distribution tables capture the primary gains from increases in economic efficiency in their estimates of changes in after-tax income. In the case of revenue-losing reform, distribution tables overstate the gains from reform because apparent increases in after-tax incomes will ultimately need to be clawed back through offsetting tax increases or spending cuts. Only in the case of revenue-raising reform will distribution tables understate the gains. Thus, in the most likely cases for tax legislation this fall, distribution tables will either reflect or overstate the gains from any increases in economic efficiency, to the extent they exist at all.

Simply stated, invocations of economic growth cannot be used to wave away regressive distribution results. Reforms such as the 2016 House Republican blueprint would boost incomes for high-income families at the expense of working- and middle-class families.

Focusing on changes in economic output rather than on the distribution of economic gains and losses not only ignores the potential for tax reform to have different impacts for people up and down the income ladder, but also overstates the economic gains from reform by counting increased output as a benefit without accounting for the costs of generating that output. Indeed, the greater risk in the coming months is not that distribution tables will understate the gains from tax reform, but rather that distribution tables will overstate the gains of reform and understate its regressivity if policymakers turn to tax cuts rather than tax reform and include a slate of temporary policies such as a one-time tax on overseas profits.

As Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration continue to develop a proposal for tax reform, it is worth revisiting why traditional distribution tables are precisely the analytical tool they will need to determine if their tax reform plan does, in fact, deliver equitable growth. This brief first explains why static distribution tables are informative about the improvements in economic well-being resulting from revenue-neutral tax reform. It then identifies three reasons that distribution tables may overstate the gains from reforms. Specifically:

Distribution tables typically do not impose budget balance on the policy changes they assess, which means that in the case of deficit-financed tax cuts, a distribution table will show gains attributable to increased borrowing even though that borrowing must ultimately be financed with spending cuts or tax increases that would make families worse off.

Timing gimmicks can affect distribution tables just as they can affect revenue estimates. A one-time tax on the repatriation of overseas corporate profits, for example, could reduce the apparent regressivity of a tax cut if distribution tables are estimated only (or primarily) for years in which the temporary policies are in effect.

If tax reform increases the federal budget deficit, then traditional approaches to measuring the incidence of certain reforms may be invalid.

Despite these limitations, distributional analysis will be critical in understanding the potential gains of any tax reform plan put forward by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration in the coming months. An understanding of what distribution analysis does and does not measure will be essential for policymakers and the public.

Distribution tables reflect the economic gains from revenue-neutral tax reform

To estimate the approximate change in economic well-being from a change in tax law, a static distribution table computes the change in tax burden assuming no change in behavior. The distribution tables produced by the Tax Policy Center and the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Tax Analysis are of this type. Assuming unchanged behavior provides a better approximation to the change in economic well-being resulting from a proposal than allowing behavior to change because the behavioral responses have little direct value to the people changing their behavior.

This perhaps counterintuitive conclusion arises from the analytical assumption that people are always doing the best that they can in the economic circumstances they face. From this assumption, it follows that people equate the gains from small changes in behavior to the costs of those changes in making choices about work, consumption, and savings. If they did not do so, then there would be a small change in behavior that made them better off.

As a concrete example, consider workers earning $20 an hour, working 40 hours per week, and facing a 25 percent tax rate. Under current law, the workers’ after-tax wage is $15 per hour. The maintained assumption is that the workers could choose to increase or decrease their hours slightly at this wage rate if they wished to do so. As they choose not to, then the value to the workers of that additional $15 is roughly equal to the costs of working more such as increased commuting costs, childcare, or less time for household chores. If the cost of working that additional hour exceeded $15, then reducing hours would make them better off. If the cost were less than $15, then increasing hours would make them better off.

If the tax rate for these workers is reduced to 20 percent and the workers decide to pick up an additional two hours per week, then the net value of those hours to them is not the full $32 in additional take-home pay from working more, but rather only about $1. The reason: At the new, higher number of hours worked, the cost of working longer is roughly $16, again equal to the take-home pay. The total cost of work for those two hours would be roughly $31, or about $15 for the first hour and $16 for the second, leaving our hypothetical workers with only an extra dollar to show for the effort.

Notably, the change in well-being resulting from the behavioral response of these workers to a 5 percentage point reduction in the tax rate is far smaller than both the direct impact of the tax cut ($40 in reduced income taxes) and the impact of the change in behavior on government revenues ($8 in new revenue resulting from the increased working hours: 20 percent of the $40 in additional gross pay).

The economic logic of this simplified example generalizes to other choices about work, consumption, and savings. For a small change in tax rates, changes in behavior provide essentially no direct benefits. For a larger tax change, the value of the change in behavior would tend to be small relative to the other effects of the proposal. Note, however, that the conclusion that a family is approximately indifferent to changes in behavior applies only to changes in behavior under its control and only for those decisions where the family is unconstrained in its choices. In more complex models, the relevant assumptions could fail in other ways such as through informational imperfections.

The above analysis treats the conclusion that changes in behavior provide little direct benefit as a justification for static distribution tables, but an alternative and likely preferable mode of analysis would be to determine the types of behavior that should be held fixed in a distribution table as precisely those for which small changes leave families indifferent. Changes in behavior that do not satisfy this property should be included, though the details of doing so can be complex. In fact, implicitly, static distribution tables typically allow at least one form of behavioral response: a switch from claiming the standard deduction to itemizing (or the reverse). One justification for including such changes is that they are essentially costless and thus there is no offsetting cost to the gains delivered by making such a change.

The assumption of no (or extremely limited) changes in behavior used in a static distribution table differs from the behavioral assumptions used in both a conventional revenue estimate and a dynamic revenue estimate. A conventional revenue estimate allows for microeconomic behavioral responses—responses that do not change macroeconomic aggregates such as labor hours or the capital stock. For instance, a decrease in the use of an itemized deduction in response to a limitation on that deduction would be a microeconomic behavioral response. A dynamic revenue estimate allows for microeconomic behavioral responses and changes in macroeconomic aggregates. Because the behavioral assumptions underlying a static distribution table and a revenue estimate are not the same, the aggregate tax change shown in a distribution table will not necessarily match the revenue estimate under either conventional scoring or dynamic scoring.

This gap between the revenue estimate for a proposal and the implied aggregate change in tax liability per the distribution table captures the primary economic gains from a proposal. If tax reform delivers positive revenue feedback—whether through microeconomic behavioral responses included in a conventional score or macroeconomic behavioral responses included in a dynamic score—then the revenue cost of the proposal will be smaller than the tax cut implicit in the distribution tables. An efficiency-enhancing tax reform that is revenue neutral including dynamic feedback would thus show a tax cut in the distribution table at no revenue cost to the government. That free-to-the-government tax cut reflects the primary economic benefits of the reform.

Consider a second example. Suppose a person making $50,000 and facing a tax rate of 25 percent can deduct from income certain expenses equal to $10,000. The government then replaces the deduction with a 20 percent tax credit and provides a $900 tax credit instead. The individual responds by reducing spending on the deductible expenses to $8,000. The government collects the same amount of revenue under this reform as it would under current law. In other words, the revenue estimate is zero.

Moreover, because the amount of the deductible expense was chosen freely prior to the reform, the person was roughly indifferent between an additional dollar of the deductible expense and nondeductible expenses. This will remain approximately the case after the reform, and thus the person realizes only a very modest gain from the behavioral change. Importantly, however, the new tax credit is worth $900 and the limitation on the deduction costs only $500 (before the reduction in such spending), which means the distribution table would show a net tax cut of $400 that was provided at no net cost to the government.

In other words, if policymakers can deliver tax reform with real economic benefits that is revenue neutral on a dynamic basis, then an appropriately constructed distribution table for that tax reform would show a net tax cut. And if the tax reform delivers equitable growth in living standards, then the table will show robust increases in well-being for working- and middle-class families, as well as high-income families.

The validity of the static distribution as a measure of the change in economic well-being also highlights the role of government policy in determining the way the economic gains from tax reform are translated into increases in well-being for families up and down the wealth and income ladders. As the behavioral changes resulting from tax reform are of relatively little direct value to families and the broader efficiency gains generally arise from the impact of reform on the government budget, it is government policy that determines how those gains are allocated. Notably, since the behavioral changes are of relatively little direct value to families, if the static tax cuts are concentrated among high-income families, then growth will not change that fact.

Of course, static distribution tables remain an approximation to the change in economic well-being, and there is plenty to debate about their construction. The quality of the approximation declines as the rate change gets larger, though for a revenue-neutral reform, the overall rate change should be small. A higher-quality approximation would show slightly higher benefits of efficiency-enhancing reform. Many of the assumptions underlying a distribution table and the associated revenue estimates are uncertain such as the responsiveness of labor supply to tax changes and the allocation of the incidence of the corporate income tax to labor and capital. Changes in wage rates and investment returns resulting from behavioral responses can affect the results. Distribution tables do not capture the benefits or costs of simplification proposals, though these are typically modest. Interactions between federal and state revenue streams often receive insufficient attention in federal policymaking.

There is much to debate about the details of distribution tables, but their importance in assessing changes in economic well-being is clear. Static distribution tables provide a reasonable approximation to the change in economic well-being across the income distribution, and economic growth does not. If revenue-neutral tax reform delivers equitable growth, then a static distribution table will show it.

Distribution tables are more likely to overstate the gains of reform

The greater analytic risk in the coming months is not that distribution tables will understate the gains from reform, but rather that they will overstate the gains from reform and understate its regressivity.

First, as noted above, distribution tables typically do not impose budget balance on the policy changes they assess. In the case of deficit-financed tax cuts, a distribution table will thus show gains attributable to increased borrowing even though that borrowing must ultimately be financed with spending cuts or tax increases. Incorporating those offsetting fiscal policies into the analysis would reduce the apparent gains in the distribution table. In fact, the primary scenario in which static distribution tables understate the gains from tax reform is one in which Congress enacts tax reform that is revenue neutral on a conventional basis and uses the economic gains to reduce the deficit and debt. In this case, the distribution table would show a near-zero change in well-being even though gains have been realized.

Second, timing gimmicks can affect distribution tables just as they can affect revenue estimates. A time-limited policy such as a one-time tax on the repatriation of overseas corporate profits could reduce the apparent regressivity of a tax cut if distribution tables are estimated only or primarily for years in which the temporary policies are in effect. More broadly, practical considerations make the construction of distribution tables on a present-value basis difficult, but there would be substantial analytic value to such an exercise. In the absence of a present-value analysis, caution is required in interpreting distribution tables for policies that differ substantially across years or for which a substantial adjustment period is likely.

Third, if tax reform increases the federal budget deficit, then traditional approaches to measuring tax incidence may be invalid. Distribution tables, for example, typically assign a portion of the incidence of a corporate tax cut to labor and a portion to capital. Most analysts assume a partial pass-through to labor based on anticipated changes in the capital stock. But the capital stock will change only over time, and whether it will grow—and whether that growth will be sustained—depends on whether increased federal budget deficits drive up interest rates and discourage private-sector activity. Thus, deficit financing not only can reverse short-run gains from a proposal and ultimately harm growth, but can also result in misleading distribution estimates that assume labor benefits from capital deepening even as the proposal reduces the capital stock.","Issue brief: If U.S. tax reform delivers equitable growth, a distribution table will show it",http://equitablegrowth.org/research-analysis/if-u-s-tax-reform-delivers-equitable-growth-a-distribution-table-will-show-it/

MONDAY PUZZLES — If you make odd connections between things as I do, the crossword might bring out different things for you. Jennifer Nutt, who wrote today’s lovely Monday crossword, probably did not have this in mind when she created it, but her puzzle brought this up for me, so I’m going to tell you a story.

The first time I visited Cape Town, I took the ferry to Robben Island to see the prison — now a museum — where former South African president Nelson Mandela and many others who resisted the National Party during the apartheid era were held. It’s the kind of thing that is expected of first-time visitors (“Oh, you must go!”) and I’m a student of history, so I climbed aboard the boat and off I went.

Cape Town is a very windy city because of its location between the mountains and the sea, and on that day, the wind was working against the ferry as it made its way across the water. With no warning, a pod of humpback whales appeared in the water at the front of the boat, and skimmed over the water toward the island, almost as if to lead us in. When we slowed down, they would loop back and continue to guide us. It was a very touching sight, almost as if they were saying, “Follow us. There are secrets to be told here.” Once we were close to the shore, they dispersed and made their way back out to sea.

The tour, which is more a heartbreaking example of man’s inhumanity to man than a tourist trap curiosity, lasted about an hour and included talks by both former prisoners and the Afrikaaner guards who had held them captive. They had returned to educate mostly foreign visitors about a relatively recent period in history (1948 — 1994) where a nationalist government had succeeded in discriminating despicably against black Africans and criminalizing interaction between the races. There were also a surprising number of white South Africans in our group.

Q. How do people die from diabetes?

A. People who have diabetes cannot regulate their blood sugar levels and if the disease isn’t tightly controlled, blood sugar can spike to abnormally high levels, a condition called hyperglycemia, or dip below normal, a condition called hypoglycemia. Both conditions are potentially life-threatening and can lead to coma and death if not promptly treated.

But complications resulting from the disease are a more common cause of death. Heart disease strikes people with diabetes at significantly higher rates than people without diabetes, “and we don’t fully know why,” said Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. People with diabetes develop heart disease at younger ages and are nearly twice as likely to die of heart attack or stroke as people who do not have diabetes.

People with Type 2 diabetes, which is the more common form of the disease, are more likely to have elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure and obesity, Dr. Gabbay said, all risk factors for cardiovascular disease. “The good news,” he said, “is that a lot of treatments, like those for lowering cholesterol, are even more effective at lowering risk in people with diabetes than in people without.” Some new classes of diabetes medications used for Type 2 diabetes have also been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk, he said.

People with Type 1 diabetes are also at increased risk for heart disease, though the reasons are less clear.

Both types of diabetes can also lead to other long-term complications, like kidney disease, that may result in premature death. Problems like vision loss, nerve damage and infections that may lead to amputations can increase the likelihood of injuries and accidents. Good disease management starting early in the disease process helps people avoid some of these complications, Dr. Gabbay said.

Researchers at the U.C. Davis Institute of Transportation Studies surveyed 2,000 people about their travel behavior in seven major metro areas, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and including people who live in their suburbs and those who don’t use these services.

The results suggest that ride-hailing draws people away from public transit. And the authors, Regina Clewlow and Gouri Shankar Mishra, estimate that 49 percent to 61 percent of ride-hailing trips either wouldn’t have been made at all if these apps didn’t exist, or would have been made by foot, biking or transit. All of those trips, in other words, added cars to the road that otherwise wouldn’t have been there.

That picture implies that Uber and the like could make traffic worse. And let’s further assume that many of those trips additionally require drivers to cruise around waiting for rides, and to “deadhead” occasionally after the rides are over (to return to, say, the airport with an empty back seat).

Among people who use these apps, 3 percent said they rode heavy rail like subway systems more since starting to ride-hail. That’s consistent with the idea that apps could help you travel the “last mile” home from the train if you don’t live near a stop, or that they could help you cobble together transportation options once you ditch your own car. But 6 percent said they rode the bus less, and 3 percent said the same of light rail.

Among the most common reasons people gave for turning away from transit: Service was too slow or unreliable. It potentially does not bode well for public transit, then, that just as these apps are growing more dominant, transit systems in cities like New York, Washington and San Francisco are facing deep problems. In New York, where other data has also suggested that ride-hailing lures riders away from public transit, officials have speculated about Uber’s role in recent declining subway ridership.

Austin, Tex., offers another intriguing case study. In May 2016, Uber and Lyft temporarily pulled out of the city over a new law that required the companies to submit drivers to fingerprint background checks. Their departure created a natural experiment, and afterward researchers at the University of Michigan, Texas A&M and Columbia University surveyed Austin residents about how the change affected their travel behavior.

Asked about the last trip riders took with Uber and Lyft, 3 percent said they took similar trips afterward by public transit instead (Austin has much lower transit usage in general than New York). That also implies some substitution. Further complicating this picture, 9 percent said they bought a personal car as a result of the change.

The bulk of the evidence so far shows that these services don’t inherently make transportation more efficient at the level of an entire city, even if they have the potential to. They may make your travel more efficient, because you don’t have to hunt for a parking spot or wait for the bus. But when you aggregate the behavior of many people, transportation becomes less efficient when transit riders switch to cars, when new car services entice people onto trips they wouldn’t otherwise have taken, or when people who give up their cars wind up traveling even more in someone else’s.

It’s equally not preordained that these apps will make traffic worse, or that they must come at the expense of public transit. If more people left their solo cars for car-pooled ride-hailing, rather than leaving public buses for solo Uber rides, that would reduce the number of cars on the road and the miles they travel. If transit agencies partnered with these companies, as some have begun to try doing, ride-hailing could fill niches that trains and buses don’t handle well, like late-night journeys, transit for riders with disabilities, and suburban service.

Unlike some of his colleagues in the tech world, Mr. Musk is driven more by cooking than by the love of a good algorithm. Growing up in Pretoria, South Africa, he started in the kitchen at age 12, making meals as a way to bring his family together. His mother, the model Maye Musk, worked as a dietitian to support the family after she divorced his father, Errol Musk, an engineer and pilot.

At her house, Mr. Musk said, “it was all brown bread and plain yogurt.” At his dad’s, he and his brother and sister, Tosca (now a film producer and director), ate whatever the maid cooked, usually in front of the TV. “It wasn’t very good,” he recalled.

“I noticed that when I cooked, my dad especially would make us all sit down and eat together,” he said. “I loved it.”

He graduated from college in Canada and made his first fortune in 1999, when he and his brother sold Zip2 — a digital mapping service that helped newspapers including The New York Times produce online city guides — to Compaq Computer for $307 million. He became an investor in his brother’s other ventures, including PayPal and Tesla. (He is on the board of both Elon Musk’s electric car company and his rocket company, SpaceX, as well as Chipotle Mexican Grill.)

Set financially, Mr. Musk moved from Silicon Valley to New York and enrolled in the French Culinary Institute (now the International Culinary Center). He lived near the World Trade Center, and after the 9/11 attacks, spent six weeks volunteering as a cook for firefighters and other people working the pile. He finally understood, he said, the link between food and community.

Soon after, he and Jen Lewin, his first wife, left for Colorado, where he met Mr. Matheson and opened The Kitchen in 2004. With its deep farm-to-table ethos and casually elegant style, the restaurant was an immediate hit.

Both projects were running just fine without him, so Mr. Musk became chief executive of another tech company. Then, on a 2010 trip with his family in Jackson Hole, Wyo., he was sliding down a snowy hill on an inner tube when it flipped. He broke his neck and was temporarily paralyzed.

During the two months he had to lie flat on his back, it became clear that he wanted to devote himself to food. He and his wife divorced; he quit the tech company and dedicated himself to changing the way Americans eat.

Mr. Musk became interested in school gardens. He remains friendly with his ex-wife (the couple have two boys, and he has a daughter with another woman), and Ms. Lewin designed modular curved plastic planters that could be arranged in any schoolyard. Paired with instructions on how they can be used to teach subjects like science, the first gardens were installed in Denver schools in 2011.

Mr. Musk has begun a chain of hyper-local restaurants called Next Door, which he and Mr. Matheson envision as the Applebee’s for a new generation.

All the food is cooked from scratch. Menus feature wild salmon, burgers of local pasture-raised beef and big Greek salads with vegetables from nearby farms. Entree prices average $14, and the restaurants are designed so customers sit down together to eat and get their meals almost as soon as they order.

The first opened six years ago next to The Kitchen in Boulder. In September, another opened in a huge urban renewal project in Memphis called Crosstown Concourse, an abandoned Sears distribution center that has been turned into apartments and shops, with a school, a health clinic and an arts center. The partners plan to add 50 more Next Door restaurants by the end of 2020.

Mr. Musk also opened an outpost of his more upscale Kitchen restaurant inside a 4,500-acre urban park called Shelby Farms in the center of Memphis. But he insisted that he be allowed to buy 300 acres nearby that for decades had been used to grow cotton, so he could turn it into an organic farm, a project now in the works.

He is also testing the Kitchenette, a little takeout spot in Shelby Farms that sells locally grown, well-prepared meals for about $5 — his answer to a fast-food restaurant.

Mr. Musk’s nonprofit arm, The Kitchen Community, has put learning gardens into 100 Memphis schools, providing both staff and materials. Each one costs about $40,000, money that comes from the Musk Foundation and local donors. He has placed his gardens in schools in Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and 150 in Chicago, where Mayor Rahm Emanuel gave the project $2 million in city funds. By 2020, Mr. Musk hopes to have them in more than 1,000 schools.

He is not a fan of traditional school garden programs. “They don’t scale at all,” he said.

There are other ways to ruffle the feathers of Alice Waters, the Bay Area chef who helped pioneer the American slow-food movement and the concept of the edible schoolyard, but criticizing her approach to local food and school gardens is near the top of the list.

He’s very earnest about what he’s doing, but he doesn’t know enough about farming and about the soil. He wants to do the right thing, but he just hasn’t done his homework. Not everything has to be scalable.”

Mr. Musk says he is “absolutely in conflict” with Ms. Waters. “I love her, but I don’t agree with her views.”

Critics have taken on his Square Roots project, too. The idea is to train young farmers by teaching them to grow greens with nothing but enhanced water and LEDs in shipping containers, and then sell the lettuce and kale to local restaurants and office workers.

Last year the project installed 10 containers in the parking lot of the old Pfizer factory in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, each able to grow as much produce as two acres of dirt. In August, Square Roots secured $5.4 million in private seed funding, and has grants from the United States Department of Agriculture. Mr. Musk wants one in every major city.

Whether food actually needs soil is one of the flash points between organic traditionalists and people like Mr. Musk. “Ideologically, they prefer soil,” he said. “We don’t care. Let them fight their fight.”

Mr. Musk’s ascent has underscored a generational rift that pits old-liners who shun aspects of emerging food science against a new wave of food disrupters who haven’t embraced the roles that history, flavor and pleasure play, said Garrett Broad, an assistant professor at Fordham University who recently wrote about one aspect of the divide for the publication Civil Eats.

“Somebody like Kimbal Musk could be an important bridge to bring some of these ideas together,” Dr. Broad said.

A turning point for Evans was his decision — like many young men of means — to go to Paris in 1926 to study for a year at the Sorbonne. His stay filled his head with ideas gleaned from Flaubert and Baudelaire, but it was another Frenchman — Eugène Atget — whose work affected him the most, leading to the dry, observational style that became his visual signature.

Clément Chéroux, a French curator, organized a massive Walker Evans retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which recently traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, (where he is now the head of the photography department). He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

“Atget has tried to define, through his photographs — what is the Parisian vernacular? What is the visual spirit of Paris? And Evans has done exactly the same with America,” Mr. Chéroux said. “What is so interesting for me, in this exchange between American and French culture, is that he has tried to define the American vernacular culture, but with the method and style of French culture.”

Evans embodied a paradox: a member of the American elite drawn to unfussy places, urban workers and desperate farmers, becoming best known for his seminal project with James Agee, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” about America’s poor and downtrodden during the Great Depression.

For Mr. Chéroux, this paradox was an interesting way to understand Evans. The curator has done scholarly research into the vernacular, which he defines as “useful, domestic and popular” in an essay in the exhibition catalog. “Maybe one of the reasons why I’m fascinated with Evans is because there is so much paradox in his work,” he said. “There is this dialectical tension between Europe and the U.S., and there is also this very strong dialectical tension between an aristocratic or elite point of view, and a subject which is definitely popular culture, and workers.”

The specific nature of the Atget-Evans vision, with its emphasis on large format, razor sharp, perfectly observed, almost preternaturally quiet moments, allows the photographs to impress viewers nearly a century later. Evans had a simple explanation: Atget’s photographs had a transcendent quality, which he tried to emulate.

In an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well. In his work you do feel what some people call poetry. I do call it that also, but a better word for it, to me, is, well – when Atget does even a tree root, he transcends that thing. And by God somebody else does not.”

By looking at things previously unobserved, or subjects once thought beneath the purview of art, Evans created a vision of America that is still inextricable from our national identity. And while his initial exposure to Atget’s work might have been coincidental — his friend Berenice Abbott showed him a trove of the Frenchman’s work — his subsequent choice of subject matter was not.

In another essay in the exhibition catalog, Evans said his early work was influenced by his feelings about the United States. “I was really anti-American at the time,” he said. “America was a big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment. I could just hear my father saying, ‘Why do you want to look at those scenes, they’re depressing. Why don’t you look at the nice things in life?’ Nothing original about that though.”

This might be the key to understanding his role in the history of photography, as he heavily influenced subsequent generations, including the famed “New Topographics” movement of the 1970s. (When asked via email whether Evans’s work had inspired him and his colleagues, Stephen Shore simply replied, “Yes.”)

According to Mr. Chéroux, Evans was able to adopt a neutral stance and let the magic, or inherent tension, of a scene speak for itself. He notably contrasted this style against the showy, artsy technique employed by contemporaries like Alfred Stieglitz and the Modernists.

“He wants to disappear in front of his subject, to let this emotion transfer from the subject to the viewer,” he said of Evans. “I think this is really what he understood. It’s the reason why he is so close to Atget. All the photographers who think that the subject is more important than themselves are in this position.”

The retrospective, while focusing on the past, and including selections from Evans’s personal collection of vernacular art, also allows viewers to appreciate how photography, a slice out of time, relates to the present. In particular, his 1937 photographs showing people displaced by floods in the South are just as relevant today.

“That’s the power of art,” Mr. Chéroux said, “to address some historical questions, but to address them in the present time. To create a kind of effect that is both present and past, and I think this is something photography is really great at.”

I used it to explore a neighborhood where I used to be a local (Astoria, Queens) to see if it could deliver. The fact that it included a wide assortment of suggestions in a borough not named Manhattan was impressive enough, compared to the other apps I tested, but the recommendations themselves were also spot on.

For example, Astoria’s popular Bohemian Hall and Beer Garden was rightfully featured, but so was SingleCut Brewery, a lesser-known, but worthwhile, beer spot.

Cool Cousin

This app scored points for originality as well as its practicality, and is perfect for travelers who don’t have any cool cousins of their own.

Cool Cousin gives you access to contributors in 40 large cities around the world. Each “cousin” has a profile, with name, age, photo, occupation and a lot more information. The idea is to add those to your network who seem to have similar tastes to your own. After each add, the cousin’s recommendations are added to your map and broken down into eight different categories, such as food, coffee, night life and outdoors.

The app seems geared toward younger travelers — it feels like a cross between Facebook, Tinder and Foursquare — and most of the cousins themselves have an appropriately hipster look. For New York, this leads to a higher concentration of recommendations below 14th Street in Manhattan and several in Brooklyn (very few in Queens), and heavy in the food and night life areas.

But the app itself is easy to figure out, and the map includes the option to download and use offline (for free). No matter where you are, just hit the location arrow to see what’s nearby.

The recommendations themselves are solid and are written casually — think Yelp, minus the negativity. I added 26 of 55 available cousins in New York and was impressed with what was revealed, including free public gardens and lesser-known art galleries, as well as a wide variety of intriguing bars and restaurants.

Your new cousins will even message you through the app to say hello, and you have the option of writing them back to ask for more tips. You will also get a push notification every time you receive a new message, which you can turn off by adjusting your settings. After asking two of my paired cousins, I received additional restaurant recommendations.

Like a Local

Well-designed and easy to navigate, Like a Local has fewer contributors than the other apps (28, providing 197 tips for New York at the time of writing) but it is in more cities than the others (over 300) and best functions as a complementary tool.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The recommendations are detailed yet concise, giving an excellent general overview and a “special tip” for each location. For example, at the Brazilian restaurant Beco in Brooklyn, Kelly advises: “Come early because the restaurant’s seating space is limited. CA$H ONLY.”

You don’t have to sign up to use the app, so you can dig right in and explore — though if you want to use the app offline, you have to pay $1.99 per city.

There’s also an option to “ask locals,” which works like a message board. I asked for Upper East Side restaurant recommendations (it is a neighborhood not represented well on any of the apps) and after a week had yet to get a response.

The recommendations included mainstream spots like St. Patrick’s Cathedral and the Central Park more often than the other apps did.

Since Berkeley passed its tax, seven municipalities have followed suit, and many others, even some states, are interested in doing the same. This has Big Soda scared because these taxes — with the awareness they create about the health effects of sugar and the consumption they reduce — threaten the industry’s bottom line.

How scared? Leaked internal Coca-Cola emails last year revealed a “coordinated war” against policies like these, says a public health advocate, Kyle Pfister, who has studied these documents. This war, waged by the American Beverage Association and sugary drink manufacturers like Coca-Cola, includes a slew of duplicitous tactics, like funding research to give a hue of legitimacy to their anti-tax claims, pursuing social media influencers, lobbying at every level of government and targeting key journalists for persuasion. These time-tested tactics have been used by the tobacco industry in its fight against cigarette taxes.

The industry also starts and funds faux grass-roots organizations. In another email, a trade group representative boasted about the impact of Philadelphians Against the Grocery Tax, an industry-funded group, which deployed an aggressive media strategy that achieved a “significant shift in public attitudes away from initial majority support for the discriminatory tax” in Philadelphia. In the end, the industry lost there.

In Cook County, which includes Chicago, the industry’s “Can the Tax” campaign spent millions on local TV ads and pressured commissioners, in particular critiquing the use of the soda tax revenue to help cover budget deficits. (In other cities, the money has been directed to public health concerns or, in the case of Philadelphia, to fund universal pre-K.) When Jesus Garcia, a Cook County commissioner, signaled he would vote to repeal the tax, he acknowledged that the beverage industry used its financial power to shape public opinion before supporters of the tax were able to craft their own message for a public debate.

There is an important lesson here: When efforts for sugary-drinks taxes are driven and supported by community coalitions that build public awareness early on, they’re better able to withstand industry attacks. Strong coalitions are vital both to adopt new taxes and to ensure they remain to curb consumption and generate funds for public health programs.

In Berkeley, the industry waged a $2 million anti-tax campaign. We credit the success of the tax effort there to a broad-based community coalition — a united front of the local N.A.A.C.P., Latinos Unidos, teachers unions and many more groups. This compact was strong enough to withstand the industry’s onslaught. We won decisively, with 76 percent of the vote. Community engagement is key.

New research published last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association underscores what Ms. Bourquin experienced, and what many fertility experts have already observed: AMH doesn’t dictate a woman’s reproductive potential. And although AMH testing is one of the most common ways that doctors assess a woman’s fertility — it’s especially important for women struggling with infertility — an AMH value isn’t always telling.

Dr. Zev Rosenwaks, director of the Center for Reproductive Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, called the study “elegant.”

“All it takes is one egg each cycle,” he said. “AMH is not a marker of whether you can or cannot become pregnant.”

Age is more than just a number

For women who haven’t yet tried to get pregnant and who are wondering whether they are fertile, an AMH value “isn’t going to be helpful in that context,” said Dr. Esther Eisenberg, the program director of the Reproductive Medicine and Infertility Program at the National Institutes of Health, which helped fund the study. In addition, “AMH wouldn’t necessarily be a good marker to tell you when you ought to freeze your eggs.”

Doctors don’t yet have a way to definitively predict egg quality or a woman’s long-term ability to conceive, but age is one of the most important factors.

“I really do feel like that’s all we have right now,” said Dr. Anne Z. Steiner, the lead researcher of the study and a professor of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.

Her study followed 750 women between the ages of 30 and 44 who had been trying to conceive for three months or less. During the 12-month observation period, those with low AMH values of less than 0.7 were not less likely to conceive than those who had normal AMH values.

The study has various limitations, however, that are worth noting. The researchers only included women who did not have a history of infertility. Women who sought fertility treatments (about 6 percent) were withdrawn. And only 12 percent of the women were in the 38-to-44 age range. In addition, the number of live births was unavailable. Dr. Steiner says she’ll next look at whether low AMH is associated with a higher risk of miscarriage among the women who conceived.

Ms. Bourquin’s daughter is now 2 years old, and she is hoping for a second child. But at 41, things aren’t as easy this time around.

For months she and her husband tried unsuccessfully to conceive naturally. After three failed attempts at intrauterine insemination, or IUI, and a failed egg retrieval, they are trying IUI yet again.

One of Dr. Steiner’s earlier studies, published in June of last year, shows that women experience a significant reduction in fertility in their late 30s.

“There’s no one age where a woman turns into a pumpkin,” Dr. Steiner said, but there are slight declines in fertility after the age of 35, followed by steeper drop-offs.

“The difference between 30 and 33 is negligible,” she said. “But the difference between 37 and 40 is going to be pretty drastic.”

Searching for a ‘golden egg’

Although AMH testing isn’t designed to be an overall gauge of a woman’s fertility, it can still provide valuable information, especially for “women who are infertile and seeking treatment,” Dr. Rosenwaks said.

It can assist in diagnosing polycystic ovarian syndrome, and identify when a woman is getting close to menopause.

Previous research also shows that AMH is pretty good at predicting a woman’s response to ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization, Dr. Steiner said, and it can predict the probability of conceiving via I.V.F.

That was the case for Lauren Donato, 37, who has spent about $50,000 trying to conceive, mainly via I.V.F., after learning last year that her AMH was very low. She recently moved back in with her parents to avoid going into debt.

She thought about freezing her eggs a decade ago. At the time, she said, she was told not to worry about her fertility.

“My O.B. kept saying, ‘You’re so young,’” Ms. Donato said. “I kept saying, there has to be some sort of test.”

As the years passed, Ms. Donato, a mental health counselor from Brooklyn, who is single, continued to think about having children.

Last year, when she was 36, one of her doctors finally tested her AMH.

Anything under 1 is typically considered a low AMH value for a woman her age, she was told. Hers was 0.1.

She visited a reproductive endocrinologist who suggested that she try I.V.F. now.

“The doctor pretty much said, ‘You’re going to have a baby now or you’re not going to have any kids,’” Ms. Donato recalled.

She selected a sperm donor and has been trying to find her “golden egg” — that one egg that will result in a pregnancy — ever since. Egg quality declines as women age, so it’s a more difficult proposition than it might have been 10 years ago. “Quantity means nothing, it’s quality,” she said. “And there’s no test for quality.”",Raising Concerns About a Widely Used Test to Measure Fertility,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/health/fertility-test-ovarian-reserve.html

In March, the deputy assistant secretary of state said that the United States is “deeply troubled” by the United Nations Human Rights Council’s “consistent unfair and unbalanced focus on one democratic country, Israel.” Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, has vowed “to stand up to the U.N.’s anti-Israel bias.” Even Ban Ki-moon, the organization’s previous secretary general, acknowledged the bias against Israel in his final speech before the Security Council: “Decades of political maneuverings have created a disproportionate volume of resolutions, reports and conferences criticizing Israel,” he said.

None of this is new. The United Nations’ hypocrisy and bias has been a constant irritation since Israel was founded. It was David Ben Gurion, the country’s founding prime minister, who coined a derisive phrase, “Um Shmum,” that remains popular in Israel today. (“Um” is the Hebrew pronunciation of the United Nation’s initials; the “sh” prefix is a way of signaling dismissal.) Attitudes haven’t changed much since then: In 2009, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu argued that “the jury is still out on the United Nations” and that “recent signs are not encouraging.”

And yet despite all this, Israel still chooses to be a part of the United Nations. Even amid Unesco’s repeated, ridiculous resolutions, the Israeli government resisted the temptation to withdraw from the organization. Israeli policy toward Unesco was — like its policy toward the rest of the United Nations — pretty simple: Remain a member and fight as hard as you can. Be a player. Do not give Israel’s foes what they want, which is Israel cast aside and ostracized by the international community.

Sometimes (though admittedly not often), Israeli even has the chance to achieve something at the United Nations. For example, just before the Trump administration announced its plan to withdraw, Unesco delayed a vote on an anti-Israel resolution. It might not sound like much, but Israel’s envoy to Unesco described it as an “achievement” that was “the result of three years of exhausting, frustrating and difficult diplomatic work.”

Enter President Trump. An Israeli strategy 70 years in the making is suddenly severely undermined. (According to news reports, the American decision was made without consulting the Israeli government.) Mr. Netanyahu then announced that when the United States quits Unesco, Israel will follow suit. It has no alternative. Israel can’t possibly let the United States leave an organization over anti-Israel bias and still remain a member itself. At the same time, Israel also can’t appear ungrateful toward the United States and hint that leaving Unesco might not be the best move for Israel.

But the truth is, Israel would prefer to continue its longtime strategy at the United Nations: staying a member and fighting for Israel’s interests. Israel would rather work on getting Unesco to improve — become a little less hostile, and even more so, less obsessed with Israel. But now that option seems to be in danger.

It’s possible that the election of the former French culture minister, a Jewish woman who has relatives in Israel, to lead Unesco might be a signal that the agency will improve. Or, perhaps, a recognition on the part of other Unesco members that the Trump administration won’t tolerate their anti-Israel shenanigans will sober up the organization.

But this can work only if Mr. Trump’s motivation for quitting Unesco is truly to curb its anti-Israel bias. If, on the other hand, his main motivation is to free the United States from paying for something he does not value, then he hasn’t helped Israel. He has hurt it by forcing it out against its will.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/opinion/unesco-united-states-withdrawal-israel.html

In recent days, the singer Bjork, the “Riverdale” actress Lili Reinhart and the “Inside Edition” correspondent Lisa Guerrero lodged new accusations against other men who work in entertainment.

The singer and actress Courtney Love accused the powerful Creative Artists Agency of punishing her after she raised questions about Mr. Weinstein’s behavior in 2005, and a recently unearthed video clip of Ms. Love making the charge has gone viral.

The model Cameron Russell started a thread on her Instagram account on misconduct by men in fashion. It has led to more than 50 models anonymously sharing their stories of harassment.

Kicked off by reports on the allegations against Mr. Weinstein, the outpouring came a little more than a year after The Washington Post published leaked excerpts from an “Access Hollywood” tape in which Donald J. Trump, then a candidate for president, boasted of groping women.

At issue now is whether or not Hollywood can continue its old way of doing business, with self-styled “outlaw” executives and auteurs getting away with sexual misconduct as lawyers and publicists protect them.

“I think it’s upsetting and devastating, all of the stories that have come out,” said Nina Jacobson, a film producer who was formerly the president of the Walt Disney Company’s Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group. “But I think the floodgates being opened is something that had to happen and that finally brings a subject to the surface that has sort of gone unchecked for countless years.”

Beginning with an article about the allegations against Mr. Weinstein that The New York Times published on Oct. 5, more than 30 accusers have stepped forward with charges of harassment, assault and even rape against the mogul. The police in New York and London have started criminal investigations. (Mr. Weinstein has denied engaging in nonconsensual sex.)

Fatima Goss Graves, president and chief executive of the National Women’s Law Center, said that, since the story broke, “we’ve gotten twice the volume of calls of people who have said they’ve experienced harassment.”

The reaction has also led some senior women in Hollywood to predict that their longtime calls for change may finally come to something.

“I don’t think this is going back to the status quo,” said Ms. Berman, the producer. “You’ll see that there will be improvement.”

The industry took a step toward that on Monday, when the Producers Guild of America moved to terminate Mr. Weinstein’s membership and issued a statement that seemed to catch up with the wave of disapproval sweeping social media.

“Sexual harassment of any type is completely unacceptable,” it said in part. “This is a systemic and pervasive problem requiring immediate industrywide action.”

On Saturday, the board of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences stripped Mr. Weinstein of his academy membership. The move drew ridicule from the HBO comedy host John Oliver, given that it did no such thing in the cases of Mr. Cosby and Roman Polanski, who, in 1977, pleaded guilty to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl and then fled the country.

“So congratulations, Hollywood,” Mr. Oliver said. “See you at the next Oscars, where — and this is true — Casey Affleck will be presenting Best Actress.”

The reference was cutting: Mr. Affleck, who won the best actor award at this year’s Oscars for “Manchester by the Sea,” had settled sexual harassment allegations made against him by two female producers in civil suits. He has denied the accusations.

Woody Allen served as the imperfect messenger for those cautioning against what he termed a “witch hunt.” His warning was in line with the thinking of some executives, who said they were wary of false accusations getting easy play on social media.

In breaking the news about the allegations, The Times and The New Yorker carefully corroborated women’s stories. Social media has no such checks and balances.

A spreadsheet listing men in the media business accused of sexist behaviors ranging from inappropriate flirting to rape surfaced last week and was circulated by email. The BuzzFeed writer Doree Shafrir weighed in on the list, writing of men who were said to be guilty of behaviors like leering: “Things do get complicated when you start lumping all this behavior together in a big anonymous spreadsheet of unsubstantiated allegations against dozens of named men.”

Ms. Jacobson, the film producer, said, “There’s an importance to a careful vetting and a careful reposting and not just a free-for-all.” She added that she was in favor of more information, not less, which is why, she said, the industry has to tackle the use of nondisclosure agreements.

“It clearly feels like we have to take the burden away from people to come forward,” she said. “They should not fear that, because you have an NDA, that you can’t speak up.”

Each successive case of a powerful man’s misdeeds bursting into the open helps to embolden the next round, the feminist Gloria Steinem said.

“When dealing with deep bias like racism and sexism, it usually takes more than one injustice — or even a few,” Ms. Steinem wrote in an email. “The Weinstein scandal would probably have been taken less seriously if Cosby, Ailes and others hadn’t come first and been within easy memory.”

Melinda McGillivray, who stepped forward last year to accuse Mr. Trump of groping her at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida in 2003, told BuzzFeed last week that Ms. Paltrow and Ms. Jolie had an impact her accusation did not because of their star power. (Mr. Trump has denied harassment accusations.)

Mr. Trump’s election had put some women here on guard against a return to male misbehavior that was more common 40 years ago. And one list circulating among ranking female executives in the industry has tracked a string of promotions of men to senior jobs — at Apple and AMC, Sony and Hulu, Fox and CBS — amid fear that progress for women has stalled since November.

“Most of the available senior management television jobs this year have gone to men,” said Katie O’Connell, a chief executive of Platform One Media, and formerly the chief executive of Gaumont Television. “While those men were all qualified, it does highlight diminished access for these highest-level positions for women in 2017.”

As part of the general reaction to the articles on Mr. Weinstein, the Hollywood & Highland shopping center removed from its 17-year-old “Road to Hollywood” public art exhibit a daybed that some have taken to represent the proverbial “casting couch” — the symbol of ritualized abuse that studio chiefs meted out in trading roles for sexual favors. It was removed because it had “attracted increased public attention and it has been threatened with damage,” a spokeswoman for the mall said.

The artist behind the installation, Erika Rothenberg, said in an interview that her work was not meant to invoke the casting couch. Referring to Mr. Weinstein’s case, she said she was “completely sympathetic to people who have feelings about this, who are angry about this.”

Nonetheless, she said she hoped the daybed would return. “I don’t think this piece is the problem,” Ms. Rothenberg said.",Harvey Weinstein’s Fall Opens the Floodgates in Hollywood,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/business/media/harvey-weinsteins-fall-opens-the-floodgates-in-hollywood.html

But not many people seem to know about an opinion piece by John Taylor and Paul Ryan, released at about the same time, that is even more revealing about the GOP’s monetary madness.

There are actually multiple revelations in that article. For one thing, it attacks not just QE2, which was about to commence, but QE1 — the Fed’s intervention during the chaotic post-Lehman period — which is generally considered to have been quite effective. Their evidence to the contrary? “QE1 failed to strengthen the economy, which has remained in a high-unemployment, low-growth slump.” Also, when I stepped outside this morning, it was cold, so I put on a coat — but it didn’t work, because it was still cold.

But the truly amazing thing is the conspiracy theorizing. The article is titled “Refocus The Fed On Price Stability Instead Of Bailing Out Fiscal Policy”, and the text matches that theme:

This looks an awful lot like an attempt to bail out fiscal policy, and such attempts call the Fed’s independence into question.

So Ryan and Taylor were accusing the Bernanke Fed of deliberately betraying its mandate in order to help out Obama by monetizing deficits — or at least doing everything they could to convey that message to readers. And that’s one heck of a conspiracy theory, given that the Fed never said anything along those lines, insisting all along that it was intervening to support the economy and to defend price stability against the threat of below-target inflation — a defense of its actions completely borne out by events.

Furthermore, think about it — suppose that you believe that the Fed’s actions were staving off what would otherwise have been a fiscal crisis. That’s supposed to be a bad thing? Were Ryan and Taylor casting envious glances at the euro area, where the ECB’s failure to do its job as lender of last resort provoked a series of near-catastrophic speculative attacks until Mario Draghi stepped up to the plate?

Anyway, keep this and other such episodes in mind. Rand Paul by no means has a monopoly on monetary crazy, conspiracy theories very much included.

He had traveled from his small town in Utah to the Catskill Mountains, to a celebration of photography where he studied with such masters of photojournalism as Mary Ellen Mark, Greg Heisler and Jodi Cobb.

A local high school band in Jeffersonville was playing a thunderous welcome as he entered a large, partly built barn. Inside he was greeted by the festival’s mastermind: Eddie Adams, the Pulitzer Prize-winning war photographer.

“Everybody who was anybody was there and I didn’t even know they existed,” said Mr. Rasmussen, now the director of photography for digital and print media at ESPN. “I went to this small agricultural college in Utah and didn’t know anybody, but in less than a week I left there with four or five lifelong friends. Sometimes you spend your whole life seeking your community and for me that was the moment that I found it.”

Mr. Rasmussen will return to Jeffersonville this weekend for the 30th Eddie Adams Workshop, which has since become one of the most important stops for up-and-coming photojournalists.

Mr. Adams died in 2004, but the workshop continues under the aegis of his wife, Alyssa Adams, and the assistance of around 150 volunteers. Some things have changed since the first session — Kodak slide film gave way to digital imagery in the late 1990s and audio and video have been added. Some sponsors have fallen away as the industry has withered, and while tuition is still free, students pay $375 for lodging.

The workshop is structured much as it was 30 years ago, with 10 groups of 10 students managed by a well-known photographer as team leader, a photo editor and a producer. This year, all the teams are led by photographers who were once students in the workshop.

For Jimmy Colton, a well-traveled photo editor who will be attending his 27th consecutive session this week, the workshop is about family. He calls himself Uncle Jimmy, and considers all 2,700 students he has worked with to be his nieces and nephews. The barn is also a place of family ghosts for Mr. Colton, whose brother Jay, and father, Sandy, both volunteered as photo editors before their deaths.

The core values of the workshop continue to be “a level of ethics beyond reproach, having great concern for your subjects and treating everyone as you would like to be treated,” Mr. Colton said.

Mr. Adams purchased the 64-acre farm in Jeffersonville in 1976 intending to convert it into a center for photography. But progress on rebuilding the ramshackle structures was slow as assignment work kept him busy. It was after he met Alyssa in 1983 that the plans for a free, merit-based workshop came together. They married shortly after the first workshop.

“This workshop is not a ‘how to,’ it’s more inspirational and aspirational,” Ms. Adams said. “This is a place where you can let your hair down and experiment a little as a student.”

The workshop does not romanticize photojournalism, and it acknowledges the price many photojournalists have paid while covering conflict. An annual memorial service for photographers who have died during war recognizes friends of Mr. Adams who were killed in Vietnam, like Henri Huet and Larry Burrows, as well as more recent casualties like Chris Hondros, who attended the 1993 workshop. An annual Award is given to a student by the Chris Hondros Foundation.

Recognizing colleagues who have been killed emphasizes that “the truth matters, pictures matter, and you can make a difference with your pictures not just in war,” said Nancy Andrews, who attended the first workshop in 1988 and has volunteered as a photo editor and will be a team leader this year. She returns for the sense of community and generosity, she said.

“I’m actually improved when you, my colleague, or you, my student, make a great picture” said Ms. Andrews, who was a Washington Post staff photographer and director of photography at The Detroit Free Press. “It’s not like there are finite numbers of great pictures out there and you stole one of them so now I can’t get one. It elevates the profession and I might be better as a result.”

Admission to the workshop, for students and professionals with less than three years’ experience is through portfolios judged by a panel of photo editors.

Not being included can be a difficult blow.

Ruth Fremson was among those young photographers who did not make the cut in the late 1980s. She remembers the rejection well, though she has since been part of three Pulitzer Prize-winning teams as a staff photographer for The Associated Press and starting in 2000 at The New York Times. While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.

She has been a team leader at the workshop the last two years and is returning this weekend as a kitchen volunteer to help prepare food for the students.

“It’s such a gift to be able to participate in it because the team leaders and volunteers get as much out of the workshop as the students,” she said. “I’ve had the benefit of many great mentors who have championed my career and this is a great place to pay it forward.”

Lie #10: Tax cuts will pay for themselvesIf tax cuts don’t generate an economic miracle, it’s hard for them to generate a revenue surge that makes up for lower rates.","Modern conservatives have been lying about taxes pretty much from the beginning of their movement. Made-up sob stories about family farms broken up to pay inheritance taxes, magical claims about self-financing tax cuts, and so on go all the way back to the 1970s. But the selling of tax cuts under Trump has taken things to a whole new level, both in terms of the brazenness of the lies and their sheer number. Both the depth and the breadth of the dishonesty make it hard even for those of us who do this for a living to keep track.

In fact, when I set out to make a list of the bigger lies, I thought there would be six or seven, and was surprised to come up with ten.

So I thought it might be useful, both for myself and for others, to put together a crib sheet: a fairly long-form description of ten big lies Trump and allies are telling, what they’ve said, and how we know that they are lies. I’m probably missing some stuff, and for all I know some new big lie will have been tweeted out by the time this is posted. But we do what we can. So here we go.

Lie #1: America is the most highly-taxed country in the world

This is a Trump special: he’s said it many, many times, most recently just this past week. Each time, fact-checkers have piled on to point out that it’s false. Here’s taxes as a percentage of GDP, from the OECD:

Photo

The blue bar is the US; the red bar the average for advanced countries.

Why does Trump keep repeating what even he has to know by now is a flat lie? I suspect it’s a power thing: he enjoys showing that he can lie repeatedly through his teeth, be caught red-handed in his lie again and again, and his followers will still believe him rather than the “fake news” media.

Lie #2: The estate tax is destroying farmers and truckers

Tales of struggling family farms disbanded because they can’t afford the taxes when the patriarch dies have flourished for decades, despite the absence of any examples. I don’t mean examples are rare: I mean that advocates of estate tax repeal haven’t been able to come up with a single example at least since the late 1970s, when exemption levels were raised to the equivalent of around $2 million in today’s dollars.

Lately Trump has added a new twist, portraying the estate tax as a terrible burden on hard-working truckers. For who among us doesn’t own an $11 million fleet of trucks?

The reality, as this graphic from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows, is that only a small number of very large estates pay any tax at all, and only a tiny fraction of those tax-paying estates are small businesses or family farms:

Photo

In fact, since transportation and warehousing are only 3 percent of GDP and farming less than 1 percent, it seems quite possible that this year only 2 or 3 truckers and not a single farmer will pay any estate tax.

Lie #3: Taxation of pass-through entities is a burden on small business

Most businesses in the United States, at least for tax purposes, aren’t what we normally think of as corporations subject to profits taxes. Instead, they’re partnerships, sole proprietorships, and S corporations whose earnings are simply “passed through”: counted as part of their owners’ personal income and taxed accordingly.

Trump wants to change that, and let owners simply pay a 15 25 percent tax on the earnings of pass-through entities, with no further taxes owed. This is being billed as a reduction in the burden on hard-working small business owners.

But as the Tax Policy Center explains, many middle-income households who own pass-through entities aren’t running businesses; they generally derive only a small fraction of their income from these entities:

Rather, they may receive occasional income from the rental of a vacation home, or from the sale of odds and ends on eBay, that they report as business income.

High-income owners of such entities, by contrast, get a lot of money from them – but they’re not struggling small business people:

This high-income group is made up of doctors, lawyers, consultants, other professionals, and, at the very highest end, partners in hedge funds or other investment firms.

And these are, of course, the people who would gain massively from the Trump proposal. The vast majority of Americans are in a tax bracket of 15 percent or less, so even if they control a pass-through entity, the Trump tax break is worth nothing to them:

Photo

High-income individuals, however, would gain a lot by paying 15 25 percent instead of the much higher rates they pay at the margin – 39.6 percent right now. And they’d also have a strong incentive to rearrange their affairs so that more of their income pops up in their pass-throughs. This wouldn’t be small-business creation; it wouldn’t add jobs; it would just be tax avoidance. That’s what happened when Kansas tried something similar, and played a big role in the state’s fiscal disaster.

So this isn’t a tax break for small business, it’s a tax break for, surprise, wealthy individuals.

Lie #4: Cutting profits taxes really benefits workers

Tax incidence is a headache-inducing subject at best, and my sense is that even the tax policy experts have gotten behind the curve in thinking through the implications of global capital markets for the subject. But I think there’s a way to cut through at least some of the confusion.

Think about what happens if you cut the taxes on corporate profits. The immediate impact is that (duh) corporations have more money. Why would they spend that extra money on hiring more workers or increasing their wages?

Not, surely, out of the goodness of their hearts – and not in response to worker demands, because these days nobody cares what workers think.

Now, they might be inclined to invest more, increasing the demand for labor and therefore raising wages indirectly while competing pre-tax profits down. But there are a couple of major slippages in this story.

First, a lot of corporate profits aren’t a return on physical capital and won’t be competed down if capital gets cheaper. Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others derive their profits from technological advantages, brand name, and market power; cutting the taxes on those profits just leaves their owners with more money.

Second, to raise wages a tax cut must raise the overall stock of capital, which means it must lead to higher total investment spending. Where does the money for that increase in investment come from? The tax cuts are unlikely to raise national saving.

The money might come from abroad, via capital inflows. But the flip side of those capital inflows would be a bigger trade deficit – hardly what the proponents of tax cuts are advertising – and in any case running trade deficits on the required scale is a much more problematic thing than people seem to realize. The dollar would have to rise sharply – and the strength of the dollar would itself deter foreign investment, very much slowing the process of wage rise.

So for an extended period – at least 5 years, probably much more — cutting profits taxes is good for owners of corporations. Workers, not so much.

Lie #5: Repatriating overseas profits will create jobs

For tax reasons, corporations hold a lot of money in overseas tax shelters. Tax cutters always claim that lower rates and/or an amnesty will bring that money home and create a lot of jobs.

So, first of all, there isn’t really a Scrooge McDuck-type pile of cash hidden overseas, ready to be put to work if the taxman will let it. Those overseas accounts are just an accounting device, which have very little real effect. Many of the companies with big overseas hoards also have plenty of idle cash at home; what’s holding them back is a lack of perceived opportunities, not cash flow. And even those who don’t have surplus cash can easily borrow at near-record low interest rates; remember, they can always use the overseas cash to secure their loans.

And we have solid empirical evidence here. In 2004 the U.S. enacted the Homeland Investment Act, which offered a tax holiday for repatriation of foreign earnings by U.S. multinationals. Careful study of its effects tells us that

Repatriations did not lead to an increase in domestic investment, employment or R&D — even for the firms that lobbied for the tax holiday stating these intentions and for firms that appeared to be financially constrained. Instead, a $1 increase in repatriations was associated with an increase of almost $1 in payouts to shareholders.

Lie #6: This is not a tax cut for the rich

Trump says it isn’t, so that’s that, right? Oh, wait.

Actually, if you look at the major provisions of the Unified Framework, the big items are (i) Cuts in corporate taxes (ii) Pass-through tax cut (iii) elimination of the estate tax (iv) cut in top marginal rate. All these strongly favor very high incomes – and everything else is small change. Hence the Tax Policy Center estimate:

Photo

Administration flacks and defenders are accusing TPC of reaching conclusions without adequate information; but the administration is making lots of assertions about what its plan will do, with apparently no more information than the center. Furthermore, given the general shape of the plan there’s no way it can fail to be very much a gift to the already very rich.

Lie #7: It’s a big tax cut for the middle class

See Lie #6 above. All the big provisions benefit the rich, not the middle class. What’s left is mostly small change – and some of it, like ending deductibility of state and local taxes and other deductions, actually raises taxes on a substantial number of middle-class Americans.

In total, by 2027, according to TPC, 80 percent of the tax cut goes to the top 1 percent; only 12 percent to the middle three quintiles.

Lie #8: It won’t increase the deficit

OK, we’re looking at big cuts in corporate taxes, elimination of the estate tax, lower rates on high-income individuals, and a massive new tax-avoidance loophole. How can this not increase the budget deficit?

The only answer would be if the tax proposal eliminated vast swathes of the existing set of tax deductions, massively broadening the tax base. It doesn’t. The only even halfway biggish thing here is the state and local deductibility end – and that is already in very big political trouble. This is a multi-trillion-dollar budget buster, unless it summons up deep voodoo. But …

Lie #9: Cutting taxes will jump-start rapid growth

Insistence in the magical power of tax cuts is the ultimate zombie lie of U.S. policy discussion; nothing can kill it. And we know why: there’s a lot of money behind the proposition that great things will happen if you cut the donors’ taxes. It’s difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.

Still, for the record: Reagan cut taxes, and although his administration began with a terrible recession, there was a fast recovery thereafter. Some of us think Paul Volcker had more to do with both the recession and the recovery than anything coming from the White House; but in any case we have more evidence.

For Bill Clinton raised taxes, amid cries from the right that he would destroy the economy. Instead he presided over a boom that surpassed Reagan in every dimension. For what it’s worth, I don’t think this boom was Clinton’s doing. But it certainly refuted the proposition that cutting taxes is both necessary and sufficient for prosperity.

Then Bush the younger cut taxes, and there were many hosannahs about the “Bush boom.” What he actually got was a lackluster recovery, followed by an epic crash.

Finally, Obama inherited the aftermath of that crash, and despite scorched-earth opposition from Republicans the economy gradually clawed its way back. Then in 2013 Obama first raised taxes substantially, then implemented the Affordable Care Act, again amid cries of disaster from the right. The economy did fine.

Oh, and there were the recent state-level experiments. Sam Brownback slashed taxes in Kansas, promising an economic miracle; all he got was a fiscal crisis. Jerry Brown raised taxes in California, amid predictions of – you guessed it – disaster; the economy boomed, and the main problem is a housing shortage.

There is nothing, nothing at all, in this history that would make any open-minded person believe that the Trump tax plan will cause dramatically accelerated growth.

Lie #10: Tax cuts will pay for themselves

If tax cuts don’t generate an economic miracle, it’s hard for them to generate a revenue surge that makes up for lower rates. True, some hidden money may come out of the woodwork and show up as taxable income, even if GDP doesn’t rise. But this effect hasn’t historically been anywhere big enough to offset the direct losses from lower taxes. Reagan’s tax cuts led to deficits, Clinton’s tax hike to surpluses; Jerry Brown presided over California’s fiscal revitalization, Sam Brownback over a fiscal crisis that eventually prompted the legislature to overrule him and raise taxes again.

So there we are: ten big tax-cut lies. That was pretty exhausting, actually – and as I said, I’ve probably missed a few, and/or Trump will invent some new ones. But I hope this ends up being a useful reference.","Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies",https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/lies-lies-lies-lies-lies-lies-lies-lies-lies-lies/?module=BlogPost-ReadMore&version=Blog Main&action=Click&contentCollection=Opinion&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body#more-41687

The president is not proposing measures like a reduction in payroll taxes, which are paid by a much larger share of workers, nor an increase in the earned-income tax credit, which would expand wage support for the working poor.

Indeed, to call the plan “tax reform” seems like a stretch — Mr. Trump himself told conservative and evangelical leaders on Monday that it was more apt to refer to his plan as “tax cuts.” Mr. Trump’s proposal echoes the large tax cuts that President Ronald Reagan, in 1981, and President George W. Bush, in 2001, passed in the first year of their terms, not the 1986 overhaul of the tax code that he often cites. Like his Republican predecessors, Mr. Trump says cutting taxes will increase economic growth.

“It’s time to take care of our people, to rebuild our nation and to fight for our great American workers,” Mr. Trump told a crowd in Indianapolis.

But the moment is very different. Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush cut taxes during recessions. Mr. Trump is proposing to cut taxes during one of the longest economic expansions in American history. It is not clear that the economy can grow much faster; the Federal Reserve has warned that it will seek to offset any stimulus by raising interest rates.

At the time of the earlier cuts, the federal debt was considerably smaller. The public portion of the debt equaled 24 percent of the gross domestic product in 1981, and 31 percent in 2001. In June, the debt equaled 75 percent of economic output.

The Trump administration insists that its tax cut will catalyze such an economic boom that money will flow into the federal coffers and the debt will not rise. The Reagan and Bush administrations made similar claims. The debt soared in both instances.

Another issue: Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan proposed to cut taxes when federal revenues had climbed unusually high as a share of the national economy.

Mr. Trump wants to cut taxes while revenues are close to an average level.

Since 1981, federal revenue has averaged 17.1 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product, while federal spending has averaged 20.3 percent.

Last year’s numbers were close to the long-term trend: Federal revenue was 17.5 percent of gross domestic product; spending was 20.7 percent.

Martin Feldstein, a Harvard University economics professor and a longtime adviser to Republican presidents, said that the moment was not perfect, but that Mr. Trump should nevertheless press ahead because the changes would be valuable.

“The debt is moving in the wrong direction,” Mr. Feldstein said. “But the tax reform is moving in the right direction.”

Proponents of the plan assert that the largest benefits are indirect. In particular, they argue that cutting corporate taxes will unleash economic growth.

Mr. Trump’s plan is more focused on business tax cuts than the Reagan and Bush plans, and economists agree that this makes economic gains more likely.

The key elements are large reductions in the tax rates for business income: To 20 percent for corporations, and to 25 percent for “pass-through” businesses, a broad category that includes everything from mom-and-pop neighborhood shops to giant investment partnerships, law firms — and real estate developers.

The plan also lets businesses immediately deduct the full cost of new investments.

“You’re going to get a boost in investment,” said William Gale, co-director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. “It’s hard to argue that there won’t be a positive effect.”

But Mr. Gale added that there are reasons to think it would be modest.

The most important is that the economy is already growing at a faster pace than the Fed considers sustainable. “Economy roaring,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Wednesday.

Also, interest rates are low, and nonfinancial companies are sitting on $1.84 trillion that they don’t want to spend. “It’s not lack of funds that’s stopping companies from investing,” Mr. Gale said.

And the stimulus would come at the cost of increased federal borrowing. Interest rates might not rise if foreigners provide the necessary money, as happened in the 1980s and the 2000s, but that means some of the benefits also end up abroad.

It’s a venerable principle that lower tax rates encourage corporate investment. But a study of a 2003 cut in the tax rate on corporate dividends found no discernible impact on investment. The finding would not have surprised Mr. Bush’s Treasury secretary at the time, Paul O’Neill, who was fired for opposing the plan. “You find somebody who says, ‘I do more R & D because I get a tax credit for it,’ you’ll find a fool,” Mr. O’Neill, a former Alcoa chairman, said at the time.

Mr. Trump’s plan also continues a long-term march away from progressive taxation. The federal income tax is the centerpiece of a longstanding bipartisan consensus that wealthy Americans should pay an outsize share of the cost of government.

But successive rounds of tax cuts have eroded that premise, according to research by the economists Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics and Emmanuel Saez of the University of California at Berkeley. In 1980, the wealthiest Americans paid 59 percent of their income in taxes while the middle 20 percent of Americans paid 24.5 percent. After the Bush tax cuts, the wealthiest Americans paid 34.7 percent of their income in taxes, while Americans in the middle income brackets paid 16.1 percent.

Under President Barack Obama, Congress increased taxation of upper-income households. Mr. Trump is seeking to resume the long-term trend toward flattening the curve. Upper-income households would get large tax cuts; lower-income households would get none.

The exact impact on the middle class is not yet clear. The outline released Wednesday proposes new tax brackets but does not specify income thresholds. It also proposes to replace the current tax deduction for each dependent with a child tax credit — but the administration did not propose a dollar amount for that new credit.

The administration said Wednesday that it was committed “to ensure that the reformed tax code is at least as progressive as the existing tax code.” That language, however, applies only to personal income taxes. The proposed reduction of business taxes and the elimination of the estate tax would both disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans.

“I don’t think there’s any way to justify this as a progressive proposal,” said Lily Batchelder, a law professor at New York University who served as deputy director of Mr. Obama’s National Economic Council. “In broad brush strokes, they’re doing nothing for the bottom 35 percent, they’re doing very little and possibly raising taxes on the middle class, and they’ve specified tax cuts for the wealthy.”","Trump Tax Plan Benefits Wealthy, Including Trump",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/trump-tax-plan-wealthy-middle-class-poor.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0

With economy, a bit of gauzy nostalgia and likable performances, it revisits an early episode from the life of Thurgood Marshall, the civil rights lawyer who became the first African-American to hold a seat on the Supreme Court. From the 1940s to the early ’60s, he argued 32 cases before the court, winning most. “Sometimes history takes things into its own hands,” Marshall once said, but he also regularly gave history a shove.

“Marshall” isn’t about the famous cases that he argued in front of the court, including the history-making Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which led the court to declare racially segregated public schools unconstitutional. Instead, the movie focuses on a 1941 case involving Eleanor Strubing, a wealthy white woman from Greenwich, Conn., who accused her black chauffeur and butler, Joseph Spell, of raping her and then pushing her off a bridge. After hours of questioning, Spell confessed. The racist reactions to the charges, which invoked the dangerous Jim Crow stereotype of the ravaging black man, caught the notice of N.A.A.C.P., which sent Marshall to the rescue.

Jauntily self-possessed, the movie’s Thurgood (Chadwick Boseman) rides in like a cavalry of one, taking the measure of the town and its escalating tension. He’s soon joined by another lawyer, Sam Friedman (Josh Gad), a button-down type who reluctantly joins the defense and reasonably fears the attention it will bring. The pair’s introduction immediately sets the alpha and beta tag-team dynamic: Thurgood casually asks for a hand with his bags, and Sam ends up carrying the load. The scene telegraphs the shifting power dynamics Thurgood represents, but it also announces that the movie will resort to easy, ingratiating comedy to sell the goods.

Video

Seamlessly directed by Reginald Hudlin from a script by the father-and-son team of Michael and Jacob Koskoff, the movie primarily involves Thurgood’s strategy to free Joseph. Part of what made the case important to the N.A.A.C.P., as the scholar Daniel J. Sharfstein has written, was that it took place in the North instead of the South, where the organization was fighting on multiple fronts. In the 1930s, the activist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that the idea that there was no prejudice in the North was a fable. “The difference between North and South in the matter of segregation,” he wrote in 1934, “is largely a difference of degree.”

“Marshall” takes up that refrain both in its restaging of the trial and through the evolution of Thurgood and Sam’s slow-warming relationship. As the case comes into focus, Joseph (Sterling K. Brown) and Eleanor (Kate Hudson) take their opposing seats, the jury troops in, and the nasty judge (James Cromwell) starts snarling. Thurgood rapidly takes the lead while slyly poking and strategically prodding Sam to rise to the occasion. Thurgood and Sam banter, lash out, jostle for position and occasionally deliver some stink eye, especially Sam (at Thurgood). Like his character, Mr. Boseman is the star of this show, while Mr. Gad is the second banana and often comic relief. Both performers are natural showmen who never step on each other’s moment; they’re fun to watch.

It’s all a bit too much fun at times. The chuckles and legal-eagle bromance make the difficult, disturbing story flow easily, but there are moments when you wish that Mr. Hudlin would ease up on the comedy. Sam, in particular, occasionally comes uncomfortably close to a being a caricature, one of those bespectacled, emasculated types who need a kick in the pants, a sock in the jaw, so they can man up. The broadness of the characterizations is of a piece with the movie’s anxious rhythms and relentless forward drive. These may be a function of the clock running out on Joseph, along with a desire to entertain. But there’s little reflective or quiet time with the characters, these men of righteous action who chase clues before swooping into court and history.","Review: In ‘Marshall,’ a Legal Pioneer Gives History a Shove",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/movies/marshall-review-chadwick-boseman.html

Season 1, Episode 5: ‘Choose Your Pain’

One of the best episodes of “Star Trek: The Next Generation” was the two-part “The Best of Both Worlds,” in which the Borg kidnap Picard and turn him into Locutus. Through a different lens, though, this was a story about Riker (Jonathan Frakes), who is forced to take command of the Enterprise and is unsure whether he is ready to do so. On its surface, the story was about the lengths a crew will go to save Picard and the potential destruction of the Federation. But it was also, if not more so, about seeing Riker develop beyond just a competent first officer. (Part of this was due to Patrick Stewart’s contract negotiations.)

Along the same lines, the fifth episode of “Discovery” is about Saru (played brilliantly by Doug Jones), who is unsure of himself after taking command following Captain Lorca’s kidnapping. I should note here that Spock faces a similar circumstance in “Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,” but at that point, Spock was a fully realized character, unlike Saru. Still, the Kelpien rises to the task magnificently, proving himself a decisive and competent commander.

Historically, “Star Trek” series have been ensemble shows. The first four episodes of “Discovery,” though, were almost entirely focused on Burnham. Here, for the first time, we see supporting characters do something other than mope or snap at Burnham. Paul Stamets, the first openly gay television character in “Star Trek” history, has a nice scene with his partner, the ship’s doctor, Hugh Culber (Wilson Cruz), in which we learn he is capable of something other than being grouchy.

Some of the early “Discovery” plotting paid off in this episode. When the ship rescues Lorca and escapes Klingon space, it is revealed that Stamets used his own body to operate the spore drive. Given that the show has quickly killed off several main characters so far, I legitimately thought that Stamets was a goner. Same for when Lorca was on the Klingon ship.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Jeff Chen is back with a surprisingly straightforward puzzle, which made me wonder if he was secretly taking us for a ride. His puzzles have had some pretty neat gimmicks in them, so when I see a list theme from him, my first thought is that perhaps he is pulling the old bluff on us.

Today’s Theme

It’s actually a list theme, but it’s a tight one. A total of four, two-word phrases each have a synonym for “victim” as their first word, and the CON MEN who target them are hiding away at 43D. For example, at 30A, the answer to “A mere pittance” is CHUMP CHANGE and, at 40A, the answer to the clue “Unexpected hit” is SUCKER PUNCH.

Tricky Clues

21A: A “Person setting the stage?” could be a narrator, but today it’s a ROADIE setting up for a concert.

57A: This puzzle was one of the entries in the Westchester Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and quite a few of the solvers were bamboozled by the spelling of MARK ANTONY with a ‘K.’ Many contestants thought that his name was spelled with a ‘C,’ but it’s not. And you have that easy crossing of PORKY’S to confirm.

23D: My first reaction to IBANKER was “What? No!” but it’s a thing.

37D: UNDEROOS were haute couture when The Boy was a wee one. He preferred the Batman ones.

Constructor Notes

My mother-in-law’s name is Patsy and I’m a big fan of Patsy Cline — “Walkin’ After Midnight” is one of my favorites. Not hard to see where I got the idea for the puzzle. What is hard to see is PATSY CLINE in the grid. She could have gone where PIGEON COOP is, but my mother-in-law in a crossword where PATSY is associated with CHUMP, SUCKER, and MARK ... hmm.

Made-up sob stories about family farms broken up to pay inheritance taxes, magical claims about self-financing tax cuts, and so on go all the way back to the 1970s. But the selling of tax cuts under Trump has taken things to a whole new level, both in terms of the brazenness of the lies and their sheer number. Both the depth and the breadth of the dishonesty make it hard even for those of us who do this for a living to keep track.

In fact, when I set out to make a list of the bigger lies, I thought there would be six or seven, and was surprised to come up with ten.

So I thought it might be useful, both for myself and for others, to put together a crib sheet: a fairly long-form description of ten big lies Trump and allies are telling, what they’ve said, and how we know that they are lies. I’m probably missing some stuff, and for all I know some new big lie will have been tweeted out by the time this is posted. But we do what we can. So here we go.

Lie #1: America is the most highly-taxed country in the world

This is a Trump special: he’s said it many, many times, most recently just this past week. Each time, fact-checkers have piled on to point out that it’s false. Here’s taxes as a percentage of GDP, from the OECD:

Photo

The blue bar is the US; the red bar the average for advanced countries.

Why does Trump keep repeating what even he has to know by now is a flat lie? I suspect it’s a power thing: he enjoys showing that he can lie repeatedly through his teeth, be caught red-handed in his lie again and again, and his followers will still believe him rather than the “fake news” media.

Lie #2: The estate tax is destroying farmers and truckers

Tales of struggling family farms disbanded because they can’t afford the taxes when the patriarch dies have flourished for decades, despite the absence of any examples. I don’t mean examples are rare: I mean that advocates of estate tax repeal haven’t been able to come up with a single example at least since the late 1970s, when exemption levels were raised to the equivalent of around $2 million in today’s dollars.

Lately Trump has added a new twist, portraying the estate tax as a terrible burden on hard-working truckers. For who among us doesn’t own an $11 million fleet of trucks?

The reality, as this graphic from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows, is that only a small number of very large estates pay any tax at all, and only a tiny fraction of those tax-paying estates are small businesses or family farms:

Photo

In fact, since transportation and warehousing are only 3 percent of GDP and farming less than 1 percent, it seems quite possible that this year only 2 or 3 truckers and not a single farmer will pay any estate tax.

Lie #3: Taxation of pass-through entities is a burden on small business

Most businesses in the United States, at least for tax purposes, aren’t what we normally think of as corporations subject to profits taxes. Instead, they’re partnerships, sole proprietorships, and S corporations whose earnings are simply “passed through”: counted as part of their owners’ personal income and taxed accordingly.

Trump wants to change that, and let owners simply pay a 15 25 percent tax on the earnings of pass-through entities, with no further taxes owed. This is being billed as a reduction in the burden on hard-working small business owners.

But as the Tax Policy Center explains, many middle-income households who own pass-through entities aren’t running businesses; they generally derive only a small fraction of their income from these entities:

Rather, they may receive occasional income from the rental of a vacation home, or from the sale of odds and ends on eBay, that they report as business income.

High-income owners of such entities, by contrast, get a lot of money from them – but they’re not struggling small business people:

This high-income group is made up of doctors, lawyers, consultants, other professionals, and, at the very highest end, partners in hedge funds or other investment firms.

And these are, of course, the people who would gain massively from the Trump proposal. The vast majority of Americans are in a tax bracket of 15 percent or less, so even if they control a pass-through entity, the Trump tax break is worth nothing to them:

Photo

High-income individuals, however, would gain a lot by paying 15 25 percent instead of the much higher rates they pay at the margin – 39.6 percent right now. And they’d also have a strong incentive to rearrange their affairs so that more of their income pops up in their pass-throughs. This wouldn’t be small-business creation; it wouldn’t add jobs; it would just be tax avoidance. That’s what happened when Kansas tried something similar, and played a big role in the state’s fiscal disaster.

So this isn’t a tax break for small business, it’s a tax break for, surprise, wealthy individuals.

Lie #4: Cutting profits taxes really benefits workers

Tax incidence is a headache-inducing subject at best, and my sense is that even the tax policy experts have gotten behind the curve in thinking through the implications of global capital markets for the subject. But I think there’s a way to cut through at least some of the confusion.

Think about what happens if you cut the taxes on corporate profits. The immediate impact is that (duh) corporations have more money. Why would they spend that extra money on hiring more workers or increasing their wages?

Not, surely, out of the goodness of their hearts – and not in response to worker demands, because these days nobody cares what workers think.

Now, they might be inclined to invest more, increasing the demand for labor and therefore raising wages indirectly while competing pre-tax profits down. But there are a couple of major slippages in this story.

First, a lot of corporate profits aren’t a return on physical capital and won’t be competed down if capital gets cheaper. Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others derive their profits from technological advantages, brand name, and market power; cutting the taxes on those profits just leaves their owners with more money.

Second, to raise wages a tax cut must raise the overall stock of capital, which means it must lead to higher total investment spending. Where does the money for that increase in investment come from? The tax cuts are unlikely to raise national saving.

The money might come from abroad, via capital inflows. But the flip side of those capital inflows would be a bigger trade deficit – hardly what the proponents of tax cuts are advertising – and in any case running trade deficits on the required scale is a much more problematic thing than people seem to realize. The dollar would have to rise sharply – and the strength of the dollar would itself deter foreign investment, very much slowing the process of wage rise.

So for an extended period – at least 5 years, probably much more — cutting profits taxes is good for owners of corporations. Workers, not so much.

Lie #5: Repatriating overseas profits will create jobs

For tax reasons, corporations hold a lot of money in overseas tax shelters. Tax cutters always claim that lower rates and/or an amnesty will bring that money home and create a lot of jobs.

So, first of all, there isn’t really a Scrooge McDuck-type pile of cash hidden overseas, ready to be put to work if the taxman will let it. Those overseas accounts are just an accounting device, which have very little real effect. Many of the companies with big overseas hoards also have plenty of idle cash at home; what’s holding them back is a lack of perceived opportunities, not cash flow. And even those who don’t have surplus cash can easily borrow at near-record low interest rates; remember, they can always use the overseas cash to secure their loans.

And we have solid empirical evidence here. In 2004 the U.S. enacted the Homeland Investment Act, which offered a tax holiday for repatriation of foreign earnings by U.S. multinationals. Careful study of its effects tells us that

Repatriations did not lead to an increase in domestic investment, employment or R&D — even for the firms that lobbied for the tax holiday stating these intentions and for firms that appeared to be financially constrained. Instead, a $1 increase in repatriations was associated with an increase of almost $1 in payouts to shareholders.

Lie #6: This is not a tax cut for the rich

Trump says it isn’t, so that’s that, right? Oh, wait.

Actually, if you look at the major provisions of the Unified Framework, the big items are (i) Cuts in corporate taxes (ii) Pass-through tax cut (iii) elimination of the estate tax (iv) cut in top marginal rate. All these strongly favor very high incomes – and everything else is small change. Hence the Tax Policy Center estimate:

Photo

Administration flacks and defenders are accusing TPC of reaching conclusions without adequate information; but the administration is making lots of assertions about what its plan will do, with apparently no more information than the center. Furthermore, given the general shape of the plan there’s no way it can fail to be very much a gift to the already very rich.

Lie #7: It’s a big tax cut for the middle class

See Lie #6 above. All the big provisions benefit the rich, not the middle class. What’s left is mostly small change – and some of it, like ending deductibility of state and local taxes and other deductions, actually raises taxes on a substantial number of middle-class Americans.

In total, by 2027, according to TPC, 80 percent of the tax cut goes to the top 1 percent; only 12 percent to the middle three quintiles.

Lie #8: It won’t increase the deficit

OK, we’re looking at big cuts in corporate taxes, elimination of the estate tax, lower rates on high-income individuals, and a massive new tax-avoidance loophole. How can this not increase the budget deficit?

The only answer would be if the tax proposal eliminated vast swathes of the existing set of tax deductions, massively broadening the tax base. It doesn’t. The only even halfway biggish thing here is the state and local deductibility end – and that is already in very big political trouble. This is a multi-trillion-dollar budget buster, unless it summons up deep voodoo. But …

Lie #9: Cutting taxes will jump-start rapid growth

Insistence in the magical power of tax cuts is the ultimate zombie lie of U.S. policy discussion; nothing can kill it. And we know why: there’s a lot of money behind the proposition that great things will happen if you cut the donors’ taxes. It’s difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.

Still, for the record: Reagan cut taxes, and although his administration began with a terrible recession, there was a fast recovery thereafter. Some of us think Paul Volcker had more to do with both the recession and the recovery than anything coming from the White House; but in any case we have more evidence.

For Bill Clinton raised taxes, amid cries from the right that he would destroy the economy. Instead he presided over a boom that surpassed Reagan in every dimension. For what it’s worth, I don’t think this boom was Clinton’s doing. But it certainly refuted the proposition that cutting taxes is both necessary and sufficient for prosperity.

Then Bush the younger cut taxes, and there were many hosannahs about the “Bush boom.” What he actually got was a lackluster recovery, followed by an epic crash.

Finally, Obama inherited the aftermath of that crash, and despite scorched-earth opposition from Republicans the economy gradually clawed its way back. Then in 2013 Obama first raised taxes substantially, then implemented the Affordable Care Act, again amid cries of disaster from the right. The economy did fine.

Oh, and there were the recent state-level experiments. Sam Brownback slashed taxes in Kansas, promising an economic miracle; all he got was a fiscal crisis. Jerry Brown raised taxes in California, amid predictions of – you guessed it – disaster; the economy boomed, and the main problem is a housing shortage.

There is nothing, nothing at all, in this history that would make any open-minded person believe that the Trump tax plan will cause dramatically accelerated growth.

Lie #10: Tax cuts will pay for themselves

If tax cuts don’t generate an economic miracle, it’s hard for them to generate a revenue surge that makes up for lower rates. True, some hidden money may come out of the woodwork and show up as taxable income, even if GDP doesn’t rise. But this effect hasn’t historically been anywhere big enough to offset the direct losses from lower taxes. Reagan’s tax cuts led to deficits, Clinton’s tax hike to surpluses; Jerry Brown presided over California’s fiscal revitalization, Sam Brownback over a fiscal crisis that eventually prompted the legislature to overrule him and raise taxes again.

So there we are: ten big tax-cut lies. That was pretty exhausting, actually – and as I said, I’ve probably missed a few, and/or Trump will invent some new ones. But I hope this ends up being a useful reference.","Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies",https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/lies-lies-lies-lies-lies-lies-lies-lies-lies-lies/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog Main&contentCollection=Opinion&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body

But for Mr. Nikolaou, the project, called “…Balkaniotheque” and sponsored by the Onassis Foundation, became more than a multifaceted look at the region. It has been a search for his very identity.

“I am a Greek,” said Mr. Nikolaou, who calls both Athens and Chalkis home. “And I have multiple identities. I belong in the East, in the West, but I also belong in the Balkans. This was forgotten for Greeks. None define themselves as Balkan. I had to find myself.”

Early on, Mr. Nikolaou said the project felt like psychoanalysis, a dive into his soul and the way he learned how to feel. He became fixated on the notion of a shared, repressed Balkan identity, one that he could unearth and restore to the collective memory.

“I wish to describe the Balkan soul,” he said. “Which seems to be dark and intractable, but it becomes simple, warm and human when it flames up.”

Mr. Nikolaou said he allowed the places to which he journeyed to choose him, not the other way around. In his travels, he’s been to nearly a dozen countries, exploring bustling capital cities as well as Roma ghettos and mountain villages.

“I made more than 20 trips trying not just to take photos, but to feel the Balkan reality,” he said. “To see those deep characteristics of the Balkan people that I believe are common all over the peninsula.”

The Balkan people were very hospitable, Mr. Nikolaou said, though he preferred to stay in the remote, rural areas. “There I met the most important people,” he said. “People totally free from the stress of our civilization. People with pain in their eyes but firstly, with big, big heart.”

He bore witness to funerals, celebrated at weddings and made intimate connections with those who opened their homes and lives to him. That vulnerability fostered a sense of human unity that Mr. Nikolaou hopes to showcase.

“The Balkans are a place where people look so different, but they are so alike in the way they face life,” he said. “And that must be what will lead us in the future. It may seem utopian, but deep inside me I believe that all people can live without borders. Even in the war-crushed Balkans, we can. It is enough to look at what it is that unites us. And what unites us is more important than what keeps us divided.”

In another one-man tour de force, in 1980, Mr. Dotrice starred in Herbert Mitgang’s “Mister Lincoln” at Ford’s Theater in Washington, where Lincoln was slain in 1865, and later on Broadway and on PBS. He had immersed himself for months in Lincoln’s life, and colleagues said his renderings of Lincoln, and especially of the Gettysburg Address, were performances of remarkable subtlety and power. Mr. Mitgang, who wrote the play, was the author of two biographies of Lincoln. He also wrote for The New York Times.

“The role of Lincoln is probably one of the hardest to play of any historical character,” Frankie Hewitt, the play’s executive producer, told The Times. “If you try to humanize him, it can get corny and awkward, and if you try to play him larger than life, he is turned into a Disney World mechanical Lincoln. But Roy is such a superb actor, he succeeds where everyone else has basically failed.”

Roy Louis Dotrice was born on the Island of Guernsey, a British dependency off the French coast, on May 26, 1923, to Louis Dotrice, a Belgian pastry chef, and the former Neva Wilton, an English baker. In 1940, when Nazi troops occupied Guernsey, Roy and his mother escaped to Britain, where he joined the Royal Air Force and became a radio operator and gunner in a bomber.

On a raid in 1942, his plane was shot down over the Baltic. He and a few other survivors floated in a dinghy for days and were washed ashore. They were captured and spent the rest of the war as prisoners in Germany. To keep captive spirits up in the stalag, the prisoners staged makeshift plays. Mr. Dotrice’s first role was the Fairy Godmother in “Cinderella.”

“We didn’t have any real women, unfortunately,” he said.

After the war, he rejected a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and plunged into acting. For 12 years he performed in, and sometimes directed, hundreds of plays in repertory companies, often a new production every week, in a thespian grind of lines, characters, plots and venues: Liverpool, Manchester and, he said, “every dreary North Country town.”

In 1947, he married Katherine Newman, an actress. They had three daughters, Michele, Yvette and Karen, who all became actresses. His wife died in 2007. His daughters survive him, as do seven grandchildren and a great-grandson, The A.P. reported.

In 1957, Mr. Dotrice joined the forerunner of the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon, and for nine years he appeared as Hamlet, Iago, Falstaff, Julius Caesar and other Shakespearean characters with casts that included future luminaries of the British theater, including Charles Laughton and Albert Finney.

While he kept a home in London, Mr. Dotrice lived in Los Angeles and worked mostly in the United States after 1980. He appeared in New York stage productions of Ibsen’s “An Enemy of the People” (1985) and Harold Pinter’s “The Homecoming” (1991). On film, he portrayed Mozart’s father in Milos Forman’s “Amadeus” (1984) and a skating coach in Paul M. Glaser’s “The Cutting Edge” (1992).

On television, he played Charles Dickens in Masterpiece Theater’s 13-part “Dickens of London” (1976); a British monarch in the mini-series “Shaka Zulu” (1986); the father of the beast on the CBS crime series “Beauty and the Beast” (1987-90); and a priest on the CBS dramatic series “Picket Fences” (1993-96). In recent years he recorded many audiobooks, creating voices for hundreds of characters in the saga adapted for “Game of Thrones.”

Looking back on his career in an interview in 1980, Mr. Dotrice recalled one of his more unusual achievements: introducing baseball — learned from Canadian P.O.W.s during the war — to cricket-playing members of his Shakespeare troupe in 1959. He put together an “all-star” team to challenge Americans at a nearby air base.

“Paul Robeson played first base, Sam Wanamaker second and Laurence Olivier third,” he said. “Peter O’Toole was shortstop, Albert Finney was catcher, I pitched and Charles Laughton was umpire.

The president also said that he will try to talk Mr. Bannon out of at least some plans to field hard-right primary candidates to challenge virtually every Senate Republican seeking re-election next year.

“The relationship is very good. We are fighting for the same thing,” Mr. Trump said during wide-ranging comments to reporters that also touched on immigration, health care, the opioid crisis, Cuba, military deaths and other topics. “We are fighting for lower taxes, big tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts in the history of our nation.”

White House officials described Monday’s lunch with Mr. McConnell as largely focused on efforts to cut taxes, and they said it ended with both men engaged and relaxed — a remarkable feat for two politicians whose personal styles could not be more different.

Mr. Trump has eagerly conducted his insurgent presidency in the glare of the cameras, antagonizing friends and foes alike and boasting of accomplishments large and small. Mr. McConnell, the definition of the Washington establishment, has always been a tight-lipped, back-room negotiator.

“In show-business parlance, Donald Trump is a show runner,” said Al Cross, a longtime Kentucky political journalist who has known Mr. McConnell for more than 30 years. “He’s all about the show — it’s all about getting good ratings for Donald Trump — and McConnell has never been about the show. He’s all about business.”

Mr. Trump mentioned in an aside at the news conference that he would soon outline an economic development plan, though he confessed that he had yet to tell Mr. McConnell about it.

Despite pledges by both men that they share the same agenda, any good will that may have once existed dissolved after the Senate twice failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. After the first defeat in July, Mr. Trump tweeted in August: “Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn’t get it done.”

In another tweet in August, he said, “The only problem I have with Mitch McConnell is that, after hearing Repeal & Replace for 7 years, he failed!”

Privately, Mr. Trump has repeatedly denigrated Mr. McConnell, most recently unloading about the Senate Republican leader during a dinner this month with a group of about a dozen conservative movement leaders in the Blue Room of the White House. According to two people with knowledge of the president’s remarks, he called Mr. McConnell “a weak leader” and said that he remained befuddled at Mr. McConnell’s inability to wrangle the votes needed to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

For his part, aides to Mr. McConnell say that he has been deeply frustrated by Mr. Trump’s willingness to lash out, even as the Senate leader successfully guided the chamber to confirm Mr. Trump’s cabinet and judicial nominations, including the president’s choice of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.

Soon after Mr. Trump took office, Mr. McConnell told associates that the new president had no clear sense of where he stood on most core issues, and he predicted that steering Mr. Trump — and taking the lead on policy — would be relatively easy.

The two disagreed early on political strategy: Mr. McConnell wanted the president to nominate a Democratic senator in a conservative state for a cabinet post to help Republicans pick up a seat. Instead, Mr. Trump plucked Ryan Zinke, a Republican representative from Montana, for the Interior Department, ending Mr. McConnell’s hopes that Mr. Zinke, a popular former Navy SEAL, would challenge Montana’s Democratic senator, Jon Tester, in 2018.

In the months since, Mr. McConnell and his aides have watched Mr. Trump buck the Senate, both publicly and privately.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly hectored Mr. McConnell to scrap Senate rules that require most legislation to clear a 60-vote hurdle before final passage, a demand that the leader has resisted, in part, for fear of a return to Democratic control.

Mr. McConnell has also been taken aback by Mr. Bannon’s decision to start a political crusade against establishment Republicans in the Senate by recruiting candidates who could put at risk the party’s control. So far, Mr. Bannon has backed conservative challengers to Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Dean Heller of Nevada, and could formally back a challenger to Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi.

Mr. McConnell said he was focused on keeping the Senate in Republican hands.

“The way you do that is not complicated,” Mr. McConnell said. “You have to nominate people who can actually win because winners make policy and losers go home.” He added a few moments later, “Our operating approach will be to support our incumbents.”

Mr. Trump said that Mr. Bannon “has been a friend of mine for a long time” and that his former strategist was doing “what Steve thinks is the right thing.”

But with Mr. McConnell standing next to him, the president hinted that he would not entirely support Mr. Bannon’s efforts to throw out of office Republicans who Mr. Bannon does not think are sufficiently supportive of Mr. Trump’s agenda.

“Some of the people that he may be looking at, I’m going to see if we talk him out of that,” the president said.

One person close to Mr. McConnell said Mr. McConnell has been very careful in his public comments about Mr. Trump in part because he did not want to put his wife, Elaine L. Chao — who serves as Mr. Trump’s secretary of transportation — in an awkward position with her boss.

Other advisers to Mr. McConnell said the two men both recognize that Republicans’ fate in 2018 hinges on whether Congress can pass the tax cuts that Mr. Trump is seeking.

“I feel like they are both under so much pressure to deliver — that’s what causes tension, real or imagined,” said Scott Jennings, a former adviser to Mr. McConnell who remains close to the majority leader. “They need to be able to jointly take something back to the voters next year to sell. I think winning on a major policy initiative like tax reform would allow for a further expansion of their relationship on politics.”

That level of cooperation — which has been so vital to the success of past presidents — was in danger of completely unraveling before Monday’s lunch. Over the objections of some of his advisers, the president had grown increasingly unwilling to set aside his insurgent tendencies to make Washington-style deals with Mr. McConnell.

Mr. Trump’s contempt grew even stronger after he backed Mr. McConnell’s preferred candidate last month in a special election in Alabama. That candidate — Senator Luther Strange — lost the election to Roy S. Moore, a defeat that Mr. Trump took personally.

And Mr. McConnell’s closest allies became increasingly aggrieved at the president’s treatment of the leader, especially because they view Mr. McConnell’s refusal to hold hearings for President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee as critical to Mr. Trump’s election.

On Monday, both men sought to minimize the conflict between them in the interest of sending a signal of unity of purpose that could soothe the despair of allies who fear the feud imperils any hopes for the tax and budget legislation before the end of the year.

One says that imperfect rationality changes everything; the other that the assumption of rationality is still the best game out there, or at least sets a baseline from which departures must be justified at length.
That’s where Robert Lucas came in: trying to rationalize the observed facts of business cycles with perfectly rational behavior in the face of imperfect information.
But at this point we can safely say that it took the whole field down a rabbit hole.","Like the vast majority of economists, I was delighted to see Richard Thaler get the Nobel. Anyone with a bit of sense – a group that, believe it or not, includes many economists – knows that people aren’t perfectly rational. But the assumption of hyperrationality still plays far too large a role in the field. And Thaler didn’t just document deviations from rationality, he showed that there are consistent, usable patterns in those deviations.

The question, however, is how much difference this should make to the practice of economics. And here you have a division between two camps. One says that imperfect rationality changes everything; the other that the assumption of rationality is still the best game out there, or at least sets a baseline from which departures must be justified at length.

Which camp is right? My thought: it depends on the field, for reasons not entirely clear to me. Let me talk about two fields I know reasonably well: macroeconomics, which I think I know pretty well, and finance, where I am much less well-informed in general but am pretty familiar with at least some international areas. What strikes me is that vaguely Thalerish reasoning is hugely important in one, in the other not so much.

Let me state two propositions derived from the proposition that people are perfectly rational:

1.Rational investors will build all available information into asset prices, so movements in these prices will be driven only by unanticipated events – that is, they’ll follow a random walk, with no patterns you can exploit to make money

2.Rational wage- and price-setters will take all available information into account when setting labor and goods prices, implying that demand shocks will have real effects only if they’re unanticipated – in particular, that monetary policy “works” only if it’s a surprise, and can’t play a stabilizing role

Now, (1) is basically efficient markets theory, which we know is wrong in detail – there are lots of anomalies. In international finance, for example, there is the well-known uncovered interest parity puzzle: differences in national interest rates should be unbiased predictors of future changes in exchange rates, but in fact turn out to have no predictive power at all. And anyone who believed that rationality of investors precluded the possibility of massive, obvious mispricing – say, of subprime-backed securities – has not had a happy decade.

Yet the broader proposition that asset price movements are unpredictable, that patterns are subtle, unstable, and hard to make money off of, seems to be right. On the whole, it seems to me that considering the implications of rational behavior has done more good than harm to the field of finance.

What about (2)? That’s where Robert Lucas came in: trying to rationalize the observed facts of business cycles with perfectly rational behavior in the face of imperfect information. This approach had a huge effect on the practice of macroeconomics, at least academic macroeconomics. But at this point we can safely say that it took the whole field down a rabbit hole. Wage- and price-setting does not reflect the best available information about future monetary policies; if it did, we’d be seeing wage contracts moving rapidly around as Kevin Warsh’s prospects on Predictit fluctuate. Everything we know suggests that there is a lot of nominal downward rigidity and a lot of money illusion in general.

And assertions that this might be true in practice, but can’t be true in theory, and must therefore be assumed away both in research and in policy have been hugely destructive.

So, rationality is a lie. But in some parts of economics it seems to be a bit of a noble lie, useful as a guide for thinking as long as you keep your tongue firmly in your cheek. In other parts, however, it’s just a disaster.

As I said, I can think of some reasons why. In financial markets, smart investors can, within limits, arbitrage against the irrationality of others. There’s no equivalent in labor and goods markets (or in consumer behavior!). But in general, the uneven applicability of behavioral thinking is surely – of course – a subject for future research.",Rationality and Rabbit Holes,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/rationality-and-rabbit-holes/

So what’s behind this priority? Follow the money. Big donors are furious at missing out on the $700 billion in tax cuts that were supposed to come out of Obamacare repeal. If they don’t get big bucks out of tax “reform,” they might close their pocketbooks for the 2018 midterm elections.

Beyond that, modern conservatism is a sort of ecosystem of media outlets, think tanks, lobbying outfits and more that offers many lucrative niches — so-called wingnut welfare — for the ideologically reliable. And that means being reliable to the interests of the wealthy.

But how can an administration that pretends to be populist, to stand up for ordinary (white) working people, sell such elitist policies?

The answer is a strategy based entirely on lies. And I mean entirely: The Trump administration and its allies are lying about every aspect of their tax plan.

I’m not talking about dubious interpretations of evidence or misleading presentation of the facts — the kind of thing the Bush administration used to specialize in. I’m talking about flat-out, easily refuted lies, like the claim that America has the world’s highest taxes (among rich countries, we have close to the lowest), or the claim that estate taxes are a huge burden on small business (almost no small businesses pay any estate tax).

Nor do I mean that there are just one or two big lies. There are many — so many I literally don’t have space to so much as list them in this column. In a long blog post this past weekend I tried to provide a systematic list; I came up with 10 major Republican lies about tax cuts, and I’m sure I missed a few.

So, politically, can they really get away with this? A lot depends on how the news media handles it. If an administration spokesperson declares that up is down, will news reports simply say “so-and-so says up is down, but Democrats disagree,” or will they also report that up is not, in fact, down? I wish I were confident about the answer to that question.

One thing we know for sure, however, is that a great majority of Republican politicians know perfectly well that their party is lying about its tax plan — and every even halfway competent economist aligned with the party definitely understands what’s going on.

What this means is that everyone who goes along with this plan, or even remains silent in the face of the campaign of mass dissimulation, is complicit — is in effect an accomplice to the most dishonest political selling job in American history.",The G.O.P.

As Iraqi troops rolled into this city of about one million, Arab and Turkmen residents fired weapons into the air in celebration.

Cheering crowds looked on as Iraqi forces removed a Kurdish flag that had flown over the Kirkuk governor’s compound and left intact an Iraqi flag mounted beside it, local officials said. Iraqi troops drove through the city, removing pesh merga flags and banners and replacing them with Iraqi flags.

While Iraq’s future remains far from secure, the momentum has clearly swung in Baghdad’s favor. Its forces have now beaten back existential challenges on two fronts, pushing the Islamic State out of major cities and retaking a critical oil region from the Kurds.

Neither battle is over. But the Islamic State, which three years ago controlled a third of the country, has been reduced to a handful of desert outposts and a small city on the Syrian border, while the Kurds may now have to defer their independence dreams.

The referendum, which had Kurds celebrating in the streets three weeks ago, has now clearly backfired. The Kurdish region depends heavily on oil revenue, roughly half of it from the Kirkuk region, and the independence vote alienated the United States and angered neighbors.

“They may have made a miscalculation of historic proportions by proceeding with the referendum over the objections of just about everyone who counts,” said Joost Hiltermann, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.

The Kirkuk operation also exposed deep divisions within the Kurdish command, as fighters loyal to a Kurdish opposition party, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, agreed to make way for the advancing Iraqi forces even as other fighters loyal to the governing Kurdistan Democratic Party continued to resist.

The Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani spearheaded the referendum, which most Kurds saw as a historic step toward achieving the national dream of an independent homeland. But critics accused Mr. Barzani of staging the vote to deflect attention from the Kurdish region’s troubled economy and what they consider to be Mr. Barzani’s authoritarian rule.

Moreover, and especially irksome to Baghdad, the vote included disputed territory outside the boundaries of the autonomous Kurdish region, including Kirkuk and the surrounding oil fields. Kurdish forces seized that territory in 2014 after Iraqi troops fled an Islamic State assault, but Baghdad has never accepted Kurdish control there.

After the referendum vote, Iraqi authorities gave the Kurds an ultimatum, to annul the vote or face military action. But over the last few days, even as Iraq massed troops in the Kirkuk region, Baghdad insisted it had no plans to carry out a military assault on Kirkuk.

As recently as Friday, the Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, said the military “cannot and will not attack our citizens, whether Arab or Kurd,” and dismissed reports to the contrary as “fake news.”

In the last few days, emissaries from Baghdad conducted secret talks with Kurdish opposition forces to negotiate their withdrawal.

Wista Raool, commander of opposition pesh merga forces south of Kirkuk, said the opposition sought to return the oil fields to the federal government. He accused Mr. Barzani and his party of “stealing” the oil from the Iraqi government.

Still, fighting broke out between advancing government forces and pesh merga fighters from Mr. Barzani’s faction.

A Kurdish commander, Gen. Mohammed Raiger, said his forces had mounted a counterattack about 15 miles west of the city. He said reinforcements with “sophisticated weapons” had arrived to support Kurdish fighters in the area.

A statement by the Kurdish government’s security council said pesh merga fighters had destroyed five American-supplied Humvees used by Iraqi forces, and would continue to resist them.

According to reports from hospitals in Kirkuk Province, 22 pesh merga fighters were killed in fighting on Monday, along with 7 Iraqi soldiers. Eleven Kurdish fighters were wounded, as well as four Iraqi soldiers and 54 civilians.

In a statement Monday afternoon, the American-led coalition played down any skirmishes as accidental. The clashes were precipitated by “a misunderstanding,” the statement said, and were “not deliberate as two elements tried to link up under limited visibility conditions” at night.

Col. Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the coalition in Baghdad, said American forces in the area were watching the situation, but were not involved in the fighting.

“We are monitoring the situation closely and strongly urge all sides to avoid additional escalatory actions,” he said. “We opposed violence from any party, and urge against destabilizing actions that distract from the fight against ISIS and further undermine Iraq’s stability.”

While Washington has called for calm, analysts said the United States was content to sit this one out, still fuming that Mr. Barzani had turned down an American offer to preside over open-ended negotiations with Baghdad if the Kurds called off the vote. Analysts said the United States sat back quietly as Mr. Barzani’s position eroded in the face of retaliation by Baghdad, which first ended international flights to the Kurdish region and then cut a deal with his rivals to take Kirkuk.

By Monday night, the Barzani government had made no public statement on the day’s events.

Officials in Baghdad said the provincial governor, Najmaldin O. Karim, had left Kirkuk for Erbil, the capital of the autonomous region. Mr. Karim could not be reached for comment. He was dismissed by Baghdad earlier this year, but remained in office because Kurdish fighters controlled the city.

Military commanders in Baghdad said their troops had taken control of an industrial district on the western edge of Kirkuk, a power plant and refinery adjacent to the oil fields outside the city and a military airport west of the city.

Iraqi troops also removed a Kurdish flag from a large statue of a pesh merga fighter that Kurdish leaders had erected at the gates to the city. They raised an Iraqi flag in its place, according to local officials, in line with an order from Mr. Abadi for troops to raise the Iraqi flag in all disputed areas reclaimed by government forces.

The big question now is whether forces loyal to Mr. Barzani will fight on or back off.

On Monday, his forces remained dug into positions near oil fields northwest of the city that the Kurds have controlled since 2014.

The commander there, Kamal Karkokly, said in an interview at his command post on Sunday that his fighters would not surrender their positions.

“We have enough weapons,” he said. “We can fight as long as we have to.”

Americans have long struggled with the question of whether this country should be more involved in world affairs, or less. The contest of ideas between internationalists and isolationists has been particularly fierce among Republicans, going all the way back to Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft and continuing on to the beginning of World War II.

But since the end of that war, whatever the differences in their priorities and points of emphasis, every president has chosen engagement rather than retreat, sometimes with surprising and positive outcomes. Richard Nixon forged relations with communist China; Ronald Reagan, having consigned the Soviet Union to “the ash heap of history,” went on to negotiate arms control treaties with Mikhail Gorbachev. Even those like Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama who argued in various ways for scaling back America’s commitments overseas insisted on a leadership role, if not the leadership role, in building an international system grounded in democratic and free-market principles.

There have been plenty of mistakes and unforeseen developments that have tested the United States and raised questions about the wisdom of its policies. But, on the whole, the world has benefited greatly from America’s guidance and its willingness to engage with allies at every step of the way. NATO, the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are all part of the architecture of global security and development that American presidents helped create.

President Trump is now taking a sledgehammer to that system. His argument, if that term can apply to such an inchoate position, is that America for too long has been “losing,” a situation he has set out to correct with nonnegotiable demands and gratuitous confrontations. He promises both to achieve more and to retrench. He promises to put “America first” while at the same time condemning it to a secondary role in global deliberations. It is a bizarre and contradictory policy: In seeking to liberate the United States from international obligations, and in waging war on multilateral institutions, he is not only destroying America’s reputation as a trusted ally but also ceding the future to the very same aggressive powers, especially the authoritarian regimes of China and Russia, that he purports to protect Americans from. Meanwhile, his running feuds with the free press, the courts and Congress are diminishing America’s standing as a bastion of constitutional liberties.

Women directed traffic on main city streets and took tickets in the subway in prim blue suits (the color varied with the job), short white socks and sensible chunky pumps. Those waiting on tables in restaurants were more apt to wear matching dresses like black and orange sheaths, while silk factory workers toiled away in shapeless housedresses and aprons, with kerchiefs on their heads; day care workers wore white dresses and accordion hats à la Western nurses of yore.

After baking, the sharpness released from the grapes had suffused everything with an irresistible contrast of tart and richness.

“This is where it happened,” my Russian guide declared. It was 1979 and I was a graduate student in Moscow for the summer. A side trip to Leningrad was a must for me, a first time traveler to the country. “Czar Alexander II was riding down this road when the assassins struck,” she said. Almost under her breath, she added, “He was a reformer.” Any hope for the liberalization of Russia seemed to die with the czar who had freed the serfs and attempted to modernize the country. Alexander II’s death brought to power his hard-line successor Alexander III, who initiated a harsh crackdown (among those soon executed was the older brother of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin). This would only sharpen the conflict in the country. Peasants had no bread. Workers’ lives were miserable and often endangered. And soldiers were forced into battle in the Great War, a fight they could not win. Alexander III’s son and successor, the hapless Nicholas II, would abdicate in 1917. The parliamentary government of Alexander Kerensky would survive less than a year.

From the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood it was just a short walk across the square to the Winter Palace, where workers’ militias seized power and laid the foundation for the Bolshevik Revolution and more than seven decades of Communist rule. “Peace, Land and Bread,” they promised.

“Ten Days That Shook the World” captures the excitement of that moment. The author, John Reed, was an American who made no secret of his Bolshevik sympathies. He nevertheless provided a riveting and vivid — if not impartial — account of the most pivotal phase of the revolution, as viewed from the ground.

From his vantage point, Reed could only tell a part of the story, however. To fully understand the Bolshevik Revolution, one must also appreciate the long trajectory of Russian history. Two other seminal works, James Billington’s “The Icon and the Axe” and Sheila Fitzpatrick’s “The Russian Revolution,” stand alongside “Ten Days” as indispensable guides to these events.

“The Icon and the Axe” is a sweeping, intricate description of Russian cultural history, spanning the pre-Romanov era through six centuries to the reign of Joseph Stalin. Flowing with ease through time and topic — from art to music, literature, philosophy, mythology and more — the book provides readers with an alluring portrayal of Russia’s proud heritage. Its impressive scope and lasting insights have made it a foundational text in Russian studies.

Adams, however, didn’t frame it that way: “I can’t blame anything other than I did not do my best at that point.
“I feel partially responsible for the tone that’s on set,” Adams said.
Adams speaks up when she wants, how she wants, and she is saying yes — and no — on her own terms.
These days, instead of telling her daughter “Don’t be bossy,” Adams asks her little girl who she is the boss of.","A pointillist, she creates pinpricks of emotion, but can easily go bigger than life, as she did to play Sydney, a con artist in the lollapalooza “American Hustle” (2013), a loose take on the Abscam scandal of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Slipping in and out of accents as well as plunging necklines, Adams — a virtuoso of complicated, seemingly contradictory moods — takes this shiny, flashy character and turns her into the most electric person in the movie. Adams studied acting for years and can cry at the drop of a dime, as she’s proved on more than one talk show. She has learned how to play the celebrity game: She knows how to chat up Jimmy Fallon, smile on the red carpet and keep cool when the paparazzi pounce. Significantly, she doesn’t give the gossip websites much material, even if she made a guest appearance in them this summer. “Fans freak that she’s pregnant after she wears flowy sundress,” one item exclaimed (erroneously). Adams seemed amused by the speculation. Stardom for women involves constant surveillance; shaking off these intrusions is crucial to maintaining and defending a private self.

A PARADOX OF stardom is that it depends on the appearance of an ordinary life. Some of this is about relatability, but it’s also about how actors fill performances up with their own humanity. In person, Adams seems nice, thoughtful, a touch vulnerable, which is how she sometimes appears on camera. (Big eyes help.) She also conveys appealing resilience. When she arrived for our interview she wasn’t accompanied by anxious handlers; when she left, she drove herself. She seems of our earth, not one of those exotic creatures whose celebrity becomes so otherworldly that it edges into camp. Yet like all stars, this palpable humanity comes with an ineluctable facility for both holding the screen and your attention. Adams seemed reluctant to see this in herself. When I mentioned Charlize Theron in passing, she lit up. “She can just sit on the couch, and you’re like, ‘That! That thing, what is it?’ That’s not me.”

I insisted that Adams was wrong, because while her appeal is different from Theron’s — Adams draws you to her, Theron keeps you at a distance — each makes you want to watch her and only her for as long as she’s on screen. Adams waved off the compliment. In someone else this might have read as false modesty, but she came across as someone who knows better than to trust other people’s admiration. It’s skepticism that feels grounded in experience. Adams found a manager soon after moving to Los Angeles in 1999 from Minnesota, where she had been working in dinner theater and dancing in regional musicals like “Brigadoon.” She was 24, with one movie credit (the 1999 beauty pageant satire “Drop Dead Gorgeous”), but she was also just another pretty young hopeful on a very crowded assembly line.

“I would go into auditions and it would be me and three model versions of me,” she said, “and I would never get the job.” It was the era of “Dawson’s Creek” and Katie Holmes. Adams did a lot of television (“I guest-starred on every WB show that was ever made”), but stripping down to a bikini to win a part wasn’t working for her. “I always thought it’s an ‘it’ factor and I just don’t have ‘it,’ ” she said. She credited her manager with helping her overcome self-doubt. “You get to decide what you want to be,” Adams recalled her manager telling her. “You get to decide that, Amy.”

She was still figuring it out when she landed the delectable role of an early 1960s candy striper in Steven Spielberg’s “Catch Me if You Can,” a 2002 biographical caper starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the con artist Frank Abagnale Jr. As Brenda, Adams weeps through much of her first scene with DiCaprio, her eyes red and watery, a hand hovering over her mouth as her character tries to hide her metal braces. DiCaprio is playing the seducer, and Adams is a stand-in for us, the soon-to-be seduced. Later, after Brenda’s braces come off and she clambers into Frank’s lap, Adams complicates the character’s innocence with heat, letting you see the clumsy girl and desiring woman at once.

Critics singled out Adams’s performance, but she was a supporting player in a Leonardo DiCaprio vehicle and, as she put it, the girl in braces: “It’s not like I had a beautiful gown with him walking down the steps of the Titanic.” The role brought her different kinds of auditions, but it was more a break than a breakthrough. When a writer friend pitched Adams to a studio for another project, the limits of Spielberg’s largess became conspicuous. The studio’s response, as Adams described it to me, was: “Oh, the homely girl from ‘Catch Me if You Can.’ ” That’s preposterous and offensive, and typical of the industry’s sexism. Adams, however, didn’t frame it that way: “I can’t blame anything other than I did not do my best at that point. I don’t think I inspired confidence.”

Confidence is a thread that wends through many stories about successful women who need to overcome not only their own insecurities but also a world that greets female achievement with ambivalence at best. When we spoke, Adams largely narrated her history in personal terms, but it was clear that the industry played its part. “I was getting ready to turn 30,” she said of the period that followed “Catch Me if You Can.” “I was tired of being unhappy and tired of chasing something that might not belong to me, like a career in film and television.” She was ready to let go of what she thought “being an actress was, or this idea of being a movie star, this idea of being ‘it,’ of being The Girl.” She was thinking of moving to New York to focus on her craft and start over. And then “Junebug” happened.

Adams’s role as a pregnant innocent, Ashley, in this little-seen 2005 independent movie was part of what became a slow-moving career trifecta. If “Catch Me if You Can” indicated that she was a fresh talent, “Junebug” suggested the richness of her range, showing her gift for moving from emotional lightness to darkness and back again. With crystalline sensitivity, Adams makes you care deeply about Ashley, whose virtue carries great narrative weight; even for those who didn’t respond to “Junebug” and its contrived hokum, the performance was a reminder of how a single actor can nearly redeem a movie. (It led to her first Oscar nomination.) Adams’s next leap forward came with the Disney hit “Enchanted,” which depends entirely on her to transform a high concept — a cartoon princess becomes human — into a delightful fairy story. Adams, who studied dance, sweeps into the movie with grace, tremulous feeling and fluttering hands, delivering an extraordinary performance that established that she had arrived at last.

SINCE THEN THERE have been juicier roles and steady acclaim and, of course, more Oscar nominations. In 2015, Adams married her longtime boyfriend, Darren Le Gallo, an artist she met in acting class, with whom she has a daughter, Aviana, named after Aviano, the Italian city where Adams, a military brat, was born. (Adams is one of seven children in a family that was Mormon until her parents’ divorce.) Having Aviana led Adams to again rethink her relationship to work. “I had to learn how to shut the door when I walk off the set. It’s hard and it doesn’t always work, but more often than not it does now,” she says. Long hours and location shoots can be tough on families, but having a husband who is willing to pack up with Adams helps. “We’ve realized we can be happy in an apartment in Detroit or a house in Hollywood or a hotel room,” she said. “It’s a good feeling, but I’m protective of it — very protective.”

It can be tricky shutting that door on a project like “Sharp Objects,” where she plays a reporter chasing a grisly story and where, for the first time, she has an executive producer credit. “What was exciting for me was being part of the creative development,” Adams said, “getting to feel comfortable speaking, feeling like that was my role now. Like, oh wait, I have an opinion and I’m going to share it!” She enjoyed it, but is unsure how much more producing she wants to do. “I can multitask,” she said, “it’s just an intense experience. And especially when you’re working every day of production, all day every day, in a dark character, and then trying to manage the other stuff — for me it was challenging.”

Those challenges extended to the set, including one day when, for a tricky single take, she had to crawl on a bathroom floor while weeping and drinking fake vomit she then had to spit up. As she was crawling and weeping and vomiting, a male crew member kept whispering the location of a prop until she finally barked, “I’ve got it, I’ve got it!” She apologized, explaining that she’d been staying in character. “He was trying to be helpful,” she told me. It’s the kind of response that I’d expected from Adams — but I had misunderstood her. I thought she was illustrating how she had gone to a psychologically dark place, but the point was that she knew she was right to call this man out. “I feel partially responsible for the tone that’s on set,” Adams said. “I’m sorry for how he felt, but I knew why I was doing that.”

Adams was standing up for herself, which is what we demand of women. What we sometimes forget, however, is that not every woman is going to speak up on her own behalf — or for other women — in exactly the same way or necessarily as a political declaration, and that she shouldn’t have to, either. What happened after Sony Pictures Entertainment was hacked in 2014 offers a good feminist case in point. Among all the ugly, embarrassing information that the hack revealed was that both Adams and Jennifer Lawrence had been paid less than their male co-stars in “American Hustle.” Lawrence went public with her feelings about the wage gap and was by turns praised and condemned for doing so. Adams said she was proud of Lawrence but made it repeatedly clear she didn’t want to discuss it in detail, if at all.

“I don’t want to talk about my own experience because I fight my own fight and I feel comfortable doing that,” Adams said when I mentioned the hack. And, as she admitted, “There’s not a lot of empathy out there for celebrities.” But the disparity that the Sony hack revealed made her curious. Years earlier, to prepare for some of her period movies, she had started reading books like “The Feminine Mystique.” (“I didn’t go to college. I didn’t do women’s studies. I had no idea.”) After the hack, she dug in again. “I spent a lot more time educating myself about what women executives get paid.” She read about C.E.O.s and teachers, the sociology and cultural conditioning.

“It’s important to talk about inequality,” Adams said. “But for me, where I feel most empowered is in educating myself and being, hopefully, a mentor for younger women. That’s more important. I offer any young actress I work with my phone number. I’ll tell them on set, ‘You don’t have to do that. You can say no.’ ” It seems like a modest gesture, but less so when you consider that the movie industry has long profited from female submission, from women acquiescing because their only choice is exploitation or unemployment. This is what makes women saying no powerful, and why it’s heartening that many are speaking up. Adams speaks up when she wants, how she wants, and she is saying yes — and no — on her own terms. These days, instead of telling her daughter “Don’t be bossy,” Adams asks her little girl who she is the boss of. “And she says, ‘Me.’ And I say, ‘That’s right. And you get to choose who you are.’ ”",The Versatile and Resilient Amy Adams,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/t-magazine/amy-adams.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

At eight weeks old, they are two feet from nose to tail and must weigh seven or eight pounds. They growl and snap over possession of a much-chewed piece of deer skin. They lick my face like I’m a long-lost friend, or a newfound toy. They are just like dogs, but not quite. They are wolves.

When they are full-grown at around 100 pounds, their jaws will be strong enough to crack moose bones. But because these wolves have been around humans since they were blind, deaf and unable to stand, they will still allow people to be near them, to do veterinary exams, to scratch them behind the ears — if all goes well.

Yet even the humans who raised them must take precautions. If one of the people who has bottle-fed and mothered the wolves practically since birth is injured or feels sick, she won’t enter their pen to prevent a predatory reaction. No one will run to make one of these wolves chase him for fun. No one will pretend to chase the wolf. Every experienced wolf caretaker will stay alert. Because if there’s one thing all wolf and dog specialists I’ve talked to over the years agree on, it is this: No matter how you raise a wolf, you can’t turn it into a dog.

Say this for Donald Trump: When it comes to sex, he’s less of a hypocrite than Harvey Weinstein. Until Weinstein’s abrupt downfall amid proliferating accusations of sexual assault and harassment, he posed as a backer of women’s rights. He made films with substantive female leads (82-year-old Judi Dench joked that she’d tattooed his name on her butt in gratitude), donated money to politicians supporting feminist policies and contributed to endow a chair at Rutgers University honoring Gloria Steinem. He even attended the Women’s March at Sundance. Yet privately, he appears to have been a sexist ogre, using his power to exploit and humiliate women. After the truth about his conduct was widely revealed, he was cast out of his professional community and rendered a pariah.

Trump is more consistent. He is a pig in public as well as behind closed doors. In 1992, New York Magazine reported that he said the best way to deal with women is to treat them like excrement, though he used a more vulgar term. He has followed his own advice. His first wife, Ivana Trump, accused him of raping her in a fit of rage. (She later denied that the events she’d recounted were rape “in a literal or criminal sense,” but stuck to the underlying story.) Trump reportedly pressured his second wife, Marla Maples, to pose for Playboy. He owned beauty pageants and, by his own admission, would barge into changing rooms to ogle the naked contestants. The makeup artist Jill Harth said that he tried to rape her. Multiple women have accused him of groping and sexual harassment. Those charges appear credible in light of the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape in which Trump boasted of grabbing women by their genitals. After the truth about his conduct was widely revealed, he was elected president of the United States.

Somehow, in the wake of the Weinstein revelations, the president’s supporters appear to believe they hold the moral high ground. Donald Trump Jr. — a man who once said that women who can’t handle workplace sexual harassment “should go maybe teach kindergarten” — has been tweeting about Weinstein incessantly. Appearing on CNN, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, Ronna Romney McDaniel, attacked Democrats for taking Weinstein’s money, insisting that there’s no comparison between Weinstein and Trump because the president “didn’t have eight settlements.” (According to an exhaustive investigation by USA Today, at least 20 lawsuits have accused Trump and managers at his companies of “discriminating against women, ignoring sexual harassment complaints and even participating in the harassment themselves.”)

On Fox News, a network that Roger Ailes ran like his personal sadomasochistic brothel, Tucker Carlson feigned outrage at the Weinstein news. “Many powerful people knew what Harvey Weinstein was doing, and not only ignored his crimes, but actively took his side against his many victims,” Carlson said. (Fox News is currently under federal investigation, in part for payoffs made to Ailes’s victims.)

Bad faith on the right does not mitigate the deep, perverse cruelty of Weinstein’s alleged crimes. If anything, it makes the fallout more painful. For the past 11 months, many feminists have been reeling from the defeat of the first female major-party presidential candidate by a predatory misogynist. The confirmation that a hugely powerful man who is supposed to be on our side is just as bad as Trump is shattering. While many women are showing defiance — outing the Weinstein types in their industries, using hashtags like #MeToo to demonstrate the ubiquity of abuse — it’s hard not to feel crushed wondering how many men really see us as full human beings.","Save the Phony Weinstein Outrage, Republicans",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/opinion/columnists/weinstein-sexual-harassment-republicans.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“The judge story is an untold story; nobody wants to talk about it,” an enthusiastic Mr. Trump said during his impromptu appearance with Mr. McConnell. “But when you think about it, Mitch and I were saying, that has consequences 40 years out, depending on the age of the judge — but 40 years out.”

With some conservatives — notably Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist — calling for his head, Mr. McConnell has put new emphasis on his role in winning Senate approval of Trump administration officials and judicial nominees. It is one way to try to mollify some conservatives angered by the inability of the Republican-controlled Congress to deliver.

Mr. McConnell renewed that pitch Monday, reminding Americans that one of the Senate’s major responsibilities is what he called “the personnel business” — handling up to 1,200 executive branch nominations.

Standing alongside the president, he also took the opportunity to remind Mr. Trump that “the single most significant thing this president has done to change America is the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.” Mr. McConnell didn’t need to say that it was his own decision in 2016 to refuse to consider President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick B. Garland for the vacancy caused by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia that held the seat open for Mr. Trump to fill.

“But it’s not just the Supreme Court,” Mr. McConnell said. “There are a lot of vacancies at both the circuit court and district court level.”

At the moment, there about 150 openings on the federal bench – 21 at the influential appeals court level – with 50 nominations pending. Some of those vacancies are because of the refusal by Republicans to act on Obama nominations in the last two years of his administration or their failure to return blue slips when Democrats still held the Senate.

“Many, many are in the pipeline,” Mr. Trump said of his nominees, promising that “we will set records in terms of the number of judges.”

Given the abundance of opportunities, Mr. McConnell reiterated his view that a refusal by Democrats to sign off on home-state nominees should not be allowed to blackball appeals court nominees. He said if that was the case, individual Democrats would have say-so over more than 60 percent of the appeals court candidates.

“That’s simply not a tenable place to land in a Senate that now deals with judges with a simple majority,” Mr. McConnell said.

Mr. Trump was not inclined to get into the arcana of the blue slip process. “My attitude is I just want really capable people going to the courts,” the president said.

Besides blue slips, the other remaining impediment to a flurry of judicial confirmations is time – Senate floor time that is. Though Democrats can no longer block nominees by requiring Republicans to assemble a supermajority of 60 votes, they can require Republicans to follow a procedure that can take more than three days for each individual nominee. And if Democrats conclude Republicans are jamming through judicial nominees, they will no doubt drag their feet as they did earlier this year on executive branch candidates.

To step up the pace of confirmations, Mr. McConnell would probably need to keep the Senate in session for longer durations than the current Monday evening through Thursday afternoon schedule. That change could irritate some lawmakers but conservatives have been pressuring Mr. McConnell to extend the Senate workweek.

Some hard-line conservatives taking aim at Mr. McConnell were not won over by his Rose Garden bonding moment with Mr. Trump.

“Mitch McConnell’s bellyaching about all the time it takes to approve presidential personnel doesn’t hold any water when 1) every other Senate before his has managed to do this in a timely manner, and 2) his Senate works an average of 2.5 days per week,” David Bozell, president of ForAmerica, said in a statement calling for Mr. McConnell to step aside.

Still, Mr. McConnell and the president are both hoping that a parade of conservatives taking up lifetime appointments on the federal bench will make restless Republicans forget — at least for a while — their disappointment in both the Trump administration and their congressional leadership.",Trump and McConnell See a Way to Make Conservatives Happy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/us/politics/trump-mcconnell-judicial-nominees.html

Just as striking was the way his prose is littered with people and places that seem a long way from anywhere but are actually at the center of everything.

Barely 72 hours after the Bolsheviks had seized power, for example, and just as the civil war that would divide Russia for the next half decade began to crystallize, Reed devotes several paragraphs to an ill-tempered conversation between an uneducated member of the Red Guards and a supercilious counterrevolutionary student, which took place by the door of a provincial railway station.

The pair were arguing about the proletariat and the bourgeoisie; beyond them, rival armies and ideas were on the march. In any other context, the soldier would have deferred to the student, his class superior. But the old orthodoxy was crumbling, and Reed shows both men navigating the social terrain of something unknown, something new.

In Egypt, too, the real story of unrest lay not in Hosni Mubarak’s presidential palace but in the mundane spaces where norms were shifting: in the tuk-tuks, previously confined to the informal settlements on the margins of the capital, which now honked their way defiantly into the city center; in the schoolchildren re-enacting battles against the security forces on their playground; in the low-level insurgencies waged in family dining rooms, college lecture halls and factory floors across the country.

Trotsky would later write of 1917 that the history of revolution is “first of all a history of the forcible entrance of the masses into the realm of rulership over their own destiny.” Reed understood this not as an academic treatise in which the masses remain faceless but as a practical reality, one that locates the essence of revolution as much in the erratic widening of individual imaginations as it does in the corridors of formal power or in the machinations of competing leaders.

Rereading “Ten Days That Shook the World” today, it is not the near-verbatim accounts of interminable, overlapping Soviet committee meetings that stand out, nor the alphabet soup of long-forgotten organizational acronyms that requires a 10-page glossary. It is not even the grand showpieces that Reed witnessed and relates in his work, like the raucous smoke-filled meetings at Lenin’s Smolny headquarters where insurrection was hatched, or the mammoth funeral processions for the martyrs of Moscow after the city was won. Rather it is the description of a well-to-do young woman’s hysterics after she is addressed as “comrade” by a streetcar conductor. It is the scene where an old workman pilots an auto-truck back toward the capital after the revolution is victorious, sweeping his arm across the urban haze: “ ‘Mine!’ he cried, his face all alight. ‘All mine now! My Petrograd!’ ” It is all the times when Reed trains his gaze on the irrefutably human micro-dramas that are inevitable, and epic, when history is sloping; the times when he homes in on the struggles that take place when every person, with their own varying level of investment in yesterday, tries, tentatively, to find a foothold in tomorrow.

Revolutions are by their nature make-do affairs with few maps to guide either participants or observers. When people are making and doing something radically transformative, and transforming themselves in the process, it’s impossible to interrogate what’s happening if you’re relying solely on the templates that came before. Reed appreciated this. Rather than fighting unknowability, he embraced it. He opens the main body of his book by recounting the bafflement of a visiting sociology professor who is informed that revolutionary sentiment is both rising and on the wane. “The professor was puzzled,” Reed notes, “but he need not have been; both observations were correct.”

Reed is not afraid to convey the contradictions of revolution — its tangle of the tumultuous and the prosaic, its clouds of misinformation and obscurity. He describes the trundling of armored vehicles in the streets, the voices in the darkness, the fear and reckless daring from which the new Russia was born. He captures, just as I tried to in Egypt, that curious feature of rapid political change whereby the furniture and accessories of the previous system remain dotted about the landscape, suddenly shorn of their power, both unaltered and simultaneously absurd. He probes the language of elites as they scrabble to keep up with events: One tycoon tells him that revolution is a sickness and that intervention is necessary to prevent it, just as “one would intervene to cure a sick child” — a foreshadowing of the infantilizing rhetoric adopted by successive Egyptian leaders. “The air was full of confused sound,” Reed reports, in a passage that could have been lifted straight out of Cairo during its own uprising. “The city stirred uneasily, wakeful.”

Across time, place and context, revolutions occur when a whiff of possibility appears, a broadening of horizons, tangible evidence that the status quo is not immutable. Wherever we are, we are all capable of picking up that scent. Of course, the full history of Russia’s revolution contains great shafts of darkness as well as light. In Egypt, too, albeit under very different circumstances, the utopianism of 2011 has given way to suffocation and violence, as a new iteration of military despots attempt to expunge collective memories of that brief moment when the ability to shape the world around oneself had fallen into collective hands. Far from invalidating the sort of reporting Reed helped pioneer, though, the fragility of such moments reinforces its worth. It is through the act of storytelling that revolution itself becomes possible.

“Ten Days That Shook the World” lives on, not because Reed got everything right (he didn’t) or because the revolution he covered was an uncomplicated success story (it was anything but), but because he understood the real force of revolutionary journalism: its potential to rouse all who engage with it — not least the reporters themselves.",The Journalist and the Revolution,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/opinion/john-reed-russian-revolution-journalism.html

In nontheme news, I have to say that the long Downs made me smile. I loved SHOT TO HELL for its unexpectedness, and “FROST/NIXON” is a nice, Scrabbly entry to write into the grid.

Tricky Clues

49A: “Strands in a cell?” looks like it refers either to the microscopic type of cell or a jail cell, although strands in a jail cell doesn’t make much sense. The answer refers to microscopic cells and the strands of genetic material within. If you are not sure whether the answer is RNA or DNA, fill in the “NA” and work that first crossing. 40D is AUDI, so the answer is DNA. See? You don’t have to be a scientist to do the crossword.

59D: I thought this one might bring out some of my fellow vegetable gardeners, because I’m sure I’m not the only one who believed that yams were tubers, not ROOTs. Apparently, “all tubers are root crops, but not all root crops are tubers,” and there are many ways to distinguish the part of a plant that grows underground. The main point you should take away from all this is that they’re good for you and you should eat your vegetables.

Constructor Notes

This idea for this theme came from thinking about Schrödinger puzzles, and wondering if I could potentially create one so that entries that contain more than one distinct stand-alone letter, for example, VITAMIN which can be followed by A, B, C, D, E, or K, intersect another such entry. Ideally, the shared possible letters for each pair of theme entries would be some combination of A, B, C and D, so that the revealer MULTIPLE CHOICE could be used. This didn’t end up panning out, but it did lead me, through a somewhat stream-of-consciousness manner of contemplating crossword themes, to come up with the one you see here. The first version of this puzzle had the theme entries VITAMINS, MUSICAL NOTES, CHEMICAL SYMBOLS, GREEK LETTERS and ALPHABET, and was rejected on the basis that ALPHABET was too obvious, and GREEK LETTERS was inconsistent. It was tough to find a new set of symmetrical theme entries, but I’m pleased with the current set. In each case, the category contains other members besides the ones that are composed of a single letter, and the letters are the members of the category themselves rather than being abbreviations, unlike something such as L M S for SHIRT SIZES. I spent a decent amount of time trying to remove the black square between TILE and GREEK and its symmetrical partner to allow for two pairs of long parallel downs, but I didn’t like the compromises on the fill, so I decided to stick to 78 words. Given that this ended up as a Monday (I had expected it to be a Tuesday) and the importance of smooth fill for Monday puzzles, I stand by this decision, and though there aren’t a ton of bonuses here, I’m fond of SHOT TO HELL and some of the mid-length fill like U.S. NEWS and HANSEL (he’s so hot right now). I don’t have a lot to say as far as the clues go, but a few of mine I’m glad to see survive the edit are 49-Across, 9-Down, 31-Down and 56-Down. Though I’m not sure it will be particularly applicable to this puzzle, I like the inside nod in the clue that Will and Joel came up with for AHA. In any case it’s great to be back, and I hope (fingers crossed) that my puzzle will be a pleasant start to everyone’s week.

Ms. Shroff, the defense lawyer, told jurors that Mr. Rahimi had a change of heart after hearing the explosion from his first bomb, and disarmed the second device.","In a statement, Mayor Bill de Blasio lauded the verdict, too. “The Chelsea bombing was an attempt to bring our city to its knees,” he said. “Instead, our N.Y.P.D., F.B.I. and federal prosecutors have brought Ahmad Rahimi to justice.”

Mr. Rahimi was charged with eight counts of transporting and setting explosives in New York for use as weapons of mass destruction. He was found guilty of all eight.

The conviction carries a mandatory life sentence; Judge Richard M. Berman set a sentencing date for Jan. 18. Mr. Rahimi’s lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, who said her office planned to appeal, delivered an unconventional closing argument to jurors on Friday, insisting on her client’s innocence in only one of the two bombs placed in Chelsea that night.

Jurors rejected that argument. After the verdict, one juror said that the evidence was “very overwhelming” and left no doubt of Mr. Rahimi’s guilt. Jurors were in agreement on most of the counts early in their four hours of deliberations, said the juror, who asked that his name be withheld because of the nature of the case.

Dozens of F.B.I. agents, police bomb-squad detectives, computer analysts and technicians presented evidence over eight days of trial testimony. They had sorted through a blocklong field of debris on West 23rd Street and feeds from dozens of video cameras in the days after the Sept. 17, 2016, explosion, searching for clues and glimpses of a suspect who made no effort to hide himself that night.

Jurors also heard from those wounded by shrapnel from a bomb specifically designed to maim people. That no one was killed was a remarkable stroke of good fortune when the magnitude of the explosion became clearer. It blew out windows and doors and left debris on the rooftops of buildings. It threw a heavy trash bin across a street six lanes wide; the mangled metal container was rolled out for inspection by jurors hearing the trial.

Mr. Rahimi carried multiple bombs — nine in all — but most did not explode. The first was set early that morning in a garbage can at the finish line of a United States Marine Corps charity race in Seaside Park, N.J. The race’s start time was delayed, however, by an unexpectedly high turnout, and no one was hurt when the bomb exploded. That night, the blast occurred in Chelsea. A short time later, passers-by found a bomb on West 27th Street, which was disarmed by the police bomb squad.

The next day, Mr. Rahimi returned to New Jersey, leaving six pipe bombs in a backpack at an Elizabeth, N.J., train station. They carried fuses, not timers, and while they were not set to explode, they were dangerous; bomb-squad officers unintentionally detonated one later with a robot.

Mr. Rahimi was identified by his fingerprints and DNA on the unexploded devices and debris from the bombs. Video from cameras along the length of his journey from Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, where he arrived from New Jersey that Saturday evening with his bombs, to West 23rd and West 27th Streets, were played for jurors over several days. Unhurried, his face without expression, Mr. Rahimi walked along the city’s sidewalks, pulling a rolling suitcase with each hand. He left one on West 23rd, the other on West 27th.

The first exploded at about 8:30 p.m. Camera after camera on the block showed smiling pedestrians, until a white blast of light filled the air. On the videos, the same pedestrians fled, their hands over their ears.

Later that night, on 27th Street, two men saw a suitcase on the sidewalk. One bent to open it, removing an object wrapped in a plastic bag — it was a pressure cooker packed with shrapnel and attached to a cellphone detonator. They took the empty suitcase. A neighbor passed, noticed the device and, rattled by the nearby explosion, called the police.

Ms. Shroff, the defense lawyer, told jurors that Mr. Rahimi had a change of heart after hearing the explosion from his first bomb, and disarmed the second device. The jury’s foreman, who, like the other juror, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the nature of the case, said the group did not buy that theory.

“We were ultimately convinced the 27th Street device was in fact set, and while it did not go off, that was not a compelling reason to give us doubt as to the intent of the device,” he said.

The foreman, from Manhattan, said the trial was a personal reminder of everyday risks. “It’s hard to be a New Yorker who is not always looking around,” he said.",Chelsea Bomb Suspect Guilty in Attack That Sowed Terror Across Region,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/nyregion/chelsea-bombing-verdict.html

But while he struck out at least 100 hitters for the fourth consecutive season, Betances also issued 44 walks in 59 ⅔ innings.
Betances pitched well in the division opener against Cleveland, then followed four other relievers to the mound in Game 2.
“In the playoffs, you’re going to rely on the arms that have been hotter.”On the mound, Betances is not throwing pitches to the backstop.","In each of his last two games, he has walked two batters — threatening what had been a comfortable lead — and given way to Tommy Kahnle. He has left to boos from the home crowd. He knows Kahnle should have had Monday off, and closer Aroldis Chapman should never have had to warm up. He feels bad about that.

“I can’t keep putting my teammates in those situations,” Betances said. “My job is to have a clean inning, get those guys out. Next thing you know, Kahnle has to clean up my mess like last time, and now Chapman’s warming up. That’s what upsets me the most. Obviously, I’m better than that. I know I’m better than that.”

It is obvious, painfully obvious, that he is so much better than this. Betances has made the All-Star team in each of the last four seasons. The only other pitchers who have done that are Clayton Kershaw, Chris Sale and Max Scherzer. That is the company he keeps.

But while he struck out at least 100 hitters for the fourth consecutive season, Betances also issued 44 walks in 59 ⅔ innings. That comes to 6.64 walks per nine — the highest figure in the majors for any pitcher in the last five seasons (minimum 50 innings).

Just when Betances seemed to be coming around at the end of the regular season — with three scoreless, hitless, no-walk innings from Sept. 24 through 27 — Manager Joe Girardi pulled him on Sept. 29 after a single and a walk to start the ninth inning against Toronto, with a four-run lead.

Betances pitched well in the division opener against Cleveland, then followed four other relievers to the mound in Game 2. He retired the Indians in order in the 11th and 12th innings, but allowed a walk, a stolen base and a single to lose the game in the 13th. Since then: four batters, four walks.

“He’s out of whack,” Girardi conceded after Monday’s win narrowed the Astros’ lead in the American League Championship Series to two games to one. “He went through it a couple of times this year, and we’ve seemingly been able to get him on track a number of different times. And we’re still trying to do that, because I still think he’s really important to us and we need him.”

Betances — who said he was fully healthy — credited Girardi for giving him chances to work through his problems. He said he understood the jeers from the fans. He plans to watch video, but thinks he has identified a persistent mechanical flaw.

“I kind of feel like I’m just yanking everything, pulling my front side a lot,” Betances said. “I feel like my timing is off right now. That’s what’s causing the walks — my timing’s off. Consistency-wise, I just haven’t been as sharp as I want to be.”

He said he had corrected the same problem before, and naturally, his teammates said they believed he could do it again.

“I don’t worry about him at all,” reliever David Robertson said. “I’ve seen what he can do; I’ve seen how many people he strikes out. I mean, he’s throwing 100 and still throwing his breaking ball 85, he just ain’t throwing it right where he wants it. That’s the only difference. He’s still got electric stuff.”

Kahnle, who has fired eight shutout innings with one hit this postseason, said loss of control was simply a job hazard.

“We all go through ups and downs,” Kahnle said. “It could be a confidence thing. I don’t really know; I don’t talk to him too much about it. But I know I’ve gone through the same thing. It’s tough, but I’m very confident he’ll get out of it.”

Girardi cannot afford to hold onto that faith. The Yankees’ July trade with the Chicago White Sox for Robertson and Kahnle — and Todd Frazier, who homered in Game 3 — has taken on even more importance now, providing Girardi reliable options instead of Betances.

Betances understands that, too.

“It’s just a matter of me getting more work, but it’s hard, obviously, now,” he said. “In the playoffs, you’re going to rely on the arms that have been hotter.”

On the mound, Betances is not throwing pitches to the backstop. Off the mound, he is not retreating from public view. Those are encouraging signs. In his searing memoir with Tim Brown this year, Ankiel — who eventually made a comeback as an outfielder — recalled the agony of dealing with the so-called yips, the inner torment of battling the monster that swallowed up his psyche with no warning.

“I closed my eyes and put myself on that mound in St. Louis, testing myself, and the crowd rose, and the moment arrived, and I was terrified,” Ankiel wrote, describing the prospect of pitching again after the 2000 postseason. “In my backyard, facing a wall, alone, the anxiety was bigger than I was. The ball was heavy. The air stuck in my throat. Spring training report day was out there, bearing down on me, and I didn’t want to go. I couldn’t. Not like this.”

That kind of affliction, which also ruined the career of Steve Blass and others, sounds like absolute torture. It does not seem like that with Betances. He seems more like a frustrated, slumping star whose height — 6 foot 8 — makes for complicated mechanics. He could probably benefit from a winter break or a breakthrough on the mound, if the right setting arises again.

Nobody knows for sure what comes next, though, perhaps not even Betances. But he insisted he would recover.

“I’ve got a good supporting cast at home, good supporting cast here with my teammates,” Betances said. “The good thing in these bad games for me is we’re winning. For me, I’m a team guy, and I’m doing the best I can when I’m out there to cheer the guys on, and even when I leave the mess out there, I’m cheering for Kahnle and whoever’s behind me to do their job.

“In the midst of all of this, I’m keeping my head high. I’m going to continue to work hard. I know I’ve had a lot of success in this game and I know I can get back and be the pitcher I know I can be.”

Given the alternative, we all should hope for the best.","Yankees Solve the Astros, but Can’t Crack the Mystery of Betances",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/sports/yankees-betances-girardi-astros.html

It was the first of many medications that Jake, who asked that his last name not be used, would try over the next year. But none seemed to work — and some made a bad situation worse. An increase in dosage made Jake “much more excited, acting strangely and almost manic,” his father wrote in a journal in the fall of 2015. A few weeks later, Jake locked himself in a bathroom at home and tried to drown himself in the bathtub.

He was hospitalized for four days, but soon after he returned home, he started hiding out in his room again. He cried, slept, argued with his parents about going to school and mindlessly surfed the internet on his phone. The more school he missed, the more anxious he felt about missing school. And the more anxious he felt, the more hopeless and depressed he became. He had long wanted to go to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but now that felt like wishful thinking.

Not every day was bad. During spring break in 2016, Jake’s father wrote: “Jake was relaxed and his old sarcastic, personable, witty self.” A week later, though, Jake couldn’t get through a school day without texting his mother to pick him up or hiding out in the nurse’s office. At home, Jake threatened suicide again. His younger siblings were terrified. “It was the depth of hell,” his mother told me.

That summer, after two more hospitalizations, Jake’s desperate parents sent him to Mountain Valley in New Hampshire, a residential treatment facility and one of a growing number of programs for acutely anxious teenagers. Over the last decade, anxiety has overtaken depression as the most common reason college students seek counseling services. In its annual survey of students, the American College Health Association found a significant increase — to 62 percent in 2016 from 50 percent in 2011 — of undergraduates reporting “overwhelming anxiety” in the previous year. Surveys that look at symptoms related to anxiety are also telling. In 1985, the Higher Education Research Institute at U.C.L.A. began asking incoming college freshmen if they “felt overwhelmed by all I had to do” during the previous year. In 1985, 18 percent said they did. By 2010, that number had increased to 29 percent. Last year, it surged to 41 percent.

Those numbers — combined with a doubling of hospital admissions for suicidal teenagers over the last 10 years, with the highest rates occurring soon after they return to school each fall — come as little surprise to high school administrators across the country, who increasingly report a glut of anxious, overwhelmed students. While it’s difficult to tease apart how much of the apparent spike in anxiety is related to an increase in awareness and diagnosis of the disorder, many of those who work with young people suspect that what they’re seeing can’t easily be explained away. “We’ve always had kids who didn’t want to come in the door or who were worried about things,” says Laurie Farkas, who was until recently director of student services for the Northampton public schools in Massachusetts. “But there’s just been a steady increase of severely anxious students.”

For the teenagers who arrive at Mountain Valley, a nonprofit program that costs $910 a day and offers some need-based assistance, the center is usually a last resort after conventional therapy and medications fail. The young people I met there suffered from a range of anxiety disorders, including social anxiety, separation anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. (Though OCD and PTSD are considered anxiety disorders at Mountain Valley and other treatment centers, they were moved into separate categories in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)

Mountain Valley teenagers spend a lot of time analyzing — and learning to talk back to — their anxious thoughts. During one group session in the summer of 2016 in a sunlit renovated barn with couches, a therapist named Sharon McCallie-Steller instructed everyone to write down three negative beliefs about themselves. That’s an easy exercise for anxious young people (“Only three?” one girl quipped), but McCallie-Steller complicated the assignment by requiring the teenagers to come up with a “strong and powerful response” to each negative thought.

She asked for volunteers. First, residents would share their negative beliefs and rebuttals with the group. Then others would act those out, culminating in a kind of public performance of private teenage insecurity.

Jake raised his hand. By then, he was in his third month at Mountain Valley, and he looked considerably less anxious than several of the newcomers, including one who sat slumped on a couch with his head in his hands. “I’m free to play the part of terrible, evil thoughts for anyone who needs them,” Jake said with a smile. He had already spent weeks challenging his own thinking, which often persuaded him that if he failed a single quiz at school, “then I’ll get a bad grade in the class, I won’t get into the college I want, I won’t get a good job and I’ll be a total failure.”

At Mountain Valley, Jake learned mindfulness techniques, took part in art therapy and equine therapy and, most important, engaged in exposure therapy, a treatment that incrementally exposes people to what they fear. The therapists had quickly figured out that Jake was afraid of failure above all else, so they devised a number of exercises to help him learn to tolerate distress and imperfection. On a group outing to nearby Dartmouth College, for example, Jake’s therapist suggested he strike up conversations with strangers and tell them he didn’t have the grades to get into the school. The college application process was a source of particular anxiety for Jake, and the hope was that he would learn that he could talk about college without shutting down — and that his value as a person didn’t depend on where he went to school.

Though two months in rural New Hampshire hadn’t cured Jake of anxiety, he had made significant progress, and the therapy team was optimistic about his return home for his senior year. Until then, Jake wanted to help other Mountain Valley teenagers face their fears.

Among them was Jillian, a 16-year-old who, when she wasn’t overwhelmed with anxiety, came across as remarkably poised and adultlike, the kind of teenager you find yourself talking to as if she were a graduate student in psychology. Jillian, who also asked that her last name not be used, came to Mountain Valley after two years of only intermittently going to school. She suffered from social anxiety (made worse by cyberbullying from classmates) and emetophobia, a fear of vomit that can be so debilitating that people will sometimes restrict what they eat and refuse to leave the house, lest they encounter someone with a stomach flu.

Jillian listened as Jake and other peers — who, in reality, liked her very much — voiced her insecurities: “I can’t believe how insignificant Jillian is.” “I mean, for the first three weeks, I thought her name was Susan.” “If she left tomorrow, maybe we wouldn’t even miss her.”

At the last one, Jillian’s shoulders caved, and her eyes watered. “I don’t want to do this,” she said, looking meekly at McCallie-Steller.

“If it’s too much, you can stop,” the therapist said, but Jillian considered the offer only long enough to reject it. She straightened her back. “No, I feel like I need to do this,” she announced. “I have a week and a half left. If I can’t get through something like this here ...”

Her voice trailed off, but the implication was clear: The real world would be much more anxiety producing — and much less forgiving.

Anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. But unlike depression, with which it routinely occurs, anxiety is often seen as a less serious problem.

“Anxiety is easy to dismiss or overlook, partially because everyone has it to some degree,” explained Philip Kendall, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple University in Philadelphia. It has an evolutionary purpose, after all; it helps us detect and avoid potentially dangerous situations. Highly anxious people, though, have an overactive fight-or-flight response that perceives threats where there often are none.

But sometimes there are good reasons to feel anxious. For many young people, particularly those raised in abusive families or who live in neighborhoods besieged by poverty or violence, anxiety is a rational reaction to unstable, dangerous circumstances. At the Youth Anxiety Center’s clinic in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, which serves mostly poor and working-class Hispanic youth, teenagers would object to the definition of anxiety I heard often at Mountain Valley: “The overestimation of danger and the underestimation of our ability to cope.”

“The fears can be very real for our kids,” explained Carolina Zerrate, the clinic’s medical director. “Oftentimes their neighborhoods are not safe, their streets are not safe and their families can feel unsafe if there’s a history of trauma and abuse.” The contemporary political climate can also feel “incredibly unsafe for the community of kids we serve,” Zerrate adds, explaining that many have undocumented family members.

And yet addressing anxiety is low on the priority list in many economically disadvantaged communities. Kids who “act out” are often labeled defiant or aggressive, while those who keep to themselves — anxiety specialists call them “silent sufferers” — are overlooked or mistaken for being shy. “If you go to a public school in a struggling urban area, teachers will talk about drugs, crime, teen pregnancy, violence,” Kendall says. “When you start to talk about anxiety, they’re like, ‘Oh, those are the kids we like!’ ”

Teenagers raised in more affluent communities might seemingly have less to feel anxious about. But Suniya Luthar, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University who has studied distress and resilience in both well-off and disadvantaged teenagers, has found that privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. “These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic,” she says, but there’s “contempt and scorn for the idea that kids who have it all might be hurting.”

Photo

For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they “never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop,’ ” Luthar says. “There’s always one more activity, one more A.P. class, one more thing to do in order to get into a top college. Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.”

It’s tempting to blame helicopter parents with their own anxiety issues for that pressure (and therapists who work with teenagers sometimes do), but several anxiety experts pointed to an important shift in the last few years. “Teenagers used to tell me, ‘I just need to get my parents off my back,’ ” recalls Madeline Levine, a founder of Challenge Success, a Stanford University-affiliated nonprofit that works on school reform and student well-being. “Now so many students have internalized the anxiety. The kids at this point are driving themselves crazy.”

Though there are cultural differences in how this kind of anguish manifests, there’s considerable overlap among teenagers from different backgrounds. Many are anxious about school and how friends or teachers perceive them. Some obsess about family conflicts. Teenagers with OCD tend to worry excessively about what foods they should eat, diseases they might contract or whatever happens to be in the news that week. Stephanie Eken, a psychiatrist and the regional medical director for Rogers Behavioral Health, which runs several teenage-anxiety outpatient programs across the country and an inpatient program in Wisconsin, told me that in the last few years she has heard more kids than ever worry about terrorism. “They wonder about whether it’s safe to go to a movie theater,” she said.

When I asked Eken about other common sources of worry among highly anxious kids, she didn’t hesitate: social media. Anxious teenagers from all backgrounds are relentlessly comparing themselves with their peers, she said, and the results are almost uniformly distressing.

Anxious kids certainly existed before Instagram, but many of the parents I spoke to worried that their kids’ digital habits — round-the-clock responding to texts, posting to social media, obsessively following the filtered exploits of peers — were partly to blame for their children’s struggles. To my surprise, anxious teenagers tended to agree. At Mountain Valley, I listened as a college student went on a philosophical rant about his generation’s relationship to social media. “I don’t think we realize how much it’s affecting our moods and personalities,” he said. “Social media is a tool, but it’s become this thing that we can’t live without but that’s making us crazy.”

In his case, he had little doubt that social media made him more self-conscious. “In high school, I’d constantly be judging my self-worth online,” he told me, recalling his tortured relationship with Facebook. “I would think, Oh, people don’t want to see me on their timeline.”

While smartphones can provoke anxiety, they can also serve as a handy avoidance strategy. At the height of his struggles, Jake spent hours at a time on his phone at home or at school. “It was a way for me not to think about classes and college, not to have to talk to people,” he said. Jake’s parents became so alarmed that they spoke to his psychiatrist about it and took his phone away a few hours each night.

At a workshop for parents last fall at the NW Anxiety Institute in Portland, Ore., Kevin Ashworth, the clinical director, warned them of the “illusion of control and certainty” that smartphones offer anxious young people desperate to manage their environments. “Teens will go places if they feel like they know everything that will happen, if they know everyone who will be there, if they can see who’s checked in online,” Ashworth told the parents. “But life doesn’t always come with that kind of certainty, and they’re never practicing the skill of rolling with the punches, of walking into an unknown or awkward social situation and learning that they can survive it.”

Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University who researches adolescent mental health and psychological differences among generations, used to be skeptical of those who sounded an alarm about teenage internet use. “It seemed like too easy an explanation for negative mental-health outcomes in teens, and there wasn’t much evidence for it,” she told me. She searched for other possible explanations, including economic ones. But the timing of the spike in anxious and depressed teenagers since 2011, which she called one of the sharpest and most significant she has seen, is “all wrong,” she said. “The economy was improving by the time the increase started.”

The more she looked for explanations, the more she kept returning to two seemingly unrelated trend lines — depression in teenagers and smartphone adoption. (There is significantly more data about depression than anxiety.) Since 2011, the trend lines increased at essentially the same rate. In her recent book “iGen,” and in an article in The Atlantic, Twenge highlights a number of studies exploring the connection between social media and unhappiness. “The use of social media and smartphones look culpable for the increase in teen mental-health issues,” she told me. “It’s enough for an arrest — and as we get more data, it might be enough for a conviction.”

Last fall, at a high school near the New Hampshire-Vermont border, I watched Lynn Lyons, a psychotherapist and author, deliver bad news to a packed auditorium of teachers and counselors. “We’re not getting the job done,” she said, pacing the stage at Fall Mountain Regional High School, where she had been asked to lead a professional-development training session about anxiety.

More than a decade ago, the school would have been unlikely to invite her to speak. Anxiety was barely on the radar of most educators back then, according to Denise Pope, another founder of Challenge Success, the Stanford-affiliated nonprofit. Pope remembers facing skepticism when she sounded the alarm about growing anxiety among teenagers. “We don’t have to convince them anymore,” she told me. “Schools are coming to us, eager for help.”

A gregarious speaker, Lyons kept her audience entertained by calling anxiety “the cult leader” — for its ability to convince people of falsehoods about themselves — and telling funny stories about overinvolved parents. But her main point was clear: In a seemingly well-meaning effort to help kids avoid what makes them anxious, administrators actually make anxiety worse. “Anxiety is all about the avoidance of uncertainty and discomfort,” Lyons explained. “When we play along, we don’t help kids learn to cope or problem-solve in the face of unexpected events.”

She pointed to the increasing use of “504 plans,” a popular educational tool that allows for academic accommodations for students with physical or mental disabilities. Though 504 plans for anxiety vary by student, a typical one might allow a teenager to take more time on homework and tests, enter the school through a back door — to avoid the chaos of the main entrance — and leave a classroom when feeling anxious.

Lyons believes in the necessity of 504 plans, and she is in agreement with many of the recommendations of Challenge Success, including later school start times, less homework and more project-based learning. But Lyons worries that too many 504 plans are “avoidance-based and teach zero skills.” She gave the example of a plan that allows a student to leave a classroom anytime he feels overwhelmed. Often, a teenager “can go wherever he wants and stay there for as long as he thinks he needs,” she said. Instead, she argued, a school should have a policy in place for the student to seek out a guidance counselor or nurse and do some role-playing that helps the student “externalize his worry,” similar to how Mountain Valley teenagers are taught to observe their thinking and talk back to it. Then the student should return to his regular classroom as soon as possible, Lyons said.

“If anxiety could talk, it would say, ‘You know, let’s just get out of here. We don’t have to do this!’ ” Lyons said from the stage. “But in order to retrain the brain, in order to create that message that says that even though I’m uncomfortable I can do this, we need to stop treating these anxious kids like they’re so frail, like they can’t handle things.”

Lyons sees a connection between how some schools deal with anxious students and what she worries is a generation of young people increasingly insistent on safe spaces — and who believe their feelings should be protected at all costs. “Kids are being given some really dangerous messages these days about the fact that they can’t handle being triggered, that they shouldn’t have to bear witness to anything that makes them uncomfortable and that their external environments should bend to and accommodate their needs,” she told me.

Among many teachers and administrators I spoke to, one word — “resiliency” — kept coming up. More and more students struggle to recover from minor setbacks and aren’t “equipped to problem-solve or advocate for themselves effectively,” a school counselor in suburban Oregon told me. In the last few years, the counselor said, she has watched in astonishment as more students struggle with anxiety — and as more of those “stop coming to school, because they just can’t.”

Some schools have taken drastic measures to accommodate what one administrator called “our more fragile students.” At Roxbury High School in Roxbury Township, N.J., there are two dedicated classrooms for anxious teenagers, including one next to a mural of Edvard Munch’s painting “The Scream.” These students typically avoid the mammoth school cafeteria in favor of eating lunch in one of the classrooms, as they did on the day of my visit last May. They had just finished gym class, an anxiety-producing event for some even as the school did all it could to reimagine the concept. Music blasted throughout the gym as the teenagers halfheartedly played something vaguely approximating a game of volleyball. The ball was allowed to bounce once before being struck — not that anyone was keeping score.

I couldn’t help wondering what Lyons, and other therapists I spoke to who worry that schools inadvertently worsen anxiety, would think of this approach. Some of the programs’ teenagers hoped to go to college, where no special classrooms would await them. How was this preparing them for that?

“Some will say that this feeds the monster,” concedes Patricia Hovey, director of special services at Roxbury High. “But you’ve got to start where the kids are, not where you are or where you want them to be. We’ve got to get them in the building. Many of our students simply don’t come to school if they have to spend all day in” general-education classes. Once the students are in school, Hovey explained, staff members can help them build the confidence and skills to eventually transition to Roxbury’s regular classes — and stand a chance at navigating college or a job once they graduate.

Even with the promise of a special classroom, getting anxious kids to Roxbury High each morning demands a herculean effort from the program’s teachers and therapists. During my visit, I watched them text and call several no-show students in an effort to coax them out of bed. They also regularly communicate with parents, talking them through what to say to a teenager who refuses to leave his room. Paul Critelli, one of the program’s teachers, told me that many parents feel overwhelmed trying to get two or three kids ready for school each morning, and that their instinct is often to “sacrifice the anxious kid” in order to avoid morning hysterics and keep the family train running on time.

Mostly, though, Critelli wants to talk to the anxious students. “What’s the issue today?” I heard him ask during a phone call with a sophomore boy, who had missed his scheduled bus and was presumably speaking to Critelli from underneath his sheets. The call was a “Hail Mary,” as Critelli put it, because while he suspects that the boy sleeps with the phone “right next to his face,” he rarely responds when he’s feeling anxious. “I appreciate you picking up — you don’t normally do that,” Critelli told him, mixing in positive affirmation with a call to action. The school would be sending another bus, and Critelli expected him to be on it.

Critelli looked for any opportunity to push students out of their comfort zones. During an informal study period after lunch, I watched him confiscate cellphones he said the teenagers were using to “hide from, control and avoid” their feelings; scoff at a student who claimed to be too anxious to return a book to the school library; and challenge a particularly reserved boy who said he had nothing to work on.

Critelli looked at him incredulously. “Dude, you’re failing physics,” Critelli said. “What do you mean you don’t have anything to do?”

“There’s nothing I can do — I’m going to fail,” the student mumbled.

“So you’re just accepting that you’re going to fail?” The boy looked at his hands. “Here’s an idea,” Critelli continued. “You can email your teacher and say, ‘What can I do to improve my grade? What extra work can I do?’ ”

Critelli surveyed his classroom of anxious teenagers. “I’d love to see you advocate for yourselves!”

Jake is a remarkably minimalist emailer and texter, eschewing exclamation points and emojis in favor of an almost old-fashioned formality. It can be challenging to gauge his moods that way, so I checked in with him regularly by phone in the months after he left Mountain Valley. He usually sounded content when we spoke, an impression confirmed by his parents, who were relieved by the changes they saw in him. In the fall of his senior year, Jake was regularly attending school — on some days he “even enjoyed it,” he told me with a laugh.

While he was careful not to overschedule himself, anxiety still sometimes overtook him. One weekend, he had to leave a Model United Nations conference after he became anxious and his stomach started cramping. “That was really disheartening, but when I struggle now it doesn’t last long, and I can usually get myself out of it pretty quickly,” he said, by talking back to his negative thoughts.

Jake also confessed to some worry about his application to attend U.N.C. He had decided to be transparent with the school about his anxiety disorder, partly because it helped explain his junior-year absences and grades and partly because the months he had spent challenging his beliefs and ideas at Mountain Valley perfectly fit the application essay prompt: Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea.

In 650 thoughtful and sometimes uncharacteristically dramatic words, Jake explained that in middle school he had “aced the tests and seemed to many as the bright future of the American ideal.” But then came high school and fear of failure, the debilitating worry that he might not be good enough. He explained that going to treatment helped him change his perspective on learning and life. “Just being able to type this very essay would have been impossible months ago due to my fear of judgment,” he wrote. “College is the next step in my journey to find a true sense of self, both academically and personally. The future has reopened its doors.”

The doors had not reopened quite as wide for Jillian, whom I visited on an oppressively humid spring afternoon in Florida. It was a school day, but Jillian wasn’t at school. Instead, she was on the screened-in back patio of the townhouse where she lives with her mother, Allison. A talented artist, Jillian loves theater and special-effects makeup design, and she was hard at work on an outfit for a “Walking Dead” costume contest at a local car dealership.

While she painted her costume to make it appear blood-soaked, we half-watched an episode of the Netflix series “13 Reasons Why” on her laptop. Jillian told me she could relate to many of the series’s themes, including cyberbullying. In middle school, she made a profile page on ASKfm, a social-networking site favored at the time by mean girls and their unsuspecting prey. Jillian was quickly targeted. “I’d get 30 mean questions or messages a day,” she said. “Most of them were like, ‘Just kill yourself.’ ”

Nothing like that happened at the small private high school Jillian attended after leaving Mountain Valley. Though the school is known for its flexibility and willingness to work with nontraditional students, Jillian still struggled to feel comfortable there. She didn’t want to open up and be known as “the anxious girl.” There were other students at school who had severe anxiety and depression — “It’s like the flu broke out here with anxious kids this year,” the headmaster told me — but Jillian didn’t feel comfortable hanging out with them, either. Several had yet to go to treatment, and “I don’t want to go backward,” she told me. But the end result, unsurprisingly, was that most students never got to know Jillian.

Her longtime pattern of missing school began again. She had the tools to challenge her anxious thoughts, but using them every day proved exhausting. “There’s feeling a weight on your chest, and there’s the feeling of 16 people sitting on top of each other on your chest,” she said. “As soon as I’d wake up, it was absolute dread.”

Needing to get to her job 40 minutes away each morning, Allison, who had sold her previous house in order to afford Mountain Valley, had little time to coax Jillian out of bed. They argued constantly. Jillian thought her mother — who was severely depressed during a year when Jillian was younger and especially needed support — could be insensitive. Allison struggled with when (and how hard) to push her daughter. She knew Jillian had a serious disorder, but she also knew it wouldn’t get better by letting her hide out in her room. Allison also couldn’t be sure when Jillian was genuinely paralyzed by anxiety and when she was “manipulating me to get out of doing whatever she didn’t feel like doing,” she said.

“The million-dollar question of raising an anxious child is: When is pushing her going to help because she has to face her fears, and when is it going to make the situation worse and she’s going to have a panic attack?” Allison told me. “I feel like I made the wrong decision many times, and it destroyed my confidence as a mother.”

Allison sometimes wondered how her own anxiety issues might have genetically predisposed her daughter to anxiety. Allison had done enough Google searches to know that anxious teenagers tend to come from anxious parents. Research points to hereditary genes that predispose children to an anxiety disorder, and studies have found that an overbearing or anxious parenting style can induce anxiety and risk-aversion in kids. In the parents’ workshop I attended in Oregon, Ashworth, the therapist, spent a lot of time urging family members to work on their own anxiety issues.

He also cautioned parents not to accommodate their children’s avoidance strategies. Families of children with OCD will routinely open doors for them, cook only the two or three specific foods they’ve agreed to eat and avoid saying certain words or sounds. Families of socially anxious kids will let them stay in the car while they go shopping, order for them at restaurants and communicate with a teacher because they’re afraid to. “So many teens have lost the ability to tolerate distress and uncertainty, and a big reason for that is the way we parent them,” Ashworth said.

While Ashworth can be blunt, he is also disarming and funny, with a self-deprecating sense of humor that appeals to both parents and their cynical children. Like many therapists who work with anxious teenagers, he tries to model a “let’s not take life — and ourselves — too seriously” approach. He also has an almost endless empathy for the challenges that these teenagers and their families face. He knows, for example, that raising a severely anxious child can feel counterintuitive. How, for example, do you set and enforce limits with an anxious teenager? If you send him to his room, “you’ve just made his day,” Ashworth told the parents in his workshop, who nodded knowingly.

Though Jillian had returned from Mountain Valley a more confident person with a nuanced understanding of her issues (and with her emetophobia largely under control), treatment didn’t solve her school struggles. As she fell further behind, her morning battles with her mother became increasingly untenable. In consultation with the school, Allison agreed to let Jillian drop out and study for the G.E.D. But Allison wasn’t happy about it; she considered it a momentary concession. “We basically said, ‘O.K., anxiety, you win.’ ”

Jillian was relieved never to have to set foot in another high school. “I’m just a lot more relaxed now,” she told me in her messy bedroom, where the walls were adorned with “Star Wars” posters and the bookshelf overflowed with young-adult fiction and sci-fi, as well as a worn copy of “Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul.” Near her bed were two prescription bottles — one for Prozac and another for Klonopin, a benzodiazepine tranquilizer. Jillian had been prescribed a number of drug combinations over the years, and while none were panaceas, she believed she would be “a lot worse if I wasn’t taking them.”

Though she spoke to a therapist once or twice a week online, Jillian otherwise ignored the structured daily schedule — including yoga, studying and cleaning her room — that she had agreed to with her mother. Jillian told me she often felt lonely at home, and she spent much of her days texting friends from around the country, some of whom she met at “Star Wars” conventions or on social media.

At the same time, Jillian was trying to make new friends. I watched her joke with fellow contestants at the costume contest (where she walked away with a $250 prize), and she was practically a social butterfly at a film event she attended with her mother. Bored with our company after the screening, Jillian spotted two teenagers talking to each other in a corner.

“O.K., I’m going to go mingle,” she announced.

On a busy weekday morning last May, a new crop of Mountain Valley residents were discovering that a key component of their treatment would involve repeatedly making fools of themselves. On the Dartmouth College campus, eight teenagers wore hand-painted white T-shirts that read “Ask Me About My Anxiety” and “I Have OCD.” They were encouraged by the therapy team to come up with scenarios that would make them uncomfortable. One teenager considered approaching random guys on campus and saying, “You must be a Dartmouth football player.” Later that afternoon, a second group of teenagers arrived. One feigned a panic attack at Starbucks. Another ordered nonsensically at a restaurant.

“What do we need to do to make your anxiety higher?” McCallie-Steller, the therapist, asked several teenagers as they prepared for their morning of exposure therapy. First developed in the 1950s, the technique is an essential component of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety, which a vast majority of researchers and clinicians believe is the most effective treatment for a range of anxiety disorders. In a large 2008 study of anxious youth published in The New England Journal of Medicine, more improved using CBT (60 percent) than the antidepressant Zoloft (55 percent), though the most effective therapy (81 percent) was a combination of the two.

But while exposure therapy has been proved highly effective, few teenagers receive it. “We’re much more likely to medicate kids than to give them therapy,” says Stephen Whiteside, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Program at the Mayo Clinic. “And when we do give them therapy, it’s unlikely to be exposure. With a few exceptions, we’re not treating people with what actually works best.”

Part of the reason is that exposure work is hard. Anxious people aren’t typically eager to feel more anxious. “It’s also uncomfortable for many therapists,” Whiteside told me. “Most people go into therapy or psychology to help people, but with exposure therapy you’re actually helping them feel uncomfortable. It’s not much fun for anybody. It’s much easier to sit in a therapist’s office and talk about feelings.”

Researchers are trying to better understand how exposure works in the brain and to fine-tune its application for anxiety treatment. At U.C.L.A., scientists at the school’s Anxiety and Depression Research Center discovered that the more anxious a person feels going into an exposure exercise, and the more surprised he or she is by the result, the more effective it is at competing with an original negative association or traumatic memory. (That’s why McCallie-Steller did her best to ramp up the teenagers’ anxiety before they began their exposure work.) Other researchers are focused on virtual-reality-aided exposure therapy, which allows people to encounter the sources of their anxiety in a therapist’s office.

For two Mountain Valley 14-year-olds on the main quad at Dartmouth, the sources of their distress were numerous. One, a brown-haired boy who embarrassed easily, suffered from a dispiriting combination of social anxiety, OCD, binge-eating and depression. It was a lot to work on in three months, and he was often overwhelmed by the magnitude of the project. On this day, he had agreed to tackle his social anxiety by sitting next to a stranger on a park bench and striking up a conversation.

Earlier, another Mountain Valley teenager took part in a similar exercise, during which the stranger opened up about his own struggles with anxiety. The teenagers were sometimes surprised that others could relate to their issues. As one girl handed out fliers about anxiety on campus, she sometimes asked people, “Can I tell you about anxiety?” More than a few students — including one who looked as if he might actually be a Dartmouth football player — responded with some version of “Trust me, I know all about it.”

The brown-haired boy was highly anxious about his exposure. He bombarded the therapist, Bryan Randolph, with questions in a seeming attempt to run out the clock until they had to return to Mountain Valley. “Can I just sit on the bench for a minute?” he asked Randolph. “And can I sit down and then start talking? I mean, do I need to ask, ‘Do you mind if I sit there?’ It’s weird to just sit there, have a conversation, then get up and come running back to a group of people.”

“Even better — let’s make it weird,” Randolph told him.

The boy shook his head. “Maybe the guy’s on break and doesn’t want to be bothered.”

“Maybe,” Randolph said. “He might hate you. He might get real mad at you.”

“That’s terrifying,” the teenager confessed. “And what if we’re so close on the bench that we’re touching?”

“That would be awkward,” Randolph said with a half-smile.

The boy craned his neck to get a better look at the man. “Is he sitting in the middle of the bench?”

“I don’t know — he might be,” Randolph told him. “But are you going to ‘what if’ this to death, or are you going to do it?”

He eventually shuffled off toward the stranger, allowing Randolph to turn his attention to the other 14-year-old, Thomas, who stood sheepishly on a nearby corner holding his sign: “I’ve Been Bullied. Ask Me.” The “Ask Me” was hard to make out, because Thomas had also included many of the insults peers have hurled at him over the years, including “B*tch,” “F*ggot,” “Ur Fat” and “Kill Yourself.” Holding the sign on a busy corner had been Thomas’s idea; he thought it might ratchet up his anxiety and force him to interact with strangers, while having the potential added benefit of educating people about bullying.

Randolph and I watched dozens of students walk by, some giving Thomas’s sign a glance but most never slowing their stride. He had been bullied for years, and now he was being ignored. I felt anxious just looking at him.

Eventually, an attractive couple in their mid-20s stopped to read the sign. They smiled, Thomas beamed and after a minute or two of conversation they all hugged. “Oh, my God, that was the greatest,” Thomas announced upon his return.

I asked him what they’d talked about. “The muscular dude said he’s been bullied, too, in middle school, and that bullies get nowhere in life,” Thomas told us. “Then the girl said, ‘You’re really brave. Can I give you a hug?’ ”

“That’s not what you were expecting, huh?” Randolph said. “Instead of being mean to you, people actually treated you with compassion.”

“Yeah, it was awesome,” he said. “I feel so good!”

The brown-haired boy, meanwhile, returned from his brief visit to the bench: “It was sooooo awkward,” he reported. “The guy just kept texting. He was probably like, Why is this kid asking me questions?”

“And what if he was?” Randolph asked him. “You’re not responsible for what he’s thinking.”

The boy appeared to consider Randolph’s point as they made their way back to the van that would return them to Mountain Valley. Sometimes, Randolph told the boys, “exactly what you think will happen happens. Other times, the exact opposite of what you think will happen happens. Either way, it’s all manageable.”

The subject line of Jake’s email to me last winter read simply, “College Results.” I opened it: “Hey Benoit, I just wanted to tell you that I was accepted to U.N.C. Chapel Hill. Jake.” I emailed back to say that he could stand to sound a little bit more excited, to which he replied, “Trust me, I’m pretty excited!”

Last month, I visited him during his fourth week of college classes. It was a Sunday, and Jake met me outside his dorm wearing khaki shorts and a Carolina Panthers jersey. He looked happier than I’d ever seen him. “Let’s walk,” he said, leading me on a tour of campus and nearby Chapel Hill, where he went record shopping (he left with a Parquet Courts album) and played touch football with a few of his friends.

Since leaving Mountain Valley, Jake had prioritized his social life. “The health of my relationships with people is just as important as academics,” he told me on a bench overlooking the main quad. He had said something similar at Mountain Valley, but back then it sounded theoretical, aspirational. It felt true now. He had made new friends on campus and was keeping up with old ones from home — and some of his peers from Mountain Valley — via text and Snapchat, the only social-media platform he regularly uses these days. “My junior year, when things got really bad, I told myself that I didn’t need to hang out with my friends a lot, that all that really mattered was how well I did at school,” he said. “I don’t think like that anymore.”

That’s not to say that Jake doesn’t study. He does — usually days before he needs to. “Procrastination isn’t a good idea for me,” he said. But he was actually enjoying several of his college classes, especially Intro to Ethics, for which he was reading Plato’s “Republic.”

Jake had experienced only one intense bout of anxiety at U.N.C. For his info sciences course, he turned in an assignment online but realized days later that there had been a technical glitch and it hadn’t gone through. He said he felt “a sudden burst of anxiety” — his chest tightened, and adrenaline coursed through his body. What had he done? He sent a panicked email to his professor and told a friend who also has anxiety issues that he was “freaking out.” Then he took a nap, which had long been one of his coping strategies. When he awoke, the professor had emailed saying it wasn’t a big deal. “That ended that crisis,” Jake told me.

For the most part, Jake felt he was managing his anxiety. Over the summer, he met twice with Jonathan Abramowitz, a psychology professor who leads the university’s anxiety and stress lab, but Jake had put off finding a regular therapist for the school year. His parents kept bugging him about it. “I just haven’t felt like I need it here,” Jake told me. But then, a few beats later, he added: “I know I need to stop making excuses and just do it.”

I was curious how much of Jake’s newfound contentment had to do with being at U.N.C., with getting into his dream school. After all, a major component of his treatment at Mountain Valley was learning to accept that his value didn’t depend solely on academic achievement. How would he have reacted if his application was one of the 74 percent that U.N.C. rejected last year?

It was clear that Jake had thought about the question. “I would have been disappointed, but I really think I would have been O.K.,” he told me. “There are other schools in the world where I would have been happy. I definitely wouldn’t have believed that a couple years ago, but a lot’s changed.”

“Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook.
I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled.","Trees can live without us, but we cannot live without trees.

With a history dating back to the dinosaurs, trees are the planet’s documentarians, watching us cycle through life while providing oxygen, shade and shelter. Trees, the oldest of which, according to Peter Wohlleben’s “The Hidden Life of Trees,” has 9,500 years, are a critical part of the human experience. We rely on them, from their deep roots to fluttering leaves.

But — at least when we’re not cutting them down — how do we influence trees? Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October. Traveling to more than 70 locations, they found trees that represent “landscapes of complexity where nature and humanity converge.” In other words, trees with stories, like the young sycamore that witnessed the Civil War, or the elm that survived the Oklahoma City bombing. These photos show how events have shaped trees, their energy, and sometimes, literally, the shape of their limbs.

“Forty-million trees are being lost every day,” said Mr. Jenshel. “We love the environment and wanted to do something that would make people think differently about trees.”

Though Mr. Jenshel and Ms. Cook — who are married, collaborate on all their projects and frequently finish each other’s sentences — have a long history of photographing trees, a much more personal seed for their project was planted in the spring of 2012. They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying. Struggling to process the information, she found herself watching the fragile petals of the cherry blossoms slowly drift to the ground, one by one.

“We did what the Japanese have been doing for centuries,” said Ms. Cook. “To take in that beauty, appreciate its ephemeral nature, and know that life does go on.”

Her father died soon after, but a new project was born, influenced by the cherry blossoms and a National Geographic magazine commission. “Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook. “And the importance trees have had throughout history in so many cultures.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, search and rescue workers were looking for human remains among the rubble, when they found part of a Callery pear tree, which traditionally is the first tree to bloom in spring and the last to change leaves in autumn. Though its trunk was scorched and many branches missing, the tree had survived the attacks. Now a symbol of strength and survival, the pear tree was nursed back to health at a Bronx nursery and, nearly a decade later, replanted at the World Trade Center memorial.

Other trees have been a part of unspeakable cruelties. From 1846 to 1870, in Goliad, Tex., an oak known as “The Hanging Tree,” provided shade for court sessions and branches for lynching.

“It’s not always a happy story,” said Ms. Cook.

One of the rain or monkeypod trees in Cambodia (imported from South or Central America), was isolated from the others as “The Killing Tree.” In 1975 when Pol Pot’s murderous rule started, the tree was used to bash children’s heads while their mothers were forced to watch.

“It took us days to recover from that experience of photographing that tree,” said Ms. Cook. “That left the deepest scar on us.”

Other trees seem to travel, and quite far. It is not clear how the adansonia gregorii (or boab) tree got to Western Australia. Perhaps it was the result of seeds dropped from the fruits by early migrants. It was a good thing, though, for the local aboriginals who used the tree as a spiritual home and lifeline, since it can hold up to 26 gallons of water.

In India, from the ancient tree deities to current bodhis of enlightenment, most trees are seen as sacred. In a Varanasi sweet shop, they found a neem tree, said to cure all ailments. Long after they shot the photo, Ms. Cook noticed her spouse’s anxiety.

“Len kept saying, ‘I don’t think we got the picture. I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled. “I totally knew it was about the sweets.”

I used it to explore a neighborhood where I used to be a local (Astoria, Queens) to see if it could deliver. The fact that it included a wide assortment of suggestions in a borough not named Manhattan was impressive enough, compared to the other apps I tested, but the recommendations themselves were also spot on.

For example, Astoria’s popular Bohemian Hall and Beer Garden was rightfully featured, but so was SingleCut Brewery, a lesser-known, but worthwhile, beer spot.

The advice for each location is the perfect length — detailed but not overwhelming, and the “Nearby” tab on the map makes it easy to scope out places wherever you are.

Cool Cousin

This app scored points for originality as well as its practicality, and is perfect for travelers who don’t have any cool cousins of their own.

Cool Cousin gives you access to contributors in 40 large cities around the world. Each “cousin” has a profile, with name, age, photo, occupation and a lot more information. The idea is to add those to your network who seem to have similar tastes to your own. After each add, the cousin’s recommendations are added to your map and broken down into eight different categories, such as food, coffee, night life and outdoors.

The app seems geared toward younger travelers — it feels like a cross between Facebook, Tinder and Foursquare — and most of the cousins themselves have an appropriately hipster look. For New York, this leads to a higher concentration of recommendations below 14th Street in Manhattan and several in Brooklyn (very few in Queens), and heavy in the food and night life areas.

But the app itself is easy to figure out, and the map includes the option to download and use offline (for free). No matter where you are, just hit the location arrow to see what’s nearby.

The recommendations themselves are solid and are written casually — think Yelp, minus the negativity. I added 26 of 55 available cousins in New York and was impressed with what was revealed, including free public gardens and lesser-known art galleries, as well as a wide variety of intriguing bars and restaurants.

Your new cousins will even message you through the app to say hello, and you have the option of writing them back to ask for more tips. You will also get a push notification every time you receive a new message, which you can turn off by adjusting your settings. After asking two of my paired cousins, I received additional restaurant recommendations.

Like a Local

Well-designed and easy to navigate, Like a Local has fewer contributors than the other apps (28, providing 197 tips for New York at the time of writing) but it is in more cities than the others (over 300) and best functions as a complementary tool.

The recommendations are detailed yet concise, giving an excellent general overview and a “special tip” for each location. For example, at the Brazilian restaurant Beco in Brooklyn, Kelly advises: “Come early because the restaurant’s seating space is limited. CA$H ONLY.”

You don’t have to sign up to use the app, so you can dig right in and explore — though if you want to use the app offline, you have to pay $1.99 per city.

There’s also an option to “ask locals,” which works like a message board. I asked for Upper East Side restaurant recommendations (it is a neighborhood not represented well on any of the apps) and after a week had yet to get a response.

President Trump on Wednesday told Fox's Sean Hannity, ""We are the highest taxed nation in the world.""

At this point, Trump has publicly made this claim at least 20 times. And it's still not true.

In fact, here are just a few ways the United States trails other countries in terms of taxation.

Total revenue collected

The United States in 2015 collected $14,794 per capita in tax revenue, according to data from the OECD, which is a group of 34 democracies with market economies.

That's well below what many other OECD members collected. Luxembourg took the top spot, with $42,655 collected per person. Norway came in second, collecting $30,140.

As a share of the economy, the U.S. collected 26.4% of its gross domestic product in total revenue, well below the 34.3% OECD average. By that measure, Denmark takes the top spot at 46.6%.

Individual taxes

Another way to compare taxes is to look at individual income tax rates.

For example, in the United States, California imposes the highest state rate (13.3%). When you add that to the top federal rate of 39.6%, the wealthy in California are paying a top combined rate of 53% on a portion of their income. That's very high, but still not as high as the nearly 56% imposed in Denmark.

What's more, the highest rate in Denmark has typically applied to a lot more income than the highest rate in California, or in the United States more broadly.

Corporate taxes

Among countries and tax jurisdictions worldwide, the U.S. corporate tax rate (when measured by federal, state and local combined) ranks fourth, behind the United Arab Emirates, Comoros and Puerto Rico, according to the Tax Foundation.

Trump is on firmer ground when he says, as he has, that the U.S. corporate tax rate is the highest ""in the developed world.""

The top U.S. corporate rate is 35%. When combined with state and local business taxes, it's just over 39% on average. That's higher than the average statutory rates of countries in the OECD. It's also higher than that of the 15 largest economies in the world, according to the Congressional Research Service.

But that doesn't tell the whole story.

Corporate tax revenue only accounts for about 2.2% of U.S. GDP, which is below the OECD average. And as percent of total taxes collected, the U.S. has been roughly on par with the OECD average in recent years.

In terms of actual tax burden, the Government Accountability Office found that once various tax breaks are taken into account, large profitable U.S. companies paid, on average, about 14% of their pretax income in taxes in 2012 -- or 22% once foreign, state and local taxes are included.

And about a fifth of those companies owed no U.S. taxes at all. One factor that can contribute to a company's zero tax liability is if it has foreign profits that it leaves overseas, because under the current system U.S. tax can be deferred on offshore earnings until that money is repatriated.

Still, calls to lower the U.S. corporate rate are widespread because so many other countries that compete with the United States for business have lowered their statutory rates.

""Our high marginal tax rates distort incentives, but we have so many tax breaks in our code, the high rate doesn't translate to paying more overall in taxes. It mainly means we collect our taxes in a highly-complex and often inefficient manner, which is why there is so much we can do to improve our tax code,"" CRFB president Maya MacGuineas has noted.

Who rules the American right? I fairly often find myself talking with people who see either the nation as a whole or at least the right side of the political spectrum as a pure oligarchy, where the big money controls everything. And money definitely plays an outsized and generally malign role in policy. Usually, however, it’s only the root of some evil, not all evil: the vileness of a Roy Moore or Joe Arpaio comes from very different sources,

But one area where the simplistic view is close to correct is tax policy. There really is no clamor, even among Republicans, for tax cuts on the wealthy and corporations. And overall public opinion is strongly against.

Nor is there a technocratic case for these cuts. There is no evidence whatsoever that tax cuts produce great economic outcomes — zero, zilch, nada. The “experts” who claim otherwise are all hired guns, and notably incompetent hired guns at that.

On the wall of the synagogue, opening my eyes, I noticed these words: “Zerstort, Nov 9, 1938, Wieder eingeweiht, September 1947” — destroyed in 1938, rededicated in 1947, eight months before the founding of the modern state of Israel. In those nine years — one more than a two-term American presidency — the German-Jewish tapestry of Berlin, of Germany, was shredded. A whole universe disappeared. Hitler was a buffoon of ruthless intuitions who contrived to take the world down with him. That’s worth recalling today.

Millions of European Jews, none more patriotic than the German, went to the gas.

All that, of course, was in the 20th century, now disappearing from view at alarming speed. Few things are more dangerous than amnesia. But of course the things you remember best are things lived. What’s the Cold War or the Berlin Wall to a 30-year-old today?

The reconciliation of German and Jew after the Holocaust was unimaginable. Death was Celan’s “master from Germany”; how could such a master proffer a hand across the ashes to those who slipped through the net? And yet, just as there could be poetry after Auschwitz, there could, over generations, be a new understanding between perpetrator and victim, even German-Jewish friendship.

I moved very reluctantly from Paris to Berlin in 1998. By the time I left in 2001 (a couple of weeks before the world changed), I was a convert to the Bundesrepublik. No nation guilty of a great crime has pursued an honest reckoning and atonement with greater rigor than Germany. It did not come immediately or easily. The country zigzagged its way to a full accounting. There were long silences and significant evasions. But Germany got there.

To me it has yielded a mystery or two, kept others back. You watch, in October, a naked woman emerging from Berlin’s Krumme Lanke lake to the hissing of a swan, watch swans’ wings thwacking the water in the struggle to get airborne, listen to the rhythmic clack-clack of hikers’ polls on the paths in the dark woods — and it is as if you are being allowed to glimpse some secret. Still, you wonder.

The Bundesrepublik is America’s child. It was forged under American tutelage and inspired by high American ideals of liberty. President Trump therefore poses a particular problem for Germany, more acute than for any other European nation. If the United States has forsaken these ideals, if the nation of “We the people” is no longer a universal idea but projects only a pay-up-now mercantilism, Germany will one day have to think again.

Back Story

The Man Booker Prize, which honors the best novel written in English and published in Britain, will be announced today.

On this year’s shortlist: “4 3 2 1,” by Paul Auster; “History of Wolves,” by Emily Fridlund; “Exit West,” by Mohsin Hamid; “Autumn,” by Ali Smith; “Lincoln in the Bardo,” by George Saunders; and “Elmet,” by Fiona Mozley.

First awarded in 1969, the Booker McConnell Prize was named for the multinational company that established it, as an effort to rival the Prix Goncourt in France. In 2002, sponsorship passed to the Man Group, an investment management firm, which added its name to the title.

The award was initially open only to writers from Britain, Ireland, Zimbabwe and the Commonwealth. Eligibility expanded in 2014 to include any English-language novelist, raising concerns that it would become dominated by Americans. (Since then, one U.S. novel — Paul Beatty’s “The Sellout” — has won. Half of the authors on this year’s shortlist are Americans.)

Winners receive 50,000 pounds, or about $66,000. Howard Jacobson, who won in 2010 for “The Finkler Question,” told The Guardian that he was going to spend the prize money on his wife: “Have you seen the price of handbags?”

Sara Aridi contributed reporting.

She committed herself to being by their sides, expecting them to ail for a few years at most.

“I felt I had an obligation, coming from a good family that was always there for me,” Ms. Marcus said. “This was just what our family did.”

She quit her job but expected to return to teaching in the future.

Using money she inherited from her father, Ms. Marcus paid for medical costs and hired private nurses to run the household.

“When it gets worse and they need more attention,” she explained, “you can’t stay up day and night and do everything: cooking, shopping, laundry, taking them to the bathroom.”

Ms. Marcus spent several days each week with her loved ones in New York, and the others in Washington with her partner, Jimmy Seigel, who also split time between the two cities.

They enjoyed an active social life as Ms. Marcus continued paying for her family’s medical care, never concerning herself with the cost. Her aunt died in 1992 and her mother in 1999.

The effects of her depleted savings caught up to Ms. Marcus in January 2016, when Mr. Seigel died of cancer.

After her partner’s death, Ms. Marcus packed up the contents of their apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and put them into storage. She tried unsuccessfully to find teaching jobs.

“That was the big surprise — that when you’re 69, they don’t want you in the classroom,” Ms. Marcus said.

A few months later, one of her cousins learned of the Homelessness Prevention Program at Dorot, a social services agency. In April 2016, Ms. Marcus moved into a temporary residence in Manhattan for older adults facing homelessness. In February, the agency placed her in permanent housing at an assisted-living center in Far Rockaway, not far from her family’s old summer home.

Ms. Marcus receives $735 a month in Supplemental Security Income and could not afford the first month’s rent. A social worker contacted the Jewish Board of Family and Children’s Services. Dorot and the Jewish Board are beneficiary organizations of UJA-Federation of New York, one of eight charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The board used $1,235 in Neediest Cases funds to cover the first month’s rent.

Ms. Marcus maintains a jaunty deposition and welcomes the unknown, embracing it as if it were another adventure before her.

“You deal with life as it happens,” she said. “You have great faith that things will work out and you just deal with it.”

Since moving into her new home, Ms. Marcus has made many friends. Awe and contentment accompany her everywhere, she said: on a leisurely subway ride to Manhattan, hearing a doo-wop a cappella group perform on a sidewalk or taking a bus ride to a Long Island shopping center to help a fellow resident pick out some new clothes.

“You have to have some sense of humor, sense of adventure if you want to enjoy things,” she said. “Everyone has bad times. That’s what life is. If you have a positive attitude and deal with things as they happen, there’s always a good thing after a bad thing.”",Staring Down Homelessness With Dignity and Pluck,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/nyregion/staring-down-homelessness-with-dignity-and-pluck.html

That’s especially true when you consider the real origin of Wonder Woman, the warrior with the indestructible bracelets and slightly kinky magic lasso who burst into comics in 1941. As it happens, there was more kink to her story than suggested by that golden lasso, which she uses to force her captives to tell the truth and looks like something from a bondage emporium. “On Paradise Island where we play many binding games,” she says in an early comic while roping another woman, “this is considered the safest method of tying a girl’s arms!”

There are some exceedingly delectable questions posed in “Professor Marston and the Wonder Women,” and a few frisky binding games on tap too. A sly and thoroughly charming Trojan horse of a movie, “Professor Marston” tells the story of the man who created Wonder Woman and the women who inspired him, both in and out of bed. The movie gleams and has all the smooth surfaces and persuasive detail of a typical period picture — the fedoras, the rides, the Katharine Hepburn trousers. All that luster, which too often in movies suggests polite manners and drowsily safe entertainment, proves to be a seductive, glossy way into something more satisfyingly complicated.

If nothing else, “Professor Marston” is another reminder that once upon a time people had sexual appetites and relationships as complex as those of today (or of 18th-century France), something else the movies don’t always like to admit. Occasionally, grandpa might have even visited a dusty, mysterious shop with sexy specialty items in front and something naughtier in back. Dr. William Moulton Marston (a winning Luke Evans) finds out just how special those items could be when he pops into a store where a man calling himself the G-string King (J.J. Feild) opens up a world of consensual power play and pleasure.

Video

At that point, life has already become interesting for Marston. The writer-director Angela Robinson lays out just how, well, knotty it all is with wit, sympathy and economy. Spanning decades, the story takes flight in 1928 with Marston teaching young lovelies at Radcliffe. “Are you normal?” he asks of a beaming, receptive audience that serves as an amusing stand-in for the viewer. Marston has answers to that and other questions, along with a theory he calls DISC — for dominance, inducement, submission and compliance — which sounds terribly complex and slightly ridiculous. (“D, I, S and C,” the real Marston wrote, “represent nodal points in the integrative emotion series.”)

Ms. Robinson borrows Marston’s theory, using it as a clever if somewhat schematic framing device as she spins her story. There are moments of domination, psychological as well as physical. There are also interludes of inducement, submission and compliance mixed in with a sweet, soft-focus romance that initially involves Marston and his wife, a frustrated academic, Elizabeth Holloway Marston (Rebecca Hall, tart, brisk, essential), and soon includes a third, Olive Byrne (a very good Bella Heathcote). A student, Olive cracks open the Marstons’ marriage, but instead of destroying it helps it grow into a shared, liberating adventure that settles into something cozily domestic.","Review: ‘Professor Marston,’ With Kinks!

So what else is needed to be able to do the job?

Basketball I.Q. “When something happens on the court, I’m the first to react to it,” Mr. Sedra said, “so you have to have knowledge of the game.”

Quick judgment. “You’ve got to know timing,” he told us, likening it to improv. “It’s really important to feed off what’s happening.”

Good chemistry. He described himself as a conduit between the crowd and the court. “I’m supposed to emit a certain type of energy to the crowd, but at the same time I feed off the crowd and reciprocate the energy they feel.”

Stage presence. While there’s no acting involved, Mr. Sedra said his demeanor and pronunciation of words change behind the mic. He does not, however, recite “how now brown cow” to loosen up; “I rehearse in my mind.”

Mr. Sedra is a Montreal native who started in radio and television, covering college basketball in Canada. He spent 11 seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers before coming to the Nets.

Hundreds of games later, he still gets nervous before taking the mic.

“You could probably do it in your living room when there’s nobody there, but let me drop you in the N.B.A. Finals and say ‘go,’” he said. “You’re not in your living room anymore; it’s 20,000 people and millions listening around the world.”

But there are also images that challenge them: Canada the diplomat having lighthearted meetings with America’s foes.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said.","“We worry when you look hard at us, but we are also touchy about being overlooked,” then-Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson of Canada told a group of American students in 1963. The quote, reprinted in the June 10th issue of The New York Times of that year, still rings true today, especially as a Canadian like myself goes through thousands of images of Canada from the newspaper’s archives.

Earlier this year, the Ryerson Image Center in Toronto received a donation of 24,804 images from a collector, Chris Bratty, who had purchased the collection with the intention of donating it. Selected by a team led by two gallerists, Steven Kasher and Stephen Bulger, the pictures range from World War I to the late 1990s, from hockey players to lumberjacks. A selection is currently on view in an exhibition at the center and in a book, both entitled “The Faraway Nearby.”

“When I heard of the collection, I immediately wanted to acquire it,” said Paul Roth, an American who is the center’s director. “For all the strengths of our holdings — including the Black Star and the Berenice Abbott archives — we don’t have a tremendous amount of Canadian photojournalism. This helps us fill that gap. And, since it comes from a major U.S. newspaper, it brings up the question of how one country covers another, which fits within our mandate of interrogating different aspects of the medium.”

The expected tropes are there: Canada as a winter wonderland; as a safe, polite neighbor who reveres hockey. But there are also images that challenge them: Canada the diplomat having lighthearted meetings with America’s foes. In one photo, Nikita S. Khrushchev laughs at a joke told by Mr. Pearson — the opposite of the famous “Kitchen Debate” moment by Elliott Erwitt, in which then-Vice President Richard Nixon castigates the Soviet leader. In another, Fidel Castro holds Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau’s youngest son, Michel Charles-Émile, during a four-day state visit. Or, Canada the troubled young nation deploying the Army to confront Quebec’s sometimes-violent calls for independence.

“The type of coverage we see speaks of a dual fascination between how familiar Canada feels, and yet how unfamiliar it sometimes appears,” Mr. Roth surmised. “I suspect that The New York Times had to ponder how to cover a country that was so close. Should they concentrate on the differences or highlight the similarities? When stories involved people or goods crossing the border, which was often the case, were they to be considered national or international news?”

Besides snow and hockey, evidence of Canada’s subordination to the British monarchy seemed of particular interest. The New York Times dedicated space daily to Princess Elizabeth’s first tour of Canada in 1951 (Slide 9) and continued to chronicle the royal family’s subsequent visits.

Mr. Trudeau also drew a lot of attention, more than any of his predecessors and successors, that is, until his son Justin ran for the same office and won in 2015. A reproduction of a spread published during the 1972 election is revealing. Within “The World” section, the article isn’t under a rubric with the country’s name, as is customary, but simply “Trudeau,” and a headline declaring “A Swinger Shows His Sober Side.” A full column is dedicated to a collage of images showing the candidate dancing, riding a motorcycle, playing hockey and pedaling a unicycle before concluding with a somber close-up portrait.

Photo

Mounting the exhibition, Denise Birkhofer — an American who recently settled in Toronto and co-curated the show with Gerald McMaster, an Indigenous Canadian of Plains Cree and Blackfoot descent — pondered how The New York Times’s fondness for certain subjects and visual archetypes might have shaped a national identity. That’s hard to answer, partly because of the variety of photographers who contributed to the paper’s Canadian coverage.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said. “Not all were Americans. Sometimes staff photographers were sent to cover a story, but other times it came from local publications or freelancers. There were also images made by Canadian agencies or corporations, such as the National Film Board and the Canadian Pacific Railway.”

Photo

Most surprisingly, during World War I, the images the paper used to showcase Canada’s participation in the war effort were supplied by Canadian entities, whose work had to be vetted by the nation’s official censors. Its goal was to avoid criticism of military endeavors by showing the conflict in a romanticized light. In other words, said Gaëlle Morel, the Ryerson Image Center exhibitions curator, “The New York Times — a private commercial enterprise — obeyed the censorship requirements of a foreign country.” In other words, the country’s image, as seen in The Times, reflected an official, sanitized perspective.

Mr. Roth said the collection has greater meaning given Canada’s sesquicentennial this year. “More than a time for celebration and patriotism, it is an occasion to think about complicated questions relating to the identity of the nation,” he said. “All countries should be interested in how they’re viewed by other states. We should strive to get past the mythologies that are created to promote tourism or to reinforce patriotic values, especially nowadays. Doing so requires unpacking widely held cultural assumptions. And that’s exactly what we can do thanks to this archive. While it doesn’t tell a single story, it does help us understand what the Canadian mythologies are.”

Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.
“The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said.","Andre Martin and Renaud Wald made off with the paintings from the Louvre without triggering the dreaded “red procedure.” That’s the high-tech system that automatically seals exits and locks doors throughout the vast museum within two minutes of a security breach. The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

Photo

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Photo

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

Anyone with a bit of sense – a group that, believe it or not, includes many economists – knows that people aren’t perfectly rational. But the assumption of hyperrationality still plays far too large a role in the field. And Thaler didn’t just document deviations from rationality, he showed that there are consistent, usable patterns in those deviations.

The question, however, is how much difference this should make to the practice of economics. And here you have a division between two camps. One says that imperfect rationality changes everything; the other that the assumption of rationality is still the best game out there, or at least sets a baseline from which departures must be justified at length.

Which camp is right? My thought: it depends on the field, for reasons not entirely clear to me. Let me talk about two fields I know reasonably well: macroeconomics, which I think I know pretty well, and finance, where I am much less well-informed in general but am pretty familiar with at least some international areas. What strikes me is that vaguely Thalerish reasoning is hugely important in one, in the other not so much.

Let me state two propositions derived from the proposition that people are perfectly rational:

1.Rational investors will build all available information into asset prices, so movements in these prices will be driven only by unanticipated events – that is, they’ll follow a random walk, with no patterns you can exploit to make money

2.Rational wage- and price-setters will take all available information into account when setting labor and goods prices, implying that demand shocks will have real effects only if they’re unanticipated – in particular, that monetary policy “works” only if it’s a surprise, and can’t play a stabilizing role

Now, (1) is basically efficient markets theory, which we know is wrong in detail – there are lots of anomalies. In international finance, for example, there is the well-known uncovered interest parity puzzle: differences in national interest rates should be unbiased predictors of future changes in exchange rates, but in fact turn out to have no predictive power at all. And anyone who believed that rationality of investors precluded the possibility of massive, obvious mispricing – say, of subprime-backed securities – has not had a happy decade.

Yet the broader proposition that asset price movements are unpredictable, that patterns are subtle, unstable, and hard to make money off of, seems to be right. On the whole, it seems to me that considering the implications of rational behavior has done more good than harm to the field of finance.

What about (2)? That’s where Robert Lucas came in: trying to rationalize the observed facts of business cycles with perfectly rational behavior in the face of imperfect information. This approach had a huge effect on the practice of macroeconomics, at least academic macroeconomics. But at this point we can safely say that it took the whole field down a rabbit hole. Wage- and price-setting does not reflect the best available information about future monetary policies; if it did, we’d be seeing wage contracts moving rapidly around as Kevin Warsh’s prospects on Predictit fluctuate. Everything we know suggests that there is a lot of nominal downward rigidity and a lot of money illusion in general.

And assertions that this might be true in practice, but can’t be true in theory, and must therefore be assumed away both in research and in policy have been hugely destructive.

So, rationality is a lie. But in some parts of economics it seems to be a bit of a noble lie, useful as a guide for thinking as long as you keep your tongue firmly in your cheek. In other parts, however, it’s just a disaster.

As I said, I can think of some reasons why. In financial markets, smart investors can, within limits, arbitrage against the irrationality of others. There’s no equivalent in labor and goods markets (or in consumer behavior!). But in general, the uneven applicability of behavioral thinking is surely – of course – a subject for future research.",Rationality and Rabbit Holes,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/rationality-and-rabbit-holes/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog Main&contentCollection=Opinion&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body

Intel said its intent “was to convey the performance capabilities of our processors through the visual metaphor of a sprinter,” but acknowledged, “Unfortunately, our execution did not deliver our intended message and in fact proved to be insensitive and insulting.”

Dove, May 2011

In 2011, Dove was criticized for another ad: this one showing three women standing side by side, each with lighter skin than the woman next to her. Behind them were signs reading “before” and “after”; the “before” sign, positioned behind an African-American woman, showed cracked skin, while the “after” sign, behind a white woman, showed smooth skin.

“Visibly more beautiful skin,” the ad read.

Edelman, the public relations company representing Dove, said in a statement to Gawker: “All three women are intended to demonstrate the ‘after’ product benefit. We do not condone any activity or imagery that intentionally insults any audience.”

The fact that the most recent ad was Dove’s second to cause offense was not lost on social media users.

Popchips, May 2012

Popchips drew fire in 2012 for an ad in which Ashton Kutcher played several characters — including a Bollywood producer named Raj, complete with brownface and an Indian accent.

Popchips initially urged viewers to watch the ad in the humorous “spirit it was intended.” Later, its chief executive, Keith Belling, said in a statement: “Our team worked hard to create a lighthearted parody featuring a variety of characters that was meant to provide a few laughs. We did not intend to offend anyone. I take full responsibility and apologize to anyone we offended.”

Qiaobi, May 2016

In a 2016 commercial for the Chinese company Qiaobi’s laundry detergent, an Asian woman shoves a detergent pod into a black man’s mouth and puts him in a washing machine, from which he emerges as a light-skinned Asian.

A spokeswoman for Qiaobi, Xu Chunyan, was unapologetic. “We did this for some sensational effect,” she said at the time. “If we just show laundry like all the other advertisements, ours will not stand out.”

Nivea, April 2017

In April, the skin care company Nivea released a deodorant ad that read, “White is purity.” White supremacists on the internet took note, with one 4chan user writing, “Nivea has chosen our side.”

A representative of Nivea’s parent company, Beiersdorf, said it had “never intended to hurt anybody or to raise any wrong interpretation.”

But, like Dove, Nivea had offended before.

Six years earlier, after apologizing for an ad that showed a black man preparing to throw away his old Afro-wearing head behind the words “Re-civilize yourself,” it promised to review “current development and approval processes” in order to “avoid any kind of future misleading interpretations.”",Dove Drops an Ad Accused of Racism,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/dove-ad-racist.html

The first day of infamy brought the country together and showed our fundamental strength.","It’s 9/11 again – and almost nobody is commemorating the anniversary. It didn’t even occur to me to use my print column space for the purpose, given all the ongoing current horrors. But since I have a bit of time before my 14-hour flight, I thought I’d take a few minutes to talk about what was supposed to happen after 9/11, but didn’t.

In the weeks and months after the atrocity, news media had a narrative about what it meant – basically, that it was a Pearl Harbor moment that brought America together with a new seriousness and resolve. This was comforting and reassuring. It was also totally false, literally from the first minutes.

The truth, as we now know, is that Bush administration officials rejoiced, even as the fires were still burning, at the opportunity they now had to fight the unrelated war they always wanted. But that wasn’t all: Republicans in Congress also saw opportunity for partisan gain from the start. Within less than two days Congressional staffers were telling me about GOP efforts to exploit the atrocity to ram through a cut in capital gains taxes.

The thing was, people just didn’t want to hear about this reality. When I wrote a column relaying what was happening in Congress, I was flooded with angry mail from readers – readers angry not at Republicans for exploiting the event, but at me for reporting it. “How can I tell that to my young son?” wrote one furious correspondent.

It took years for people to accept the shameful truth. And it took even longer for the news media: a plurality of voters had concluded that the Iraq war was sold with lies long before it was considered acceptable to say this in polite company.

Why didn’t 9/11 change anything? Partly because unlike Pearl Harbor, terrorism wasn’t and isn’t an existential threat. Yes, it’s scary; but you had to be an idiot to think that there was any risk of an Islamic takeover of the West. This meant that domestic political villains felt free both to continue their villainy and to treat terror just as another thing to exploit.

Beyond that, by 2001 we were already deep into extreme polarization driven by the radicalization of the GOP. (No, it’s not “both sides.”) Anyone who says that Trump has made the Republican Party unrecognizable has forgotten about Tom DeLay.

In fact, you have to wonder what the response to Pearl Harbor would have been if the GOP of 1941 had been what it was in 2001. I suspect Republicans would have declared that it was FDR’s fault and opposed government borrowing to pay for World War II, not to mention price controls and rationing.

In any case, at this point we can see that 9/11’s place in the American story ended up being almost the opposite of Pearl Harbor’s.

But her teenage discovery that her grandmother’s town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world.

Today she no longer considers herself religious “in terms of attending church,” but she appreciates the spiritual passion and ecstasy she documents in religious settings in far-flung countries. “My work can be a kind of prayer,” she said. “With time, I understood that what is interesting to me is not God — but God in people.”

Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, “Where Gods Whisper,” published by Contrasto Books.

She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a “kind of moral and ethical necessity.”

As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians, Jews and Muslim Tatars. She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.

Her grandparents’ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. “In one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,” she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer.

She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.

“Beyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,” she wrote in “God’s People: A Travel Into Another Europe,” an earlier book. “In winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.”

Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmother’s town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust. It was the town’s “total silence” about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.

Ms. Bulaj’s photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too.

“I photograph instinctively,” she said. “I am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.”

The fifth of six children, he was so determined to get to college that he was already budgeting for it as a high school student. (I reproduced his handwritten budget, which he still has, in a 2015 column.)

After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.

His phone number was on his company website, and every time a tearful call came in, he asked what might have kept the problems from happening in the first place. Inevitably, it came down to people wishing they’d known at the beginning how large their loan payment was going to be relative to their monthly income.

Payback, and the financial literacy work Mr. Ranzetta has been doing for years (which he pays for out of his own savings), is his attempt to open students’ eyes.

Once he persuaded McKinney to help him, he began working with Jenny Nicholson, one of the creators of Spent. Her work on that project was informed by her own childhood, part of which she spent in Tennessee without running water or electricity.

When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. “I was richer, frankly, than I’d ever been in my life,” she said.

Photo

She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision — from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there — is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?

And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don’t act fast enough.

All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson’s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she’d had more fun and more friends.

Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.

Still, Brian Page, a high school teacher in Reading, Ohio, said he welcomed an additional teaching tool that is highly experiential. He should know, since he’s the educator I wrote about three years ago who takes his students on a yellow school bus tour of pawnshops and payday-lending stores to do math problems using those businesses’ terms and fine print. “It’s not just what you know,” he said. “It’s what you do with what you know.”

Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don’t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.

There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they’re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family’s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn’t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.

Still, teachers may quite reasonably fear a delicate dance around personal data when teaching about paying for college generally. “The potential teacher reluctance is with the social aspect, not with the topic,” said Laura Levine, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit group JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.

With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students’ peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. “My hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,” he said.

There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.

“I’ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,” she said. “But I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don’t have to give up everything to succeed.”",A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/your-money/paying-for-college/payback-college-loans.html

Slipping in and out of accents as well as plunging necklines, Adams — a virtuoso of complicated, seemingly contradictory moods — takes this shiny, flashy character and turns her into the most electric person in the movie. Adams studied acting for years and can cry at the drop of a dime, as she’s proved on more than one talk show. She has learned how to play the celebrity game: She knows how to chat up Jimmy Fallon, smile on the red carpet and keep cool when the paparazzi pounce. Significantly, she doesn’t give the gossip websites much material, even if she made a guest appearance in them this summer. “Fans freak that she’s pregnant after she wears flowy sundress,” one item exclaimed (erroneously). Adams seemed amused by the speculation. Stardom for women involves constant surveillance; shaking off these intrusions is crucial to maintaining and defending a private self.

A PARADOX OF stardom is that it depends on the appearance of an ordinary life. Some of this is about relatability, but it’s also about how actors fill performances up with their own humanity. In person, Adams seems nice, thoughtful, a touch vulnerable, which is how she sometimes appears on camera. (Big eyes help.) She also conveys appealing resilience. When she arrived for our interview she wasn’t accompanied by anxious handlers; when she left, she drove herself. She seems of our earth, not one of those exotic creatures whose celebrity becomes so otherworldly that it edges into camp. Yet like all stars, this palpable humanity comes with an ineluctable facility for both holding the screen and your attention. Adams seemed reluctant to see this in herself. When I mentioned Charlize Theron in passing, she lit up. “She can just sit on the couch, and you’re like, ‘That! That thing, what is it?’ That’s not me.”

I insisted that Adams was wrong, because while her appeal is different from Theron’s — Adams draws you to her, Theron keeps you at a distance — each makes you want to watch her and only her for as long as she’s on screen. Adams waved off the compliment. In someone else this might have read as false modesty, but she came across as someone who knows better than to trust other people’s admiration. It’s skepticism that feels grounded in experience. Adams found a manager soon after moving to Los Angeles in 1999 from Minnesota, where she had been working in dinner theater and dancing in regional musicals like “Brigadoon.” She was 24, with one movie credit (the 1999 beauty pageant satire “Drop Dead Gorgeous”), but she was also just another pretty young hopeful on a very crowded assembly line.

“I would go into auditions and it would be me and three model versions of me,” she said, “and I would never get the job.” It was the era of “Dawson’s Creek” and Katie Holmes. Adams did a lot of television (“I guest-starred on every WB show that was ever made”), but stripping down to a bikini to win a part wasn’t working for her. “I always thought it’s an ‘it’ factor and I just don’t have ‘it,’ ” she said. She credited her manager with helping her overcome self-doubt. “You get to decide what you want to be,” Adams recalled her manager telling her. “You get to decide that, Amy.”

She was still figuring it out when she landed the delectable role of an early 1960s candy striper in Steven Spielberg’s “Catch Me if You Can,” a 2002 biographical caper starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the con artist Frank Abagnale Jr. As Brenda, Adams weeps through much of her first scene with DiCaprio, her eyes red and watery, a hand hovering over her mouth as her character tries to hide her metal braces. DiCaprio is playing the seducer, and Adams is a stand-in for us, the soon-to-be seduced. Later, after Brenda’s braces come off and she clambers into Frank’s lap, Adams complicates the character’s innocence with heat, letting you see the clumsy girl and desiring woman at once.

Critics singled out Adams’s performance, but she was a supporting player in a Leonardo DiCaprio vehicle and, as she put it, the girl in braces: “It’s not like I had a beautiful gown with him walking down the steps of the Titanic.” The role brought her different kinds of auditions, but it was more a break than a breakthrough. When a writer friend pitched Adams to a studio for another project, the limits of Spielberg’s largess became conspicuous. The studio’s response, as Adams described it to me, was: “Oh, the homely girl from ‘Catch Me if You Can.’ ” That’s preposterous and offensive, and typical of the industry’s sexism. Adams, however, didn’t frame it that way: “I can’t blame anything other than I did not do my best at that point. I don’t think I inspired confidence.”

Confidence is a thread that wends through many stories about successful women who need to overcome not only their own insecurities but also a world that greets female achievement with ambivalence at best. When we spoke, Adams largely narrated her history in personal terms, but it was clear that the industry played its part. “I was getting ready to turn 30,” she said of the period that followed “Catch Me if You Can.” “I was tired of being unhappy and tired of chasing something that might not belong to me, like a career in film and television.” She was ready to let go of what she thought “being an actress was, or this idea of being a movie star, this idea of being ‘it,’ of being The Girl.” She was thinking of moving to New York to focus on her craft and start over. And then “Junebug” happened.

Adams’s role as a pregnant innocent, Ashley, in this little-seen 2005 independent movie was part of what became a slow-moving career trifecta. If “Catch Me if You Can” indicated that she was a fresh talent, “Junebug” suggested the richness of her range, showing her gift for moving from emotional lightness to darkness and back again. With crystalline sensitivity, Adams makes you care deeply about Ashley, whose virtue carries great narrative weight; even for those who didn’t respond to “Junebug” and its contrived hokum, the performance was a reminder of how a single actor can nearly redeem a movie. (It led to her first Oscar nomination.) Adams’s next leap forward came with the Disney hit “Enchanted,” which depends entirely on her to transform a high concept — a cartoon princess becomes human — into a delightful fairy story. Adams, who studied dance, sweeps into the movie with grace, tremulous feeling and fluttering hands, delivering an extraordinary performance that established that she had arrived at last.

SINCE THEN THERE have been juicier roles and steady acclaim and, of course, more Oscar nominations. In 2015, Adams married her longtime boyfriend, Darren Le Gallo, an artist she met in acting class, with whom she has a daughter, Aviana, named after Aviano, the Italian city where Adams, a military brat, was born. (Adams is one of seven children in a family that was Mormon until her parents’ divorce.) Having Aviana led Adams to again rethink her relationship to work. “I had to learn how to shut the door when I walk off the set. It’s hard and it doesn’t always work, but more often than not it does now,” she says. Long hours and location shoots can be tough on families, but having a husband who is willing to pack up with Adams helps. “We’ve realized we can be happy in an apartment in Detroit or a house in Hollywood or a hotel room,” she said. “It’s a good feeling, but I’m protective of it — very protective.”

It can be tricky shutting that door on a project like “Sharp Objects,” where she plays a reporter chasing a grisly story and where, for the first time, she has an executive producer credit. “What was exciting for me was being part of the creative development,” Adams said, “getting to feel comfortable speaking, feeling like that was my role now. Like, oh wait, I have an opinion and I’m going to share it!” She enjoyed it, but is unsure how much more producing she wants to do. “I can multitask,” she said, “it’s just an intense experience. And especially when you’re working every day of production, all day every day, in a dark character, and then trying to manage the other stuff — for me it was challenging.”

Those challenges extended to the set, including one day when, for a tricky single take, she had to crawl on a bathroom floor while weeping and drinking fake vomit she then had to spit up. As she was crawling and weeping and vomiting, a male crew member kept whispering the location of a prop until she finally barked, “I’ve got it, I’ve got it!” She apologized, explaining that she’d been staying in character. “He was trying to be helpful,” she told me. It’s the kind of response that I’d expected from Adams — but I had misunderstood her. I thought she was illustrating how she had gone to a psychologically dark place, but the point was that she knew she was right to call this man out. “I feel partially responsible for the tone that’s on set,” Adams said. “I’m sorry for how he felt, but I knew why I was doing that.”

Adams was standing up for herself, which is what we demand of women. What we sometimes forget, however, is that not every woman is going to speak up on her own behalf — or for other women — in exactly the same way or necessarily as a political declaration, and that she shouldn’t have to, either. What happened after Sony Pictures Entertainment was hacked in 2014 offers a good feminist case in point. Among all the ugly, embarrassing information that the hack revealed was that both Adams and Jennifer Lawrence had been paid less than their male co-stars in “American Hustle.” Lawrence went public with her feelings about the wage gap and was by turns praised and condemned for doing so. Adams said she was proud of Lawrence but made it repeatedly clear she didn’t want to discuss it in detail, if at all.

“I don’t want to talk about my own experience because I fight my own fight and I feel comfortable doing that,” Adams said when I mentioned the hack. And, as she admitted, “There’s not a lot of empathy out there for celebrities.” But the disparity that the Sony hack revealed made her curious. Years earlier, to prepare for some of her period movies, she had started reading books like “The Feminine Mystique.” (“I didn’t go to college. I didn’t do women’s studies. I had no idea.”) After the hack, she dug in again. “I spent a lot more time educating myself about what women executives get paid.” She read about C.E.O.s and teachers, the sociology and cultural conditioning.

“It’s important to talk about inequality,” Adams said. “But for me, where I feel most empowered is in educating myself and being, hopefully, a mentor for younger women. That’s more important. I offer any young actress I work with my phone number. I’ll tell them on set, ‘You don’t have to do that. You can say no.’ ” It seems like a modest gesture, but less so when you consider that the movie industry has long profited from female submission, from women acquiescing because their only choice is exploitation or unemployment. This is what makes women saying no powerful, and why it’s heartening that many are speaking up. Adams speaks up when she wants, how she wants, and she is saying yes — and no — on her own terms. These days, instead of telling her daughter “Don’t be bossy,” Adams asks her little girl who she is the boss of. “And she says, ‘Me.’ And I say, ‘That’s right. And you get to choose who you are.’ ”",The Versatile and Resilient Amy Adams,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/t-magazine/amy-adams.html

This summer, Somali lawmakers and some international donors claimed to have seriously weakened the Shabab amid efforts by the United States and African-backed forces, called Amisom, to wrest control of Shabab-held territories and kill key figures of the organization in drone strikes.

At a conference in London in May, world powers agreed on plans to support and train Somalia’s army and take over a task currently performed by African Union troops.

However, analysts say that the Shabab’s capacity for mayhem remains far from diminished. In fact, in recent weeks, Shabab operatives have been gaining ground. On Saturday, as the bombs went off, the group took over the town of Bariire, just 31 miles from Mogadishu in the Lower Shabelle region.

“It’s a cold, cold blast of reality,” said David Anderson, a professor of African politics at Warwick University in Britain.

The Shabab had never really disappeared. “It is a guerrilla organization that is really quite efficient in what it does. It makes fewer attacks now but kills far more. The Shabab are getting better at targeting, as this attack shows.”

The bombings were carried out by drivers of two trucks, crammed with explosives, who drove through multiple checkpoints on a tightly patrolled highway. Their easy access raised questions over whether Shabab infiltrators had compromised security.

“No one likes to talk about this, partly because it’s difficult to quantify,” Professor Anderson said. “It’s widely accepted that most of the institutions and organs of the Somali state are infiltrated by the Shabab.”

The bombings also highlighted divisions within the government, particularly the security services, and the weakness of President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, who came to power eight months ago with high expectations. His leadership has been further undermined by infighting among clans that control different parts of the government, which may have made the capital more vulnerable to Shabab attacks.

“There was a lot of friction, parallel commands, which bubbled to the surface,” Mr. Abdi said. “That should have sent of a clear warning signal, and the Shabab took advantage of that situation.”

In recent years the Shabab have also capitalized on growing religious conservatism in the region, propelled by poverty and despair. Moderate gains in recent years as measured in elections and more inclusive government could easily disappear, analysts say.

“There are large parts of the country lacking in opportunities and livelihoods, and the Shabab have been able to take advantage of that,” said Ahmed Soliman, an expert on Somalia at Chatham House, a London-based research group.

“The solution for the Shabab isn’t to drone-strike it away,” he said. But if international interest in Somalia diminishes, “there can be an unraveling of the progresses made in government and institutions.”

In Washington on Monday, Pentagon officials said they were examining options to send additional trainers and advisers to Somalia in case the Somalia government requested such assistance. But the senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, ruled out any major American troop deployments to the African country.

Eight residents, including Ms. Hibbard, died that day and six more died in the days and weeks that followed. More than 100 people were evacuated to hospitals and other nursing homes.

The callers, sometimes nurses or nursing assistants, attempted to remain calm, but often sounded pressured, exhausted and overwhelmed as they answered questions about the conditions of the patients. All were reported to be having severe difficulty breathing.

“Oh my God, this is crazy,” a woman making the fourth call said at around 6:15 a.m. as she struggled to find a patient’s age in the nursing home’s computer system, which had a separate power source. “We are initiating CPR at this moment,” she said. Then, sounding flustered, she gave the phone to another woman.

“They have a crash cart there, they’re working on her now as we speak,” the second woman said, referring to the wheeled supply cart used for resuscitations.

Gov. Rick Scott has criticized the nursing home for failing to call 911 on behalf of its residents, and the deaths remain under police investigation. The newly released audio demonstrates that the nursing home staff did indeed call 911 for patients that Wednesday morning, as well as for two patients the previous two days.

But by the time the calls were made, the residents were suffering respiratory distress, and in some cases dying.

According to information provided by the police, a call was made on Monday, Sept. 11, a day after Hurricane Irma made landfall in Florida.

That call was made for an 81-year-old woman on the second floor who was experiencing breathing problems. A second 911 call was made around midday on Tuesday, on behalf of a 93-year-old man. “He had a fever,” a woman told the 911 operator. “We started, you know, ordering the tests for him and stuff, but he’s getting short of breath now.”

The 911 audio was released by the police after two local newspapers, The Sun-Sentinel and The Miami Herald, went to court to demand them under the state’s public records statutes.

“Investigators have now completed witness interviews related to the 911 calls and have determined that the audio can be released without jeopardizing the ongoing investigation,” the police said in a news release.

Several families of residents who died have sued the home. The governor, through the state’s health agency, moved to shut down the nursing home. The home has filed a legal challenge.

Hollywood Hills, one of many nursing homes in South Florida that lost power after the hurricane, has noted that state officials and the power company were repeatedly called for help in restoring electricity to the air conditioning. In one of the 911 calls made on Sept. 13, a worker at the Broward County emergency operations center noted that the day before, a psychiatric facility that shared the same building as the nursing home, and also had no air conditioning, had called the county for assistance.

On Monday, Geoffrey D. Smith, a lawyer for the nursing home, said the home could not comment on the 911 calls because it had not yet heard them. “We have been asking for these records since the incidents occurred,” he said in an email. “To date, we have not had access to the 911 calls and are still waiting for responses to our multiple public record requests.”

After the deaths, the governor released an emergency rule that will require all nursing homes and assisted living facilities, by Nov. 15, to have generators and enough fuel to keep their facilities at safe temperatures. In the past, nursing homes have resisted similar measures, citing cost, and several industry groups have filed legal challenges to the new rule. Last week, the state’s health care agency said that homes could request extensions “under extreme circumstances.”

Inside the overheated nursing home that Wednesday, the calls, over the space of just a few hours, became more frequent and urgent as the situation turned dire.

“I have another patient that’s in respiratory distress,” one caller said.

“Make sure to check on the patient, please! I’m on this call,” she said to someone else in the home. “I’m on the phone for the next patient.”

“She’s not breathing!” she said to the operator, who told her to locate a defibrillator. “Yes, a defibrillator, get a defibrillator for her,” the woman told someone else, then returned to the phone.

Right now it looks as if tax “reform” — actually it’s just cuts — may go the way of Obamacare repeal. Initial assessments of the plan are brutal, and administration attempts to spin things in a positive direction will suffer from loss of credibility on multiple fronts, from obvious lies about the plan itself, to spreading corruption scandals, to the spectacle of the tweeter-in-chief golfing while Puerto Rico drowns.

Now, it ain’t over until the portly golfer sings. But still, it’s worth spending a few minutes on why a fresh debacle seems likely.

The important point is that there are crucial links between the health care faceplant and the bad news (for the GOP) on taxes — links both causal and, you might say, cultural.

Republicans took power in January determined to cut taxes on the wealthy, bigly. That has, after all, been the GOP establishment’s overriding priority for four decades; it’s what donors demand.

But they’re somewhat constrained by concerns about deficits. It’s not that they themselves care about red ink: nobody with influence in the GOP has ever cared about federal debt, least of all the deficit peacocks who preened and posed as apostles of fiscal responsibility. But all that posturing makes budget-busting tax cuts awkward. And procedural issues in the Senate also make it hard to do too much budget-busting without 60 seats.

One important goal of ACA repeal was to loosen those constraints, by repealing the high-end tax hikes that paid for Obamacare, hence giving a big break to the donor class. Having failed to do that, Rs are under even more pressure to deliver the goods to the wealthy through tax cuts.

But deficits are a constraint, even if not a hard one. Now, Republicans have always claimed that they can cut tax rates without losing revenue by closing loopholes. But they’ve always avoided saying anything about which loopholes they’d close; they promised to shift the tax burden away from their donors onto [TK], some mystery group. It was magic asterisk city; it was “Don’t tax you, don’t tax me, tax that fellow behind the tree” on steroids.

But as they sidle up toward actual legislation, they need to start getting specific: the shifts need to get real. So where will the money come from?

The bright answer in Trumpcuts is, end the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT). This probably sounded like a good idea: hey, it will punish blue states, which foolishly collect a lot of taxes to do things like feed people and treat their illnesses.

But there are a lot of Republican voters in blue states, and even a significant number of Republican Congressmen. And who are these voters? By and large, affluent but not super-rich households — hence with relatively high marginal tax rates — for whom deductibility of SALT is a big deal. As the details of the plan sink in, these people will scream bloody murder, and their representatives will become a big problem for the leadership.

So what were they thinking? My guess is that they weren’t thinking. What we learned from health care was that after 8 years, Republicans had never bothered to learn anything about the issues. There’s every reason to believe that the same is true for the distribution of tax changes, which Paul Ryan called a “ridiculous” issue and presumably nobody in his party ever tried to understand.

So now the lies and willful ignorance are catching up with them — again.",Shifts Get Real: Understanding the GOP’s Policy Quagmire,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/09/30/shifts-get-real-understanding-the-gops-policy-quagmire/

The gay managers of that era were forthright about their sexuality, if only among friends and colleagues.
“As gay men, we have to remake ourselves in order to survive,” he said.
“It’s not like a gay man at the time could marry or enjoy a family,” Mr. Cooper said.
In the case of Mr. Epstein, Mr. Tiwary believes the message went beyond sex.","That understanding played out in memorable Rolling Stone images like David Cassidy showing off his naked torso down to his pubic hair, in a Playboy-style centerfold, and Jim Morrison smoldering next to the cover line “He’s Hot, He’s Sexy, He’s Dead.”

Jock McLean, who worked as an assistant to George Harrison 50 years ago, noticed the depth of the relationship between the Beatles and Mr. Epstein one August day not long before the manager’s death. Mr. McLean’s job was to pick up the singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson, a promising new artist in those days, and drive him to a meeting with Mr. Harrison at the house he was renting on Blue Jay Way in the Hollywood Hills, Calif.

There was talk of Mr. Nilsson perhaps joining the Beatles nascent company. That’s when things went sour, Mr. McLean said.

“George was talking about how wonderful the whole thing was going to be, trying to convince Harry to join the company,” Mr. McLean recalled. “It was all great until Harry said, ‘The only thing is, I don’t think I could be managed by a gay man.’” (Mr. Epstein’s sexuality was known by many in the industry at the time.)

Incensed, Mr. Harrison gave his assistant a nod.

“In a heartbeat, Harry was out of the house,” Mr. McLean said. “George, like all the Beatles, was extremely supportive of Brian. To them, Brian was the man.” (After Mr. Epstein died, Mr. Nilsson had a rapprochement with the band and worked closely with John Lennon.)

Roger Daltrey, the lead singer of the Who, had a similar respect for Mr. Lambert, who had an upper-class background at a time when those of his tier rarely interacted with working-class ruffians like Mr. Daltrey.

“Kit was the only ‘posh’ guy I ever met who wouldn’t talk down to me,” Mr. Daltrey said in “Lambert & Stamp.” “Kit had this fearless quality.”

At the time, men like Mr. Lambert had to. Up until 1967, being gay was illegal in Britain, and long after that law changed, gay men remained a target of police entrapment, blackmail and beatings. Mr. Epstein was assaulted and was the target of blackmail before he died in 1967 from an accidental overdose of sleeping pills and alcohol.

At the same time, many of these men had great power within their circle. As managers of some of the era’s most potent British rock bands, they stood at the forefront of sounds, sensibilities and styles that would demolish and remake pop culture.

The gay managers of that era were forthright about their sexuality, if only among friends and colleagues. Besides Mr. Epstein and Mr. Lambert, those men included Robert Stigwood (manager of Cream and the Bee Gees), Simon Napier-Bell (the Yardbirds, Marc Bolan), Billy Gaff (Rod Stewart), Ken Pitt (David Bowie), Barry Krost (Cat Stevens) and Larry Parnes (who molded pre-Beatles British rockers, including Tommy Steele to Billy Fury).

Photo

Their sexual orientation was mirrored by Americans including Nat Weiss (who oversaw the Beatles’ business interests and later managed James Taylor), Danny Fields (who managed Iggy Pop and the Stooges and, later, the Ramones), as well as music moguls including David Geffen and Clive Davis (who identifies as bisexual).

According to Mr. Napier-Bell, part of the reason British gay men of his era gravitated to the music business was because it was one of the few areas “where you could be out amongst yourselves. It was like a private club,” he said. “It was such a good life. You’d go to Robert Stigwood’s house and it was like a gay pub.”

Jim Fouratt, who has worked in the music industry since the 1960s, believes the men in Mr. Napier-Bell’s circle brought to the emerging rock scene a special understanding of image. “As gay men, we have to remake ourselves in order to survive,” he said. “That matches perfectly with the masquerade of rock ’n’ roll, with the fantasy.”

Martin Aston, the author of “Breaking Down the Walls of Heartache: How Music Became Gay,” said the connection between rock’s gay managers and image molding stems from the fact that “gay men at the time would be judged almost entirely on how they looked. It wasn’t like there were lots of nice places to go and have lovely conversations. It was all communicated through cruising.”

As a result, Mr. Aston said, gay men developed a comfort with the art of being seen, “as opposed to straight men, who, before the phenomenon of the ‘metrosexual,’ were threatened by the notion of being looked at, of becoming an object.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Vivek Tiwary, the author of the “The Fifth Beatle,” argues that Mr. Epstein’s sexual orientation had a strong influence on the Beatles’ public image.

“Brian Epstein’s attraction to all of the Beatles, and in particular to John, allowed him to create an image for the band that was appealing not just to girls, but also to boys,” Mr. Tiwary said. “Brian knew what it was like to be a boy, as well as how to attract them. A straight manager might just think, ‘Here’s a bunch of cute boys that girls will love.’ He might make them so girl-friendly that they seem too weak for guys to get into them.”

One of Mr. Epstein’s pivotal decisions was to change the Beatles’ outfits, from denim and leather to natty suits. Using the best local tailors, he got the band into single-breasted, three-button mohair suits, with narrow labels and even narrower pants, according to Mark Lewisohn in his book on the band, “Tune In.”

By honing such looks, the managers did more than influence the presentation of musicians. They advanced the image of a new kind of man. As the ’60s progressed, androgyny became central to male display, with long hair, brightly colored clothing, and, in the case of the mods of the mid-’60s, flashy tailored suits.

“The mods loved nothing more than to be seen walking down the street, sharp dressed with sharkskin pants and makeup,” said James Cooper, the director of “Lambert & Stamp.” “These tough guys wore eyeliner.”

Mr. Fouratt thinks that much of the permission for the gender blurring came from the spreading drug culture. “Drugs allowed men and boys to discover their beauty and femininity,” he said. “The foppishness of rock stars is like the peacock, where the male is the beautiful one, not the female. That became the forefront in rock ’n’ roll, encouraged by the gay managers.”

It played out most clearly in a star like Mick Jagger, who adopted a campy and preening persona, affects shared by the Rolling Stones’ first manager, Andrew Loog Oldham.

“Mick was attractive for that preening,” Mr. Oldham said. “Many men might say to their mates, ‘Oh, he’s a poof!’ So they didn’t mind their wives or girlfriends enjoying him.”

Straight rock stars also found that appropriating the sensual awareness of gay men paid off in sexual opportunities. “David Bowie had to force the working-class guys in his band the Spiders from Mars to wear those glam clothes,” Mr. Aston said. “But as soon as they saw the impact it had on women, they were like, ‘Pass me the blush!’”

Still, given the vilification of homosexuality at the time, one might expect the rockers to have some discomfort with the gay men who advised them. In the case of the Who, Mr. Cooper believes the members bonded with Mr. Lambert not in spite of his sexual identity but in some ways because of it. The unlikeliness, and mutual risk, of the connection between Mr. Lambert (an upper-class, privileged gay man) and his partner in management, Chris Stamp (a straight street kid) impressed them deeply.

“The unconditional bond their managers had gave them an aura of invincibility,” Mr. Cooper said. “It also gave them a mystery: Who were these guys? If these guys were capable of bonding, they could be capable of anything.”

Mr. Lambert played that aspect up, stoking the Who’s budding interest in cultural disruption and advising the band’s leader, Pete Townshend. “Kit was telling the press that the Who were a new form of social crime,” Mr. Cooper said. “He told Pete, ‘When you give an interview, leave a wound. Oh, and by the way, smash your instruments.’”

Mr. Napier-Bell sees the entire notion of rock ’n’ roll rebellion as an extension of “gay anger.” “We were against the establishment, the government and the law, which was against us,” he said. “It was an attitude felt by the managers that was expressed through their groups.”

At the same time, many of the gay men came from more refined backgrounds than the rockers, an experience they transferred to their charges. “Brian came from a world of classical music and jazz,” Mr. Tiwary said. “He envisioned that the Beatles would be like the great classical composers and be remembered long after they were gone.”

Mr. Lambert, whose father was a prominent classical composer, pushed Mr. Townshend to write a rock opera, resulting in “Tommy.” “Kit molded me as a composer,” Mr. Townshend said in “Lambert & Stamp.”

If the young rockers benefited from the taste and ambition of their gay advisers, in turn the managers got a sense of connection they otherwise couldn’t achieve. “It’s not like a gay man at the time could marry or enjoy a family,” Mr. Cooper said. “With a band, there’s a sense of an extended family. They could raise and nurture the musicians and put all the complexity of their experience into something of worth.”

At the same time, the gay men involved with the bands found a route to power. “Where else could they get that feeling of being primary?” Mr. Cooper said. “It was a way to have impact and relevance.”

And in an era when gay sexual expression was brutally suppressed, the men were able to express themselves through the most influential sex symbols of the day, creating a kind of erotic ventriloquism.

“Whatever thoughts, feelings and longings they had in themselves could be played out in a band — and in front of an entire arena full of people,” Mr. Cooper said.

In the case of Mr. Epstein, Mr. Tiwary believes the message went beyond sex.

“It’s the great tragedy of the Brian Epstein story that he died lonely, never having a proper boyfriend,” Mr. Tiwary said. “I believe the fact that Brian couldn’t love openly made him dedicate himself to spreading a message of love with the Beatles. Through them, he had the chance to spread that love all over the world.”",The Gay Architects of Classic Rock,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/style/the-gay-architects-of-classic-rock.html

Other research published in the journal Health Economics supports the pollution hypothesis. In their analysis of the Great Recession in Europe, José Tapia Granados of Drexel University and Edward Ionides of the University of Michigan found that a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a one percent lower mortality rate for respiratory illnesses, as well as reductions in mortality for cardiovascular disease and heart conditions, which are known to be sensitive to air pollution. In countries where the recession was more severe — the Baltic States, Spain, Greece and Slovenia — respiratory disease mortality fell 16 percent during 2007-2010, compared with just a 3.2 percent decline in the four years preceding the recession.

Other factors contribute to rising mortality during expansions. Occupational hazards and stress can directly harm health through work. Some studies find that alcohol and tobacco consumption increases during booms, too. Both are associated with higher death rates. Also, employed people drive more, increasing mortality from auto accidents.

During recessions, people without jobs may have more time to sleep and exercise and may eat more healthfully. One study found that higher unemployment is associated with lower rates of obesity, increased physical activity and a better diet. On the other hand, suicides increase during economic downturns.

Some recent work suggests that economic booms may have become less deadly and busts more so in recent years. This could be a result of less polluting production in modern, expanding economies, or of better medical care for those with conditions sensitive to pollution. Safer roads and cars, and less driving under the influence of alcohol and other substances, could also play a role.

“It’s also possible that opioids and other drugs may have made recessions more harmful to health than they used to be,” Mr. Cutler said.

Other analysis shows that although smaller economic booms increase mortality, larger ones decrease it. Japan’s economic booms in the 1960s and 1970s are associated with longer life spans there, for example. Serious and lengthy downturns — like the Great Depression — are associated with shorter lives, even as smaller ones lengthen them.

Wealthier nations are healthier nations, an effect seen across generations. People in their formative years — children and teenagers — are particularly sensitive to the economic environment. Conditions in utero can have lasting health and economic effects. Graduating from college during a recession can depress one’s earnings for a decade. People growing up during a strong economy are more likely to have access to resources and to develop skills and opportunities that promote health. These benefits can last a lifetime, increasing longevity.

In total, there’s little question that long-term economic growth broadly improves the human condition. But not everyone enjoys the gains equally.

As with the case of Mr. O’Reilly, their findings were bolstered not just by testimony but by legal documents and company records.
“If you look across these various episodes, there are a lot of similarities,” Ms. Steel said.
Ms. Kantor and Ms. Twohey were likewise unaware of the dimensions of the Weinstein case when they began working on it.
Mr. Weinstein was fired by the Weinstein Company three days after The Times’s first report was published.","And on Oct. 5, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey revealed that the Hollywood megaproducer Harvey Weinstein has been confronted with sexual harassment allegations for nearly three decades, and in at least eight cases has reached settlements with his accusers. Many more accusations of harassment and assault have been leveled at Mr. Weinstein — on the pages of The Times, in other publications and on social media — in the days since. As with the case of Mr. O’Reilly, their findings were bolstered not just by testimony but by legal documents and company records.

All of these journalists say they experienced much the same thing while reporting: ever more women telling the same stories about a small handful of powerful men.

“If you look across these various episodes, there are a lot of similarities,” Ms. Steel said. “Men offering career advancements and then asking somebody up to their hotel room, or building a relationship with someone and then making these unwanted sexual advances.”

She and Mr. Schmidt began their investigation into Mr. O’Reilly’s conduct by looking at the case of Andrea Mackris, a former Fox producer who sued him for harassment in 2004. They learned that Ms. Mackris wasn’t the only one who had made allegations of this nature.

Ms. Kantor and Ms. Twohey were likewise unaware of the dimensions of the Weinstein case when they began working on it. “In a way, we’re asking the same questions now as we were at the start of the reporting,” Ms. Kantor said, “which is, what is the scale and scope of this thing?”

There are a number of factors that make allegations of sexual harrassment difficult to report. In all three cases, reporters said sources were hesitant to speak out because their allegations were so intimate; because they feared reprisal by powerful men; and in many instances, the women involved had entered into settlements that included nondisclosure agreements.

“Until reporting on this, I didn’t realize the extent that these settlements and these confidentiality agreements played in this whole ecosystem,” Ms. Steel said. “As soon as a woman signs this, she can’t talk about her allegations ever again.”

Given the challenges, these stories required weeks or months of painstaking work. “Getting people to speak on the record about these painful experiences requires time, patience and establishing trust,” said Matt Purdy, a deputy managing editor at The Times. “We have given reporters that time and the support of editors because this is a subject that absolutely demands to be brought into the open in a big way.”

Mr. Schmidt and Ms. Steel took nearly eight months with the O’Reilly story; Ms. Benner worked for over a month on the Silicon Valley article; and Ms. Kantor and Ms. Twohey spent four months working on the Weinstein case. (That included, for several weeks near the end, a number of consecutive nights spent at the office until midnight or 1 a.m. Their editor, Rebecca Corbett, who heads The Times’s investigative projects desk, sometimes stayed even later.)

The reporters weren’t immune, either, to much the same kind of intimidation and bullying their sources said they’d faced. “The people who carried out the unacceptable behavior threw up as many hurdles as possible,” said Pui-Wing Tam, The Times’s technology editor, who worked on the Silicon Valley story. “Many used threats, yelling and blamed the victims. At times, they called me to try and undermine the credibility of the reporters themselves.”

(“What can I say?” she added. “That just won’t work, folks.”)

And Mr. Weinstein threatened to sue The Times this month. “He had one high-priced consultant or lawyer after another — ” Ms. Kantor began.

“An army,” Ms. Twohey confirmed. “It was an army attacking us.”

Ms. Steel, meanwhile, had already been subject to the displeasure of Mr. O’Reilly. When reporting an unrelated article on him in February 2015, he’d called her and told her, on the record: “I am coming after you with everything I have,” and, “You can take it as a threat.”

The experience equipped Ms. Steel with an empathetic perspective while reporting the harassment story two years later. “When I was talking to sources, I knew what it was like to be on the other side of a phone call when O’Reilly was saying threatening things,” she said.

And when it came to telling their stories, at least some of the women featured in all three articles were heartened by The Times’s commitment to the topic.

“We did have some sources who had never spoken to another journalist,” Ms. Kantor said. They opened up to her and Ms. Twohey in part, they said, because they had seen the success of the O’Reilly and Silicon Valley stories.

Still, all the reporters emphasized that their motivation wasn’t advocacy. “We didn’t seek out to do this reporting to take someone down,” Ms. Steel said.

Ms. Kantor concurred. “Sometimes sources would say things to me like, ‘Go get him,’” Ms. Kantor said. “I don’t have any personal animus toward Harvey Weinstein. For us, this is really just about uncovering the truth.”

For all three cases, that process of uncovering has had a dual effect. On one hand, to discover the extent of the allegations — and the pervasiveness of the culture — has been overwhelming. The reporters said they spent days afterward sorting through dozens of tips; Ms. Steel said people working across a range of industries asked her to look into their similar experiences. As she put it, “It’s disheartening to see that there’s still this power imbalance and that this culture of misogyny really remains in our businesses and in our lives.”

On the other hand, the investigations are beginning to have powerful real-life consequences. Mr. Weinstein was fired by the Weinstein Company three days after The Times’s first report was published. Mr. O’Reilly was ousted by Fox News on April 19. And the venture capitalist Dave McClure stepped down from his company, 500 Startups, several days after Ms. Benner’s report.

The journalists agreed that there has also been an accompanying shift in the culture around disclosure. “I think that what you saw almost immediately was a growing safe space for more women to come forward and tell their stories,” Ms. Twohey said. One source, she said, had been particularly frightened about potential blowback but has since received many notes of gratitude — even flowers, Ms. Twohey said.

Ms. Steel said she was struck, in the course of doing research, by how differently the media portrays these women’s stories even since Andrea Mackris first filed suit against Mr. O’Reilly (and her personal life was subsequently dragged through the mud in the tabloids) in 2004.

“I’ve thought a lot about that,” Ms. Steel said. “There’s this whole history of women who have made these allegations before. How would their stories have been told today?”

“Now that Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow have come forward, I wonder if it will take some of the weird societal sting out of it,” Ms. Benner said. “We are so much more than the bad things that happen to us.”",How to Break a Sexual Harassment Story,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/15/insider/sexual-harassment-weinstein-oreilly.html

“In modern times this has got be an unprecedented event, and a major hazard for the public and for property owners,” said Dr. Alan Lockwood, a retired neurologist who has written widely about public health. He said an apt comparison might be the environmental cleanup after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in New York, as debris and dust swirled through Lower Manhattan.

As could well happen too in California, Dr. Lockwood said, the health and environmental effects were felt long after the attack, in the chemicals or pollutants workers and responders at the site, and the public at large, may been exposed to as the cleanup went on.

Household building materials are obviously different from the components of a concrete tower. But they pose risks too. Treated wood in a house’s frame, for instance, put there to prevent bacteria growth, can contain copper, chromium and arsenic. Consumer electronics contain metals like lead, mercury and cadmium. Older homes might have asbestos shingles. Even galvanized nails are a concern because when they melt they release zinc. All are potentially harmful.

“It’s a completely complex mixed bag of different stuff that’s there,” said Geoffrey S. Plumlee, associate director for environmental health with the United States Geological Survey.

Dr. Plumlee led a study after several Southern California wildfires in 2007 that found that ash from burned-out residential areas contained elevated levels of arsenic, antimony and metals including lead, copper and chromium. In most cases the levels were above federal Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for soil remediation.

After a fire in Slave Lake, Alberta, in 2011 that destroyed about 400 homes, the city landfill was found to be leaching toxins after fire debris was deposited there.

In California, the road ahead to cleanup and the safe return to properties will probably not be smooth or fast, public health officials and cleanup experts said. The sheer number of communities affected and properties destroyed creates a greater challenge than any the state has faced in recent history.

Local and state agencies, focused on active fires, have not yet sorted out who will take the leadership roles. Even determining how severely lands are affected and the estimated costs of remediation lay ahead in the weeks and months to come.

At a packed public meeting in the basketball gym at Santa Rosa High School on Saturday, some residents said they worried that the cleanup could go on for years and asked state officials if they could proceed on their own.

The answer they got was a qualified yes. An approved contractor can be hired, if one is available. Otherwise the cleanup should be free in most cases, residents were told, paid for with taxpayer money or private insurance if a homeowner has a debris-removal clause in the insurance policy on the house.

But state and federal officials said on Monday that many of the details of how this cleanup would work remained unsettled. That is partly because the focus has been on response to the fires and the fatalities, and the 40,000 people still evacuated from their homes, but also because of the complex mix of properties affected on both public and private lands.

“There are more questions than answers,” said David Passey, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He said, for example, that FEMA, the federal government’s lead disaster response agency, typically concentrated on public property, not private, unless individual counties declare the private properties a public health and safety risk. Counties and cities can also take the lead on cleanup, he said, and that too has not been fully sorted out.

“We don’t know yet which of those solutions, or mixture of those solutions, the cities and counties will choose,” Mr. Passey said.

Mark Oldfield, a spokesman for the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, which administers state-managed waste handling and recycling programs, said a typical situation for cleanup would include a kind of triage, with the most hazardous materials as a site handled first, typically by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control. That agency would evaluate and remove hazardous debris, which can range from asbestos siding or pipe insulation to paints, batteries, flammable liquids and electronic waste like computers and monitors.

After that, contractors under CalRecycle’s auspices could focus on remaining debris removal for recycling (metals and concrete) or disposal (ash and contaminated soil), Mr. Oldfield said. Then the land could be prepared for potential rebuilding. But, he added, “With fires still active in many areas, there is not yet a timetable for cleanup efforts to begin.”

Dr. Relucio, Napa County’s public health director, said that in the meantime, people who go back to their properties should protect their eyes, lungs and skin, with long sleeves and pants, boots, glasses, and a good quality N95-rated mask available in most hardware stores.

Dr. Lockwood said a secondary caution for anyone entering a burned site is human idiosyncrasy, in the things people store in garages, use in their hobbies or just never got around to throwing away.

And therein lies the rub: It is not clear that the intent of these “headline” valuations is to trick anyone.","And if the special side deals that most unicorn companies offer to certain investors — more on this sleight of hand in a moment — are taken into account, almost half of the companies would fall below the $1 billion threshold.

“These financial structures and their valuation implications can be confusing and are grossly misunderstood not just by outsiders, but even by sophisticated insiders,” Mr. Strebulaev and Mr. Gornall wrote in a report on their research, describing most private investments as a “black box.”

That black box increasingly has relevance not just to gossips in Silicon Valley, but also to public investors. Big mutual fund companies like T. Rowe Price and BlackRock have aggressively begun investing in unicorn companies in recent years on behalf of public investors — yes, you may own a stake in Uber and not even know it — helping to increase the valuations even further.

And even the big public mutual funds, the researchers contend, are not properly valuing the assets. “It is inappropriate to equate post-money valuations and fair values,” the professors said, explaining how, more often than not, public funds use the headline price that comes after a round of financing, and don’t distinguish between various types of shares.

One of the many ways that some companies inflate their valuations, for instance, is by offering certain investors guaranteed valuations in an initial public offering. In other words, if a company doesn’t reach a certain valuation at the time of an I.P.O., it will issue the investor more shares to make up the difference between the guaranteed price and the one that was attained. Effectively, all the other common shareholders end up paying the difference — and often don’t know it.

“Shares issued to investors differ substantially not just between companies but between the different financing rounds of a single company, with different share classes generally having different cash flow and control rights,” the researchers said.

Mr. Strebulaev said he was shocked when he dug into the contracts of the different fund-raising rounds. “The overvaluation is so large because many of these companies use sophisticated contracts that benefit some investors at the expense of other investors,” he said. Without identifying a particular company, he said some of the deals were “mind boggling.”

Worst of all, he said, he believes that “the people who are hurt the most are employees.” He said that in many cases employees didn’t understand that the value of the options they had been granted were disconnected from whatever the latest headline valuation of their employer might be.

When Mr. Strebulaev first circulated a draft of his paper, he said, “a number of companies contacted me, or, rather, their general counsels contacted me.” He encouraged them to point out mistakes or factual errors. “I haven’t heard back from them,” he said.

To cite one example from the research: In 2015, Appdynamics issued a Series F round with special terms for certain investors, including “a provision offering a 20% bonus in down I.P.O.s,” meaning one that fell in price. Legg Mason, already an investor, then revalued its shares in the company at a higher price, “despite not being eligible for the 20% bonus,” the professors wrote. “These examples are representative of common industry practices.”

In another example, the professors found that sometimes a fund-raising round painted an overly “rosy picture.” As an example, the professors used a particular fund-raising round from nearly a decade ago for SpaceX, arguing that “SpaceX’s value actually fell in 2008” while its reported valuation went up. The researchers said investors that year “were promised twice their money back in the event of a sale, with that claim senior to all other shareholders.”

“That guarantee increased the price those investors were willing to pay for SpaceX shares,” the professors said, “but did not alter its true value.”

Still, the professors were quick to say they did not believe that these terms were meant to manipulate investors.

He added: “I am prepared to dramatically restrict who can donate money to our campaign — including lawyers — and the amounts that our contributors are able to give.”

Mr. Vance has raised roughly $6.1 million for three campaigns, starting in 2009, and some of his most generous donors have been criminal lawyers and law firms who have also represented clients against his office. Such donations are legal under state law, and most of the state’s 62 district attorneys accept them.

In New York City, politicians who raise money through the city’s campaign finance system can accept only $400 from individuals with business before the city, and $4,950 from others. But those rules do not apply to the city’s prosecutors, who are county officials. They must comply with much higher limits for state office holders. In Manhattan, that limit is close to $50,000 for the general election.

In April 2015, Mr. Vance decided not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein, the movie mogul and Democratic Party donor, on charges that he groped an Italian model in his TriBeCa office during an interview.

Mr. Vance’s campaign accepted $32,000 from Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, five months after he made the decision not to pursue charges against the Trumps. He returned that donation this year after The New Yorker reported about it.

Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for Mr. Vance’s campaign, said a committee of lawyers currently vets donations to make sure they do not come from defendants in criminal matters. Then a senior member of Mr. Vance’s staff conducts a second review for other possible conflicts of interest, including spotting lawyers with pending cases. Since 2009, Mr. Vance has returned 31 contributions for about $134,000, but his campaign has not provided a breakdown.

Mr. Weinstein’s defense team boasted some of Mr. Vance’s most generous contributors: the white-collar defense lawyer Elkan Abramowitz, who is also Mr. Vance’s former law partner, and Linda Fairstein, a former Manhattan sex-crimes prosecutor who now writes crime novels. Each has donated a little more than $26,000 since 2009.

Other examples dot Mr. Vance’s campaign finance records. For instance, about $4,600 has been donated by Brafman and Associates, and its senior partner Benjamin Brafman, who represented two high-profile men accused of rape whom Mr. Vance eventually declined to prosecute: the financier Dominique Strauss-Kahn in 2011 and the lawyer Sanford A. Rubenstein in 2015.

Mr. Vance’s campaign also has received large checks regularly from Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, the law firm that represented Mayor Bill de Blasio during Mr. Vance’s investigation of the mayor’s campaign finances. In March, Mr. Vance declined to bring charges in that case as well.

Mr. Vance has said there was not enough evidence in those cases to prove that a crime had been committed. “There has never been a campaign contribution of any size that has any impact on my decision making on a case,” he said in an interview. “Some folks, I understand, find that hard to believe.”

Several defense lawyers said privately they gave to Mr. Vance’s campaign not to influence a specific case, but because it might help them gain access to Mr. Vance or his senior assistants.

“The reason why you donate and show up to their fund-raisers is so you can hopefully be at least recognized and get a meeting if necessary,” said one defense lawyer, requesting anonymity because he still has pending cases in Manhattan. “It’s standard New York politics.”","Running Unopposed, Vance Is Suddenly on the Defensive",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/nyregion/cyrus-vance-political-donations.html

He had traveled from his small town in Utah to the Catskill Mountains, to a celebration of photography where he studied with such masters of photojournalism as Mary Ellen Mark, Greg Heisler and Jodi Cobb.

A local high school band in Jeffersonville was playing a thunderous welcome as he entered a large, partly built barn. Inside he was greeted by the festival’s mastermind: Eddie Adams, the Pulitzer Prize-winning war photographer.

“Everybody who was anybody was there and I didn’t even know they existed,” said Mr. Rasmussen, now the director of photography for digital and print media at ESPN. “I went to this small agricultural college in Utah and didn’t know anybody, but in less than a week I left there with four or five lifelong friends. Sometimes you spend your whole life seeking your community and for me that was the moment that I found it.”

Mr. Rasmussen will return to Jeffersonville this weekend for the 30th Eddie Adams Workshop, which has since become one of the most important stops for up-and-coming photojournalists.

Mr. Adams died in 2004, but the workshop continues under the aegis of his wife, Alyssa Adams, and the assistance of around 150 volunteers. Some things have changed since the first session — Kodak slide film gave way to digital imagery in the late 1990s and audio and video have been added. Some sponsors have fallen away as the industry has withered, and while tuition is still free, students pay $375 for lodging.

The workshop is structured much as it was 30 years ago, with 10 groups of 10 students managed by a well-known photographer as team leader, a photo editor and a producer. This year, all the teams are led by photographers who were once students in the workshop.

For Jimmy Colton, a well-traveled photo editor who will be attending his 27th consecutive session this week, the workshop is about family. He calls himself Uncle Jimmy, and considers all 2,700 students he has worked with to be his nieces and nephews. The barn is also a place of family ghosts for Mr. Colton, whose brother Jay, and father, Sandy, both volunteered as photo editors before their deaths.

The core values of the workshop continue to be “a level of ethics beyond reproach, having great concern for your subjects and treating everyone as you would like to be treated,” Mr. Colton said.

Mr. Adams purchased the 64-acre farm in Jeffersonville in 1976 intending to convert it into a center for photography. But progress on rebuilding the ramshackle structures was slow as assignment work kept him busy. It was after he met Alyssa in 1983 that the plans for a free, merit-based workshop came together. They married shortly after the first workshop.

“This workshop is not a ‘how to,’ it’s more inspirational and aspirational,” Ms. Adams said. “This is a place where you can let your hair down and experiment a little as a student.”

The workshop does not romanticize photojournalism, and it acknowledges the price many photojournalists have paid while covering conflict. An annual memorial service for photographers who have died during war recognizes friends of Mr. Adams who were killed in Vietnam, like Henri Huet and Larry Burrows, as well as more recent casualties like Chris Hondros, who attended the 1993 workshop. An annual Award is given to a student by the Chris Hondros Foundation.

Recognizing colleagues who have been killed emphasizes that “the truth matters, pictures matter, and you can make a difference with your pictures not just in war,” said Nancy Andrews, who attended the first workshop in 1988 and has volunteered as a photo editor and will be a team leader this year. She returns for the sense of community and generosity, she said.

“I’m actually improved when you, my colleague, or you, my student, make a great picture” said Ms. Andrews, who was a Washington Post staff photographer and director of photography at The Detroit Free Press. “It’s not like there are finite numbers of great pictures out there and you stole one of them so now I can’t get one. It elevates the profession and I might be better as a result.”

Admission to the workshop, for students and professionals with less than three years’ experience is through portfolios judged by a panel of photo editors.

Not being included can be a difficult blow.

Ruth Fremson was among those young photographers who did not make the cut in the late 1980s. She remembers the rejection well, though she has since been part of three Pulitzer Prize-winning teams as a staff photographer for The Associated Press and starting in 2000 at The New York Times. While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.

She has been a team leader at the workshop the last two years and is returning this weekend as a kitchen volunteer to help prepare food for the students.

“It’s such a gift to be able to participate in it because the team leaders and volunteers get as much out of the workshop as the students,” she said. “I’ve had the benefit of many great mentors who have championed my career and this is a great place to pay it forward.”

Nor is Mr. Vance the only faux reformer.

The New Orleans district attorney, Leon Cannizzaro, claims that his office “has worked aggressively to reform New Orleans’s criminal justice system.” But his actions indicate that he values convictions over his community. He has locked up rape victims who refused to testify against their assailants and has served fake subpoenas to pressure witnesses to talk. Mr. Cannizzaro defended a sentence in which a 17-year-old was sent to prison for 99 years for an armed car robbery, even though no one was injured during the crime. His office tried to sentence a man to 20 years in prison for stealing $31 worth of candy.

The Los Angeles district attorney, Jackie Lacey, is a Democrat who has benefited from the public’s perception that she is a reformer. This is something she has fed herself, bragging to a Los Angeles Sentinel reporter that she has read “The New Jim Crow” by Michelle Alexander and has seen Ava DuVernay’s documentary “13,” about the connection between slavery and mass incarceration. But Ms. Lacey’s values have consistently lagged behind those of her constituency.

In ballot initiatives, Los Angeles County residents supported shorter sentences for low-level and nonviolent property and drug crimes and wanted to legalize recreational marijuana use for adults. Ms. Lacey opposed both. And although the county voted in favor of abolishing the death penalty, she continues to support it. Last year there were just 31 death sentences nationwide. Ms. Lacey’s office secured four of them.

Philadelphia’s former district attorney R. Seth Williams was once identified as a rising political star. But it turns out he wasn’t much of a leader at all. By the end of his tenure, which was cut short after he pleaded guilty to bribery and resigned, Philadelphia had locked up more of its residents per capita than any other major city. One in four defendants was being held in jail simply because of an inability to pay bail.

Mr. Williams had also won praise for agreeing not to pursue life-without-parole sentences again for 300 juvenile offenders. The Supreme Court has ruled they were unconstitutionally sentenced to such punishments and entitled to new sentencing hearings. But less than a year later, he reneged on his promise and denied ever making it.

America incarcerates more people than any other country, and it is prosecutors who are largely responsible.

So it’s especially frustrating that many of those who are praised as change-makers are at best making bite-size improvements. And because they say the right things, the public gives them a pass: Mr. Vance is running unopposed for a third term, and Ms. Lacey also ran unopposed in her last election.

The progressive bombast is meaningless if prosecutors continue to promote the same harsh practices behind the scenes. Instead, voters must look closely at their policies and hold them to high and specific standards. We should ask: Are prosecutors opposing new mandatory minimum sentences during legislative debates? Have they declined to request cash bail in a vast majority of cases? Are they keeping children out of adult court and refusing to seek life-without-parole sentences for them?

Over 1,000 prosecutors will be up for election next year in places like Dallas, San Diego, Seattle, Oakland, Calif., and Charlotte, N.C.

“The move backfired, and the experience has inhibited actions thereafter,” said Rosa Balfour, a senior fellow in the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund. She cited the bloc’s failure to impose any effective sanctions on Hungary and Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has championed “illiberal democracy” and has signaled his admiration for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

The experience of government decimated the Freedom Party, which dropped to 5 percent in the polls and split. Mr. Haider died in a car accident in 2008, depriving the party of its most charismatic figure. The party has since been revived on a platform of ethnic identity, anti-Islamization and anti-immigration, but with a slightly softer face, repressing its neo-Nazi past and embracing the European Union.

The party reached 20.5 percent of the vote four years ago and nearly won the presidential election last year. It was aided this time by the dissolution of a similar and rival far-right party founded by, and named after, an Austrian-Canadian businessman, Frank Stronach.

Austria has usually voted for center-right and right-wing parties, and it was late to examine its history under the Nazis. It preferred to see itself as the “first victim” of the Austrian-born Hitler, instead of a willing collaborator with the Third Reich and its racist, anti-Semitic policies.

Even in mid-1980s, when it was revealed that Kurt Waldheim had lied about his service as an intelligence officer in the Nazi army, the Austrians elected him anyway. Throughout his six-year term he was ostracized by many countries, including the United States.

For the European Union, the potential challenge from Austria is similar to that from Poland and Hungary, which welcomed the Kurz victory; a coalition between Mr. Kurz and the Freedom Party would create a government more like that of those two countries and less like ones in Germany or France. Still, Mr. Kurz is strongly pro-European, and the Freedom Party has largely dropped its euroskepticism after losing last year’s presidential election, when voters made clear “they didn’t want it,” Mr. Lehne said.

Mr. Kurz has refused to say what coalition he prefers, but given that Austria will take over the European Union presidency in the last half of next year, he is expected to remain “pretty mainstream,” Mr. Lehne said. “Expect a restrictive attitude to migration,” with limits to social benefits to E.U. workers in Austria,” he said, adding: “But that is mainstream now.”

For the European Union, there are few options other than constructive engagement, the way that Brussels is working with President Andrzej Duda to restrain what it sees as the most destructive policies of the Polish government — those aiming to restrict the news media and the judiciary.

The European Union “can, reluctantly, work with such governments, but it can cause difficulties for certain policy areas, especially migration,” said Fabian Zuleeg, chief executive of the European Policy Center, a research organization in Brussels.",Austria’s Rightward Lurch Is Europe’s New Normal,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/world/europe/austria-election-right.html

“It doesn’t matter how efficient the internet is,” said Zhu Wei, deputy director of the Communications Law Research Center at the China University of Political Science and Law, which advises the government on internet laws. “It won’t work without security.”

China is not resting on its laurels.

In the weeks leading up to the major party congress that opens in Beijing on Wednesday, the country’s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, has issued a raft of new regulations.

One, which took effect last week, holds the creators of online forums or group chats responsible for their users’ comments.

Another bans anonymous users, a blow at the bots and deceptive accounts — like those on Facebook and Twitter — that distributed false stories aimed at American voters.

“If our party cannot traverse the hurdle presented by the internet, it cannot traverse the hurdle of remaining in power,” a department of the cyberspace administration wrote in a top party journal last month.

The article was in keeping with President Xi Jinping’s early recognition of the power of the internet. Mr. Xi created and empowered the cyberspace administration, which has subsumed many of the overlapping agencies that once governed content in cyberspace.

The administration is now seen as an institution as important as the defense ministry. Since last year, it has been led by Xu Lin, 54, a party technocrat and former propaganda official, who, like other influential officials who previously worked beside Mr. Xi in Shanghai, has soared through the ranks.

Samm Sacks, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the cyberspace administration was a core part of Mr. Xi’s vow to make China a cyber superpower, on par with the United States.

“There’s a recognition that technology has advanced more quickly than the government’s ability to control it,” Ms. Sacks said. Russia’s interference with Facebook, to cite only one example, was “justification for exactly what they are doing here.”

China’s homegrown internet companies are key to its top-down approach. Tech firms are expected to keep content on file for 60 days and report to the police any forbidden content. The government is acquiring small equity stakes in some tech companies in exchange for board seats, giving it a direct role in the governance of new internet titans.

The tech firms also face tight penalties if they fail to keep users in line. In September, the cybersecurity administration imposed fines on social media platforms owned wholly or in part by three of China’s biggest internet companies — Tencent Holdings, the Alibaba Group and Baidu — for failing to stop the circulation of fabricated rumors, violence and pornography. (Companies can be fined up to $76,000 per offense, and have their business licenses canceled, if they cannot prevent the transmission of banned content.)

Human rights observers worry that the crackdown may have a chilling effect on political speech that is already tightly curbed. Last month, for example, the police raided the home of a university professor, Liu Pengfei, who had hosted a current-affairs forum on Tencent’s WeChat software, one of the world’s most popular messaging apps.

In exchange for accepting tight controls, China internet companies have been allowed to grow while their foreign rivals were shut out of the country. They can now claim their own technology successes. Tencent’s WeChat has transformed social life in China: People use it to chat, pay bills, transfer money, book cabs and hook up romantically.

China is now embarking on an ambitious project to dominate fields like artificial intelligence, and some say China could be at an advantage. It has more than 700 million internet users, and it doesn’t have a robust legal framework to deal with data privacy intrusions. That makes it easier for companies to harness user data — which is core to developing A.I. technology.

Still, China’s advantage could be double-edged. Chinese internet companies have struggled to expand abroad, which experts say stems in part from their dependence on their government.

“To a large extent, the competitive advantage is the political relationship they have with the government there and that’s not something you can carry across borders,” said Lokman Tsui, an assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Moreover, not all of the new restrictions have been welcomed here. Some of the companies — and internet users — balked at tightened enforcement of rules requiring users of social media platforms to provide their real identities to the companies (although they may still use online pseudonyms). Weibo’s announcement that it was seeking 1,000 recruits to become supervisors to report illegal content online — the definitions of which can be expansive — was met by derision on its own site.

“Online and offline, Big Brother is watching,” wrote one user, who used the handle mingxinjianxing.

But when it comes to the controversy over Russia’s intervention, there has been little discussion here. Among the few who are discussing it on Weibo, some expressed shock that the United States does not censor information shared on social media platforms.

Mr. Zhao, the young volunteer on Weibo, is typical of those here who believe government control is justified.

In a restaurant called Europa, Mr. Zhao — who declined to disclose details of where and how he works — described China’s system not as “Big Brother” so much as a younger brother, which he is, protecting children, like those of his sister, from harmful material.

“Even though the internet is virtual, it is still part of society,” he added. “So in any space I feel no one should create pornographic, illegal or violent posts.”

In his new capacity, he scours Weibo in search of the lurid and illicit. Some posts, he explained, are thinly veiled solicitations for pornography or prostitution, including one message he reported to the police the other day for using what he said was a euphemism for selling sex.

When he reports abuse, it is the police who follow up. He excitedly displayed his smartphone to show the latest of his more than 3,000 followers on Weibo: the division of the Beijing police that monitors the internet.

“Normally, if you don’t do bad things, you don’t get followed by the police,” he said. “I think this — for someone who has been online for so many years — is really special.”","As U.S. Confronts Internet’s Disruptions, China Feels Vindicated",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/world/asia/china-internet-cyber-control.html

Freezing and praising, might have seen in this

No trifle, but a shade of bliss —

That land of tolerable flowers, that state

As near and far as grass

Where eyes become the sunlight, and the hand

Is worthy of water: the dreamt land

Toward which all hungers leap, all pleasures pass.

By the early 1960s, however, critical opinion generally conformed to Mr. Jarrell’s oft-quoted assessment that Mr. Wilbur “never goes too far, but he never goes far enough.”

Typical of complaints in this vein was a review by Herbert Leibowitz of Mr. Wilbur’s collection “The Mind-Reader” in The New York Times of June 13, 1976: “While we acknowledge his erudition and urbanity, we regretfully liken his mildness to the amiable normality of the bourgeois citizen.”

But there were many on the other side who objected to the notion that Mr. Wilbur’s poems were somehow unimportant because they were pretty. Jack Butler, for example, a resident of Okolona, Ark., wrote a letter to the editor in response to Mr. Leibowitz’s review, remarking, “Sirs, the man has had a feast set before him, the very best, and complains because it is not a peanut butter and ketchup sandwich.”

Mr. Wilbur sailed on regardless of which way the wind blew. He won a second Pulitzer in 1988, for “New and Collected Poems”; became the second poet laureate of the United States, succeeding Robert Penn Warren, in 1987-88; and won many other awards over the years, including the $100,000 Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize in 2006, when he was 85. In all, he produced nine volumes of poems and several children’s books, which he himself illustrated.

He was also an esteemed translator of poems and other works from the French, Spanish and Russian, including the plays of Molière and Racine.

Frank Rich, then The Times’s chief theater critic, wrote in 1982 that Wilbur’s adaptations of Molière comedies like “Tartuffe,” “The Misanthrope” and “The School for Wives” were “beautiful works of art in themselves — Mr. Wilbur’s lighter-than-air verse upholds the idiom and letter of Molière, yet it also satisfies the demands of the stage.”

Mr. Wilbur wrote lyrics for opera and musical theater productions, too; among them, Leonard Bernstein’s “Candide.”

Mr. Wilbur served three bloody years as a combat soldier in Europe in World War II, an experience that some critics thought might be a clue to the orderly, generally optimistic nature of his work. Perhaps “the utter disparity between what he saw and what he wished to see made him run for cover,” the poet and scholar John Reibetanz wrote. Mr. Wilbur dismissed this explanation.

“I feel that the universe is full of glorious energy,” he said in an interview with The Paris Review, “that the energy tends to take pattern and shape, and that the ultimate character of things is comely and good. I am perfectly aware that I say this in the teeth of all sorts of contrary evidence, and that I must be basing it partly on temperament and partly on faith, but that’s my attitude.”

Richard Purdy Wilbur was born in New York City, on March 1, 1921. When he was 2, his family moved to rural North Caldwell, N.J., and rented a pre-revolutionary stone house on a 500-acre private estate.

Roaming the woods and fields with his younger brother, Lawrence, Richard absorbed lessons of the natural world that would later fit easily into his poems. At home, immersion in books and the arts was a fact of everyday life. His father, Lawrence Lazear Wilbur, was a portrait painter. His mother, the former Helen Purdy, came from a family of journalists: Her father had been an editor of The Baltimore Sun, and her paternal grandfather an itinerant publisher and editor who founded several Democratic newspapers across the country.

Mr. Wilbur went to Amherst College in 1938, where he contributed poems, essays and cartoons to the campus newspaper and magazine. In 1942 he married Charlotte Ward and got his bachelor’s degree, and it seemed to him that he might become a journalist and write poems as a diversion.

First, though, there was the war. He had wanted to serve as an Army cryptographer but was denied the necessary clearance because his leftist views had raised an official suspicion of “disloyalty.” Indeed, he later said, he once attended a Marxist function at Amherst, and slept through it, but his politics were nothing much more radical than the Roosevelt New Deal policies.

It was at Harvard, where he went for graduate studies after the war, that he began to see poetry as a vocation. His first collection, “The Beautiful Changes,” came out in 1947, the same year he finished his master’s degree. He became an assistant professor at Harvard in 1950 and taught there for four years, the beginning of an academic career that included 20 years at Wesleyan University and 10 years at Smith. He finally went home to teach at his alma mater, Amherst, which honored him on his 90th birthday in March 2010 with readings of his poems and translations.

Beside his son Christopher, Mr. Wilbur is survived by a daughter, Ellen Wilbur; two other sons, Nathan and Aaron; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. His wife, Charlotte, died in 2007.

“Anterooms,” his last collection of new poems and translations, was published in 2010 — a slim volume whose better pieces were “as good as anything Wilbur has ever written,” the Times’s reviewer, David Orr, wrote. Looking back, he observed that Mr. Wilbur had “spent most of his career being alternately praised and condemned for the same three things” — for his formal virtuosity; for his being, “depending on your preference, courtly or cautious, civilized or old-fashioned, reasonable or kind of dull”; and finally for his resisting a tendency in American poetry toward “conspicuous self-dramatization.”

Mr. Wilbur’s work did grow somewhat more personal in later years — he had “crumbled” a bit, as he put it. But his poems were never without wit, grace and rigor, even when they were about the end of things, as in the two-stanza “Exeunt:”

Piecemeal the summer dies;

At the field’s edge a daisy lives alone;

A last shawl of burning lies

On a gray field-stone.

All cries are thin and terse;

She will join “The Project,” Network Ten’s top news and current affairs program, starting next year, Ten said. The deal could make her the highest-paid female host on Australian television, local news reports said.

Her departure comes as other news outlets have been facing questions about gender pay disparities. In July, the BBC released pay data showing that women represented only one-third of the on-air talent who were paid at least 150,000 pounds, or about $200,000, by the broadcaster in the past year.

Ms. Wilkinson’s move drew praise from leading women across the media industry.

“What a woman. Lisa Wilkinson taking a stand for women everywhere by asking for equal pay with her co-host and walking when Channel Nine refused,” wrote Mia Freedman, co-founder of the women’s media company Mamamia. “Now she has a better deal at Channel 10.”

Her departure from Nine Network also drew the attention of prominent politicians.

“If the reason is about equal pay, I say good on her,” said Gladys Berejiklian, the premier of New South Wales. “I think she’s sending a very strong message to the community.”

Nine Network acknowledged Ms. Wilkinson’s contribution to “The Today Show,” saying that her partnership with Mr. Stefanovic had “taken the show to the success it is today.”

The pair embodied the easygoing Australian character with lighthearted banter and moments of mutual appreciation, with Ms. Wilkinson playing the calm, composed foil to Mr. Stefanovic’s regular tomfoolery.

Before hiring Ms. Wilkinson in 2007, Nine Network cycled through various co-hosts for Mr. Stefanovic to chip away at the popularity of “Sunrise,” the long-dominant breakfast show on Seven Network.

After Ms. Wilkinson joined “The Today Show,” its audience gradually increased, although not enough to overtake “Sunrise.”

“It was a stunning turnaround for a program many had written off a decade earlier,” wrote Michael Lallo, an entertainment reporter for Fairfax Media. “This should have been sufficient proof of Wilkinson’s value.”

Mr. Stefanovic opened the show Tuesday morning by acknowledging his shock at the departure of Ms. Wilkinson and thanking her for her support, citing “the laughs, sage advice, the calmness.”

“For 10 years Lisa has dragged herself out of bed at 3:30 in the morning, fed the dogs and cats, put a load of washing on, and come into work and sat on my left to inform you at home about what’s happening in the world,” Mr. Stefanovic said.

Nine Network said it would be “going in another direction” and considering its options over “the coming weeks and months.”

On Monday, Ms. Wilkinson was described by a fellow anchor, Leigh Sales of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, as a “steady, consistent, highly competent, warm and delightful presence” on “The Today Show.”",Australian TV Host’s Departure Raises Questions on Gender Pay Gap,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/world/australia/gender-pay-gap-lisa-wilkinson.html

“After achieving a turnaround of the People’s Party, Mr. Kurz must achieve a turnaround for Austria.”","With nearly all ballots counted, the Socialists, with 26.9 percent of the vote, edged ahead of the Freedom Party, with 26 percent. They are believed to be the most likely partner for Mr. Kurz as he tries to create a majority needed to form a government.

The road to that goal could be said to begin when Mr. Kurz, at age 16, called up the People’s Party office in the working-class neighborhood of Vienna’s 12th District where he grew up, the only son of a teacher and a technician. In one of the professionally produced videos on his home page, Mr. Kurz tells how he offered them his services.

“It didn’t go too well,” he recalled, pacing and looking pensive in an open-collared shirt. “They gave me the sense that I should get back to them in a couple of years. That experience left me with the idea that politics should actually be something where everyone can participate. Where anyone who wants to can get involved.”

Mr. Kurz persisted, eventually joining the party and working his way up through the youth wing to become its leader in 2009. Two years later, he became a political appointee in the Interior Ministry and in 2013 won a seat in the national Parliament and became the country’s integration minister. The following year, he became Austria’s youngest foreign minister, at 27, and a figure on Europe’s international stage, in his trim navy suits, often worn without a tie.

Freimut Dobretsberger, a longtime member of the People’s Party, claims to have met every Austrian chancellor stretching back to Bruno Kreisky, a legendary figure in the country’s political scene who took over in 1970, ushering in a leftward shift in Austrian politics that has remained virtually unbroken since. The center-left Social Democrats were relegated on Sunday to third place, the first time in a century that they have not been one of the two largest political parties.

Instead of viewing Mr. Kurz’s youth as a liability, Mr. Dobretsberger, an 80-year-old former banker, believes that is the young candidate’s strength.

“In Austria, we have strong, but old-fashioned industries,” Mr. Dobretsberger said. “Unlike in Silicon Valley or in Korea, we are too reliant on the service sector and that needs to be changed. I think not him as a person, but the momentum he has generated, will make that possible.”

Analysts of Austria’s political landscape have compared Mr. Kurz’s achievement of sensing a societal shift to the right, and harnessing a desire for change. When he took over his political party, he rebranded it a movement, creating a website and an app that made it easy for people to get involved, attracting 200,000 new supporters, the party said.

But as Alexandra Siegl, a Vienna-based political analyst, points out, Mr. Kurz understood how to capitalize on Austrians’ fears over the arrival of thousands of immigrants from the Middle East from 2015 to 2016. From the strain they placed on the country’s welfare system to the threat that Islamic extremists may be among them, his position seemed ripped from the populist playbook.

“Mr. Kurz took on similar, if not exactly the same position as the Freedom Party,” Ms. Siegl said. Members of the far-right party complained that the young minister had copied their ideas.

He also sold himself as having closed the so-called Balkan route, after having defied the promise by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany of a “welcoming culture,” by reaching agreements with countries in Austria’s southwest to close their borders.

Some Austrians disparaged the swing to the right that the election represented and that is likely to continue under Mr. Kurz. Among them was Jörg Heiser, an Austrian who teaches as the Berlin University of Arts, who in a Facebook post called Mr. Kurz “a sort of Orban in Macron clothing,” a reference to Viktor Orban, the populist Hungarian leader who has exhibited strong authoritarian leanings, and Emmanuel Macron, the centrist, technocratic young president of France.

Ms. Merkel congratulated Mr. Kurz on Sunday, after it became clear his party had emerged as the winner. On Monday she praised his “modern” campaign style, but with an eye to the likelihood that Mr. Kurz will build a coalition with the Freedom party, she cautioned that she would not be trying to copy it for Germany.

Mr. Kurz also has his critics at home, where the speed at which he rose through the party’s ranks and the seeming unwillingness of many local media outlets to sufficiently challenge him.

“The party saw him as a Messiah, a young man who was going to come and be their savior,” said Josef Redl, an economics reporter for the left-leaning weekly Falter. “All he campaigned on was immigration, and he got away with it.”

On the morning after the election, as the country chewed over the outcome and waited for the final result to be announced, most likely on Thursday, many were quick to point out that governing may prove more challenging than campaigning.

“Mr. Kurz promised many things, these promises demand upholding,” wrote Dietmar Neuwirth in the Austrian newspaper Die Presse. “After achieving a turnaround of the People’s Party, Mr. Kurz must achieve a turnaround for Austria.”","For Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s 31-Year-Old New Leader, a Swift Rise",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/world/europe/sebastian-kurz-austria.html

Professional stylists often discuss goals, priorities and other issues in order to develop a client’s personal style. It’s a long process that can take months of working one on one with someone.

“Working with a stylist is more about figuring out who you are, and then dressing yourself accordingly,” Ms. Messiah added. “You really get to understand how things are supposed to fit so you can maximize its use in your closet.”

Don’t expect to get the same level of service in a box, Ms. Messiah says. She suggests having specific action items ready for your online stylist because, unlike an in-person stylist, they won’t ask you questions about your priorities and goals. It’s crucial to have an idea of what you want beforehand. Instead of “I want a better wardrobe,” you might tell your stylist, “I need nicer dresses to wear to company cocktail parties” or “I need casual clothes that also look professional for my remote job.”

As long as you keep your expectations realistic, however, these services can be useful, and there are a number of ways to ensure you have the best possible experience with them.

Pick the right box to start

There are two different categories of clothing box services: subscription-only and try-and-buy. Subscription-only services, like Threads Monthly or Five Four Club, don’t send clothes that are intended to be sent back. (In fact, some don’t even offer refunds.) These subscription boxes work just like Birchbox or Blue Apron: you sign up for a box and keep what you get.

By comparison, Stitch Fix and Trunk Club are try-and-buy services, meaning you try on the clothes and only buy the items you keep. You can order a box regularly and set up your own subscription, but they’re ultimately designed to allow you to try on clothes in the comfort of your home. This also means you need to trust yourself to reliably send back the items that don’t fit or that you don’t like.

If you know what kind of clothing you like and simply want a regular shipment of new threads every month, subscription-only services are probably your best bet. However, if you’re looking to try new styles, address specific clothing needs for your body, or just need the help of a professional to pick out pieces, you’ll probably want to stick with the flexibility of try-and-buy.

Our favorite pick, Stitch Fix, offers that flexibility. It also offers a variety of sizing, from petite to tall to plus-size, which is another factor you want to consider when picking the right box. Most, but not all, boxes have clothes that fit a variety of body types, and you can typically find this information in the FAQ section of their website. For more on what made Stitch Fix the winning choice — and for details on other options — check out our full comparison and test at Wirecutter, a New York Times company.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Give your stylist specific feedback

Once you sign up for a service, take the time to fill out your profile thoroughly. Stitch Fix and Bombfell, two of the most popular options, take you through a series of detailed questions about your measurements and preferences.

This can be time-consuming, but the more time you spend offering accurate answers, the better chance you have of getting a box you like. With Trunk Club, another popular option, you’ll answer a few basic questions, too, but then a stylist will contact you, either via email or chat, to get more insight and feedback from you.

“I would take the time because that really informs what you’re getting,” said Jon Shanahan of the YouTube style channel The Kavalier. “When I first used Trunk Club, I just wrote a couple of things to my stylist, and looking back it wasn’t very helpful. If you take the time to say why things fit what you like, it’s in their best interest to get you right as a customer.”

Mr. Shanahan even suggests getting feedback about your style from friends and family to help you with the process. Many of these services also include a section where you can leave a message for your stylist. Don’t leave that field blank. Give your stylist as much information as possible so they know what to work with.

If you want specific items in your wardrobe, let them know. If you have specific goals for your style, like more clothes for networking events, tell them. Search for some styles you like on Pinterest, pin them to a board, and send the link to your stylist. Most services will directly ask for a Pinterest board link.

Learn some style basics

It doesn’t hurt to learn the basics of personal style, either. This way, you know you’re requesting the right types of clothing, and clothing that you like and that looks good on you.

“I think there’s something fundamentally wrong with how we think about style. “You don’t know why you’re wearing something, so it just ends up being another thing in the back of your closet. Get to the reasons why you want something,” Ms. Messiah suggested.

Personal styling is often a self-discovery process that explores your desires beyond the clothing. The process helps you determine why you want to look better in the first place, and then encourages you to align your personal goals, career goals, and even relationship goals with your style. If you want to excel in your corporate career, for example, you’ll do well to focus on choosing professional clothing that supports that goal. That means leaving out shorts and T-shirts when you place your order.

Try a second box

Your online stylist might not get it right the first time around. “You need to give it two cycles for them to really nail everything,” Mr. Shanahan added. “That’s when you really start to say, ‘Yes you got this.’”

The idea is that the more you work with your stylist, the better a grasp they’ll have on what you’re looking for, specifically. In fact, when you send items back, most services allow you to briefly explain why you’re sending that particular item back. Maybe the shoulders are too big or you just have too many of that type of item in your wardrobe already. Your stylist will see these notes and know not to send you similar pieces next time.

Thus at $20 to $25 a box, it may be worth a second or third chance if you’re unhappy with the first box. And some boxes, like Bombfell, don’t have a styling fee at all. As Mr. Shanahan put it, “You might as well give it a couple of shots because there’s a very low barrier to entry.”

Finally, it’s worth noting that shopping for clothing can also be a stressful experience, namely when you don’t find anything that fits you quite right. Try to have fun, and remember to exercise some self-compassion along the way.

“It’s not you, it’s the clothes,” Ms. Messiah said. “There’s vanity sizing. No one designs the clothes with you in mind.” She advises her own clients to keep an open mind when it comes to trying on new things and remember: “it’s all part of a journey, but at the end of the day, it’s just clothes.”",How to Use Clothing Subscription Boxes to Find Your Personal Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/smarter-living/clothing-box-services-stitch-fix-trunk-club.html

Back Story

The Man Booker Prize, which honors the best novel written in English and published in Britain, will be announced today.

On this year’s shortlist: “4 3 2 1,” by Paul Auster; “History of Wolves,” by Emily Fridlund; “Exit West,” by Mohsin Hamid; “Autumn,” by Ali Smith; “Lincoln in the Bardo,” by George Saunders; and “Elmet,” by Fiona Mozley.

First awarded in 1969, the Booker McConnell Prize was named for the multinational company that established it, as an effort to rival the Prix Goncourt in France. In 2002, sponsorship passed to the Man Group, an investment management firm, which added its name to the title.

The award was initially open only to writers from Britain, Ireland, Zimbabwe and the Commonwealth. Eligibility expanded in 2014 to include any English-language novelist, raising concerns that it would become dominated by Americans. (Since then, one U.S. novel — Paul Beatty’s “The Sellout” — has won. Half of the authors on this year’s shortlist are Americans.)

Winners receive 50,000 pounds, or about $66,000. Howard Jacobson, who won in 2010 for “The Finkler Question,” told The Guardian that he was going to spend the prize money on his wife: “Have you seen the price of handbags?”

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Today we get to watch a face-off between the good guys and the bad guys, courtesy of David J. Kahn.

Today’s Theme

The GUNFIGHT AT / THE O.K. CORRAL (28D and 62A) took place in October 1881, and was a 30-second shootout between the lawmen of Tombstone, Ariz., and a group of outlaws called the Cowboys (in those days, it was considered an insult to call a law-abiding cattleman a “cowboy”). Mr. Kahn was able to get only one law man (DOC HOLLIDAY) and one bad guy (IKE CLANTON) into his grid for space reasons.

In addition, we have four entries forming a circular “corral” of sorts (31A, 37D, 52A and 35D). All of them are synonyms for the word “O.K.,” but all are clued as something different, neatly hiding the connection to the theme in plain sight. That’s a pretty nice bonus.

Tricky Clues

1A: I had MACAU and MACAW (wrong, Deb! That’s a bird) before MACAO.

49A: Do you get tripped up by clues where the first word is actually a proper name? “Banks of Chicago” sounds as if it refers to places in Chicago where you can keep your money, but we’ve got only a five-letter slot. The constructor and editors have sneakily used the capital-letter-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence rule against you. “Banks” refers to the baseball player ERNIE Banks.

Constructor Notes

I guess I can say with a smile that this is just an O.K. puzzle. This worked only because I was able to find 4 four-letter synonyms for O.K. that could be clued otherwise, which is why “so-so,” at first an obvious synonym, wasn’t included. I also wanted to include a gunfighter on each side. Fun fact: Kirk Douglas, who played Doc Holliday in the 1957 movie, celebrated his centennial last year.

Mohamed Sharif, another student, described it as a “disaster.” Though he is no stranger to explosions, he said, this one was of a kind “I’ve never heard before.”

In one early sign of the political fallout, Somalia’s Internal Security Ministry said that its spokesman, Ahmed Sayid Arab, had resigned and that a replacement had been appointed.

The African Union, which has about 22,000 troops stationed in Somalia, warned that it was “now clear that without adequate and appropriate support in Somalia, many of the security gains made in recent years could be reversed.”

This summer, Somali lawmakers and some international donors claimed to have seriously weakened the Shabab amid efforts by the United States and African-backed forces, called Amisom, to wrest control of Shabab-held territories and kill key figures of the organization in drone strikes.

At a conference in London in May, world powers agreed on plans to support and train Somalia’s army and take over a task currently performed by African Union troops.

However, analysts say that the Shabab’s capacity for mayhem remains far from diminished. In fact, in recent weeks, Shabab operatives have been gaining ground. On Saturday, as the bombs went off, the group took over the town of Bariire, just 31 miles from Mogadishu in the Lower Shabelle region.

“It’s a cold, cold blast of reality,” said David Anderson, a professor of African politics at Warwick University in Britain.

The Shabab had never really disappeared. “It is a guerrilla organization that is really quite efficient in what it does. It makes fewer attacks now but kills far more. The Shabab are getting better at targeting, as this attack shows.”

The bombings were carried out by drivers of two trucks, crammed with explosives, who drove through multiple checkpoints on a tightly patrolled highway. Their easy access raised questions over whether Shabab infiltrators had compromised security.

“No one likes to talk about this, partly because it’s difficult to quantify,” Professor Anderson said. “It’s widely accepted that most of the institutions and organs of the Somali state are infiltrated by the Shabab.”

The bombings also highlighted divisions within the government, particularly the security services, and the weakness of President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, who came to power eight months ago with high expectations. His leadership has been further undermined by infighting among clans that control different parts of the government, which may have made the capital more vulnerable to Shabab attacks.

“There was a lot of friction, parallel commands, which bubbled to the surface,” Mr. Abdi said. “That should have sent of a clear warning signal, and the Shabab took advantage of that situation.”

In recent years the Shabab have also capitalized on growing religious conservatism in the region, propelled by poverty and despair. Moderate gains in recent years as measured in elections and more inclusive government could easily disappear, analysts say.

“There are large parts of the country lacking in opportunities and livelihoods, and the Shabab have been able to take advantage of that,” said Ahmed Soliman, an expert on Somalia at Chatham House, a London-based research group.

“The solution for the Shabab isn’t to drone-strike it away,” he said. But if international interest in Somalia diminishes, “there can be an unraveling of the progresses made in government and institutions.”

In Washington on Monday, Pentagon officials said they were examining options to send additional trainers and advisers to Somalia in case the Somalia government requested such assistance. But the senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, ruled out any major American troop deployments to the African country.

Many older L.G.B.T. Australians have endured decades of discrimination, sexual and physical violence, and forced medical or psychological treatment. Some still have criminal records for homosexuality. (Australia’s final laws against sodomy were repealed in 1997.)

Older gay and transgender people are used to hiding their bodily or sexual differences to protect themselves, said Dr. Catherine Barrett, an elder care researcher and activist. For some older gays, she said, their last experience with the health system may have been a forced visit to an institution decades ago. Those experiences can make it hard for them to feel safe, she said.

At the ball, the guests settled in to watch a night of cabaret, drag and opera over a three-course dinner.

Many were fabulously dressed, such as a man outfitted like Liberace, but Brian Day, 77, said he preferred to wear his “new trackie-daks,” or sweatpants. On his flannel shirt was pinned his Order of Australia medal, awarded for his services during the AIDS crisis and to the gay-rights movement. When the dancing started, he watched and shuffled his feet.

His body, he said, can get sore sometimes.

“I’ve been beaten up three times in my adult life, including once in my flat, my own place,” he said. “For us, the world is violent.”

While he currently lives without care, he understands why some people might return to the closet. The institutions have been “violent to us,” he said, and he still twinges when a police officer walks by.

“The closet was a safe place,” he said. “We haven’t got as much energy as we used to have. And we don’t want to get into brawls. We just want to live peaceful lives now, please.”

He is also concerned that services for the aged are not prepared to deal with the residual grief of older gay men, particularly the trauma of the AIDS epidemic.

“We have lived through 25 years of having our friends die, die, die, die, die, die, die. …” he trailed off. “How will people take me, like with me crying then?”

Later in the evening, Jean Taylor, 73, a writer and activist since the 1970s, took in the night air on a bench outside the hall, watching busy Swanston Street with her companion, Ardy Tibby, 76. Ms. Taylor said she thought that lesbians would always be “cautious” about coming out but that they needed to “be a little brave” and not “buy into the assumption that all nursing homes are unsafe.”

Ms. Taylor, a self-labeled “housewife and mother of two turned radical lesbian feminist,” said the ball was a nice celebration, but she voiced disappointment that much of the local lesbian-feminist history had been “lost.”

“People don’t even know or care enough to find out what we did,” she said.

After the dinner plates were cleared, Mr. Meecham addressed the crowd.

“To the L.G.B.T.I. elders who have led the way, who have shaped our community, who have fought for my right to wear these six-inch heels and gold nail polish: To you, I say thank you. I bow down to you.”

Mr. Meecham then leapt off the stage with the microphone and pulled guests out of their seats one by one, inviting them to share their stories.

“I always say that closets are for clothes and mothballs, and that’s it,” said Gordon Wilson, a gay man in his 80s.

As “I Wanna Dance With Somebody” played, two silver-haired women began a simple waltz. One stood tall and straight, elbows pointed outward, face fixed into a formal expression. They spun in a half circle one way, then another. Her companion leaned into the chest of her partner and smiled, allowing herself to be swept around the fringes of the dance floor.","For Older Gays Who Might Re-enter the Closet, a Ball Invites Them Out",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/world/australia/lgbt-ball-melbourne.html

But her teenage discovery that her grandmother’s town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world.

Today she no longer considers herself religious “in terms of attending church,” but she appreciates the spiritual passion and ecstasy she documents in religious settings in far-flung countries. “My work can be a kind of prayer,” she said. “With time, I understood that what is interesting to me is not God — but God in people.”

Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, “Where Gods Whisper,” published by Contrasto Books.

She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a “kind of moral and ethical necessity.”

As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians, Jews and Muslim Tatars. She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.

Her grandparents’ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. “In one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,” she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer.

She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.

“Beyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,” she wrote in “God’s People: A Travel Into Another Europe,” an earlier book. “In winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.”

Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmother’s town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust. It was the town’s “total silence” about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.

Ms. Bulaj’s photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too.

“I photograph instinctively,” she said. “I am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.”

But insults aside, he offered a new analysis of corporate tax incidence – an approach that is novel, innovative, and completely boneheaded. Oh, and it just happens to say what his political masters want to hear.

As I see it, this is part of a broader pattern.

When the financial crisis struck, there were many calls for new economic ideas – even an Institute for New Economic Thinking. The implicit story, pretty much taken for granted as true, was that the crisis proved the inadequacy of economic orthodoxy and the need for fundamental new concepts. Pretty obviously, too, supporters of calls for new thinking had a sort of Hollywood script version of how it would play out: daring innovators would propose radical ideas, would face resistance from old fuddy-duddies, but would eventually win out through their superior ability to predict events.

What actually happened was very different. True, nobody saw the crisis coming. But that wasn’t because orthodoxy had no room for such a thing – on the contrary, panics and bank runs are an old topic, discussed in every principles book. The reason nobody saw this coming was an empirical failure – few realized that the rise of shadow banking had done an end run around Depression-era bank safeguards.

The point was that only the dimmest of free-market ideologues reacted with utter bewilderment. The rest of us slapped our foreheads and said, “Diamond-Dybvig! How stupid of me! Diamond-Dybvig!”

And post-crisis, pretty standard macro worked pretty well. Both fiscal policy and monetary policy did what they were supposed to (or, in the case of money, didn’t do what they weren’t supposed to) at the zero lower bound. Plenty of room for refinement, lots of opportunities to use the mother of all natural experiments for empirical work, but no huge requirement for radical new thinking.

Nonetheless, there was a proliferation of radical new concepts: contractionary fiscal policy is actually expansionary, expansionary monetary policy is actually deflationary, terrible things happen to growth when debt crosses 90 percent of GDP. These ideas instantly got huge amounts of political traction – never mind the fuddy-duddies in the economics establishment, the policy establishment leaped at the chance to apply new ideas.

What did the ideas they leaped at have in common? All of them had, implicitly or explicitly, conservative ideological implications, whether the authors intended that or not. (I’m quite sure that Reinhart-Rogoff weren’t operating out of any political agenda. Not equally sure about others.) And all of them proved, quite quickly, to be dead wrong.

So new economic thinking since the crisis has proved, for the most part, to consist of bad ideas that serve a conservative political agenda. Not exactly the script we were promised, is it?

Once you think about it, it’s not too hard to see how that happened. First of all, conventional macro has worked pretty well, so you’d need really, really brilliant innovations to make a persuasive major break with that conventionality. And really, really brilliant innovations don’t come easy. Instead, the breaks with conventional wisdom came mainly from people who, far from transcending that wisdom, simply failed to understand it in the first place.

And while there are such people on both left and right, there’s a huge asymmetry in wealth and influence between the two sides. Confused views on the left get some followers, provoke a back-and-forth on a few blogs, and generate some nasty tweets. Confused views on the right get mainlined straight into policy pronouncements by the European Commission and the leadership of the Republican Party.

Which brings me back to Hassett. Tax incidence, like macroeconomics, is a technical subject with a mainstream consensus that faces challenges from left and right. But a lot of hard work went into creating that consensus; this doesn’t mean that it’s right, but you have to come up with a really good idea to challenge it effectively.

On the other hand, you can get a lot of political traction with a really bad idea challenging the consensus, as long as it serves the interests of big money and the political right.

Say this for Donald Trump: When it comes to sex, he’s less of a hypocrite than Harvey Weinstein. Until Weinstein’s abrupt downfall amid proliferating accusations of sexual assault and harassment, he posed as a backer of women’s rights. He made films with substantive female leads (82-year-old Judi Dench joked that she’d tattooed his name on her butt in gratitude), donated money to politicians supporting feminist policies and contributed to endow a chair at Rutgers University honoring Gloria Steinem. He even attended the Women’s March at Sundance. Yet privately, he appears to have been a sexist ogre, using his power to exploit and humiliate women. After the truth about his conduct was widely revealed, he was cast out of his professional community and rendered a pariah.

Trump is more consistent. He is a pig in public as well as behind closed doors. In 1992, New York Magazine reported that he said the best way to deal with women is to treat them like excrement, though he used a more vulgar term. He has followed his own advice. His first wife, Ivana Trump, accused him of raping her in a fit of rage. (She later denied that the events she’d recounted were rape “in a literal or criminal sense,” but stuck to the underlying story.) Trump reportedly pressured his second wife, Marla Maples, to pose for Playboy. He owned beauty pageants and, by his own admission, would barge into changing rooms to ogle the naked contestants. The makeup artist Jill Harth said that he tried to rape her. Multiple women have accused him of groping and sexual harassment. Those charges appear credible in light of the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape in which Trump boasted of grabbing women by their genitals. After the truth about his conduct was widely revealed, he was elected president of the United States.

Somehow, in the wake of the Weinstein revelations, the president’s supporters appear to believe they hold the moral high ground. Donald Trump Jr. — a man who once said that women who can’t handle workplace sexual harassment “should go maybe teach kindergarten” — has been tweeting about Weinstein incessantly. Appearing on CNN, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, Ronna Romney McDaniel, attacked Democrats for taking Weinstein’s money, insisting that there’s no comparison between Weinstein and Trump because the president “didn’t have eight settlements.” (According to an exhaustive investigation by USA Today, at least 20 lawsuits have accused Trump and managers at his companies of “discriminating against women, ignoring sexual harassment complaints and even participating in the harassment themselves.”)

On Fox News, a network that Roger Ailes ran like his personal sadomasochistic brothel, Tucker Carlson feigned outrage at the Weinstein news. “Many powerful people knew what Harvey Weinstein was doing, and not only ignored his crimes, but actively took his side against his many victims,” Carlson said. (Fox News is currently under federal investigation, in part for payoffs made to Ailes’s victims.)

Bad faith on the right does not mitigate the deep, perverse cruelty of Weinstein’s alleged crimes. If anything, it makes the fallout more painful. For the past 11 months, many feminists have been reeling from the defeat of the first female major-party presidential candidate by a predatory misogynist. The confirmation that a hugely powerful man who is supposed to be on our side is just as bad as Trump is shattering. While many women are showing defiance — outing the Weinstein types in their industries, using hashtags like #MeToo to demonstrate the ubiquity of abuse — it’s hard not to feel crushed wondering how many men really see us as full human beings.","Save the Phony Weinstein Outrage, Republicans",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/opinion/columnists/weinstein-sexual-harassment-republicans.html

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

Photo

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.

The CSeries received a significant endorsement last year, when Delta Air Lines ordered 75 of the planes, which are slightly smaller than the A320 or Boeing’s 737. Although Boeing did not bid on Delta’s purchase, it undertook a trade action against Bombardier, arguing that loans and investments in the CSeries by the governments of Canada and Quebec would allow the company to sell the planes at artificially low prices. Bombardier has rejected that claim. Noting that Boeing has received help from the United States, it called its competitor’s complaint “pure hypocrisy.”

Boeing’s trade action has angered the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which immediately suspended plans to buy fighter jets from Boeing worth about 6 billion Canadian dollars ($4.8 billion). The wings of the CSeries are made at a Bombardier factory in Northern Ireland, prompting Theresa May, the British prime minister, to join Mr. Trudeau in urging President Trump to ask Boeing to drop its case. But they have not found a receptive audience in Washington.

Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, declined to comment, saying the government did not yet know enough about the development to determine its impact.

On Oct. 6, it announced an additional 79.82 percent duty for selling the aircraft at an artificially low price.

The Commerce Department will announce final rulings on the duties in December, then the United States International Trade Commission will uphold or overturn the tariffs early next year.

In a statement, Boeing called the announcement “a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidized competitors to skirt the recent findings of the U.S. government.” “Our position remains that everyone should play by the same rules for free and fair trade to work,” it said.

The assembly line in Alabama may solve the tariff problem, but it could raise political tensions in Quebec, which had bailed out the program through an investment of about 1 billion Canadian dollars. But Mr. Bellemare said the sales power of Airbus should mean that far more CSeries airplanes will be made, which will guarantee — and possibly expand — employment at the factory northwest of Montreal that now builds the plane.",Bombardier Turns to Airbus to Salvage Imperiled Airliner,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/business/bombardier-airbus.html

Ms. Tan, who has published seven novels, also reflects on her writing life, and describes how she cried the day her debut novel, “The Joy Luck Club,” was published — not out of happiness, but out of dread and fear of criticism.

Mary Karr, the poet and memoirist, said “Where the Past Begins” gave her new insight into Ms. Tan’s evolution as a writer, and compared it to “Speak, Memory,” Vladimir Nabokov’s memoir. “It’s a book about the development of a sensibility as much as it is about the family trauma that led her to need a place of beauty and disassociation,” said Ms. Karr, a friend of Ms. Tan’s. “She’s an interesting person, because she’s both tortured and happy.”

Most books come into being through a mysterious alchemy between writer and editor. ut Mr. Halpern, a published poet and the publisher at Ecco, has helped to shape the careers of novelists like Joyce Carol Oates, Richard Ford, Robert Stone, T.C.

In Ms. Tan’s memoir, Mr. Halpern becomes a central, recurring character. She dedicates “our book” to him. His notes appear as interjections in the introduction. Later in the book, a chapter titled “Letters to the Editor” consists of dozens of email exchanges between the two. He sends her a poem he wrote. She tells him about attending a screening of a Woody Allen movie. In most of their exchanges, Mr. Halpern plays the role of muse and cheerleader as Ms. Tan oscillates between earnest reflection on her work and crushing self-doubt. “I keep asking myself how the hell I wrote such a long and bloated book,” she writes about her last novel in one message to him. In another, after seeking Mr. Halpern’s opinion on a scene, she writes: “Never mind. I deleted it. It was bad.”

Mr. Halpern and Ms. Tan have a warm, teasing relationship, which is on display in their email messages and even more evident in person. They got together two months ago in Manhattan, where Ms. Tan and her husband of 43 years, Louis DeMattei, a retired tax attorney, have a loft in SoHo. Over a bottle of wine at a restaurant on Park Avenue South, they discussed how the memoir came together.

They disagreed about whether the original book was supposed to be a book of essays or a collection of their emails to one another, but they concurred on other points.

“I’m a very slow writer,” Ms. Tan said.

“She’s not lying,” Mr. Halpern said. “It’s not slow so much as, there are a lot of psychological road blocks. You like to turn in a perfect piece of prose, and that almost never happens. This book was also a little bit of an anathema in that it started out as one thing, and slowly morphed into something else, and we were very careful not to say what that was, because we had our ground rules.”

“You never asked for a memoir,” Ms. Tan said.

“I knew you would never do it,” Mr. Halpern replied. “If you had thought that it was going to be a memoir, you never would have written it.”

“The test is going to be the book,” he later continued “Do you think that you will ultimately regret writing this book?”

“You know, it’s not regret,” Ms. Tan said. “My reluctance is always casting something out there that will be in the public and will be subject to public interpretation. I want nothing of that. It’s like taking the mask off, taking your clothes off, and having people say, oh my God. It’s nonfiction, and people can make fun of the way you think or say, oh that was trivial.”

In a way, it’s surprising that it took Ms. Tan this long to write about herself. Her fiction, which often features Chinese mothers and daughters, is full of family lore and semi-autobiographical material. Her 1989 debut novel, “The Joy Luck Club,” which has sold nearly 6 million copies in the United States, is an intergenerational epic about Chinese mothers and daughters. Her second novel, “The Kitchen God’s Wife,” features a Chinese-American girl in California who learns about dark secrets from her mother’s past, and is modeled partly on her own family.

There’s no shortage of dramatic material from Ms. Tan’s past, and she could have easily mined her childhood to write a traditional account of her life. Born in California in 1952 to Chinese immigrants, she grew up in fear of her volatile mother. Ms. Tan’s late mother, Daisy, was depressed and unstable, and repeatedly threatened suicide. She once tried to throw herself out of the car when the family was driving on the highway. When Ms. Tan was 16, her mother brandished a meat cleaver and threatened to kill her.

When she was 14, Ms. Tan’s family was struck by a double tragedy: her older brother Peter developed a brain tumor and died at age 16. Then her father, an electrical engineer and Baptist minister, was diagnosed with a brain tumor, and died not long after Peter. Her mother believed the family was cursed.

Ms. Tan also catalogs some of the trials and misfortunes she’s faced as an adult: her feeling of “relief and sadness” when she had a miscarriage at 28, and her struggle with chronic Lyme disease, which she contracted in 1999. The disease spread to her brain, causing seizures that sparked bizarre but benign hallucinations, like a Renoir painting or a spinning odometer. When she started taking medication to control the seizures, it made her giddy, and she worried it would make her write maudlin fiction. (The sideeffects eventually abated).

In the process of researching the memoir, Ms. Tan discovered more family secrets. She found a photograph of her maternal grandmother, a concubine who died of a possibly intentional opium overdose, dressed as a courtesan. She found letters to her parents from immigration officials, warning that their student visas had expired and they were at risk of deportation.

Now that the book is about to be published, Ms. Tan is feeling apprehensive. She worries about family members who might think she’s sullied her grandmother’s memory, and is terrified of the critical response. She’s accustomed to having her fiction critiqued, but this feels much scarier, and more personal. “There’s so much in there that’s raw,” she said.

Ms. Tan plans to have her papers destroyed when she dies, including her letters and the many partial novels she abandoned, so “Where the Past Begins” may be the most complete and intimate record of her life that her fans and readers will get.

And it very likely wouldn’t exist, she admits, had it not been for the gentle and insistent prodding from her editor. “In many respects,” she said, “This is his book.”","Amy Tan, the Reluctant Memoirist",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/books/amy-tan-memoir.html

Professional stylists often discuss goals, priorities and other issues in order to develop a client’s personal style. It’s a long process that can take months of working one on one with someone.

“Working with a stylist is more about figuring out who you are, and then dressing yourself accordingly,” Ms. Messiah added. “You really get to understand how things are supposed to fit so you can maximize its use in your closet.”

Don’t expect to get the same level of service in a box, Ms. Messiah says. She suggests having specific action items ready for your online stylist because, unlike an in-person stylist, they won’t ask you questions about your priorities and goals. It’s crucial to have an idea of what you want beforehand. Instead of “I want a better wardrobe,” you might tell your stylist, “I need nicer dresses to wear to company cocktail parties” or “I need casual clothes that also look professional for my remote job.”

As long as you keep your expectations realistic, however, these services can be useful, and there are a number of ways to ensure you have the best possible experience with them.

Pick the right box to start

There are two different categories of clothing box services: subscription-only and try-and-buy. Subscription-only services, like Threads Monthly or Five Four Club, don’t send clothes that are intended to be sent back. (In fact, some don’t even offer refunds.) These subscription boxes work just like Birchbox or Blue Apron: you sign up for a box and keep what you get.

By comparison, Stitch Fix and Trunk Club are try-and-buy services, meaning you try on the clothes and only buy the items you keep. You can order a box regularly and set up your own subscription, but they’re ultimately designed to allow you to try on clothes in the comfort of your home. This also means you need to trust yourself to reliably send back the items that don’t fit or that you don’t like.

If you know what kind of clothing you like and simply want a regular shipment of new threads every month, subscription-only services are probably your best bet. However, if you’re looking to try new styles, address specific clothing needs for your body, or just need the help of a professional to pick out pieces, you’ll probably want to stick with the flexibility of try-and-buy.

Our favorite pick, Stitch Fix, offers that flexibility. It also offers a variety of sizing, from petite to tall to plus-size, which is another factor you want to consider when picking the right box. Most, but not all, boxes have clothes that fit a variety of body types, and you can typically find this information in the FAQ section of their website. For more on what made Stitch Fix the winning choice — and for details on other options — check out our full comparison and test at Wirecutter, a New York Times company.

Give your stylist specific feedback

Once you sign up for a service, take the time to fill out your profile thoroughly. Stitch Fix and Bombfell, two of the most popular options, take you through a series of detailed questions about your measurements and preferences.

This can be time-consuming, but the more time you spend offering accurate answers, the better chance you have of getting a box you like. With Trunk Club, another popular option, you’ll answer a few basic questions, too, but then a stylist will contact you, either via email or chat, to get more insight and feedback from you.

“I would take the time because that really informs what you’re getting,” said Jon Shanahan of the YouTube style channel The Kavalier. “When I first used Trunk Club, I just wrote a couple of things to my stylist, and looking back it wasn’t very helpful. If you take the time to say why things fit what you like, it’s in their best interest to get you right as a customer.”

Mr. Shanahan even suggests getting feedback about your style from friends and family to help you with the process. Many of these services also include a section where you can leave a message for your stylist. Don’t leave that field blank. Give your stylist as much information as possible so they know what to work with.

If you want specific items in your wardrobe, let them know. If you have specific goals for your style, like more clothes for networking events, tell them. Search for some styles you like on Pinterest, pin them to a board, and send the link to your stylist. Most services will directly ask for a Pinterest board link.

Learn some style basics

It doesn’t hurt to learn the basics of personal style, either. This way, you know you’re requesting the right types of clothing, and clothing that you like and that looks good on you.

“I think there’s something fundamentally wrong with how we think about style. “You don’t know why you’re wearing something, so it just ends up being another thing in the back of your closet. Get to the reasons why you want something,” Ms. Messiah suggested.

Personal styling is often a self-discovery process that explores your desires beyond the clothing. The process helps you determine why you want to look better in the first place, and then encourages you to align your personal goals, career goals, and even relationship goals with your style. If you want to excel in your corporate career, for example, you’ll do well to focus on choosing professional clothing that supports that goal. That means leaving out shorts and T-shirts when you place your order.

Try a second box

Your online stylist might not get it right the first time around. “You need to give it two cycles for them to really nail everything,” Mr. Shanahan added. “That’s when you really start to say, ‘Yes you got this.’”

The idea is that the more you work with your stylist, the better a grasp they’ll have on what you’re looking for, specifically. In fact, when you send items back, most services allow you to briefly explain why you’re sending that particular item back. Maybe the shoulders are too big or you just have too many of that type of item in your wardrobe already. Your stylist will see these notes and know not to send you similar pieces next time.

Thus at $20 to $25 a box, it may be worth a second or third chance if you’re unhappy with the first box. And some boxes, like Bombfell, don’t have a styling fee at all. As Mr. Shanahan put it, “You might as well give it a couple of shots because there’s a very low barrier to entry.”

Finally, it’s worth noting that shopping for clothing can also be a stressful experience, namely when you don’t find anything that fits you quite right. Try to have fun, and remember to exercise some self-compassion along the way.

“It’s not you, it’s the clothes,” Ms. Messiah said. “There’s vanity sizing. No one designs the clothes with you in mind.” She advises her own clients to keep an open mind when it comes to trying on new things and remember: “it’s all part of a journey, but at the end of the day, it’s just clothes.”",How to Use Clothing Subscription Boxes to Find Your Personal Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/smarter-living/clothing-box-services-stitch-fix-trunk-club.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Puerto Rico is already a tax haven for multinationals and high-income individuals (income earned in Puerto Rico is exempt from federal corporate and income tax: See the Bloomberg explainer).
By using the U.S. data on Puerto Rico's pharmaceutical exports to the world rather than Puerto Rico's export data, the New York Times inadvertently understated Puerto Rico's importance to pharmaceutical manufacturing.","The United States compiles data about Puerto Rico’s trade with the world.

The largest supplier of imports to Puerto Rico?

Ireland.

The second largest?

Singapore.

Tax trumps gravity, it seems.

Incidentally, Switzerland jumped into third place in the 2016 league table, leaping past other exporters of chemicals and Puerto Rico’s suppliers of fuel oil, diesel, and the like.

It isn’t exactly hard to figure out what is going on here. Puerto Rico’s imports tend to be specialty organic chemicals and pharmaceutical products, and, well, they tend to be supplied from countries that are known to specialize in helping multinationals optimize their global tax bill.

And, setting aside trade with the fifty states for the moment, where are Puerto Rico’s biggest export markets?

Belgium and the Netherlands.

The big ports and distribution centers in northwest Europe. Europe is almost certainly buying packaged pharmaceuticals—Puerto Rico’s biggest export to the world translates from trade jargon to “medicine, in measured doses, packaged for retail.”

It is a bit too simple to say Puerto Rico imports active pharmaceutical ingredients from low-tax jurisdictions and exports finished pharmaceuticals to high-tax jurisdictions. The imports from Ireland and Singapore could be for pharmaceuticals destined for the U.S. market, and the active ingredients for the finished goods exported to Rotterdam and Antwerp may be coming from the United States.

But the geography of Puerto Rico’s external trade is a good example of why I find the bilateral data useful. It helps identify when trade in tasks starts to look more like trade in tax.*

Puerto Rico also publishes its own trade data—with one release that splits trade with the United States from trade with the world, and another that offers more product detail but aggregates Puerto Rico’s “exports” to both the United States and the world.

This, to be clear, is a different definition of external trade than the U.S. census data uses. Puerto Rico counts the island’s “trade” with the fifty states as external trade. Territories are strange.

That data can help fill out some of the points that Bloomberg’s Justin Fox made in a very good recent column.

The numbers from Puerto Rico’s Government Development Bank (GDB) start in 2007, so the data series starts just after the infamous “936” tax break expired.

But to me they don’t suggest that pharmaceutical manufacturing has left the island in the last ten years (contrary to the received wisdom).

LinkedIn Email Share Share

Pharmaceutical exports—counting “exports” to the rest of the United States—have been around $50 billion a year since 2007, and the pharmaceutical trade surplus (exports, net of imports, including chemical imports)** has been around $30 billion.

Puerto Rico’s ""exports"" of pharmaceuticals to the United States, in dollar terms, almost certainly exceed Ireland’s pharmaceutical exports.***

The real fall off in “exports” since 2009 has come in electronic manufacturing, not in pharmaceuticals. (At least not in nominal pharmaceutical exports).

LinkedIn Email Share Share

If the nominal data doesn’t deceive, the fall in jobs in the pharmaceutical sector in Puerto Rico’s pharmaceutical sector has come in no small part from technological improvements and greater efficiency in production.

Though no doubt there also is a more complex story to be told.

In an industry with ongoing productivity gains, the number of jobs supported in the industry tend to fall over time—it typically takes a rise in production for the number of jobs to grow or stay constant. And that hasn’t happened in Puerto Rico, for a host of reasons. While Puerto Rico hasn’t seen an absolute decline in its pharma exports to the world or to the U.S., it has lost out a bit relative to other “offshore” sources of pharmaceuticals in the U.S. market. Puerto Rico is no longer attracting an ever rising share of the industry—it isn’t winning the competition among tax havens in the way it used to—and without that advantage, production has stalled and jobs have fallen.

LinkedIn Email Share Share

But the pharmaceutical industry still has a big enough presence to basically drive Puerto Rico’s rather extraordinary balance of payments numbers (this, again, uses the Puerto Rican data that counts trade with the fifty states as external trade).

Income (dividends and the like) payments to off-island non-residents (the multinationals) are huge—resulting in a $30 billion or so annual outflow (for a sense of the relative size of this flow, Puerto Rico’s “domestic” economy—GNP—is now around $65 billion). That income deficit not surprisingly is roughly equal to the trade surplus in pharmaceuticals and chemicals. In other words, transfer pricing shifts profits to Puerto Rico, before dividend payments move the profits to yet another jurisdiction.

Excluding pharmaceuticals, Puerto Rico actually runs a significant trade deficit in goods. And that goods deficit in turn is roughly equal to Puerto Rico’s surplus in tourism and the (large) net transfer Puerto Rico receives from the federal government.

LinkedIn Email Share Share

Transfers have gone up in part because of Obama-era policies—ACA funds and the like (see my paper with Greg Makoff). But also because the federal government provides help to poor Americans without jobs—and thus has helped to limit the social impact of Puerto Rico’s ten year slump.

It isn’t a pretty picture.

Puerto Rico is already a tax haven for multinationals and high-income individuals (income earned in Puerto Rico is exempt from federal corporate and income tax: See the Bloomberg explainer). It would have to be even more of a tax haven—not just an offshore jurisdiction but an onshore jurisdiction with a lower tax rate than elsewhere in the U.S.—to gain a further tax advantage. That runs against the desire to broaden the federal tax base.

And the current set of federal transfers haven’t done more than cushion Puerto Rico’s economic slide.

There aren’t any easy answers to Puerto Rico’s long-term economic decline. ****

But on one point I do have conviction: multinational companies, tax-wise, get a better deal in Puerto Rico than in the fifty states; low-wage Puerto Ricans who work on island, by contrast, get a worse deal from the federal government than they would get for work in the fifty states (thanks to the absence of the earned income tax credit). That really needs to change.

* The geographical breakdown of services trade also is informative. The biggest market for U.S. exports of financial services? The UK Caribbean, which accounts for roughly a third of U.S. financial services exports. The biggest market for exports of research and development services? Ireland, with about a quarter of the total in 2014, followed by Switzerland. Ireland, Switzerland, Bermuda, and the UK Caribbean account for over half of total exports of research and development services (see the BEA interactive tables for trade in services, table 2.2). A big part of services trade is the physical movement of people and goods (travel and shipping). And at least for the U.S., a significant share of the rest looks to be related to the movement of intangible assets to low-tax jurisdictions. There are some very real exports in the services data (architectural services, e.g. skyscraper design and engineering, is one of my favorites). But some service exports look to be driven primarily by trade in tax.

** Puerto Rico’s trade data is based on the NAICS classification, which treats pharmaceuticals as a subcategory of organic chemicals. Puerto Rico provides a breakout though for pharmaceuticals (NAICS 3254, a subcategory of NAICS 325).

*** Puerto Rico’s exports of pharmaceuticals to all off island destinations can be compared to the roughly $15 billion—according to the U.S. data—that Puerto Rico exports to destinations other than the fifty states. Or sum up the relevant categories in the (extremely detailed) U.S. data on trade with Puerto Rico. By using the U.S. data on Puerto Rico's pharmaceutical exports to the world rather than Puerto Rico's export data, the New York Times inadvertently understated Puerto Rico's importance to pharmaceutical manufacturing.

The point in each case is that while changes in taxes or transfers may induce changes in how much people work, when you assess these changes you have to bear in mind that, to a first approximation, workers are paid their marginal product.
This means that if increased transfers induce some people to work less, it also causes them to earn less, so that the rest of society isn’t any worse off; if lower taxes induce high earners to work more, it also means that they’re paid more, so that the rest of society doesn’t reap any of the gains.
Reminder: workers care about their welfare, not what happens to GDP.
Making the rich richer without trickle down does the rest of us no good.","Greg Leiserson has an interesting post on assessing tax reform, in which he argues that distribution tables — showing the direct gains and losses from a tax change — properly measure welfare gains, and don’t need to be revised to consider the induced effects on labor supply, effort etc.

This is also, by the way, the logic behind the Diamond-Saez proposition that the optimal top tax rate is the one that maximizes revenue: aside from the taxes they pay, increased effort by the very rich to a first approximation makes no difference to everyone else, because the increase in output is fully captured by higher top incomes.

You look at the jobs data, the gross domestic product data, all the data on how the economy is doing, and I think those have done as well or even better than we were expecting. Obviously, the employment report showed the drop in jobs in September, but we know that was because of the hurricane. I think unemployment will be below 4 percent by this time next year and it’s remarkable — assuming we get below 4 percent — we’ve only seen that a couple of times in the last 50 years.

Q. Yet a lot of prime-age adults have not returned to the work force.

A. Labor force participation is one of those big questions. I won’t say it’s a mystery, but it’s a big question. What we’ve seen has actually been fascinating. As the labor market has improved and unemployment has come down, the labor force participation for prime-age females, 25-54, looks like it is moving back up quite a bit. But for the men, the same age group, this has been pretty flat. That’s something a lot of economists are trying to sort through. To what extent is it structural? To what extent can policies affect that?

We’re in a good place to kind of let this economy run a very strong labor market, with inflation low and no signs of inflationary pressures really picking up yet. A couple more years of roughly 4 percent unemployment and we’re going to learn a lot more about this labor force participation issue and really test this out to see if there’s more people who can come back into this labor market.

Q. Your staff has produced some interesting research suggesting that wage growth has been stronger than it seems. Tell us about that.

A. What my colleagues have highlighted is that a lot of people who are at the end of their careers are retiring, and at the same time we’re pulling in a lot of younger and less experienced workers who are being paid less because they’re new to the work force.

By the way, during the recession this worked the other way. Younger people were laid off and the more experienced workers stayed on, and that helps to explain why we saw wage growth during the recession. To the average person, this is all backward, and that’s why it’s important to look under the hood.

Q. A longstanding economic theory, known as the Phillips Curve, is that inflation increases as unemployment declines. Given unemployment is low, why haven’t we seen stronger inflation?

I’ve been doing this a long time, and the Phillips curve has been declared dead far more times than Mark Twain.

People say that foreign factors matter a lot. I feel like I’ve read this book before. I’ve read it a few times. It’s a plausible hypothesis — obviously global factors are more important today than they were 25 years ago. But you have to test that on the data, and every time we’ve tested that, it generally doesn’t show a robust relationship with U.S. inflation.

Q. So onward and upward?

A. If you look at a dart board view of our objectives, where to the right and the left is unemployment relative to the normal rate, and up and down is inflation relative to 2 percent, we’re not right at the bull’s-eye but we’re about as close to that bull’s-eye as we’ve ever been. This is pretty good.

Q. Beginning in December?

A. My own view is we want to continue this gradual pace of increase. One more rate increase in December and three more next year is a pretty good starting point. I am still data dependent, but that is my baseline view.

My view is that the normal fed funds rate in the future is 2.5 percent, which is pretty low. That’s not a lot of rate increases to get to that normal level, but I do think we want to be moving gradually toward that over the next two years.

Q. Does your outlook include a boost from fiscal policy?

A. My baseline view is that there won’t be a change in fiscal policy that has a significant effect on the economic outlook — not a major tax cut or a major infrastructure package.

Q. Would a tax cut benefit the economy?

A. We don’t need fiscal stimulus in the short run — our economy is strong, we’re in a good place — but I do think it would be valuable if we could find a way to improve the supply side of the economy, labor force participation issues, productivity growth.

I think that the research on corporate tax changes of the kind we’re talking about here is that they have relatively modest positive effects on the supply side. We also know that if major tax changes create much larger deficits and debt, we know that’s going to squeeze out the availability of credit for productive investment too.

Q. You spend a lot of time talking to business leaders in the western U.S. What is their view of the state of economic policy?

A. The word uncertainty comes up far more in my conversations with business and community leaders than it does in the economic data. You look at these market-based indicators, and uncertainty measures are near all-time lows. But when you talk to businesspeople, they’re just very nervous about all of these things. As time has progressed, they’re not seeing the positives and they’re not seeing quite the things they were worried about, but they’re still just nervous about what’s going to happen. How much that’s actually affecting hiring and investment, I can’t say. We’re actually in a strong economy now. It’s not like businesses are struggling.

Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com.

Jimmy Kimmel Goes Home to New York City

Jimmy Kimmel on Monday began a week of broadcasts from the Brooklyn Academy of Music. He usually tapes “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” in Hollywood, but decided to do his show this week from the town where he was born. He could hardly get started without taking a jab at Brooklyn’s reputation for liberal pretentiousness — something it didn’t have during his childhood.

“In honor of our show being here in Brooklyn, all of the jokes you will hear tonight were written in small batches, by hand, on biodegradable hemp parchment, using natural ink that was made from sustainably harvested lingonberries. So rest assured, this is all artisanal tonight.” — JIMMY KIMMEL

Mr. Kimmel is making the broadcasts even more special by having Paul Shaffer, David Letterman’s former musical director and sidekick, sit in with the house band all week. On Monday, Mr. Shaffer took a car ride with Mr. Kimmel — and some very surprised passengers.

Mr. Kimmel also welcomed his fellow comic Amy Schumer, who reminisced about her own childhood in Brooklyn.

... And Trevor Noah Goes to Chicago

Mr. Kimmel isn’t the only late-night host on the road this week. Trevor Noah is hosting “The Daily Show” from Chicago. (Meanwhile, most other hosts are taking the week off.) Mr. Noah started his show on Monday wondering why President Trump and many conservatives seem to relish bemoaning Chicago’s high murder rate.

“People in politics, especially on the right, they always point fingers at Chicago. And it’s weird, because there are other cities with higher murder rates: St. Louis, Baltimore, Memphis, Cleveland. But no one’s ever like, ‘Oh, don’t go to Cleveland.’ Well, they are, but not because of murder.” — TREVOR NOAH

Mr. Noah played clips from Fox News in which commentators suggest that President Barack Obama bears the blame for Chicago’s violence. At that point, Mr. Noah said he’d figured it all out.",Jimmy Kimmel Kicks Off a Week of Shows in Brooklyn,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/arts/television/jimmy-kimmel-live-brooklyn.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The representatives of Fekat I met were incredibly helpful throughout my visit, particularly Eyob Teshome, a Cyr wheel expert and all-around good guy who served as an informal guide for a portion of my stay. He helped acquaint me with the neighborhood, find a local SIM card, answered questions and showed me a few different sights.

He is also, like several Ethiopians I met, incredibly proud of his country. “We are special,” he began, before correcting himself: “We believe we are special,” he said, smiling and looking downward. Mr. Teshome, a devout Christian (most Ethiopians are Christian, either Ethiopian Orthodox or Protestant), talked a bit about Ethiopia and its role in the Bible, and how many Ethiopians view the country — one of the world’s oldest Christian nations — as the promised land.

“And did you know,” asked a smiling Mr. Teshome, as we walked past street hawkers selling mangos and young men offering to clean your sneakers for a few birr, “that we have our own calendar? And that we even have our own time?” Ethiopia works on a 13-month calendar, with 12 30-day months and a 13th intercalary month (a leap month, basically) of five or six days. And instead of working on standard international time, which would put it in the same zone as Moscow, it works on a 12-hour clock determined roughly by sunrise and sunset. What we would call 7 a.m. is simply called “1 o’clock” in Ethiopian time — be careful when making appointments.

After showing me my room — modest, but comfortable, with a bunk bed and shared bathroom down the hallway – Mr. Teshome asked me if there was anything in particular I wanted to do. I said I was up for pretty much anything. “O.K.,” he said. “We’ll go to Merkato.” We hopped on the Chinese-built metro rail at Menilik II Square (right near the beautiful St. George’s Cathedral, where Haile Selassie was crowned emperor in 1930), and rode two stops west to Gojam Berenda (2 birr, less than 10 cents). We exited the station to a completely different world.

I’ve been to markets all over the world but I wasn’t prepared for this. By some accounts, Merkato is the largest open-air market in Africa: It encompasses an entire neighborhood — several square miles of barely controlled chaos. Vendors hawk nearly everything you could possibly imagine. Produce, textiles, car parts, baked goods and massive sacks of colorful incense line the dirt roads packed with honking cars and busy traders trying to avoid getting hit.

Things are roughly divided into sections: All the cookware on one street, towering stacks of colorful plastic containers on another. Against the side of a building under a plastic tarp, I saw a man welding old mechanical gears into weight lifting sets. “Watch your pockets,” Mr. Teshome warned me as we wound our way through the crush of people at the Merkato, passing rows of shoes, colorful T-shirts, bags of spices, slaughtered animals. We stopped to snack on chornake, a dense, doughnut-like fried pastry (2 birr), then each bought a mefakia (also 2 birr), a short stick of wood many Ethiopians use as a natural toothbrush. We continued wandering the market, cleaning our teeth. (Many things in the city cost just a few birr — keep some small change handy.)

Mr. Teshome warned me about pickpockets in the market, but overall, I didn’t find safety to be a problem in the city. I used common sense by limited the amount of walking I did after dark and not mindlessly gazing at my phone while strolling down the street. You may occasionally be gawked and called after — my general sense was that it came from a place of friendliness and curiosity.

But there’s also a serious hustle to many of the locals, primarily young men, who are eager to make a birr or two by cleaning your shoes, selling you knickknacks or escorting you to a destination. I’d generally advise against following strangers anywhere or accepting offers to “show you around.” Decline firmly, but not rudely.

After picking up a local SIM card (with 4G capability) from the Ethio Telecom shop near Minilik Square (bring your passport, a hundred birr or so to top up your phone, and plenty of patience — the wait can be considerable), I was beginning to feel the effect of all my recent travel. It was time for a cup of coffee — lucky for me, Addis Ababa is full of modest streetside coffee stands selling amazing java. No surprise there — coffee is believed to have originated on the Ethiopian highlands.

The best cup of my trip was at Tomoca Coffee, a small storefront on Wawel Street in the Piazza area near where I bunked at the circus (there are a few locations). The cozy, homey shop was packed, and flooded with the warm, earthy scent of ground coffee. I picked up a cup for 14 birr and a frosted doughnut for 15 birr. The doughnut was mediocre, but that was beside the point: The coffee, a dense, bittersweet shot of only three or four ounces, was some of the best I’ve had. You can buy whole bean coffee, too; I picked up a couple of 500-gram bags to bring home (138 birr).

Food and drink are practically a religion in Ethiopia, and there’s no shortage of places to get tasty, family-style meals. Expect thick stews of vegetables and meat eaten together with injera, a sour, spongy fermented bread made from teff, a native grass. At KG Corner, a neighborhood restaurant that’s been operating since 1960, I tried the fasting ferefer (the Ethiopian Orthodox Church prescribes a number of fasting days during which adherents may not eat animal products) for 43 birr and the shiro tegabino, a pea stew (also 43 birr). The ferefer was essentially a spicy vegetable stew that tasted heavily of the deep, earthy berbere spice that Ethiopia is famous for.

Other highlights of my stay included the Holy Trinity Cathedral, also known as the Haile Selassie church (the former emperor is buried on the premises with his wife). Admission to the church and small museum on the property is a relatively expensive 150 birr. For theater buffs, the Ethiopian National Theater, originally constructed during the Italian occupation, is worth visiting for a look at its massive lobby and gilded interior. I even took in a show, “Finger of God” (40 birr). While I don’t speak Amharic, I found the performance engaging.

The National Museum of Ethiopia is just a 15-minute walk from the Holy Trinity Cathedral and, for just a 10-birr admission fee, it is a must-see. The highlight, naturally, is Lucy — the Australopithecine hominid that made an enormous splash when her partial skeleton was discovered in eastern Ethiopia in 1974 by Donald Johanson and Tom Gray.

When she was discovered, the 3.2-million year old Lucy excited the anthropological world because of her well-preserved remains as well as the fact that she walked upright — shedding possible light on the “missing link” of how humans may have evolved. Seeing the bone fragments up close and in person is fascinating even for casual fans of history and paleontology. While the fossil long predates Ethiopia, of course, it serves as a reminder of how much rich history the country has — and what fascinating discoveries await the curious traveler.","Navigating Sometimes Chaotic, Always Fascinating Addis Ababa",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/travel/addis-ababa-ethiopia-budget-frugal.html

“This is where it happened,” my Russian guide declared. It was 1979 and I was a graduate student in Moscow for the summer. A side trip to Leningrad was a must for me, a first time traveler to the country. “Czar Alexander II was riding down this road when the assassins struck,” she said. Almost under her breath, she added, “He was a reformer.” Any hope for the liberalization of Russia seemed to die with the czar who had freed the serfs and attempted to modernize the country. Alexander II’s death brought to power his hard-line successor Alexander III, who initiated a harsh crackdown (among those soon executed was the older brother of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin). This would only sharpen the conflict in the country. Peasants had no bread. Workers’ lives were miserable and often endangered. And soldiers were forced into battle in the Great War, a fight they could not win. Alexander III’s son and successor, the hapless Nicholas II, would abdicate in 1917. The parliamentary government of Alexander Kerensky would survive less than a year.

From the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood it was just a short walk across the square to the Winter Palace, where workers’ militias seized power and laid the foundation for the Bolshevik Revolution and more than seven decades of Communist rule. “Peace, Land and Bread,” they promised.

“Ten Days That Shook the World” captures the excitement of that moment. The author, John Reed, was an American who made no secret of his Bolshevik sympathies. He nevertheless provided a riveting and vivid — if not impartial — account of the most pivotal phase of the revolution, as viewed from the ground.

From his vantage point, Reed could only tell a part of the story, however. To fully understand the Bolshevik Revolution, one must also appreciate the long trajectory of Russian history. Two other seminal works, James Billington’s “The Icon and the Axe” and Sheila Fitzpatrick’s “The Russian Revolution,” stand alongside “Ten Days” as indispensable guides to these events.

And that is what is worrying global watchdogs. Last year, developing nations issued a record $133 billion in debt, according to Bond Radar, a data gathering outfit. Bankers have forecast another stellar year in 2017, approaching $150 billion — an amount that is nearly twice what was raised in 2015. The I.M.F. warned last week that this rush to snap up the debt of financially fragile countries could end badly. Many of these countries are already burdened with high levels of debt, and analysts fear that as they issue more they will be unable to meet financing requirements if interest rates rise sharply.

“These easy financial conditions might last for a while, but the longer they last the more the vulnerabilities build up,” said Tobias Adrian, who heads the I.M.F.’s monetary and capital markets division. “The impulse is to lever up when times are good, and we want to lean against that.”

A Rush Into Emerging Market Bonds Governments in emerging markets have taken advantage of rock-bottom interest rates to borrow record amounts from bonds in the last two years. ’11 ’12 ’13 ’14 ’15 ’16 ’17 billion $100 50 0 Year-to-date ⤵

The rush into the bonds of such nations shows just how short memories can be in the financial world.

Mongolia, for example, was a darling of the investment community before commodity prices collapsed in 2014 and 2015. Now the country’s bonds are being restructured because the government is short of funds. And it was not that long ago that Greece, even with its towering debt load, was an investor favorite.

Ground zero for this mash-up between finance ministers flogging bonds and yield-starved investors looking to buy them was the lobby of the Mayflower Hotel in downtown Washington.

That was where Joyce Chang, J. P. Morgan’s head of global research and a pioneer in emerging market bond investing, was holding the investment bank’s traditional bond jamboree, timed to coincide with the fund’s twice-a-year meetings.

More than any other global investment bank, J. P. Morgan has a special power when it comes to emerging market bonds. Unlike its competitors, it oversees the standard benchmarks for the corporate and government bonds issued by such countries, the most prominent being its Emerging Market Bond Index, which tracks the sovereign bonds issued by more than 60 countries. Investors, especially exchange-traded funds, buy or sell bonds based on whether they are in — or out — of these closely watched indexes.

Harried central bankers and finance ministers rushed in and out of the hotel lobby, trailing entourages of aides and security guards as their black town cars idled by the curb.

On Thursday, rooms overflowing with eager listeners heard pitches from the finance minister of Brazil, whose country’s economy is recovering, and the head of the central bank of Argentina, which has become an investor favorite after it recently issued a bond that doesn’t mature for 100 years. The response from the floor was ebullient, with one investor pressing Brazil’s finance chief, Henrique Meirelles, on whether he planned to run for president.

What distinguishes this emerging market bond rally from others, bankers and economists say, is the extent to which it is being led by less financially mature markets like the Ivory Coast, Iraq and Suriname, which in the past have relied on credit from institutions such as the I.M.F. and the World Bank to finance government spending initiatives.

This year, lower-income emerging economies are expected to issue close to $10 billion in government bonds, according to the I.M.F., more than the past two years combined.

Of all of them, a recent $500 million bond offering by Tajikistan, a landlocked former Soviet republic that has rarely interacted with global investors, was the most curious. Tajikistan is paying investors an interest rate of just over 7 percent for 10 years, and the deal was a quick and easy sell for the country’s bankers, with demand several times the amount of money secured.

The half-billion dollars raised is especially staggering when compared to the size of Tajikistan’s economy. The cash influx represents 7 percent of its gross domestic product and dwarfs the $74 million the country holds in foreign exchange reserves.

“We were all scratching our heads over that one,” said Brett A. Rowley, an emerging market bond investor at TCW in Los Angeles, which passed on the Tajikistan bonds.

For his part, Mr. Rowley loves Egyptian Treasury bills. He promoted them on an investor panel at the Institute of International Finance’s conference, touting their mouthwatering yields and the strength of the Egyptian lira. After the panel, he cornered Mr. Amer, the Egyptian central bank head and said, “I told everyone: buy more T bills!”

Other countries are looking to dig into this fertile ground.

“We have seen a lot interest in Sri Lankan paper,” said P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, the deputy governor of the Sri Lankan central bank. So bullish are investors about Sri Lanka, Mr. Weerasinghe said, that some are even asking that the country issue 30-year bonds. Earlier this year, Sri Lanka sold $1.5 billion in 10-year bonds and Mr. Weerasinghe said there was investor demand for seven times that amount.

Mr. Nnanna, Nigeria’s deputy central bank governor, said he was gearing up for a round of meetings with Goldman Sachs, J. P. Morgan and Bank of America.

The Nigerian economy has been hit hard by the drop in the price of oil and is increasingly reliant on foreign borrowing to pay for government expenditures. Earlier this year, Nigeria issued a $1 billion, 15-year bond. Demand far outstripped supply. “We are ready to issue bonds for 20 years now,” Mr. Nnanna said.

In the past, these frenzies often ended in pain for all. Explaining why his bonds are a safe bet, Mr. Nnanna repeated a notorious maxim attributed to Walter B. Wriston, the chief executive of Citibank — made at the onset of the Latin American debt crisis in the early 1980s.

The point in each case is that while changes in taxes or transfers may induce changes in how much people work, when you assess these changes you have to bear in mind that, to a first approximation, workers are paid their marginal product.
This means that if increased transfers induce some people to work less, it also causes them to earn less, so that the rest of society isn’t any worse off; if lower taxes induce high earners to work more, it also means that they’re paid more, so that the rest of society doesn’t reap any of the gains.

This is also, by the way, the logic behind the Diamond-Saez proposition that the optimal top tax rate is the one that maximizes revenue: aside from the taxes they pay, increased effort by the very rich to a first approximation makes no difference to everyone else, because the increase in output is fully captured by higher top incomes.

The reissue, a two-disc boxed set with extensive liner notes called “Any Other Way,” comes out Oct. 20. It is the first comprehensive collection of Ms. Shane’s music, which electrified primarily Canadian audiences throughout the 1960s. In 1963, the title track — a buttery William Bell cover — was a local hit on Toronto radio and peaked at No. 2 on the singles chart there, ahead of Skeeter Davis’s “The End of the World” and below the Chiffons’ “He’s So Fine.”

Ms. Shane walked away from her career without explanation in 1971. In the intervening decades, she has become an internet curiosity and minor cult heroine among soul music aficionados who have spun crackpot theories as to her whereabouts and well-being.

Over two telephone calls this fall, Ms. Shane, who is now 77, spoke to The New York Times for her first-ever extensive interviews with the press, and first public remarks of any kind since she disappeared 46 years ago.

She was eager to break her silence.

“I told Sam and Doug: If you want me to be phony, you’ve got the wrong person,” Ms. Shane said, referring to her publicist and Mr. Mcgowan.

She was born in Nashville in 1940, black and transgender at a time when either meant a life of constriction and compromise. Before she ever set foot on a stage, Ms. Shane’s existence was itself a tightrope walk, pitched between third rails in the Jim Crow South.

Though she said she self-identified as a woman in a man’s body by the time she was 13, Ms. Shane occasionally described herself to peers as gay — several decades before the movement for transgender rights altered the discourse around gender and sexuality. Throughout her career, she was referred to publicly as a man.

“I was just being me,” she said. “I never tried to explain myself to anyone — they never explained themselves to me.”

Around 1959, she emigrated to Toronto, where she wore wigs and makeup onstage and off — typically paired with fur, silk or sequins. In front of rapt nightclub audiences, when she sang with husky, quavering verve, or turned interstitial monologues into febrile, secular sermons, she was exhibiting a kind of radical transparency.

Ms. Shane’s memorable rendition of “Any Other Way” contains a line — “Tell her that I’m happy, tell her that I’m gay” — that she imbued with subversive subtext.

“You know, you’re supposed to live,” she says in a monologue from the live version included on the boxed set, outlining her own liberation theology. “As long as you don’t force your will and your way on others, forget ‘em, baby, you don’t need ‘em.”

Before she left the grid in 1971, Ms. Shane studied under Little Richard and the Upsetters, and shared stages with Etta James, Jackie Wilson and the Impressions, among other R&B and soul icons. But she never recorded a studio album, in part because of the fledgling state of Canada’s music industry at the time and her own distrust of record labels. In the years after she stopped performing, Ms. Shane’s star, like that of so many almost-famous performers dotting the universe of postwar popular music, quietly dimmed.

Ms. Shane said she’d spent the better part of the last five decades in Los Angeles, where she first moved to be with her mother, Jessie Shane. Ms. Shane’s stepfather died in 1963, and the singer said she felt guilty pursuing a career thousands of miles away while her mother lived alone. So she left it behind, and cared for her mother until her death in 1997.

In Nashville, Ms. Shane has sought a clean break from her past. She said she moved back eight or nine years ago and now lives alone.

She is reclusive and ventures outside only rarely — once a month for supplies (including pet food: her black-and-gold cat is named Sweetie), or for the occasional walk. She declined to say how she’s supported herself, but said she’s never had a job other than music.

When Ms. Shane does leave the house, she dresses in a hat and sunglasses out of fear of being recognized. She estimates that her neighbors have spotted her only “three or four” times in the near decade since she moved in.

“I don’t mingle,” she said, because “down South, gossiping and meddling is like breathing.”

She was at times unapologetically misanthropic, tracing her distrust of others to her upbringing in Nashville. As a child, Ms. Shane turned heads by speaking and dressing in an openly feminine manner from an early age. She disarmed busybodies and browbeaters with preternatural self-confidence and an innate survival instinct that could turn ferocious.

For example, she recalled a schoolyard bully who made the mistake of striking her with a stone in the fourth grade. “He wanted to torment me and I would never allow that,” Ms. Shane said, still defiant. She used a jump rope to thrash him — and then, in a fight-or-flight fury, turned the whip on a teacher who attempted to intervene.

Not all of her antagonists were as conventional. Ms. Shane said she had twice escaped inappropriate touching from older men who were friends of her family, beginning when she was as young as five. The experiences shaded her worldview.

Recent advances in gay and transgender rights have done little to brighten it. Asked for her thoughts on the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision upholding gay marriage, Ms. Shane expressed limited enthusiasm. “We should have been able to do it from the beginning,” she said. “We’ve had to fight for everything that should have already been on the table.”

Today, her domestic life is both extraordinary and familiar. Ms. Shane has never learned to cook (“I’m a terror in the kitchen, honey — I could set water on fire”) and has food catered four to five times per week (when craving strikes, she orders from Domino’s). She says she’s accumulated an extensive library of movies and TV shows, and enjoys watching old Hollywood films with stars like Peter Lorre, Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford.

Lately, though, she’s been binge-watching the NBC fantasy drama “Grimm,” about a homicide detective who discovers a hidden world of mythological creatures.

“Every culture has some kind of boogeyman,” she said.

After the release of Ms. Shane’s anthology, Mr. Mcgowan is hopeful that renewed interest will prompt her to return to public life, and — in a perfect world — the stage. Ms. Shane made no such promises in her interviews. But, she said, a recent glance at the popular music landscape has at least stirred the thought.

“I’m going to have to school these people again,” she said.","Jackie Shane, a Transgender Soul Pioneer, Re-emerges After Four Decades",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/15/arts/music/jackie-shane-transgender-soul-pioneer.html

In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.”

For his part, Mr. Weinstein acknowledged, in a larger statement to The New York Post, that his actions could have a negative impact on Ms. Chapman’s company. Marchesa’s public profile depended largely on its connection to Hollywood — the label does not advertise — and, fair or not, Ms. Chapman and her line are now swept up in this unfolding story.

The refrain from major department stores in response to requests for comment? “We just don’t want to be part of this story.”

But that is unavoidable. Fashion is already deeply involved.

Not just because on Tuesday a petition was begun by Care2 asking Nordstrom to drop the Donna Karan and DKNY lines in response to Ms. Karan’s comments (though she herself is no longer involved with either label).

And not just because fashion has its own history with sexual harassment and the poor treatment of young women, including increasingly documented abuses of models and the many claims against the photographer Terry Richardson (who, after some time away, is still working in the industry).

Mr. Weinstein, more than perhaps any film executive of the modern era, seemed to understand the role fashion could play as he built an upmarket brand in which box office performance was important, but so were glitter and good reviews.

He introduced “Project Runway.” Along with the shoe designer Tamara Mellon he was instrumental in the revival of Halston, for which he corralled Sarah Jessica Parker, the celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe (who often dressed her clients in Marchesa) and the private equity firm Hilco as partners. He licensed the option to revive the Charles James brand the same year the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art featured a Charles James exhibition.

When actresses from his films campaigned for Oscars, there and elsewhere, guess whose dresses they often wore?

“We all knew celebrities were asked to wear Marchesa if they were in a Weinstein movie,” said the co-owner of a fashion communications company who asked not to be identified. “They were supposed to wear it at least once. We all knew that cycle.”

Going all the way back to his days at Miramax, the first of two studios Mr. Weinstein co-founded, he put out fashion-themed films.

In 1994, Mr. Weinstein released Robert Altman’s “Prêt-à-Porter.” In 2009, he acquired the North American distribution rights for “A Single Man,” the designer Tom Ford’s debut film. In 2011, he acquired Madonna’s “W.E.,” a period drama about Wallis Simpson in which the gowns were almost the only thing that got good notices.

Mr. Ford would never have held up Mr. Weinstein as the poster boy for how to treat women.

Still, Mr. Ford said Thursday, it was a far cry from what was revealed over the last week and a half, through two exposés in The New York Times outlining allegations of a pattern of sexual harassment and assault and a third from The New Yorker detailing accusations of rape.

“What Harvey has done is shocking, indefensible and disturbing on many levels,” Mr. Ford said. “I knew that Harvey certainly liked beautiful young women.” But, he added: “I had no idea of his predatory and abusive behavior or that he had paid settlements to anyone.” Mr. Ford noted that since he himself is a gay man, Mr. Weinstein’s “sex life would certainly not have been something that he would have felt the need to share with me.”

Ms. Parker collaborated with Mr. Weinstein at Halston. “Over the last two decades, through various projects, I’ve always maintained a relationship with him that I was, for the most part, comfortable with,” she said. “Now I feel he is a stranger, that I didn’t know him at all. And desperately sad to hear how so many women have suffered.”

And Ms. Mellon, referring to sexual predation, concurred: “I never saw anything like that. That behavior usually happens when no else is watching and in private. If I had seen it, I would have stopped it. I only ever witnessed raging and threats, but that was toward me and I pushed back when he did that.”

Mr. Weinstein’s increased presence on the fashion circuit seemed to coincide with his shrinking presence in the film world. Optics had always been essential to his prestige brand, so it made some sense that he leaned on an industry selling illusions to help maintain his myth. The razzle-dazzle of Harvey and his wife on red carpets all over the world was a good distraction when fewer awards were coming his way.

“Project Runway” helped, too. It made stars out of the designer Michael Kors, the model Heidi Klum and the editor Nina Garcia. Lauren Zalaznick, then the head of the Bravo network, where the show debuted, said: “On the surface, of course, it was a logical extension into TV. But what it really did was help build a firmer network within the fashion and publishing industries. It lent even more proximity to the power of relationships with designers, editors and models, and the scepter of magazine covers, more and different awards, political and socially minded fund-raisers, and the attendant money, glamour and even more power that comes along with that territory.”

A spinoff, “Project Runway All Stars,” which debuted in 2012, features Ms. Chapman as a judge; the next season has already been filmed.

Mr. Weinstein was a key fund-raiser for amfAR, whose gala during the Cannes Film Festival is the most fashion-centric event on the movie festival circuit. Ms. Klum was honored by the organization in 2013.

LVMH, the French luxury conglomerate, has a 1 percent stake in the Weinstein Company. In 2007, Mr. Weinstein wrote the profile of Mr. Arnault for the Time 100 most influential people list. In 2011, he told The Wall Street Journal, “When I wasn’t doing so well, Anna would give a party and put me next to Bernard Arnault.”

A person familiar with LVMH said the two men barely knew each other.

Mr. Weinstein was also a regular at the Met Gala, which has been co-chaired by Ms. Wintour since 1999, and at the Council of Fashion Designers of America awards. (In 2016, there were plans for the Weinstein Company to produce a television special on the CFDA awards, but it fell through, Mr. Kolb said, when they realized that the event was not paced for television.) Mr. Weinstein appeared in front rows, including those of Marchesa, Dior, Louis Vuitton and Burberry.

It was at a fashion show that the actress Léa Seydoux met Mr. Weinstein, she wrote in The Guardian. He then requested a private meeting with her, she said, which quickly turned inappropriate. (She also wrote about watching him pursue another woman at the Met Gala.) The model turned actress Cara Delevingne recently accused Mr. Weinstein of pursuing her and repeating to her details of her personal life as reported in the tabloids.

Trish Goff, a model who was a regular in the pages of Vogue and appeared in campaigns for Chanel and Dior, said she met Mr. Weinstein at a cocktail party at Ms. Wintour’s house in 2003 when she was 25. “He came in and someone said, ‘Oh, there’s Harvey Weinstein,’ so I turned to look at him, and he was looking at me,” she said. Shortly thereafter her agent got a call from his office inviting her to lunch.

She recalled: “This was at a time in my career when I was starting to think about what’s next. I was nervous about it, because he had a reputation, but I was equally nervous about not going because I was a single mother, and what if he made it so I didn’t work anymore? So I said, ‘O.K., tell him I’ll have lunch.’”

They ended up at the Tribeca Grill. “When I arrived, I discovered we were seated in a private room,” she said. “I asked him why he had wanted to have lunch, and he said ‘You were looking at me’ — as if to imply I was interested. I said, ‘Yes, I was looking at you because you are Harvey Weinstein, and I had never seen you before.’

“Then he started asking me if I had a boyfriend, and if we had an open relationship. I said I wasn’t interested in an open relationship, but he was relentless, and I kept trying to shut that down and move on. Then he started putting his hands on my legs, and I said, ‘Can you stop doing that?’ When we finally stood up to go, he really started groping me, grabbing my breasts, grabbing my face and trying to kiss me. I kept saying, ‘Please stop, please stop, but he didn’t until I managed to get back into the public space.

“The horrible thing is, as a model, it wasn’t that unusual to be in a weird situation where a photographer or someone feels they have a right to your body.”

Ms. Hofmeister, Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, said he could not be reached for comment on Ms. Goff’s allegations and directed a reporter to a previous statement denying allegations of nonconsensual sex.

Now Marchesa has become yet another symbol of Mr. Weinstein’s abuse of power, a brand he helped mastermind and support. There is now a #boycottmarchesa hashtag on Twitter. Helzberg Diamonds, which held the license for Marchesa’s bridal jewelry, announced it had delayed the planned line.

“The relationship helped the business tremendously,” said Stellene Volandes, the editor of Town & Country. “Marchesa had such great success on the red carpet and became known for that.” (Ms. Chapman appeared on the cover of the magazine in 2009.)

The label, which was founded in 2004 by Ms. Chapman and Keren Craig, first received real attention that same year, when Renée Zellweger, the star of the Miramax film “Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,” appeared on the red carpet in a Marchesa dress. She was followed shortly thereafter by Cate Blanchett, who wore Marchesa to the Rome premiere of “The Aviator,” also produced by Miramax.

In recent years, Marchesa’s red-carpet magic has dimmed and its celebrity placements have lost a bit of their star power, yet the label’s princess-y dresses still found eager takers. In 2017, Octavia Spencer, who has appeared in movies produced by Mr. Weinstein, wore a custom Marchesa gown to the Academy Awards, when she was nominated for her role in “Hidden Figures.”

When stars did wear the label, there was often a connection to Mr. Weinstein. Jennifer Jason Leigh wore Marchesa to the Academy Awards in 2016, when she was a nominee for her role in “The Hateful Eight,” directed by Quentin Tarantino (and executive-produced by the Weinstein brothers).

But Hollywood stylists who work with such stars and fashion houses to find dresses for premieres, award shows and red carpet events, appear to be taking a wait-and-see approach on the label. Of a half-dozen top stylists who have used Marchesa, not one would comment on how the Weinstein revelations would have an impact on their use of Marchesa.

“There’s a mob mentality that has developed,” said Lauren Santo Domingo, a founder of Moda Operandi, an online fashion retailer, who said she was standing behind Marchesa. On Wednesday, the brand postponed a planned preview of its spring 2018 collection to an unspecified “later date.” The company is hunkering down, and could not be reached for comment.

“I think the issue is no one knows what to say to Georgina, or the words to use,” Mr. Kolb said. “But as a creative power and as a CFDA member, she is someone who deserves the industry’s support and backing.”

Indeed, said Julie Gilhart, a fashion consultant and the former fashion director of Barneys New York: “We are living in a time right now when we should try to find the words.”",Fashion Breaks Its Silence on Harvey Weinstein Scandal,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/style/harvey-weinstein-marchesa-georgina-chapman-anna-wintour.html

BEIRUT, Lebanon — Kurdish-led forces said on Tuesday that they had taken all of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa from the Islamic State, a major blow to the militant group, which had long used it as the de facto capital of its self-declared caliphate.

Officers with the Syrian Democratic Forces, an American-backed militia group made up of Syrian Kurds and Arabs, said by phone and in press statements that they had taken control of the city after a monthslong campaign. But the United States Central Command stopped short of declaring victory, saying that fighters were checking to make sure all areas were clear.

Celebrations had already begun in Raqqa, where residents had lived under the repressive rule of militants who beheaded people in a central square for offenses as minor as smoking or communicating on the internet without permission. Fighters could be seen cheering in the streets, according to residents reached by phone and text message.

Still, the victory came with a heavy cost. Much of the city was devastated by American-led airstrikes that killed more than 1,000 civilians, according to tallies by local activists and international monitors. About 270,000 residents have been displaced by the fighting, and thousands of homes were destroyed.

“I HAVE FOUND IT!” Mary Shelley remembered thinking when she awoke from a fateful nightmare in the summer of 1816 with a thunderclap of inspiration. “What terrified me will terrify others.” These terrors provided the raw material for “Frankenstein,” which she composed at 19 and published anonymously in London two years later, unleashing one of the great ogres of the imagination into the world. “I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out,” she wrote, “and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life.” To quote the mad doctor responsible for him in the 1931 Universal Pictures film: “It’s alive!” Now, as the 200th birthday of Shelley’s Monster — or, really, her monstrous allegory — fast approaches, he remains at large.

But a monstrous allegory for what, exactly? Like all great myths, Shelley’s tale shape-shifts to suit any number of freaky interpretations without sacrificing the original’s hellacious powers. It could be a 19th-century premonition about the dangers of biotechnology, or a fable about the possibilities of male birth and all the horror such transgressions of the so-called natural invoke. Though “Frankenstein” also remains one of the most savage tales about father-son dysfunction, the Monster is a daddy, too, responsible in some ways for fantastic creations including Marilyn Manson; “The Rise of the Planet of the Apes” (2011), which turns, like Shelley’s tale, on the education of an “uncivilized” beast; and Rei Kawakubo’s “bump” dresses (1997), recently on view at the Met, which distort the bodies of their wearers to throw monstrous shadows. Yet there’s something about this story of unhallowed arts that makes it darkly resonant for queer artists beyond any other group.

When you’re gay and grow up feeling like a hideous misfit, fully conscious that some believe your desires to be wicked and want to kill you for them, identifying with the Monster is hardly a stretch: A misunderstood beast finds solace in the solitude of the woods, but seems to endlessly face the wrath of the torch-bearing, small-minded inhabitants in the world beyond. There have been explicitly queer representations of Frankenstein’s creature at least since “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” the camp classic that has been screened more or less continuously since its release in 1975, in which the titular monster (created by transvestite Frank-N-Furter) is a lithe blond male in skimpy gold lamé. (The X-rated “Andy Warhol’s Flesh for Frankenstein,” a retelling of Shelley that gleefully chronicles the doctor’s attempt to create a “perfect” man, predates “Rocky Horror” by about a year.) More recently, on television, “Penny Dreadful” (2014) and “The Cleveland Show” (2011) have starred gay versions of Frankenstein or his Monster.

If vampires occupy a magical role in the erotic life of adolescents as cultivated loners (consider Robert Pattinson in the “Twilight” saga, 2008-12, or everybody in “Only Lovers Left Alive,” 2013), Frankenstein’s Monster is their nightmarish queer counterpart. He’s a misfit child spurned by his father who grows up to be a sensitive oddity, too strange to be accepted by society or reproduce naturally and forced to seek refuge in seclusion. The artist Richard Hawkins, whose oeuvre could be understood as a complex wrestling match with the meanings of the Monster, and who has painted stitched-together creatures alongside lusty young men, wisely pinpointed the reasons for this queer sympathy as well as whatever divides the zombie from the vampire in a 2009 interview in the book “Of Two Minds, Simultaneously.” As a child he fell for Frankenstein‘s Monster “because he’s clumsy, shy and misunderstood; Dracula because he’s dandyish, nocturnal and misunderstood.”

Bill Condon’s 1998 film “Gods and Monsters” created both a kind of queer origin story and creation myth for the Monster’s continuing presence in popular culture. An account of the last days of James Whale, director of the 1931 adaptation of “Frankenstein,” the film begins as a tame biopic but soon mutates into a very peculiar discursion about the seductions and strangeness of flesh. It features Ian McKellen as Whale fighting a naked handyman played by Brendan Fraser, his beefcake head obscured by a gas mask, steamy poolside shenanigans straight from a Honcho magazine dreamscape and evocations of a putrid soldier strobe-lit by lightning strikes. Whale’s unrequited lust for the hunk kinkily inverts the longing-loathing dynamics between Monster and Doctor, but a hint of romance still quivers through the proceedings and at its climax, the Monster (or Fraser?) escorts Whale over eldritch moorland to his death. (Condon has been enlisted to direct a new version of Whale’s “Bride of Frankenstein” in 2019.)

Why didn’t 9/11 change anything?
Partly because unlike Pearl Harbor, terrorism wasn’t and isn’t an existential threat.
In fact, you have to wonder what the response to Pearl Harbor would have been if the GOP of 1941 had been what it was in 2001.
The first day of infamy brought the country together and showed our fundamental strength.","It’s 9/11 again – and almost nobody is commemorating the anniversary. It didn’t even occur to me to use my print column space for the purpose, given all the ongoing current horrors. But since I have a bit of time before my 14-hour flight, I thought I’d take a few minutes to talk about what was supposed to happen after 9/11, but didn’t.

In the weeks and months after the atrocity, news media had a narrative about what it meant – basically, that it was a Pearl Harbor moment that brought America together with a new seriousness and resolve. This was comforting and reassuring. It was also totally false, literally from the first minutes.

The truth, as we now know, is that Bush administration officials rejoiced, even as the fires were still burning, at the opportunity they now had to fight the unrelated war they always wanted. But that wasn’t all: Republicans in Congress also saw opportunity for partisan gain from the start. Within less than two days Congressional staffers were telling me about GOP efforts to exploit the atrocity to ram through a cut in capital gains taxes.

The thing was, people just didn’t want to hear about this reality. When I wrote a column relaying what was happening in Congress, I was flooded with angry mail from readers – readers angry not at Republicans for exploiting the event, but at me for reporting it. “How can I tell that to my young son?” wrote one furious correspondent.

It took years for people to accept the shameful truth. And it took even longer for the news media: a plurality of voters had concluded that the Iraq war was sold with lies long before it was considered acceptable to say this in polite company.

Why didn’t 9/11 change anything? Partly because unlike Pearl Harbor, terrorism wasn’t and isn’t an existential threat. Yes, it’s scary; but you had to be an idiot to think that there was any risk of an Islamic takeover of the West. This meant that domestic political villains felt free both to continue their villainy and to treat terror just as another thing to exploit.

Beyond that, by 2001 we were already deep into extreme polarization driven by the radicalization of the GOP. (No, it’s not “both sides.”) Anyone who says that Trump has made the Republican Party unrecognizable has forgotten about Tom DeLay.

In fact, you have to wonder what the response to Pearl Harbor would have been if the GOP of 1941 had been what it was in 2001. I suspect Republicans would have declared that it was FDR’s fault and opposed government borrowing to pay for World War II, not to mention price controls and rationing.

In any case, at this point we can see that 9/11’s place in the American story ended up being almost the opposite of Pearl Harbor’s. The first day of infamy brought the country together and showed our fundamental strength. The second tore us further apart, and highlighted our political decay.",The Day Nothing Changed,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/09/11/the-day-nothing-changed/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog Main&contentCollection=Opinion&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body

They had checked on the residents after the storm and found, Mr. Young said, that they needed “just about everything”: food, water, cleaning supplies. Ms. Albors set up a line of credit with a local supplier for $5,000.

“Really, it’s very fragile here,” he said. “Like everyone, we’re trying — day by day, in this new reality we’re living in Puerto Rico — to move forward.”

Since the storm, Ms. Albors has worked around the clock: late nights in the office, calls with Mr. Russi first thing in the morning. Sleep, she said, has been difficult to come by.

“I always work like this,” she said. “I’m always on a mission here.”

But now the work also kept her occupied. Ms. Albors, who came to New York in 2000, grew up in Manatí, a city on the northern coast. Like much of the island, it, too, was pounded by the hurricane. Ms. Albors thought of her nieces and nephews — “They’re my life,” she said — and her mother, who is in her 70s and was alone in Manatí.

As the days wore on, the list of needs kept growing. The messages kept arriving. But she could tell a tide had shifted: Now, she was receiving pictures of smiling volunteers handing out bags of supplies and of teenagers cleaning the homes of older people. The other list, the one by the window, grew, too: More things were getting done.

Mr. Russi described the work as a collective effort. But Ms. Albors, he said, was at the center of it. “I can move things; I can make things happen,” he said. “She has such great connections in Puerto Rico. She has a real good network and good sense of the island, so giving her charge of this thing has been a godsend.”

The cargo container still had not made it to the island. It was supposed to take a week to get there, but then, the shipping company told her, it would be at least a week longer. But, she said, that had not halted their work: Another plane was bringing 50 more generators and more than 1,000 tarps.

And as her phone kept vibrating with messages, she received one she had been waiting for. There was a picture of her mother, leaning back in a rocking chair, safe and content.

37A: This is one of those clues that was probably a no-brainer for some of you, but I went down the catwalk looking for an answer to “Prep for the runway, maybe.” We’re dealing with airliners, not fashion lines, and the answer is a crossword stalwart, DEICE.

51A: Religious references always bounce off my unschooled mind, but I find Pope Francis’ personality fascinating and when I saw this quote — “when one goes against one’s conscience” — I assumed that he meant guilt, which didn’t fit. This was also probably not a universally difficult clue, but it was a thought-provoking one for me. He’s referring to SIN, something I’ve always thought of as an absolute, objective rather than subjective or personal.

72A: “Cause of insomnia, maybe” just had to be guilt. Why did I fixate on this particular sensation while doing this puzzle? Worry, stress, self-doubt, a strong urge to begin a move to Scandinavia at 3 a.m. — there are many things that can keep one up at night. Including, I guess, a DRIP — be it a slow leak or someone who just won’t stop talking.

138A: An example of how precise cluing can be, “We should avoid doing that” led me to snap in BAD IDEA when I was first circling the grid.

46D: This term for a “ratcheting wheel mechanism,” PAWL, was a completely new word to me. It wasn’t a blocker for anything so I just let it fill itself in with crosses at the end of solving. This used to happen to me all the time when I started doing puzzles 350 years ago, but these days it’s a novelty to discover a common word like this. It’s also used in the puzzle, though rarely.

In absolute numbers, the population of immigrants in Los Angeles, Oakland and other California metropolitan areas dwarfs that of Sonoma County. But immigrants play a significant role here: nearly one-fifth of the residents in Santa Rosa’s metropolitan area are foreign-born, according to an analysis by Manuel Pastor, a professor at the University of Southern California who studies immigration. Latin American immigrants, mainly from Mexico, dominate the blue-collar work force.

Immigrant enclaves straddle Sebastopol Road, a thoroughfare in Santa Rosa lined with Latino-owned restaurants, supermarkets and gown shops catering to teenage girls celebrating their quinceañeras. Coffey Park, a Santa Rosa neighborhood that is home to many foreign-born residents, was devastated by blazes lit by flaming embers that flew across a six-lane highway.

Immigrants make up a majority of the 55,000 people employed by the wine industry and are also ubiquitous in the kitchens of farm-to-table restaurants and ritzy resorts that make the region a magnet for affluent tourists.

Sonoma County also has some of the highest rents in the country, on a par with the San Francisco Bay Area. But pay here tends to be lower than in the city.

In San Francisco, housekeepers at unionized hotels earn about $23 an hour, compared with $11 to $13 an hour in Sonoma County, according to Unite Here, the union that represents room cleaners in those areas.

“It’s extremely expensive to live in Sonoma County, and rents keep going up,” said Wei-Ling Huber, president of Unite Here in the region, “The fire is only going to exacerbate the housing crisis.”

Indeed, it is not uncommon for immigrants who earn $40,000 annually to pay $1,800 a month in rent in Santa Rosa, and anecdotal evidence suggests that prices have been rising since the fires swept through.

Manuel Vieyra was paying $1,650 a month to rent a three-bedroom house. Having endured a traumatic escape as his house went up in flames last week, his family is now struggling to find a place they can afford.

“They’re asking $2,000, even $2,800 a month,” he said. “I don’t know what we’ll do.” The family, which lost everything, also needs to scrounge up the money to replace their car, which his wife used to reach her housekeeping job, and his work truck.

Mr. Vieyra, a 51-year-old father of three, works in high-end residential construction and has lived in Sonoma County since he crossed the border as a teenager to work in the vineyards of Sebastopol.

His family is camping out at a friend’s small house, rather than in one of the shelters, out of concern that Mr. Vieyra and his wife, Fabiola, who are both undocumented Mexicans, could be arrested.

Spanish-language media and advocacy groups have publicized that federal immigration authorities will not be conducting enforcement actions in areas affected by the fires. Senator Kamala Harris, the California Democrat, tweeted over the weekend that she had “personally confirmed” that policy with the acting Homeland Security secretary, Elaine Duke.

But at a tidy, comfortable shelter at the Finley Community Center in Santa Rosa, there appeared to be no Latinos in sight on Sunday, not even in the semiprivate “family suites.”

Even those who did not lose their homes have had their lives upended.

For years, Manuel Correa has tended the gardens of 40 homes in an exclusive subdivision in Santa Rosa. At least 10 of the houses were destroyed, and another 25 were evacuated. Mr. Correa and his crew have not worked for a week.

“I’m worried about how we’ll manage; there are so many bills,” said Mr. Correa, 29, who has two young children and another on the way. His monthly rent is $2,000.

No one expects a prolonged work shortage, as cleanup and reconstruction will create a demand for cheap labor, and the vineyards were largely untouched.

The question is whether the workers can find places to stay.

Unlike other victims of the wildfires, undocumented immigrants do not qualify for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. They also do not qualify for unemployment and welfare benefits.

A coalition of immigrant-service providers and advocates on Sunday started Undocufund, a fund-raising effort for undocumented families affected by the fires. By Monday, it had raised about $44,000. The Sonoma County Grape Growers Foundation plans to announce a fund on Tuesday to help farmworkers pay their rent, find housing and refurnish their dwellings.

Duff Bevill, head of Bevill Vineyard Management, which harvests his vineyards and those of 30 other growers in Sonoma County, was already planning to build a dormitory to house 38 seasonal workers that he hopes to bring in from Mexico. He intends to use a visa program for farmworkers that requires employers to provide housing.

In the past, that rule and other red tape have led many farmers to bypass the visa program and hire workers who overwhelmingly are undocumented. But more farms in the wine country could soon be forced to consider providing housing.

Mr. Bevill attended a meeting on Sunday with county supervisors, Hispanic community leaders, business representatives and farmers to discuss rebuilding Sonoma County. One of the biggest risks they identified was the loss of workers.

“The first thing that will start happening is, people who work in vineyards, hotels and restaurants will lose access to affordable housing and start leaving,” Mr. Bevill said. “At some point, workers are going to say they can’t find a place to live, and they’re going to leave.”","As Fires Move On, Wine Country Wonders Whether Immigrants Will, Too",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/us/california-fires-immigrants.html

So it’s not surprising that we humans are unable to make something like time or the marking of time bend to our collective wills. For centuries, different countries used different calendars, and even the old Julian calendar had its problems.

That is why, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII ordered that everyone stop messing around and use one calendar. Even then, the later a country switched over, the more days had to be dropped in order to stay in sync with the vernal equinox and the winter solstice. This resulted in a lot of confusion for a while, including the month of September 1752 in North America, which looked like this and which children across the continent still whisper about as “The Best Start to the School Year Ever.”

Final approval is also expected to be given for an additional 459 housing units in the urban settlement of Ma’ale Adumim, east of Jerusalem, though in that case bids for construction still need to be issued.

Oded Revivi, the chief foreign envoy of the Yesha Council that represents the settlers, complained that the amount of building being approved “does not accommodate even the natural growth” of the settler population.

The Trump administration has been more accommodating than its predecessors when it comes to Israeli settlement activity. But it has also called for restraint as it tries to foster a resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process with regional support and a coalition against Iran’s regional ambitions.

“That’s the tension: a government that wants to satisfy, or not upset, the American administration,” Mr. Revivi said, “and the demands of citizens whose needs are not being kept.”

Based on several meetings he had with Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Revivi believes the Trump administration has not really drawn clear lines about what settlement it could live with.

“They said to the prime minister, ‘We are not going to put any limits on you, but just make sure that what you do doesn’t get us upset,’ Mr. Revivi said. “I think that’s where Prime Minister Netanyahu is: not knowing just how much he can pull the strings without getting the American administration upset.”

Most of the world considers the settlements, built in the territory that Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war — the heartland of any future Palestinian state — to be a violation of international law.

Hagit Ofran, who monitors construction for Peace Now, a leftist Israeli advocacy group that opposes settlement activity, said there had been a sharp acceleration in the promotion of plans compared with the last two years. The rate now, she said, is similar to that in 2014, which was a bumper year. (The relative slump in 2015 and 2016 might have been due to a glut.)

“The strategy is to confuse us,” Ms. Ofran said. And Israel, she said, is now allowing itself to build in places where it has held off for decades.

For example, approval is being given for 31 new apartments in the Jewish settlement in the heart of the contested and volatile city of Hebron, although that project is expected to be held up by a legal challenge by Hebron’s Palestinian-run City Hall.

And for the first time in 20 years, final approval is also being given for a new settlement, Amihai, to accommodate the families who were evacuated from the illegal Israeli outpost of Amona, which was built on private Palestinian land.

A bid for construction is expected to be issued for 300 units in the Beit El settlement that the government has been promising since 2012. And heavy machinery has been spotted in recent days carrying out soil-boring tests at Givat Hamatos, an area over the 1967 lines in southern Jerusalem. According to Peace Now, the infrastructure work is being done in preparation for the issuing of bids for the construction of 1,600 housing units in the area.

Anti-settlement groups say the construction in Givat Hamatos would drive a wedge between predominantly Palestinian East Jerusalem neighborhoods and Bethlehem, harming the contiguity of any future Palestinian state. The past promotion of plans there have prompted international condemnation.

In its official statement last week, the government declared: “During 2017, approximately 12,000 housing units in different stages of planning and construction will be approved, about four times the amount in 2016. Whoever claims that this is not a significant improvement is misleading the public.” But hinting at the need to take Israel’s broader interests into account, the statement also said, “Whoever believes that diplomatic considerations need not be taken into account is greatly mistaken.”

“There is nobody,” the statement concluded, “that does more for settlement, steadfastly and wisely, than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.”

Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, condemned the latest settlement plans. “Clearly, Israel is bent on entrenching the military occupation and its illegal settlement enterprise,” she said, “further reaffirming its intentions of displacing Palestine and replacing it with ‘Greater Israel.’”

Bezalel Smotrich, an Israeli lawmaker from the staunchly pro-settlement Jewish Home party, which sits in Mr. Netanyahu’s governing coalition, wrote a scathing online post accusing the prime minister’s staff of issuing “a sea of lying numbers.”

Mr. Smotrich blamed the Americans for not authorizing plans for industrial zones by the settlements, in part because they take up a lot of space. “Without industrial zones there is no employment, no livelihood and no existence,” he said.

The planning committee meeting this week convenes four times a year. Shaul Arieli, an Israeli expert on political geography who prepared maps for past negotiations with the Palestinians, and who is a strong advocate for the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, said final approval for about 600 units has become relatively “routine.”

But in the past, he said, about 75 percent of new building was inside the so-called settlement blocs, meaning areas mostly close to the 1967 line that Israel intends to keep in any future agreement with the Palestinians, possibly in return for land swaps. Over the last six or seven years, he said, up to half the new building has been deep in the West Bank, outside the blocs.","Israel Moves Ahead on West Bank Settlements, but Guardedly",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/world/middleeast/israel-west-bank-settlements.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Yet for much of the last century, until 1994, photography in the city’s rapid transit system was illegal (though it was a spottily enforced offense). In the late 1930s — soon after the city imposed its ban — Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed unsuspecting commuters.

Mr. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35 mm camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release that snaked down his sleeve.

Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers.

Not surprisingly, Ms. Levitt was soon taking her own subway portraits, first with Mr. Evans’s gear, and then with her own camera, possibly using the same technique. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and was eventually nominated for an Academy Award, she would, three years after Mr. Evans died in 1975, return underground to photograph passengers. A new book called, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades.

It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring art deco posters, elaborate furs, and jauntily-tilted hats, while those from the 1970s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. In some photos, the subjects appear to be looking right at Ms. Levitt, adding further mystery about her technique.

But insults aside, he offered a new analysis of corporate tax incidence – an approach that is novel, innovative, and completely boneheaded. Oh, and it just happens to say what his political masters want to hear.

As I see it, this is part of a broader pattern.

When the financial crisis struck, there were many calls for new economic ideas – even an Institute for New Economic Thinking. The implicit story, pretty much taken for granted as true, was that the crisis proved the inadequacy of economic orthodoxy and the need for fundamental new concepts. Pretty obviously, too, supporters of calls for new thinking had a sort of Hollywood script version of how it would play out: daring innovators would propose radical ideas, would face resistance from old fuddy-duddies, but would eventually win out through their superior ability to predict events.

What actually happened was very different. True, nobody saw the crisis coming. But that wasn’t because orthodoxy had no room for such a thing – on the contrary, panics and bank runs are an old topic, discussed in every principles book. The reason nobody saw this coming was an empirical failure – few realized that the rise of shadow banking had done an end run around Depression-era bank safeguards.

The point was that only the dimmest of free-market ideologues reacted with utter bewilderment. The rest of us slapped our foreheads and said, “Diamond-Dybvig! How stupid of me! Diamond-Dybvig!”

And post-crisis, pretty standard macro worked pretty well. Both fiscal policy and monetary policy did what they were supposed to (or, in the case of money, didn’t do what they weren’t supposed to) at the zero lower bound. Plenty of room for refinement, lots of opportunities to use the mother of all natural experiments for empirical work, but no huge requirement for radical new thinking.

Nonetheless, there was a proliferation of radical new concepts: contractionary fiscal policy is actually expansionary, expansionary monetary policy is actually deflationary, terrible things happen to growth when debt crosses 90 percent of GDP. These ideas instantly got huge amounts of political traction – never mind the fuddy-duddies in the economics establishment, the policy establishment leaped at the chance to apply new ideas.

What did the ideas they leaped at have in common? All of them had, implicitly or explicitly, conservative ideological implications, whether the authors intended that or not. (I’m quite sure that Reinhart-Rogoff weren’t operating out of any political agenda. Not equally sure about others.) And all of them proved, quite quickly, to be dead wrong.

So new economic thinking since the crisis has proved, for the most part, to consist of bad ideas that serve a conservative political agenda. Not exactly the script we were promised, is it?

Once you think about it, it’s not too hard to see how that happened. First of all, conventional macro has worked pretty well, so you’d need really, really brilliant innovations to make a persuasive major break with that conventionality. And really, really brilliant innovations don’t come easy. Instead, the breaks with conventional wisdom came mainly from people who, far from transcending that wisdom, simply failed to understand it in the first place.

And while there are such people on both left and right, there’s a huge asymmetry in wealth and influence between the two sides. Confused views on the left get some followers, provoke a back-and-forth on a few blogs, and generate some nasty tweets. Confused views on the right get mainlined straight into policy pronouncements by the European Commission and the leadership of the Republican Party.

Which brings me back to Hassett. Tax incidence, like macroeconomics, is a technical subject with a mainstream consensus that faces challenges from left and right. But a lot of hard work went into creating that consensus; this doesn’t mean that it’s right, but you have to come up with a really good idea to challenge it effectively.

On the other hand, you can get a lot of political traction with a really bad idea challenging the consensus, as long as it serves the interests of big money and the political right.

Americans have long struggled with the question of whether this country should be more involved in world affairs, or less. The contest of ideas between internationalists and isolationists has been particularly fierce among Republicans, going all the way back to Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft and continuing on to the beginning of World War II.

But since the end of that war, whatever the differences in their priorities and points of emphasis, every president has chosen engagement rather than retreat, sometimes with surprising and positive outcomes. Richard Nixon forged relations with communist China; Ronald Reagan, having consigned the Soviet Union to “the ash heap of history,” went on to negotiate arms control treaties with Mikhail Gorbachev. Even those like Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama who argued in various ways for scaling back America’s commitments overseas insisted on a leadership role, if not the leadership role, in building an international system grounded in democratic and free-market principles.

There have been plenty of mistakes and unforeseen developments that have tested the United States and raised questions about the wisdom of its policies. But, on the whole, the world has benefited greatly from America’s guidance and its willingness to engage with allies at every step of the way. NATO, the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are all part of the architecture of global security and development that American presidents helped create.

President Trump is now taking a sledgehammer to that system. His argument, if that term can apply to such an inchoate position, is that America for too long has been “losing,” a situation he has set out to correct with nonnegotiable demands and gratuitous confrontations. He promises both to achieve more and to retrench. He promises to put “America first” while at the same time condemning it to a secondary role in global deliberations. It is a bizarre and contradictory policy: In seeking to liberate the United States from international obligations, and in waging war on multilateral institutions, he is not only destroying America’s reputation as a trusted ally but also ceding the future to the very same aggressive powers, especially the authoritarian regimes of China and Russia, that he purports to protect Americans from. Meanwhile, his running feuds with the free press, the courts and Congress are diminishing America’s standing as a bastion of constitutional liberties.

So who wins in the never-ending evolutionary battle between predator and prey?

In one recent study in a Southern California desert, rats overwhelmingly defeat snakes, escaping in all of 23 recorded attacks during 40 encounters. The recordings captured 15 different snakes, 21 identified kangaroo rats and 17 unidentified rats. Only once did a snake manage to sink its fangs in a rat deep enough to inject venom, and it wasn’t enough to stop the rat from getting away and recovering.

The rats also seemed to be able to prevent strikes, by so-called “predator deterrent” actions like kicking sand at the snake, drumming its foot, jumping back or going up to investigate the snake. According to some thinking about how prey and predator interact, these actions are ways for a prey animal to show off how quick or strong it is, essentially saying, “Forget about trying to catch me, you don’t have a chance.”

Neither battle is over. But the Islamic State, which three years ago controlled a third of the country, has been reduced to a handful of desert outposts and a small city on the Syrian border, while the Kurds may now have to defer their independence dreams.

The referendum, which had Kurds celebrating in the streets three weeks ago, has now clearly backfired. The Kurdish region depends heavily on oil revenue, roughly half of it from the Kirkuk region, and the independence vote alienated the United States and angered neighbors.

“They may have made a miscalculation of historic proportions by proceeding with the referendum over the objections of just about everyone who counts,” said Joost Hiltermann, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.

The Kirkuk operation also exposed deep divisions within the Kurdish command, as fighters loyal to a Kurdish opposition party, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, agreed to make way for the advancing Iraqi forces even as other fighters loyal to the governing Kurdistan Democratic Party continued to resist.

The Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani spearheaded the referendum, which most Kurds saw as a historic step toward achieving the national dream of an independent homeland. But critics accused Mr. Barzani of staging the vote to deflect attention from the Kurdish region’s troubled economy and what they consider to be Mr. Barzani’s authoritarian rule.

Moreover, and especially irksome to Baghdad, the vote included disputed territory outside the boundaries of the autonomous Kurdish region, including Kirkuk and the surrounding oil fields. Kurdish forces seized that territory in 2014 after Iraqi troops fled an Islamic State assault, but Baghdad has never accepted Kurdish control there.

After the referendum vote, Iraqi authorities gave the Kurds an ultimatum, to annul the vote or face military action. But over the last few days, even as Iraq massed troops in the Kirkuk region, Baghdad insisted it had no plans to carry out a military assault on Kirkuk.

As recently as Friday, the Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, said the military “cannot and will not attack our citizens, whether Arab or Kurd,” and dismissed reports to the contrary as “fake news.”

In the last few days, emissaries from Baghdad conducted secret talks with Kurdish opposition forces to negotiate their withdrawal.

Wista Raool, commander of opposition pesh merga forces south of Kirkuk, said the opposition sought to return the oil fields to the federal government. He accused Mr. Barzani and his party of “stealing” the oil from the Iraqi government.

Still, fighting broke out between advancing government forces and pesh merga fighters from Mr. Barzani’s faction.

A Kurdish commander, Gen. Mohammed Raiger, said his forces had mounted a counterattack about 15 miles west of the city. He said reinforcements with “sophisticated weapons” had arrived to support Kurdish fighters in the area.

A statement by the Kurdish government’s security council said pesh merga fighters had destroyed five American-supplied Humvees used by Iraqi forces, and would continue to resist them.

According to reports from hospitals in Kirkuk Province, 22 pesh merga fighters were killed in fighting on Monday, along with 7 Iraqi soldiers. Eleven Kurdish fighters were wounded, as well as four Iraqi soldiers and 54 civilians.

In a statement Monday afternoon, the American-led coalition played down any skirmishes as accidental. The clashes were precipitated by “a misunderstanding,” the statement said, and were “not deliberate as two elements tried to link up under limited visibility conditions” at night.

Col. Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the coalition in Baghdad, said American forces in the area were watching the situation, but were not involved in the fighting.

“We are monitoring the situation closely and strongly urge all sides to avoid additional escalatory actions,” he said. “We opposed violence from any party, and urge against destabilizing actions that distract from the fight against ISIS and further undermine Iraq’s stability.”

While Washington has called for calm, analysts said the United States was content to sit this one out, still fuming that Mr. Barzani had turned down an American offer to preside over open-ended negotiations with Baghdad if the Kurds called off the vote. Analysts said the United States sat back quietly as Mr. Barzani’s position eroded in the face of retaliation by Baghdad, which first ended international flights to the Kurdish region and then cut a deal with his rivals to take Kirkuk.

By Monday night, the Barzani government had made no public statement on the day’s events.

Officials in Baghdad said the provincial governor, Najmaldin O. Karim, had left Kirkuk for Erbil, the capital of the autonomous region. Mr. Karim could not be reached for comment. He was dismissed by Baghdad earlier this year, but remained in office because Kurdish fighters controlled the city.

Military commanders in Baghdad said their troops had taken control of an industrial district on the western edge of Kirkuk, a power plant and refinery adjacent to the oil fields outside the city and a military airport west of the city.

Iraqi troops also removed a Kurdish flag from a large statue of a pesh merga fighter that Kurdish leaders had erected at the gates to the city. They raised an Iraqi flag in its place, according to local officials, in line with an order from Mr. Abadi for troops to raise the Iraqi flag in all disputed areas reclaimed by government forces.

The big question now is whether forces loyal to Mr. Barzani will fight on or back off.

On Monday, his forces remained dug into positions near oil fields northwest of the city that the Kurds have controlled since 2014.

The commander there, Kamal Karkokly, said in an interview at his command post on Sunday that his fighters would not surrender their positions.

“We have enough weapons,” he said. “We can fight as long as we have to.”

Forced to abandon his radical policy, he came to rely on the German chancellor for support and understanding. But his brinkmanship undermined earlier efforts and pushed Greece back into recession.

Now it is German politicians who threaten to derail the relationship that held the eurozone together. Even before the Sept. 24 election, the surge in support for the extreme-right-wing Alternative for Germany party had skewed the country’s politics, with members of other parties echoing some of its demands, including opposition to the eurozone and to support for Greece.

In trying to forge a governing coalition, Ms. Merkel will have to reconcile contradictory policies among potential partners and placate critics within her own party. The Free Democrats, who are likely partners, advocate a hard line on Greece. Recently, the party leader, Christian Lindner, accused the soon-to-be-former finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, who had repeatedly proposed that Greece leave the eurozone (at least temporarily), of being too soft. Mr. Lindner is in a position to demand commitments that there be no debt relief for Greece and that Germany maintain a strict fiscal policy with regard to Europe.

This is a difficult time for liberal democracy. The threat to the European Union and its principles demands a stronger union, as the new French president, Emmanuel Macron, has stressed. The European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, refers to the need for social values that go beyond the concerns of the single market and the eurozone.

Over the past few years, Ms. Merkel has agreed to move toward closer union. This was not so clear at the start of the crisis. In 2010, there was no centralized fund to rescue Greece. The system that was adopted, mainly at Germany’s insistence, involved eurozone countries making bilateral loans to Greece; its terms were punitive, and it also made taxpayers in donor countries keenly aware that their money was going toward bailing out the Greeks rather than protecting the common currency.

This caused lasting suspicion of Greece in many countries. It kept the focus on national interests rather than encouraging confidence in the European whole. The immigration crisis magnified this, with several countries breaking ranks with the European Union’s policy, erecting walls and refusing to accept their quota of refugees, choosing their own perceived interests over the bloc’s principles.

The eurozone now has the institutions and procedures to cope with economic emergencies. It dealt with crises in Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus without provoking turmoil similar to that in Greece or inciting anger in donor countries. The European Central Bank — despite German protestations — plays a more active role defending the euro and member states than it did in 2010. As long as Greece remains in bailout limbo, however, it is shut out of the E.C.B.’s bond-buying program, which would give Greek banks greater liquidity and improve confidence in the economy.

It is no surprise that populists have made gains in Germany. But they still account for a small percentage of voters and should not be allowed a disproportionate say in national policy. There is too much at stake. In Greece, we saw what happens when politicians with slogans rather than serious proposals dominate the scene. In Greece, though, it is the Greeks who pay for their mistakes. The world cannot afford for Germans to make the same mistake.

I taught my first class at Columbia University’s M.F.A. program this month, and even though I’ve been teaching college writing since 1993, I initially felt a little intimidated by the school’s regal campus. That, and regretful.

I enjoyed going to college at the University of Michigan, an hour from home, but my secret humiliation is: I was the type of mediocre student I now disdain. As a freshman, I cared about my friends, my boyfriend and my poetry. Or, I cared about what my boyfriend thought of my friends, what my friends thought of him, and what they thought of my poetry about him. Here’s what I wish I’d known and done differently:

A’S ARE COOL AND COME WITH PERKS As a student, I saw myself as anti-establishment, and I hated tests; I barely maintained a B average. I thought only nerds spent weekends in the library studying. Recently I learned that my niece Dara, a sophomore at New York University with a 3.7 G.P.A. (and a boyfriend), was offered a week of travel in Buenos Aires as part of her honors seminar. I was retroactively envious to learn that a 3.5 G.P.A. or higher at many schools qualifies you for free trips, scholarships, grants, awards, private parties and top internships. At 20, I was too busy freaking out when said boyfriend disappeared (after sleeping with one of said friends). Students certainly don’t need to strive obsessively for perfection, but I should have prioritized grades, not guys.

SHOW UP AND SPEAK UP If a class was boring or it snowed, I’d skip. My rationale was that nobody in the 300-person lecture hall would notice and I could get notes later. Attendance barely counted. When I went, I’d sit quietly in back. Yet as a teacher, I see that the students who come weekly, sit in front, and ask and answer questions get higher grades and frankly, preferential treatment. After 15 weeks, I barely know the absentees or anyone Snapchatting the term away on their iPhones. It’s not just that these students flush $300 down the toilet every time they miss my class; participating can actually lead to payoffs. I reward those who try harder with recommendations, references, professional contacts and encouragement.

CLASS CONNECTIONS CAN LAUNCH YOUR CAREER As an undergrad, I rarely visited my professors during office hours. I didn’t want to annoy teachers with what I considered triviality. Besides, I thought I knew everything already. In graduate school, on the other hand, I went to the readings of a professor I admired. Eventually, I’d go to his office just to vent. Once, after I complained about a dead-end job, he recommended me for a position at The New Yorker, jump-starting my career.

“The picture down the stretch is not pretty,” Professor Wadi warned. “As yesterday’s rain enlivens a dry brook, tomorrow’s rain will facilitate even more its turning into a gushing, dangerous river.”",Philippine City Is Declared ‘Liberated’ From Terrorists After Months of Fighting,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/world/asia/philippines-marawi-fighting.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mr. Wiley, who was born in Los Angeles in 1977, is adept at heroicizing his subjects — some of whom he found through open calls or simply by approaching people on the street. He endows them with the poses and gestures of kings and nobles borrowed from portraits by Velázquez, Holbein, Manet and Titian and also sets them against bold, sometimes jarring patterns of rich brocades, Dutch wax fabrics or Liberty’s wallpaper. One of his most reproduced works is an equestrian portrait of Michael Jackson that recycles Velazquez’s portrait of King Philip II mounted on a white charger while a battle rages in the distance.

Mr. Wiley’s flamboyant portraits of men, in particular, give them a worldly power and often a gravitas that they don’t necessarily possess in real life. That is part of his work’s irreverent, perspective-altering force. It will be fascinating to see if Mr. Wiley rises to the occasion of painting a world leader like former President Obama, who already has a big place in history and plenty of dignity.

If flamboyance is not the best way to go, Mr. Wiley certainly has alternatives, as exemplified by his more restrained half-portraits based on the work of the Northern Renaissance painter Hans Memling, including “After Memling’s Portrait of a Man With a Coin of the Emperor Nero,” now in the collection of the Phoenix Art Museum. Mr. Wiley has at times delegated painting to assistants in the manner of a Renaissance master. It seems safe to assume that this is one commission he will tackle himself.

Ms. Sherald is far less known. Born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973, she now lives in Baltimore, where she earned an M.F.A. from the Maryland Institute College of Art. She decided at an early age to become a painter. In a profile in The Washington Post last year, she cited as the beginning of that journey catching sight, on a sixth-grade museum trip, of “Object Permanence,” a family portrait by the painter Bo Bartlett (also Georgia-born, but now Maine-based) in which the artist, who is white, painted himself as a black man. Her career has been interrupted by three years spent nursing ailing family members and another year to recover from her own heart transplant, in her early 30s.

In 2016 Ms. Sherald became the first woman to win the National Portrait Gallery’s Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. Curators added Ms. Sherald to the list for the Obamas “at the very last minute,” Ms. Sajet said.

Like Mr. Wiley, Ms. Sherald paints portraits of African-Americans by working both from photographs and live models, and feeding off painting’s traditions, if in a more straightforward way.

Her figures appear before solid fields of color reminiscent of Manet and also Barkley L. Hendricks (1945-2017), who silhouetted his tall, thin, stylishly dressed African-Americans against bright backgrounds.

Ms. Sherald’s subjects, on the other hand, are mostly young and come in all shapes and sizes. Her images play black and white against color in different ways, most obviously in the skin tones, which are painted on the gray scale. This recalls old photographs but mainly gives the figures a slight remove from the rest of the painting, one that also signals their awareness of the obstacles to their full participation in American life. This simple device introduces the notion of double consciousness, the phrase coined by W.E.B. DuBois to describe the condition of anyone living with social and economic inequality.

Double consciousness may be inevitable in portraits of people outside the power structure. It is certainly present in Mr. Wiley’s portraits and it is a likely bet that it will figure in official portraits of groundbreaking leaders like the Obamas.

A precedent for such portrayals can be found in the proud sardonic oil portrait of Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to the United States Congress, from New York’s 12th Congressional District. It is by the African-American artist and illustrator Kadir Nelson and is in the collection of the House of Representatives.

Reforming the Child Tax Credit Could Amplify Its ImpactThere are other ways to make the child tax credit more generous to these families.
There have been several plans over the years to do exactly that with the child tax credit, from both Republicans and Democrats.","The tax reform framework released three weeks ago by the White House and Republican congressional leadership has lofty goals: Simplify the tax code; provide relief for middle-class families; cut taxes for businesses; end many narrowly focused special tax benefits; and keep the reformed tax code “at least as progressive” as the existing one.

Many of the policies proposed in the framework remain ambiguous. Yet it is those policies, in particular the details of the child tax credit expansion, that will determine whether most American families win or lose.

As of Now, G.O.P.’s More Specific Tax Policies Tend to Benefit the Rich

Here’s an estimate of how each policy in the G.O.P. framework could affect families at different income levels on average in 2026, using assumptions similar to those in a recent analysis by the Tax Policy Center. Under these assumptions, the plan as it now stands has a modest benefit on average over all, and a substantial benefit to the top 1 percent.

By everyone’s admission, the plan is a work in progress and could change (possibly including new ideas). But it is specific about the levels of the new standard deduction; the repeal of personal exemptions and the alternative minimum tax; the cut to the corporate income tax rate; and several other policies.

So despite the uncertainty, some families can be more confident of getting tax relief than others. We divided the framework’s policies into two buckets: those policies that are relatively more clear and those that are more ambiguous.

Higher-clarity policies Lower-clarity policies Repeal individual A.M.T. Individual income tax rates of 12, 25, and 35 percent Increase standard deduction Increase child tax credit Dependent credit of $500 Repeal “numerous other exemptions, deductions, and credits” Repeal personal exemptions Partial limit on business deduction for net interest Repeal non-charity/mortgage itemized deductions One-time deemed repatriation Index to chained Consumer Price Index Repeal of non-section 199 business tax provisions Cap passthrough rate at 25 percent Cut corporate rate to 20 percent & repeal corporate A.M.T. Fully expense equipment through 2022 Enact territorial system Repeal section 199 Repeal estate and generation-skipping transfer taxes

Splitting the score in this way shows that the benefits to the top 1 percent are largely explained by the policies on which the framework is most specific. That means increasing the benefit to everyone else requires focusing on the policies that are currently ambiguous.

Three Policies Are a Key to How the Tax Plan May Change

Critics of the Tax Policy Center analysis — like Kevin Hassett, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers — rightly say that since Congress is still working out the details of tax reform, we should view any evaluation of the framework as preliminary and tentative. (We should likewise be skeptical of any assertions of the plan’s economic benefits at this point.)

Three of the more ambiguous policies have the most potential to change the distribution of benefits: a possible fourth bracket on high-income filers; adjusting the thresholds for the new income tax brackets; and expanding the child tax credit.

A Fourth Bracket Would Raise Revenue, but Wouldn’t Distribute Benefits

The framework sets individual income tax brackets at 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, but leaves open the possibility of a fourth rate higher than 35 percent. This wouldn’t directly benefit middle-class families by itself. But it would taper the benefit to the top 1 percent and could be used to lower the deficit impact of tax reform legislation over all.

Consider as an example a 45 percent top rate on income above $1 million ($1.4 million if married). This rate is 10 percentage points higher than the top marginal rate proposed in the framework, and 5.4 percentage points higher than the current top marginal rate. This idea would lower the benefit to the top 1 percent by about a fifth, and raise about $500 billion over 10 years. It’s a meaningful impact, but it’s not enough on its own to meet the framework’s distributional goals, even before accounting for how the rich might reclassify income in the wake of such a higher rate.

Expanding the Lowest Bracket Would Reach Some but Not All Working Families

Alternatively, the new individual income tax brackets could be adjusted so that more income is subject to the lowest 12 percent rate instead of the 25 percent rate. But in fact, under the Tax Policy Center’s assumption that the current 10 percent and 15 percent brackets are converted to the 12 percent bracket, much of the middle class already gets all the benefit it can from the new 12 percent bracket. If, for example, we expand the 12 percent bracket to also include income currently subject to the 25 percent rate, virtually all of the added benefit flows to families above the 70th percentile (about $87,000 for a family of two in 2017).

So while expanding the 12 percent bracket could provide relief for families in the top quarter, including some who think of themselves as middle class, it isn’t an effective way of reaching working families in the bottom three quarters.

Tripling the Current Child Tax Credit Would Have a Modest Effect

Of the policies explicitly mentioned in the G.O.P. framework, expanding the child tax credit holds the most potential for reaching lower-income families. But simply expanding the current credit delivers only modest benefits. That’s because the regular child tax credit is nonrefundable, which means that it’s valuable only to families with federal income tax liability (the additional child tax credit does allow some families with three or more children to claim part of the regular child tax credit as a refund, but the benefit is capped and often uneven).

This is why large increases to the current child tax credit do not significantly change the balance of benefits under the framework. The Tax Policy Center assumes that the regular credit is expanded by $500 to a maximum of $1,500 per child. But an even more generous expansion of the regular credit — say, tripling it to $3,000 per child — would help lower- and middle-income filers only somewhat more than under the Tax Policy Center’s assumptions.

Reforming the Child Tax Credit Could Amplify Its Impact

There are other ways to make the child tax credit more generous to these families. If the credit were fully refundable, or applicable against both income and payroll taxes — which virtually every working person pays regardless of income — more families would benefit.

There have been several plans over the years to do exactly that with the child tax credit, from both Republicans and Democrats. Below we model an idea based on a 2015 proposal from Senators Marco Rubio and Mike Lee, though it may not reflect their latest thinking. The Rubio-Lee proposal called for an additional $2,500 per child tax credit that would not be refundable but could be used to offset both income and payroll tax liability. If Congress adopted this approach in tax reform legislation, the benefit to lower- and middle-income families would be drastically larger than from other policies in the framework.

This approach has trade-offs, of course; most notably, it would raise the deficit by $1.4 trillion over 10 years, on top of the already $2.5 trillion cost of the framework under the Tax Policy Center’s assumptions. So simply tacking a Rubio-Lee-style approach onto the existing framework might prove to be a deal breaker for too many in Congress without other changes.

Making More Aggressive Assumptions About What Corporate Tax Cuts Do to Wages Doesn’t Change Much

The Tax Policy Center, as well as nonpartisan analysts at the Congressional Budget Office and the Treasury department, assume that the vast majority (around 80 percent) of the benefits of corporate tax cuts are in the form of higher capital income, such as dividends and returns on investment. They see the benefit to wages and salaries as being modest by contrast. The White House argues that wages will grow much more than these agencies assume. But even if capital income only saw, say, 50 percent of the benefit of cutting corporate taxes, the distribution wouldn’t look radically different, as the graph above shows. Since both capital and labor income skew toward the top 1 percent, changing these assumptions can affect the estimate of the absolute benefit for any given family but can only go so far in shifting their share of the benefits in a distributional analysis.

In the end, if Congress wants to prioritize tax relief for lower-income and middle-income Americans, the framework gives it some options, not only in how it fills in the details on the more ambiguous policies, but also in whether it chooses to scale back any of the less ambiguous ones.","For the Non-Rich, the Child Tax Credit Is the Key to Tax Reform",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/17/upshot/tax-reform-winners-losers-child-tax-credit.html

A visit to the renewed Music Hall suggested that it could be a road map of sorts for officials in New York.

Shrinking Down

In modern concert halls, as in modern baseball stadiums, smaller is generally considered better. Orchestra officials here said that while there had been more sellouts in recent seasons, especially of Cincinnati Pops concerts, they were the exception, not the rule. Just as ball teams no longer build stadiums for World Series crowds, most orchestras no longer build halls that only visiting superstars can hope to pack.

Audiences raised on high fidelity and high definition demand more intimate experiences.

“I think our ears are different,” the new president of the New York Philharmonic, Deborah Borda, said of the trend toward smaller halls in recent decades. “We are now used to having a sound system and cranking up the sound, or putting buds in our ears.”

Before its renovation, Cincinnati Music Hall was, in the pejorative words of some musicians, a bit of a barn. The multiuse hall, which was the site of the 1880 Democratic National Convention, held 3,417 seats — many tucked under balconies. Now the side and rear walls on its lower levels have been moved in. When the orchestra plays on a stage that now extends past the proscenium and into the auditorium, the hall holds just 2,282. (It can seat up to 2,524 when other resident companies, including the Cincinnati Opera, the Cincinnati Ballet and the Cincinnati May Festival, perform.)

“It gives you a little more latitude to program things that you know are going to be challenging to some, but which are part of your mission,” said Jonathan Martin, the orchestra’s new president, who noted that popular pieces like “Carmina Burana” would always outsell Bruckner symphonies. “But we should be doing Bruckner, because that’s part of our mission.”

Photo

When the New York Philharmonic first planned to leave Carnegie Hall for Lincoln Center in the 1950s, it envisioned a hall with 2,400 seats. But it built one with more than 2,700 amid a post-World War II classical boom. Now, Ms. Borda said, there is a “real possibility” that a redone Geffen Hall will lose seats “to enhance the acoustical experience and to make it a better emotional experience at concerts.”

Creature Comforts

With fewer seats, Music Hall can now fit more comfortable ones — a bit wider, with added legroom. And in a nod to the desires of modern audiences, cup holders allow concertgoers to bring drinks into the auditorium with them, as Broadway audiences often do these days. (At one point on reopening night, the clinking of ice cubes could be heard during a quiet passage of Scriabin’s “Poem of Ecstasy.”)

The restrooms were upgraded, increasing capacity by about 60 percent. The hall also added more concession stands.

Surviving Exile

One of the reasons New York scaled back its plans for a radical transformation of Geffen Hall was the growing fear that building the most recent, complicated design threatened to leave the philharmonic homeless for more than two seasons. That was considered a real risk to the orchestra, which can ill afford to hasten the loss of its subscriber base.

Here in Cincinnati, the orchestra carefully planned for its single season away from home, taking over a theater in downtown Cincinnati and spending $3 million to bring it up to snuff. It scheduled more visiting stars than usual and offered free parking to subscribers to try to keep them in the fold. During its season in exile, an orchestra official said, its subscriptions only dipped by 4.6 percent.

Photo

Another fear in New York was the rising price tag — and questions about how much money the city could be expected to provide. Cincinnati scaled back some of its earlier ambitions, too, in order to bring costs down, but in the end accomplished its wish list with $143 million. Grants from the city of Cincinnati and the state of Ohio, along with state and federal tax credits, provided roughly half the budget.

Easy on the Ears

A big difference between the renovation here and the one in New York is that Music Hall has long been celebrated for its acoustics, while Geffen Hall has been considered acoustically troubled.

For its reopening, Cincinnati’s hall got an acoustical workout, from the ebullience of John Adams’s “Short Ride in a Fast Machine” to the Classicism of Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 1 to the blaze of Scriabin. In Jonathan Bailey Holland’s atmospheric new piece “Stories of Home,” whispered murmurs of the woodwind and brass players, speaking in English and German, came through clearly. Janelle Gelfand, a veteran Cincinnati critic, judged the new acoustics “a work in progress” in a review in Classical Voice North America, praising some aspects but criticizing others.

In an interview backstage, Mr. Langrée praised the new hall as “very honest,” and called its stage a vast improvement that allowed the musicians to hear one another better. “The sound was less clear before,” he added. “It was mostly working on balance, dynamics. Now it’s about colors.”

Mr. Langrée, of course, is also the music director of the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra, which plays each summer in Geffen Hall. When he was asked if the Cincinnati renovation might show the way forward for his New York base, he laughed.

“Oh, yes, I think so,” he said, before stopping himself. “But I cannot give any advice.”","As Geffen Hall’s Renovation Stumbles, Cincinnati Shows the Way",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/arts/music/geffen-hall-cincinnati-lincoln-center.html

PhotoIn an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well.","From grizzled cotton farmers to quiet small-town buildings and roadside stands, Walker Evans built his reputation on chronicling America’s out-of-the-way places and people. And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common. Born Walker Evans III, the scion of a prominent family, he grew up in privilege, attending Phillips Academy and then Williams College, dropping out after one year.

A turning point for Evans was his decision — like many young men of means — to go to Paris in 1926 to study for a year at the Sorbonne. His stay filled his head with ideas gleaned from Flaubert and Baudelaire, but it was another Frenchman — Eugène Atget — whose work affected him the most, leading to the dry, observational style that became his visual signature.

Clément Chéroux, a French curator, organized a massive Walker Evans retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which recently traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, (where he is now the head of the photography department). He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

“Atget has tried to define, through his photographs — what is the Parisian vernacular? What is the visual spirit of Paris? And Evans has done exactly the same with America,” Mr. Chéroux said. “What is so interesting for me, in this exchange between American and French culture, is that he has tried to define the American vernacular culture, but with the method and style of French culture.”

Evans embodied a paradox: a member of the American elite drawn to unfussy places, urban workers and desperate farmers, becoming best known for his seminal project with James Agee, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” about America’s poor and downtrodden during the Great Depression.

For Mr. Chéroux, this paradox was an interesting way to understand Evans. The curator has done scholarly research into the vernacular, which he defines as “useful, domestic and popular” in an essay in the exhibition catalog. “Maybe one of the reasons why I’m fascinated with Evans is because there is so much paradox in his work,” he said. “There is this dialectical tension between Europe and the U.S., and there is also this very strong dialectical tension between an aristocratic or elite point of view, and a subject which is definitely popular culture, and workers.”

The specific nature of the Atget-Evans vision, with its emphasis on large format, razor sharp, perfectly observed, almost preternaturally quiet moments, allows the photographs to impress viewers nearly a century later. Evans had a simple explanation: Atget’s photographs had a transcendent quality, which he tried to emulate.

Photo

In an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well. In his work you do feel what some people call poetry. I do call it that also, but a better word for it, to me, is, well – when Atget does even a tree root, he transcends that thing. And by God somebody else does not.”

By looking at things previously unobserved, or subjects once thought beneath the purview of art, Evans created a vision of America that is still inextricable from our national identity. And while his initial exposure to Atget’s work might have been coincidental — his friend Berenice Abbott showed him a trove of the Frenchman’s work — his subsequent choice of subject matter was not.

In another essay in the exhibition catalog, Evans said his early work was influenced by his feelings about the United States. “I was really anti-American at the time,” he said. “America was a big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment. I could just hear my father saying, ‘Why do you want to look at those scenes, they’re depressing. Why don’t you look at the nice things in life?’ Nothing original about that though.”

This might be the key to understanding his role in the history of photography, as he heavily influenced subsequent generations, including the famed “New Topographics” movement of the 1970s. (When asked via email whether Evans’s work had inspired him and his colleagues, Stephen Shore simply replied, “Yes.”)

According to Mr. Chéroux, Evans was able to adopt a neutral stance and let the magic, or inherent tension, of a scene speak for itself. He notably contrasted this style against the showy, artsy technique employed by contemporaries like Alfred Stieglitz and the Modernists.

“He wants to disappear in front of his subject, to let this emotion transfer from the subject to the viewer,” he said of Evans. “I think this is really what he understood. It’s the reason why he is so close to Atget. All the photographers who think that the subject is more important than themselves are in this position.”

The retrospective, while focusing on the past, and including selections from Evans’s personal collection of vernacular art, also allows viewers to appreciate how photography, a slice out of time, relates to the present. In particular, his 1937 photographs showing people displaced by floods in the South are just as relevant today.

“That’s the power of art,” Mr. Chéroux said, “to address some historical questions, but to address them in the present time. To create a kind of effect that is both present and past, and I think this is something photography is really great at.”

The Yankees, who had the best home record in the American League during the regular season, continued to look like a different team at a re-energized Yankee Stadium, where they have won all four games in the postseason. The Astros, who played two airtight games in Houston over the weekend, seemed to feel as uncomfortable in the Bronx as the Minnesota Twins did in the wild-card game and the Cleveland Indians did in the division-series round.

“Our players are used to this field,” said Manager Joe Girardi, who will send Sonny Gray to pitch against the Astros’ starter, Lance McCullers Jr., in Game 4 on Tuesday at 5:08 p.m. “They know how to hit here and our fans — our fans are great. I’m watching them in the first inning in left field and they’re banging on the wall. And I love it.”

The Yankees also loved that they were getting a break from Dallas Keuchel and Justin Verlander — the Astros’ two former Cy Young Award winners who dominated them over the weekend. Still, they did not exactly strafe the Astros’ starter on Monday, the right-hander Charlie Morton.

Three of their six hits off Morton did not leave the infield, and two others barely did: a bloop single by Aaron Hicks in the second and a bloop double by Greg Bird in the fourth. But they hurt just the same.

With two outs in the second, Starlin Castro reached on dribbler to third and Hicks followed with a flare into left field. That brought up Frazier, who lunged at a 95-mile-per-hour fastball that was low and off the plate, and lifted it toward right field.

The swing was so awkward that right fielder Josh Reddick broke in on the ball before realizing how hard it had been hit. Reddick retreated and gave chase, but the ball landed in the bleachers for a three-run shot.

As it did, Frazier, who grew up in Toms River, N.J., let out a yell from the basepath and pointed to some friends and relatives who were marooned in right field instead of the family section in the second deck behind the Yankees’ dugout. (“I got yelled at today,” he said.)

Frazier then pointed down to his wrist. “I’m pointing to them and saying, ‘What time is it?’ ” Frazier said. “It’s my time.”

But the lead did not look any sturdier than Frazier’s swing did as the Astros loaded the bases with two outs in the third after Sabathia walked George Springer and Jose Altuve around a single by Alex Bregman. That brought up Carlos Correa, who had homered and doubled to account for both Astros runs on Saturday.

But Sabathia’s 0-1 cutter got in on Correa’s hands, and he popped out to end the threat.

“He likes to get his hands extended,” said Sabathia, who had the first scoreless outing of his playoff career. “I was trying to get something in on him and made a good enough pitch where he popped up to short.”

In the fourth, it was Judge’s turn to thwart the Astros.

Judge, who had stolen a two-run home run from Francisco Lindor in a 1-0 win over the Indians in Game 3 of their division series, brought the crowd to its feet again — by leaving his feet again.

This time he crashed into the wall to catch a drive by Yulieski Gurriel to begin the fourth inning. Judge slammed into the wall with his left shoulder, which he had been treating with ice for after games for much of the second half of the season. After the catch, he tumbled to the warning track, the crowd roared and Sabathia threw both arms into the air.

“There’s not much give in any wall,” Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner said. “It may help if you hit it somewhere where there’s not any stands behind them, but that pad is only a couple of inches thick, and right behind that is not moving, even as big as he is. Even though it’s padded, it’s a pretty good hit he took.”

In the fifth, Judge came to Sabathia’s aid again, racing in to make a diving catch of Cameron Maybin’s liner, again lifting the crowd off its seats.

It was those types of contributions that had left Girardi heartened even though Judge, even after the home run, was 3 for 30 with 21 strikeouts since the start of the division series. While he acknowledged Judge might be pressing, Girardi also praised his attitude, his work ethic and his defense.

Judge said he remained committed to the approach he used during the regular season, when he led the A.L. with 52 home runs, a major-league rookie record.

“A big change I wanted to make this year was just prepare the right way, prepare the same way and see how it works,” Judge said. “It works during the regular season, and why would I come in the postseason and try to change something even though I’m struggling for three or four games, five, six games?”

When the Yankees took command in the fourth, their rally again had modest roots against Morton. Bird led off with a bloop double that Maybin, the left fielder, shied away from catching. After Morton retired Castro and Hicks — Bird advancing to third on the latter’s fly ball to right — Frazier drew a walk.

Chase Headley then hit a grounder up the middle that Altuve snagged with a dive, but he had no play as Bird crossed the plate. It was the first hit of the playoffs for Headley and the first by a Yankees designated hitter. After Gardner was hit by a pitch to load the bases, Manager A. J. Hinch called on the right-hander Will Harris to relieve Morton.

Harris threw Judge a 2-2 fastball up and in, but Judge turned on it and lashed a line drive that carried over the head of Maybin and landed in the first row of the left-field bleachers. Suddenly, the Yankees’ lead was 8-0.

If that ended any suspense, there were still a few moments of agitation in the ninth. Dellin Betances walked two batters, Tommy Kahnle allowed a walk and a single, and closer Aroldis Chapman was getting loose in the bullpen before Altuve grounded into a double play to end the game.

“We just couldn’t get back in the game,” Hinch said after the Yankees, with a lift from their big right fielder, managed to get back in the series.","With His Bat and His Glove, Aaron Judge Lifts Yankees Past Astros",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/sports/baseball/yankees-astros-game-3-alcs.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Q. When the recent hurricanes hit, how did animals seek refuge?

A. For most wildlife, there is no early warning system when a big storm approaches. Most animals have no choice but to shelter in their usual environments.

Some birds, however, respond to weather signals like changes in barometric pressure and fly ahead of the storm. A few get caught in high winds and sent many miles away. A displaced roseate spoonbill, presumably from Florida, recently was observed in New Jersey.

The American Bird Conservancy reported that after hurricanes Irma and Maria reached the Caribbean, many flamingos left the islands of Inagua in the Bahamas ahead of the storm, returning in force afterward. But flamingos on the Cuban island of Cayo Coco died in the thousands.

When Hurricane Harvey reached the coast of Texas, the National Wildlife Federation observed that many animal and bird species had adapted to periodic hurricanes. Still, the severity of this fall’s weather prompted the release of toxic chemicals from various sites that could compound the usual problems, the group said.

One area of special concern is the rich oyster beds of Galveston Bay. The storm was expected to change the normally saline environment to freshwater for weeks, perhaps longer than the oysters could tolerate.

In Florida, the endangered Key deer is a good swimmer, and some have been spotted since the storm surges of Hurricane Irma.

I thought about his words often as I drove for five days, sometimes for as long as eight hours at a stretch, both in terms of the architecture I saw as well as in trying to convince myself that his overarching plan described how I was feeling. In fact, my state of mind about the trip could be described as shaky at best. A friend in Oslo warned me that bad weather often cropped up unexpectedly in October, especially in the north: torrential rain storms or early snow storms that leave cars stranded on a mountain pass or by a lonely fjord.

I was slowly becoming a more daring driver but I was not used to being without a passenger in a country where I didn’t speak a word of the language. On top of that, I already felt emotionally quite alone from my marital breakup, a melancholy sensation that only intensified during intervals when an hour passed without seeing another car, even on major highways.

After a couple of days though, the peace and diversity of the countryside became meditational, a panorama that seemed dreamlike through my windscreen. Traditional country cottages built into mounds of earth with grass-topped roofs and green weathered doors looked as if they were out of “The Hobbit.” Dark thick forest alternated with bucolic sun-dappled farmland and bare, desolate mountains overlooking quaint lakeside towns. One late afternoon as I drove into a village, the sun appeared to drop like a fireball into the fjord. Spectacular modern installations appeared on remote corners in the most far-fetched of places, that they sometimes seemed like a figment of my imagination.

I have never seen a place so multifaceted in its geography and so unpopulated, except perhaps on the other side of the earth, in Patagonia.

Above Trollstigen, another project conceived along these routes is the Juvet Landscape Hotel, designed by the architects Jensen & Skodvin, and the creepy, if incredibly appropriate aesthetically, setting for the 2015 film “Ex Machina.”

From the exterior, the compound, in a nature reserve called Reinheimen, looks almost like a hippie campsite with its low-slung, wood-encased cabins on stilts. But as I was shown into my room, the rustic vision was completely turned on its head — the natural wood or in some instances stone that covers the rear of the structures hides glass walls and raw cement cubes facing front — with views onto the gentle valley, and onto the surrounding peaks and meandering river that cut through the landscape behind.

The perspective created the effect that I was both inside and outside the hotel, part of the natural surroundings, both the voyeur and the inhabitant.

After a dip in the outdoor hot tub, I joined other travelers and guests around a candlelit communal dining room, an intimate warm environment where locally hunted venison was served alongside foraged mountain vegetables that were like strange fairy-tale versions of carrots and beets with curly tendrils and odd shapes. A roaring fire and candles were our only light.

Around the dinner table, we traded stories about what brought us up the mountain and where we came from. The Chinese-American college student recounted his adventures while taking a gap year. The Norwegian honeymooners were in need of a wilderness break from Oslo, the capital. The glossy magazine reading hikers from Britainwanted a sleek hotel after rugged trails. I shared my journey in broad strokes, the American expatriate in Tuscany, my road trip, my love of nature, and I left out the impending change in my marriage and my sense of loss.

When I look back now, my Norwegian road trip seems like one of the most surreal and meaningful of any I have ever taken, even after many years of absorbing trips. The memory turns in my head like a film trailer, so cinematic and surprising that I still almost can’t believe it was real. The pristine beauty, the sense of drama. Perhaps it was the network of beautiful art and architecture that made me feel, daring and courageous by journey’s end. And for that, I am grateful.

Close to half: The portion of hospitals without electricity.

48: The official death toll, although health experts believe — and media reports suggest — the real number to be higher.

(Sources: CNN, NBC, Stat, The Washington Post.)

Where, oh where, is the urgency from Washington about this crisis?

The “message out of Washington amounts to a doctrine of personal responsibility and culpability applied only to Puerto Rico and its people,” writes The Atlantic’s Vann Newkirk II, “not the other areas of the United States affected by recent storms.”

A response on taxes. My column last week urged two top Trump administration officials — Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin — to stop telling lies about their tax plan. Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, replies in a letter to the editor that the column was unfair because “the details of the tax bill have not yet been released.”

The trouble with this argument is that virtually no independent expert believes that any bill can be consistent with both the administration’s initial framework and its pledge that the bill won’t mostly benefit the wealthy. Ross, in his letter, repeats that pledge: “tax reform will result in a system at least as progressive as current law.”

I’m happy to revisit this issue when the full bill is released and admit it if I was wrong.

Like players in “The Front Page,” hordes of cigar-chomping, fedora-wearing men plied their trade as a contact sport that was not above recreating scenes or putting a prop or two — like a lonesome looking doll — into everyday moments of tragedy.

In this cast of characters, Weegee was the Dante of New York’s nighttime demimonde. His photos, of swells and speakeasies, crime and crowds, or perps and play, are a singular record of New York City in the 1930s and ’40s. And just when you thought you had seen all of his work, a new book, “Extra! Weegee,” features vintage prints — many previously unseen — that captures Weegee’s singular point of view.

Photo

Daniel Blau, the book’s editor, admitted that he had “never really liked Weegee.” Obviously, he has since come to his senses, putting together an impressive volume that captures the many sides of New York as it approached World War II. The images were found in the archives of the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a syndicate founded at the turn of the last century by Edward Willis Scripps. The photos — which had been taken for the association’s Acme Newspictures service — passed through the hands of several owners, and were discovered in storage in 2012 by Ryan Adams.

These prints, Mr. Blau wrote in the book, changed his mind, as he saw pictures vastly different from those he had encountered 30 years earlier in some badly reproduced volume. And in a nod to the current daily torrent of images, these photos had an air of mystery, he said, and the mark of a master.

Weegee, born Ascher Fellig in 1899 in what is now Ukraine, lived a spartan existence down by the old New York Police headquarters in Lower Manhattan. That’s not surprising, since his realm was the streets. And the images he shot revealed not just a knowledge of people and places, but an appreciation for the ironic, odd or absurd.

A car dangles off the roadway that encircles Grand Central Terminal, with a “ONE WAY” arrow pointing at it, while two men stand under an awning, not oblivious, but not impressed, either. In another, an overturned vehicle rests on its side, with a sign reading “SLOW DOWN” hovering behind it like an unheeded warning.

Working crowds, you have images of a sweaty, packed throng in Coney Island and people celebrating the end of World War II. A jubilant sailor is surrounded by four women, flanking a sign he held declaring: “$2,000 In Bank Now I’m Looking for a Wife,” with “18-40” added at the bottom. An image of gawkers at a murder scene is a collage of mostly children’s faces, some goofy, arrayed around one woman whose grief is etched on her face.

He also found the lighter side, showing teenaged bobbysoxers jitterbugging in the aisles of a theater, dogs and cats, and even a gorilla. The book is divided into chapters that all start with “EXTRA!” and are devoted to topics like Crime, Cool, Friends, Characters and more.

Of course, the main character on this sidewalk stage is Weegee himself. Mr. Blau deftly connects the man and his era to how we and Hollywood — to which Weegee decamped in 1947 to try his hand at acting — now perceive it.

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote. “Weegee made these possible. He was a game changer — breaking new ground in both photography and photojournalism. Using a camera to tell a story as others used their pen or speech.”

Mr. Blau concludes that while Weegee may have left to be a movie actor, he had long been on that path.

“By then he had already made all the films he wanted,” he wrote. “All films made of a single frame. All telling a story in one take. Today I love these short films.”

So we get a Hodor (Ryan Pifher) bounding on and offstage barking his name at seemingly random moments; a Jon Snow (the Kit Harington doppelgänger Zachary Evan Kanner) whom no one — in a nod to the early episodes — seems to cares about; and a Daenerys Targaryen and Khal Drogo (Mandie Hittleman and the suitably buff Ace Marrero) who generate comic sparks with Dothraki-style lovemaking.

New technologies like electric and autonomously driven vehicles are forcing major changes while the center of gravity in the car business is shifting toward Asia. “There is a lot of fluidity in the entire industry space, which is what these players see,” Mr. Wells said.

In an interview at a pub called The Grenadier in London, Mr. Ratcliffe explained that terminating the much-loved Defender would create demand for a replacement because it “had left quite a hole in the marketplace.” He criticized the many SUVs still being sold as “jelly molds” that all look alike.

Mr. Ratcliffe owns two versions of the Defender — one from 1955 and a so-called Heritage model made near the end of its production run. He said he wants to preserve the Defender’s boxy, military-style ruggedness.

Toby Ecuyer, a yacht designer, has the job of turning Mr. Ratcliffe’s ideas into drawings. “What we are trying to design is something extremely utilitarian,” not a luxury vehicle, he said.

Mr. Ratcliffe conceded that the new vehicle will need updates to meet global safety and emission standards, including in the United States, where its sales stopped in 1997. He said he planned to make about 25,000 vehicles a year — about the number of Defenders sold in 2015, the year before its production was halted.

Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by Tata, an India-based conglomerate, has found success with luxury models like the Range Rover. The company said in a statement that it had plans for the Defender and would pay close attention to any actions regarding its “proprietary rights.”

Mr. Ratcliffe built a $40 billion per year petrochemical empire called Ineos by buying chemical plants that other companies wanted to discard and then running them more efficiently. He said he can also find cheaper ways to operate a car company as well.

According to his team, for instance, European manufacturers had already expressed an interest in either building his car on contract or selling him a fully equipped plant. Either way, that would help limit upfront investment and risk. He said he did not want to put in more than 600 million pounds — less than the $1 billion analysts estimate that development and production of a new model typically costs.

Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director of the CAR center at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany, said he doubted that an updated version of an old concept would have appeal beyond a dwindling group of enthusiasts. A few would buy Mr. Ratcliffe’s car, he said, but it would “become a niche which gets smaller over time.”

Mr. Dyson has been much more guarded about his plans. “It’s not a sports car and not a very cheap car,” he told reporters at his company store on London’s bustling Oxford Street in late September. He recounted that in the 1990s he had designed a device for cleaning truck exhaust but received a cool reception from vehicle manufacturers. Instead, he focused his efforts on electric motors and batteries, hoping that one day he could step up to cars.

He has reached that point. Mr. Dyson has purchased a World War II-era airfield near his company’s headquarters in Malmesbury, in southern England, where the development work will continue. He said the new vehicle will offer a “radical” electric motor design that he said would be more efficient than those available on the market now.

Mr. Dyson has proved himself a dogged inventor, designing high-end vacuum cleaners and other products like hair dryers. His technological savvy gives him a chance of scoring a hit in the much more complex and costly global car industry, analysts said. In 2015, he bought Sakti3, an American start-up that is working with solid state batteries. Mr. Dyson said he could be on track to commercializing a so-called solid state battery, which analysts say might be more powerful and safer than the lithium ion devices now used in electric cars and cellphones. He said both the start-up and his own team were working on the project.

“The edge that Dyson have if they do have an edge is to possibly be ahead of the game in solid state batteries,” said Philippe Houchois, an auto analyst at Jefferies, an investment bank.

As nascent as they are, the plans Mr. Dyson has laid out will be expensive, particularly for a medium-size company like Dyson. Mr. Dyson said he would spend £1 billion on the car and another £1 billion on the battery — a lot of money for a company that reported £2.5 billion in revenue last year.

He may need to spend more. Tesla, for instance, has already spent about $6 billion, according to analysts’ estimates.

Mr. Dyson said he planned to develop not only a new motor but a new chassis. “We are starting from scratch,” he said. “There isn’t one that is suitable.”

Electric cars are clearly a high-risk venture. Mr. Houchois said none of the vehicles on the market, including those made by Tesla, which recently reported disappointing production numbers on its new Model 3, are making money for their owners. Dyson may seek to bring costs down by manufacturing in Asia, where it already makes appliances.

Still, whatever his reputation, Mr. Dyson has set himself a formidable task. “It is one thing to design and manufacture a household item,” said R. A. Farrokhnia, a professor at the business and engineering schools at Columbia University. “And quite another to prototype and then build a complex electric vehicle.”",An Electric Car and a Rugged Throwback: The Dreams of 2 Rich Britons,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/automobiles/wheels/startup-car-markers.html

In August 2011, after a Chinook military helicopter was shot down over Afghanistan, killing 38 people, including 25 Special Forces troops, Mr. Obama consoled the families of all those killed, according to Jeremy B. Bash, a former chief of staff to Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, who attended the ceremony.

David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said, “I don’t recall anything moving him more. He saw it as his duty to console them as best he could and thank them on behalf of the nation.”

But several officials said it was not always realistic to expect presidents to call the families of every fallen soldier. During the peak years of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Mr. Obama and former President George W. Bush faced hundreds of fatalities each year.

In the Niger episode, three American soldiers were killed while on patrol on the border between Niger and Mali this month. The body of a fourth American soldier was recovered later.

While he did not explain why he had not called their families, Mr. Trump said he had written letters to the family members over the weekend, which he said would be mailed later in the day or on Tuesday. He said he also planned to call them.

“I felt very, very badly about that,” he said. “The toughest calls I have to make are the calls where this happens. Soldiers are killed. It’s a very difficult thing,” he said. “Now, it gets to a point where, you know, you make four or five of them in one day. It’s a very, very tough day. For me, that’s by far the toughest.”

A senior official said Mr. Trump had planned to speak sooner to the families, but the White House had to wait until the Pentagon’s paperwork was completed.

Pentagon officials said the military’s Africa Command was putting together a detailed timeline of the attack and of the response by French helicopters that first provided air cover for the badly outnumbered American and Nigerian forces, and eventually medical evacuation.

On Monday, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, joined a growing chorus calling for a review of the circumstances leading to the ambush.

After he answered the question about his response to the attack, Mr. Trump was pressed later in the news conference about his claim that Mr. Obama had never called bereaved families. This time, he seemed to soften his tone.

“I don’t know if he did,” the president said. “I was told he didn’t often, and a lot of presidents don’t. They write letters.”

“President Obama, I think, probably did sometimes and maybe sometimes he didn’t,” Mr. Trump continued. “That’s what I was told.

OAKLAND, Calif. — Discussing her work at Apple at an event last week about fighting racial injustice, Denise Young Smith, the company’s vice president of diversity and inclusion, said, “There can be 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men in a room and they’re going to be diverse, too, because they’re going to bring a different life experience and life perspective to the conversation.”

That’s right: a dozen white men, so long as they were not raised in the same household and don’t think identical thoughts, could be considered diverse. After a furor erupted, Ms. Smith clarified her comments in an email to her team that was obtained and published by TechCrunch. It reads in part, “Understanding that diversity includes women, people of color, L.G.B.T.Q. people, and all underrepresented minorities is at the heart of our work to create an environment that is inclusive of everyone,” and “I regret the choice of words I used to make this point.”

But Ms. Smith wasn’t the first to endorse the view in her initial statement. Those of us in the tech industry know that the idea of “cognitive diversity” is gaining traction among leaders in our field. In too many cases, this means that, in the minds of those with influence over hiring, the concept of diversity is watered down and reinterpreted to encompass what Silicon Valley has never had a shortage of — individual white men, each with their unique thoughts and ideas. This shift creates a distraction from efforts to increase the race and gender diversity the tech industry is sorely lacking.

This overlaps with the sentiments expressed in a screed by a Google software engineer that critiqued the company’s race and gender diversity efforts and ascribed the unequal representation of women in tech to “biological causes.” It included the line, “Viewpoint diversity is arguably the most important type of diversity.”

Yet for much of the last century, until 1994, photography in the city’s rapid transit system was illegal (though it was a spottily enforced offense). In the late 1930s — soon after the city imposed its ban — Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed unsuspecting commuters.

Mr. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35 mm camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release that snaked down his sleeve.

Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers.

Not surprisingly, Ms. Levitt was soon taking her own subway portraits, first with Mr. Evans’s gear, and then with her own camera, possibly using the same technique. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and was eventually nominated for an Academy Award, she would, three years after Mr. Evans died in 1975, return underground to photograph passengers. A new book called, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades.

It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring art deco posters, elaborate furs, and jauntily-tilted hats, while those from the 1970s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. In some photos, the subjects appear to be looking right at Ms. Levitt, adding further mystery about her technique.

It’s hard to know how she operated, since Ms. Levitt, who died at age 95 in 2009, spoke little of her work. “If it were easy to talk about, I’d be a writer,” she said. “Since I’m inarticulate, I express myself with images.”

That extended health care access to people in the hills and surrounding counties who had never been insured, and shrank charity-case costs.
She fears that if Republicans unwind the health care law, the tough times will return.
The endless fighting over the health care law has left some of the Swansons so frustrated that they wonder if starting from scratch is the only way to move forward.","MOUNTAIN HOME, Ark. — Marjorie Swanson was the first in the family to get a job at Baxter Regional Medical Center after moving to this rural Ozark town from Chicago’s South Side in 1995.

A year later, her husband was hired by the maintenance department. Six months ago, their daughter snagged a job as a pharmacy technician and shares the night shift with her fiancé, who works in housekeeping. Their son started in 2013 as a biomedical technician, repairing medical equipment. He was introduced to his wife by two nurses there: one who is now his mother-in-law and Beverly Green, an aunt through marriage.

Baxter County, Ark. DEMOGRAPHICS BAXTER U.S. Population 41,000 323 mil. Percentage white 97% 77% Percentage 65 and older 31% 15% Median household income in 2015 $35,400 $53,900 4.3% 4.4% Unemployment rate Health care share of employment 26% 13% ELECTION RESULTS 2012 2016 71% Trump Romney 74% Obama 27% Clinton 21%

“Without our hospital, I’d probably be working at McDonald’s,” said Ms. Green, who was born at the medical center 47 years ago and has worked there for the past 27, first as a nursing assistant, and now as a manager. “Almost everyone has someone related here.”

That’s not surprising in Baxter County, in a part of northern Arkansas known for two dragon-shaped fishing lakes filled with largemouth bass, walleye and bream. The hospital is the single largest employer, with 1,600 people paid to mop floors and code insurance forms, stitch wounds and perform open-heart surgery.

“We are the economic anchor of the community,” said Ron Peterson, Baxter Regional’s president and chief executive. “When we downsize, the whole community downsizes.”

So for residents of the nearly all-white county, who overwhelmingly voted for President Trump, the fight over the Affordable Care Act is about both lives and livelihoods, access to care and to jobs. And the cloud that remains over the law’s future is unsettling.

Even after the latest Senate effort to overturn the bill collapsed last month, Republicans insisted that the failure was not the final word on the matter for this Congress. “At some point there will be a repeal and replace,” Mr. Trump declared. In the meantime, he has moved to scrap subsidies to insurance companies that help cover low-income people and signed an executive order permitting policies exempt from some of the act’s coverage rules — actions that supporters of the law say will gut it.

Whatever happens, the economy of every state will be affected. Across the country, the health care industry has become a ceaseless job producer — for doctors, nurses, radiologists, paramedics, medical technicians, administrators and health care aides. Funding that began flowing in 2012 as a result of the Affordable Care Act created at least a half-million jobs, according to an analysis by Goldman Sachs.

In many rural areas, where economies are smaller and less diversified, the impact is magnified. Health care has long been an economic bedrock in Baxter County, with a population of 41,000. But its significance has grown since the Affordable Care Act passed. The hospital alone has added 221 employees, a 16 percent increase, since 2011. The health sector accounts for one in nine jobs nationwide, but one in four here — roughly equal to the share employed by the county’s manufacturers and retailers combined.

“I’m optimistic about the economy, but I’m not optimistic about this health care reform,” Marjorie Swanson said. Like many of her co-workers and neighbors, she dislikes parts of the law that President Barack Obama championed. But she also knows that undoing it now would reduce both the number of insured patients and the government payments that keep the hospital afloat.

One of 31 states (plus the District of Columbia) that chose to extend Medicaid coverage, Arkansas got extra money to cover more low-income residents. Its adult uninsured rate dropped 12.3 percentage points, more than nearly every other state.

Losing that Medicaid money now might not put Baxter Regional out of business, but it could compel the independent, nonprofit hospital to merge with a larger system and cut back its services and work force. And that could be as devastating as slashing jobs at a steel plant in a factory town.

Gathered in a conference room at the hospital between shifts, many in the extended Swanson clan, dressed in a rainbow of blue, red and maroon scrubs, said the law needed to be fixed, not scrapped. And they primarily blamed a corrupt Washington establishment — not Mr. Trump — for failing to do so.

“It’d be like getting a new job as a manager here and every single person is against you,” Ms. Green said of Mr. Trump. She grew up in a family that leaned Democratic, and she supported Bill Clinton, then the state’s governor, for president in 1992, but said she didn’t trust Hillary Clinton.

Still, she is anxious about how Republican-led changes in health care could affect her job. “Probably we’d have to move,” said Ms. Green, whose husband is a firefighter. “But where to go? My whole family’s here. There’s no one who comes for a holiday from somewhere else.”

Ms. Swanson, 52, nodded. “We’d have difficulty getting a job with insurance,” she said. “And where would we get our care?”

Hospitals in rural areas have long struggled financially, but over the past decade the rate of closings has grown steadily. As young people gravitate to urban centers for college and employment, populations have dwindled, and those left behind are often poorer, sicker and less apt to have health insurance.

Baxter Regional, serving a county seat that is a retirement destination, is in a stronger position than most of the nation’s 2,500 rural acute-care hospitals. It offers neurosurgery and an emergency cardiac catheterization lab, the state’s first 3-D mammograms and magnetic resonance imaging. Still, it exists on a financial knife edge even as it helps prop up the local economy. The average operating margin began dipping below the break-even point in 2006 and has hovered near there since.

The financial effect of the Affordable Care Act on the hospital has been mixed. The Medicaid expansion in Arkansas allowed residents earning 138 percent of the federal poverty level — $16,643 for an individual or $33,948 for a family of four — to buy private insurance paid for primarily by the federal government. That extended health care access to people in the hills and surrounding counties who had never been insured, and shrank charity-case costs.

But it also reduced Medicare reimbursements, which cover the elderly. This trade-off left many hospitals ahead, but not Baxter Regional, which has an unusually large share of Medicare patients — 67 percent compared with a national average of 40 percent.

The added $4 million in Medicaid payments did not make up for the $12 million lost through Medicare. As Mr. Peterson points out, however, the Republican proposals to remake the law would have decreased Medicaid money without restoring any Medicare cuts. Arkansas would be particularly hard hit because it is among a handful of states with provisions that automatically end expanded Medicaid benefits if federal funding is reduced. The results would include fewer insured patients and a lot more debt.

A repeal now, Mr. Peterson said, would be calamitous.

“I was not initially a proponent,” he said of the law. “But once Medicare was cut, then it was very important to make sure you got the whole benefit from the Medicaid expansion. Otherwise, you would have just seen the cuts. Why would I be for that?”

Young people are still leaving. But health care offers a lure to draw them back.

It’s a five-minute drive from Baxter Regional to the office of Robin Myers, the chancellor of Arkansas State University-Mountain Home, a two-year college that works closely with the hospital to produce job-ready students.

“I can’t tell you how intricately we are tied together with the hospital,” Mr. Myers said. “We could not survive without them.”

“We’re really educating people in the health care professions to stay here,” he added, noting that the school’s typical student is a 28-year-old woman. Once housed in a funeral home and feed store, the college now occupies a stately campus completed in 2000 and styled on Thomas Jefferson’s neo-Classical design for the University of Virginia.

Mountain Home, like other rural towns, is seeing an outflow of young people. The kindergarten has 100 fewer children than it did five years ago. But Mr. Myers said that “if we have opportunities for them, they want to come back.”

Marjorie Swanson’s daughter, Alison, 23, returned after graduating from college in 2016 with a fine-arts degree. She found an internship with a Stanford University professor, but when it ended, she had no job and no way to afford San Francisco’s sky-high rents.

“I was broke,” she said. “I came back home and was just trying to save up money and working a minimum-wage job that was terrible.”

When a rare opening as a well-paid pharmacy technician arose, her mother urged her to apply. “I’m really, really fortunate, and I really like this job,” Ms. Swanson said. “I would have never thought I would have done this, but the opportunity was there.”

Dr. Lucas Bradley, a neurosurgeon who had just finished up his residency in Little Rock, grew up in Maine, not Mountain Home, but he and his wife, Karla, knew they wanted to raise their family in a small town. Without a growing full-service hospital, though, Dr. Bradley, 37, said he probably wouldn’t have moved here and bought a house. His children — six with a seventh on the way — wouldn’t attend nearby public schools. His wife wouldn’t shop at Harps or fill the car’s gas tank at Valero. His family wouldn’t attend one of the area’s churches.

An economic impact review by the hospital concluded that workers’ earnings combined with their spending on groceries, clothing and the like generated more than $216 million a year in economic activity and helped create 1,280 jobs beyond their own. The hospital spends an additional $19 million a year on goods and services in a dozen surrounding counties. Based on the loss of Medicaid expansion money, the review estimated that a repeal of the Affordable Care Act could mean up to 500 layoffs at the hospital.

Vacationers looking for ‘one square inch of heaven’ became retirees drawn to a community-centered hospital.

Even now, with a repaved Route 62 running through it, Mountain Home is still what residents call a place you’ve got to be coming to, to get to. Joe Miles, now 65 and president of Integrity First Bank, grew up about 90 miles downstream on the White River and used to hunt and fish here as a child. “You couldn’t get here except by ferry,” he recalled.

Spectacular Ozark scenery, lakes and a river crowded with trout, thanks to federal dam projects, started luring fishermen to the area in the 1950s. The next decade, a group of local businessmen pushed development at a time when the ambulance doubled as a hearse, and the traffic light at Seventh and Main Streets was removed because there were so few cars.

One was T. J. McCabe, a co-founder of Integrity First, who traveled to boat and recreational-vehicle shows in the Midwest, giving away deeds for “one square inch of heaven” and telling the recipients to come visit their property.

“And they would come,” Mr. Miles recalled. “What we’re reaping today are second and third generations from Chicago, Green Bay and Minneapolis.”

Vacationers — blue-collar workers with dependable pension plans — turned into retirees. They were drawn by the lower cost of living, natural beauty and, over time, a full-service, community-centered hospital that could treat hip fractures, diabetes and congestive heart failure without a three-hour drive.

Marjorie Swanson’s parents moved to Mountain Home after researching best-places-to-retire lists. It was during a vacation visit that she and her husband decided it would be a great place to raise their children.

Many of the retirees — who make up 30 percent of the county’s population — join a large network of volunteers at the hospital; a smaller circle of wealthier ones are big financial donors as well.

In a county where two-thirds of the public-school children qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, such contributions have funded scholarships that helped pay for Ms. Green’s advanced nursing training, and college for Alison Swanson and her brother, Matt. In addition, they have underwritten emergency-room furniture, wheelchairs, free wigs for cancer patients and more.

The stream of retirees slowed when the housing market crashed, and nest eggs turned into foreclosures. During the recession, those who came were like Sarah and Blair Brozynski, Chicago residents who had long vacationed here. They lost their jobs and moved to their summer house in Mountain Home, where they could live with their five children more cheaply.

Now director of education at the hospital, Ms. Brozynski, 47, remembers when the factories laid off workers, the hospital stopped hiring and a wave of closings hit resorts. Car lots were full because no one was buying.

“That was pretty sad, and we got a taste of it,” said Ms. Brozynski, whose husband is training to be a paramedic on a hospital scholarship. A son, also named Blair, is working in the hospital kitchen while he finishes college. She fears that if Republicans unwind the health care law, the tough times will return.

Many were skeptical about the Affordable Care Act, but its funding is cited as a lifeline in extending coverage.

Ms. Brozynski supported Mr. Obama’s health care legislation when it was first proposed, but many others in the county were skeptical. Some objected to the rise in premiums or a provision devised to keep the plan solvent — fining people who failed to sign up for coverage.

Now, whatever the criticisms, the dozens of employees interviewed at Baxter Regional and elsewhere all expressed thanks that more people had insurance. Michael Haynes, a 64-year-old real estate agent, credited the Affordable Care Act with saving his life. He didn’t have insurance before 2014. Without it, he would not have gone for a routine physical, which led to a diagnosis of prostate cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma. After chemotherapy treatments, he is in remission.

At the Christian Clinic — the health care provider of last resort — the number of nonpaying patients seen each week has dropped from 90 to about 50 because of the expanded coverage, said Dr. Paul Wilbur, the clinic’s chairman.

The law has brought insurance to more than 360,000 people in Arkansas, and it now covers 61 percent of children in the state’s small towns and rural areas. “That meant just a gigantic helicopter drop of federal funding,” said Mark Duggan, an economist at Stanford. If that is reversed, “the hospital sector is going to get really hard hit.”

Dr. Bradley, who voted for Mr. Trump and credits him with shaking up inside-the-Beltway cronyism, said the health care law had “benefited hospitals, patients and providers in the state of Arkansas.”

“There were lots of parts in that bill that were done right, parts that were necessary,” Dr. Bradley said. There were significant shortcomings, too, he said, but they are fixable. Sadly, he added, bitter partisanship has made the law a lasting target.

The endless fighting over the health care law has left some of the Swansons so frustrated that they wonder if starting from scratch is the only way to move forward.

“Let it implode and start from ground zero,” Marjorie Swanson suggested at one point. But that prospect, echoing a threat by Mr. Trump, scared other members of the family.

“What does that actually mean?” Ms. Green said. “If he’s going to let it fail and there’s no reimbursements and things are closing, how many casualties are in the wake?”","Deep in Trump Country, a Big Stake in Health Care",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/16/business/economy/trump-obamacare-arkansas.html

The battle is being fought on both moral and economic grounds. Mining advocates stress the hundreds of tangible construction and mining jobs this copper-nickel operation could create in the coming decades. Boundary Waters activists argue that the very presence of mining — its disruption of this area’s natural character, not to mention the specter of pollution — could hamper the region’s “amenity-based” development in a multitude of tangible and intangible ways, from destroying property values to stripping away jobs that feed off this area’s natural beauty.

In the land of iron and water, opposition to copper-nickel mining is more than just a protect-the-wilderness stance; it also reflects a deeper desire to change the area’s character, from hardscrabble mining region to tourist destination that prioritizes protecting the wilderness over creating more mining jobs. Central to the debate between the two camps is a philosophical question: What is the right kind of economy for a place like the Boundary Waters?

For as far back as he can trace it, Dan Forsman’s family has lived here, where iron meets water. His great-great-grandfather migrated from Finland in the 1890s and homesteaded on a 474-acre lake. His great-grandfather, Emil Forsman, worked in the mines before opening a longtime Ely watering hole, Forsman’s Tavern. Emil’s son worked as a maintenance foreman in the crusher at an Ely mine. In 1947, Emil’s eldest grandchild was born above Forsman’s Tavern. That boy, Mike, grew up in Ely, worked for a canoe outfitter for $1.25 an hour, volunteered to join the Marines in the 1960s and worked in the mines for 34 years. His youngest son was Dan. Dan grew up in awe of the giant machines that his mechanic father worked to fix. When he turned 20, after training at a two-year community college to become a heavy-equipment mechanic, he got a job at the same mine as his father.

At 4:40 a.m. on a chilly late-spring morning, I pulled up to Dan Forsman’s house to drive with him to work. The diesel engine of his 2002 Chevy Silverado pickup was already growling. He had gotten up 12 minutes earlier, thrown on torn jeans, a T-shirt and a camouflage hunting jacket and packed a lunch: turkey and American cheese on white bread, a banana and a Little Debbie Cosmic Brownie. The 29-year-old tugged down on a cap that advertised the brand of nitrous oxide he uses to soup up car engines. A block away, he steered past his father’s house and the garage where he learned to tinker. His prized car is a 1979 Chevy Camaro; he can get it up to nearly 150 miles per hour on a nearby drag strip.

Forsman drove up the hill of Ely’s business district. Some people call this a mining town, others a tourist town, but East Sheridan Street shows it to be both. There’s the grilled-cheese shop frequented by tourists and the grocery store that stocks the hot smoked bologna local residents swear by. There are liquor stores that boycotted a local brewery after the brewery publicly sided with clean-water advocates, but down the street is a stylish new wine bar serving that same beer. More than a dozen local canoe outfitters that organize trips into the Boundary Waters are based here. Neighboring storefronts display yard signs: “We support mining. Mining supports us.”

“There are two Elys, two different realities, different visions,” Tom Coombe, the editor of The Ely Echo and a fourth-generation Elyite, told me.

As Forsman’s truck rumbled to the top of the hill, we passed a two-story building that used to be Forsman’s Tavern. Now it’s occupied by Piragis Northwoods Company, a successful canoe outfitter and outdoor store. Steve Piragis has run this shop a decade longer than Dan Forsman has been alive, but Forsman’s family still considers Piragis an outsider — a “packsacker,” the local term for people who moved here for wilderness instead of mining.

Past the city limits and into the heart of Minnesota’s Iron Range, fog lifted over white pine trees. A ring-necked pheasant strutted alongside Wolf Creek Pass. As Forsman parked in the same lot his father used to park in — 52 minutes door to door — steam poured from four chimneys.

Forsman is proud of his part in this 360-employee mining enterprise. He’s proud that his labor makes something tangible: Huge chunks of rock become tiny bits of rock, which are ground and baked into half-inch pellets containing 67.5 percent iron, which leave this processing plant on the rails at a rate of 8,500 tons a day. The pellets are loaded onto ships in Duluth, where they float along Lake Superior to the other Great Lakes. At the bottom tip of Lake Michigan, just east of Chicago, tons of these pellets are fed into the largest blast furnace in the Western Hemisphere and smelted into steel, eventually becoming cars or trucks or household appliances or plate steel for ships and armored vehicles.

Up a flight of metal stairs, Forsman entered the locker room, put on his blue coveralls and laced up his steel-toed boots. Everything in his workplace seems improbably enormous. The mining trucks, with their 12-foot-tall tires, can haul 240 tons of rock from the open-pit mines into the processing facility. Miles away, off a gravel road as wide as a six-lane highway, 280,000 pounds of explosives had been loaded into 132 16-inch-diameter holes in a mining pit — it was blast day. The explosions would shake the earth, breaking up rock for the processing facility. The pit looked like a gray moonscape.

“To make money, you have to make something that wasn’t there,” Forsman told me. “You dig it up or you grow it. Without those things, you’re just making nothing. Without the basic minerals to make a phone, you can’t make an app for the phone. Because there’s nothing there.”

Forsman says he loves and wants to protect the Boundary Waters. He also believes copper mining and clean water can coexist. Then again, the mine that Forsman works in is a taconite mine, not the type of copper-nickel mine that environmentalists decry as a threat to this watershed. But what matters most to Forsman is the need for jobs in this hollowed-out region. Ely’s population has shrunk 30 percent since 1980; school enrollment is a third of what it was in the late 1960s. “If they stop this new mine, what’s the draw to be up here if there’s no jobs?” Also, he notes, those who oppose new mining jobs — “elitists” and “hypocrites,” Forsman calls them — benefit from the same metals that blue-collar workers like him produce. “People don’t understand where things come from anymore,” he said.

When Forsman refers to these “people,” he’s often referring to one person in particular. Her name is Becky Rom, and she is the head of the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters. What makes him most angry is Rom’s condescension, her moral certainty: “The way she comes off, her attitude and way of doing this, it’s part of the problem.”

“Danny Forsman drives to the mine in his truck, comes home and watches TV, and he doesn’t know this world exists,” says Becky Rom, a 68-year-old lawyer who returned to her childhood home after retirement and now leads the environmental campaign. One afternoon this spring, I stood on a dock with Rom and her husband, Reid Carron, as they lowered a canoe into the South Kawishiwi River. Rom dangled her feet over the water, which was a couple miles of portages, rivers and rapids from the southwestern border of the Boundary Waters. Chokecherry and juneberry trees were in bloom. Sometimes Rom sees moose, otters, timber wolves or black bears. Today a blue jay hopped along the shore near where a beaver had built a lodge of alder limbs. Rom guessed newborn beavers were inside.

Rom has an energy that can be difficult to keep up with, whether she’s channeling it into hourlong soliloquies about the history of the Boundary Waters or a breakneck march into the wilderness. Rom slid into the canoe, her husband in back and me in the middle. The water beneath us was nearly black, tannin-stained, jarringly cold. A few years ago, an environmental group cited the South Kawishiwi as one of America’s 10 most endangered rivers because of the possibility that Twin Metals would begin mining for copper-nickel nearby.

Rom has become the most prominent foe of copper-nickel mining near the Boundary Waters. She makes frequent lobbying visits to St. Paul and Washington to drum up support from administrative and elected officials. Her group commissions studies and opinion polls; she takes part in public debates. But even the miners who hate her most wouldn’t dare call her a packsacker. Rom’s family has lived in Ely as long as the Forsmans. Her grandfather, Caspar Rom, emigrated from Slovenia in the 1890s. In December 1917, three weeks after his ninth child was born, Caspar Rom was leaning over an ore car when a cave-in crushed his head. That newborn son was Bill Rom, Becky’s father. He hunted and fished with his brothers to help his mother put food on the table. In 1946, he opened Canoe Country Outfitters, soon one of the most successful outfitters around. Three years later, Becky was born.

Her father became a leader in the fight for the federal Wilderness Act, whose passage in 1964 helped create federally designated wilderness areas. During the battles over the tightening of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness regulations in the 1970s, Bill Rom became a symbol among local residents, who for generations had enjoyed this land with few restrictions, of environmentalism run amok. Under new rules, airplanes were banned, which meant no more flying seaplanes into remote lakes. Resorts were torn down. Motorboat use was limited. Resentful local residents harassed Rom. In 1975, logging trucks blockaded his business on two of the busiest weekends of the year. Snowmobiles buzzed around his house at night to keep the Roms from sleeping. Becky’s brother camped inside the family business with their dog and a gun. Eventually, Rom sold his business rather than endure protests from people he grew up with.

But his cause left a lasting imprint on his daughter. After Rom and her husband, Reid Carron, retired from the largest law firm in the Twin Cities — she was a commercial real estate lawyer, he a management labor lawyer — they moved north in 2012 to a modern log cabin they had built on land her father bought decades before on Burntside Lake. Today a copy of the 1964 Wilderness Act signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson hangs on Rom’s bedroom wall.

Rom maneuvered the canoe toward the other side of the river. Docks jutted into the water, evidence of homes hidden in the trees. She lifted her paddle and gestured toward some white pines: “This would be all mines,” she said. “The noise, the lights, the dust, it would be everywhere.” A woodpecker pounded its beak into a tree. A smallmouth bass hunting mayflies broke the river’s surface.

The edge of the Boundary Waters is several miles from three mineral deposits that Twin Metals hopes to develop and just a half-mile from a fourth one. The deposits are near or under lakes and rivers that stream directly into the Boundary Waters. Acid mine drainage could potentially flow past 30 resorts, outfitters and campgrounds, as well as hundreds of homes, before reaching the Boundary Waters at Fall Lake. From there, water enters Basswood Lake, a popular fishery that straddles the Canadian border, then Canada’s Quetico Provincial Park and then Voyageurs National Park and Rainy Lake. All told, polluted water could theoretically affect up to 2.3 million acres of American and Canadian public lands, according to a peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Hydrology. Pollution could harm fish, wild rice and property values. (This sounds alarmist to those who support underground copper-nickel mining near Ely; the multiyear process of planning the mine and clearing it with regulators would, they believe, set up ample safeguards against pollution.)

Rom and her husband climbed out of the canoe. Back in town, they pointed out thriving enterprises. One family company makes outerwear, which nicely complements the family’s other business, a lodge that runs winter dogsledding trips. An outfit called Crapola makes cranberry-apple granola. An art gallery displayed prints from a nature photographer. A fancy new restaurant, a spa, a gift shop that also sells saunas, a renovated historic theater looking for a tenant — Rom regards all these small businesses as evidence that the future here will not replicate the mining past. The jobs may be seasonal or not pay as well as mining jobs; on the other hand, they are not as backbreaking and they foster a local creative class. Last year, National Geographic Adventure ranked Ely as one of the world’s nine best outdoor towns, citing its proximity to vast public lands. Only one other American community — Moab, Utah, near Arches and Canyonlands national parks — made the list.","In Northern Minnesota, Two Economies Square Off: Mining vs. Wilderness",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/magazine/in-northern-minnesota-two-economies-square-off-mining-vs-wilderness.html

“The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said.","Andre Martin and Renaud Wald made off with the paintings from the Louvre without triggering the dreaded “red procedure.” That’s the high-tech system that automatically seals exits and locks doors throughout the vast museum within two minutes of a security breach. The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

Photo

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Photo

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

I thought about his words often as I drove for five days, sometimes for as long as eight hours at a stretch, both in terms of the architecture I saw as well as in trying to convince myself that his overarching plan described how I was feeling. In fact, my state of mind about the trip could be described as shaky at best. A friend in Oslo warned me that bad weather often cropped up unexpectedly in October, especially in the north: torrential rain storms or early snow storms that leave cars stranded on a mountain pass or by a lonely fjord.

I was slowly becoming a more daring driver but I was not used to being without a passenger in a country where I didn’t speak a word of the language. On top of that, I already felt emotionally quite alone from my marital breakup, a melancholy sensation that only intensified during intervals when an hour passed without seeing another car, even on major highways.

After a couple of days though, the peace and diversity of the countryside became meditational, a panorama that seemed dreamlike through my windscreen. Traditional country cottages built into mounds of earth with grass-topped roofs and green weathered doors looked as if they were out of “The Hobbit.” Dark thick forest alternated with bucolic sun-dappled farmland and bare, desolate mountains overlooking quaint lakeside towns. One late afternoon as I drove into a village, the sun appeared to drop like a fireball into the fjord. Spectacular modern installations appeared on remote corners in the most far-fetched of places, that they sometimes seemed like a figment of my imagination.

I have never seen a place so multifaceted in its geography and so unpopulated, except perhaps on the other side of the earth, in Patagonia.

Above Trollstigen, another project conceived along these routes is the Juvet Landscape Hotel, designed by the architects Jensen & Skodvin, and the creepy, if incredibly appropriate aesthetically, setting for the 2015 film “Ex Machina.”

From the exterior, the compound, in a nature reserve called Reinheimen, looks almost like a hippie campsite with its low-slung, wood-encased cabins on stilts. But as I was shown into my room, the rustic vision was completely turned on its head — the natural wood or in some instances stone that covers the rear of the structures hides glass walls and raw cement cubes facing front — with views onto the gentle valley, and onto the surrounding peaks and meandering river that cut through the landscape behind.

The perspective created the effect that I was both inside and outside the hotel, part of the natural surroundings, both the voyeur and the inhabitant.

After a dip in the outdoor hot tub, I joined other travelers and guests around a candlelit communal dining room, an intimate warm environment where locally hunted venison was served alongside foraged mountain vegetables that were like strange fairy-tale versions of carrots and beets with curly tendrils and odd shapes. A roaring fire and candles were our only light.

Around the dinner table, we traded stories about what brought us up the mountain and where we came from. The Chinese-American college student recounted his adventures while taking a gap year. The Norwegian honeymooners were in need of a wilderness break from Oslo, the capital. The glossy magazine reading hikers from Britainwanted a sleek hotel after rugged trails. I shared my journey in broad strokes, the American expatriate in Tuscany, my road trip, my love of nature, and I left out the impending change in my marriage and my sense of loss.

When I look back now, my Norwegian road trip seems like one of the most surreal and meaningful of any I have ever taken, even after many years of absorbing trips. The memory turns in my head like a film trailer, so cinematic and surprising that I still almost can’t believe it was real. The pristine beauty, the sense of drama. Perhaps it was the network of beautiful art and architecture that made me feel, daring and courageous by journey’s end. And for that, I am grateful.

Will you try something with me?

Grab a blank piece of paper, draw a line right down the middle and think of the last time you saw someone fail. It might take you a minute to remember. Got it? Now, on the left side of the paper, write down a few words describing how that failure made you think about that person.

Now, I want you to think about the last time you failed. I bet it won’t take nearly as long to recall. On the right side of the paper, jot down a few words describing how that failure made you think about yourself.

Finally, compare the two. If you’re like me, you probably had one or both of the following things happen.

“Well, I’m getting evicted,’” Mr. Zolfo replied. He said he had been subletting from another actor, who, to his surprise, “had apparently decided that paying rent was optional.”

There are monthly dinners to bond and discuss house business — like what to do about flies around the compost, and implementing a chore list.

“For me, the big question was, ‘How could I live the life I want to live in New York without spending a fortune?’” Mr. Heitz said.

For him, the experience of finding and creating a home was both so challenging and ultimately satisfying that shortly after moving in he decided to take the advice of a broker he met during his apartment search.

Suppose the US were to cut corporate tax rates.
So the story of a corporate tax cut is as follows: initially we’re at a point like A.
That’s pretty slow: it will take a dozen years to achieve even half the adjustment to the long run.","These days, what passes for policymaking in America manages to be simultaneously farcical and sinister, and the evil-clown aspects extend into the oddest places. Hence the tale of the Mnuchin Treasury’s incompetent attempt to suppress an internal analysis – to send it down the mnemory hole? — on the incidence of corporate taxation. This paper reached the inconvenient conclusion that most of the tax stays where it’s applied – with the owners of corporate capital – with only a small share falling indirectly on workers. In general, attempts to suppress stuff like this fail thanks to leaks. But in this case the paper has already been published in a peer-reviewed journal, so that even if the Treasury were locked down tight everyone could read it anyway.

But let’s leave that story on one side; I want to talk a bit about the actual economics of corporate tax incidence. This is not usually my subject, but there’s an intersection with international economics that seems relevant, and which – as far as I can tell, although I’m not as familiar as I should be with the literature – isn’t being appreciated in the current discussion. Specifically: while global capital markets should tend to equalize after-tax rates of return in the long run, the imperfect integration of goods markets implies that the long run is pretty darn long – not enough for us to be all dead, but long enough that return equalization should take decades.

Oh, and a warning: I try to tell readers when something is going to be wonkish and incomprehensible, but this is going to be really, really, really wonkish and incomprehensible, unless you spent years doing perfect-foresight dynamic models. Actually, maybe this is being written for Olivier Blanchard and three or four other people. Whatever.

Anyway, to set the stage: this whole literature goes back to Harberger, who envisaged a closed economy with a fixed stock of capital. He showed that in such an economy a tax on profits would fall on capital, basically because the supply of capital is inelastic.

The modern counterargument is that we now live in a world of internationally mobile capital; this means that for any individual country the supply of capital, far from being fixed, is highly elastic, because capital can move in or out. In fact, for a small economy facing perfect capital markets, the elasticity of capital supply is infinite. This means that the after-tax return on capital is fixed, so any changes in corporate tax rates must fall on other factors, i.e. labor.

Most analysis of tax incidence nonetheless allocates only a small fraction of the corporate tax to labor, for three reasons.

First, a lot of corporate profits aren’t a return to capital: they’re rents on monopoly power, brand value, technological advantages, and so on. Inflows of capital won’t compete those profits away, so the international capital market isn’t relevant to the incidence of taxes on those profits.

Second, America isn’t a small country. We are, instead, big enough to have a strong effect on worldwide rates of return.

Third, imperfect integration of both capital and goods markets is a reality. Rates of return probably aren’t equalized even in the long run; anyway, if a corporate tax cut brings in more capital, this will drive down the relative price of US products, which will limit the return on additional capital and hence keep workers from getting the full benefit of the tax cut.

I’m fine with all that. But I think it’s also important to ask exactly how inflows of capital that equalize rates of return are supposed to happen. Once you ask that question, you see that long run analysis may not be good enough for policy purposes.

Suppose the US were to cut corporate tax rates. This would initially raise the after-tax rate of return on capital, which would provide an incentive for foreign capital (or overseas assets of US firms) to move into the country. This would, in turn, drive the after-tax rate of return back down. How would it do this? By increasing the U.S. capital stock, reducing the marginal product of capital (and raising that of labor).

But how would the capital stock be increased? One does not simply walk into Mordor unbolt machines in other countries from the floor and roll them into America the next week. What we’re talking about is a process in which U.S. investment exceeds U.S. savings – that is, we run current account deficits – which increases our capital stock over time.

There’s an immediate irony here: the rhetoric calling for corporate tax cuts is all about “competitiveness”, yet the initial impact would be bigger trade deficits. But never mind that: think about what it takes to have a bigger trade deficit.

I’ve spent three decades pointing out the fallacy of the doctrine of immaculate transfer – the notion that international flows of capital translate directly into trade imbalances. Exporters and importers don’t know or care about S-I; they respond to signals from prices and costs. A capital inflow creates a trade deficit by driving up the real exchange rate, making your goods and services less competitive. And because markets for goods and services are still very imperfectly integrated – most of GDP isn’t tradable at all – it takes large signals, big moves in the real exchange rate, to cause significant changes in the current account balance.

So, a U.S. corporate tax cut should lead to a stronger dollar, which affects the current account deficit that is the counterpart of an inflow of capital. But how much stronger does the dollar get? The answer, familiar to international macroeconomists, is that the dollar rises above its long-run expected value, so that people expect it to decline in the future – and the extent of the rise is determined by how high the dollar has to go so that expected depreciation outweighs the rise in after-tax returns compared with other countries.

The point is that the knowledge that we’re looking at a one-time adjustment limits how high the dollar can go, which limits the size of the current account deficit, which limits the rate at which the U.S. capital stock can expand, which slows the process of return equalization. So the long run in which returns are equalized can be quite long indeed.

Suppose we assume rational expectations. (I know, I know – but for a benchmark it may be useful.) Then we can think of the adjustment process I’m describing as a little dynamic system in e, the exchange rate, and K, the capital stock. High K means a low rate of return compared with r*, the foreign rate of return, so e must be rising. High e means large trade deficits. The phase diagram looks like this:

Photo

where the saddle path is the unique path along which expectations about the future exchange rate are fulfilled. You can solve for that path by linearizing around a steady state; the solutions to that system have two roots, one negative, one positive, and the negative root tells you the rate of convergence along the saddle path.

At any given time the capital stock K is given; the exchange rate e jumps to put the system on the saddle path, and then it converges over time to the long run equilibrium.

So the story of a corporate tax cut is as follows: initially we’re at a point like A. Then the tax cut raises the long-run equilibrium capital stock. But it takes time to get there: first we get a currency appreciation, as shown by the jump from A to B, and then over time we converge to C.

The question is, how fast is this convergence? And we do have enough information to put in some stylized-fact numbers. I assume Cobb-Douglas production, with a capital share of 0.3. The capital-output ratio is about 3, implying an initial rate of return of 0.1. And the modelers at the Fed tell us that the impact of the exchange rate on net exports is about 0.15 – that is, a 10 percent rise in the dollar widens the trade deficit by about 1.5 percent of GDP.

When I plug these numbers in, assuming I’ve done the algebra right, I get a rate of convergence of .059 – that is, about 6 percent of the deviation from the long run eliminated each year. That’s pretty slow: it will take a dozen years to achieve even half the adjustment to the long run.

What this says to me is that openness to world capital markets makes a lot less difference to tax incidence than people seem to think in the short run, and even in the medium run. If you’re trying to assess the effects of tax policies over the next decade, a closed-economy analysis is probably closer to the truth than one that assumes instant equalization of returns across nations.",The Transfer Problem and Tax Incidence (Insanely Wonkish),https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/the-transfer-problem-and-tax-incidence-insanely-wonkish/

I liked Binyamin Appelbaum’s historical comparison of the Trump tax cut with Reagan and Bush, although such a comparison risks suggesting that the previous rounds made sense. They didn’t. The Reagan tax cut caused a sharp reversal in the long-run trend toward a declining debt-GDP ratio, the Bush tax cuts undid the fiscal progress of the Clinton years. And conversely, the Clinton tax hike helped produce surpluses even as the economy experienced a large boom, totally the opposite of what the usual suspects on the right predicted.

That said, Trumpcuts are an even worse idea than Reaganomics, and not just because we start from much higher debt, the legacy of the financial crisis, which cut deeply into revenue and temporarily boosted spending. It also matters that we start from a much lower top tax rate than Reagan did.

Here’s the modern history of the top marginal rate:

Photo

So Reagan was cutting taxes with a starting rate of 70%; Trumpcuts would start from only a bit more than half that. Why does this matter?

Actually, two reasons. First, tax cuts are supposed to spur growth by increasing the amount of an increment in income someone can keep for himself or herself. When you start from 70% taxation, cutting the rate 1 percent raises the take-home component by 1/30, or more than 3%. When you start from 39.6%, the same size cut raises the take-home slice by 1/60, or half as much. In other words, we’d expect the incentive effects of a given tax cut now to be only half what they were under Reagan.

And suppose for the sake of argument that you do get some extra growth. How much of this feeds back into higher revenue? That depends on the marginal tax rate — which is much lower now, only a bit more than half, than it was in 1981.

So even if you believed that voodoo economics worked under Reagan — which it didn’t — it would take a lot more voodoo, in fact around 4 times as much, for it to work now.

At the ball, the guests settled in to watch a night of cabaret, drag and opera over a three-course dinner.

Many were fabulously dressed, such as a man outfitted like Liberace, but Brian Day, 77, said he preferred to wear his “new trackie-daks,” or sweatpants. On his flannel shirt was pinned his Order of Australia medal, awarded for his services during the AIDS crisis and to the gay-rights movement. When the dancing started, he watched and shuffled his feet.

His body, he said, can get sore sometimes.

“I’ve been beaten up three times in my adult life, including once in my flat, my own place,” he said. “For us, the world is violent.”

While he currently lives without care, he understands why some people might return to the closet. The institutions have been “violent to us,” he said, and he still twinges when a police officer walks by.

“The closet was a safe place,” he said. “We haven’t got as much energy as we used to have. And we don’t want to get into brawls. We just want to live peaceful lives now, please.”

He is also concerned that services for the aged are not prepared to deal with the residual grief of older gay men, particularly the trauma of the AIDS epidemic.

Ms. Taylor said she thought that lesbians would always be “cautious” about coming out but that they needed to “be a little brave” and not “buy into the assumption that all nursing homes are unsafe.”

Ms. Taylor, a self-labeled “housewife and mother of two turned radical lesbian feminist,” said the ball was a nice celebration, but she voiced disappointment that much of the local lesbian-feminist history had been “lost.”

“People don’t even know or care enough to find out what we did,” she said.

After the dinner plates were cleared, Mr. Meecham addressed the crowd.

“To the L.G.B.T.I. elders who have led the way, who have shaped our community, who have fought for my right to wear these six-inch heels and gold nail polish: To you, I say thank you. I bow down to you.”

Anyone with a bit of sense – a group that, believe it or not, includes many economists – knows that people aren’t perfectly rational. But the assumption of hyperrationality still plays far too large a role in the field. And Thaler didn’t just document deviations from rationality, he showed that there are consistent, usable patterns in those deviations.

The question, however, is how much difference this should make to the practice of economics. And here you have a division between two camps. One says that imperfect rationality changes everything; the other that the assumption of rationality is still the best game out there, or at least sets a baseline from which departures must be justified at length.

Which camp is right? My thought: it depends on the field, for reasons not entirely clear to me. Let me talk about two fields I know reasonably well: macroeconomics, which I think I know pretty well, and finance, where I am much less well-informed in general but am pretty familiar with at least some international areas. What strikes me is that vaguely Thalerish reasoning is hugely important in one, in the other not so much.

Let me state two propositions derived from the proposition that people are perfectly rational:

1.Rational investors will build all available information into asset prices, so movements in these prices will be driven only by unanticipated events – that is, they’ll follow a random walk, with no patterns you can exploit to make money

2.Rational wage- and price-setters will take all available information into account when setting labor and goods prices, implying that demand shocks will have real effects only if they’re unanticipated – in particular, that monetary policy “works” only if it’s a surprise, and can’t play a stabilizing role

Now, (1) is basically efficient markets theory, which we know is wrong in detail – there are lots of anomalies. In international finance, for example, there is the well-known uncovered interest parity puzzle: differences in national interest rates should be unbiased predictors of future changes in exchange rates, but in fact turn out to have no predictive power at all. And anyone who believed that rationality of investors precluded the possibility of massive, obvious mispricing – say, of subprime-backed securities – has not had a happy decade.

Yet the broader proposition that asset price movements are unpredictable, that patterns are subtle, unstable, and hard to make money off of, seems to be right. On the whole, it seems to me that considering the implications of rational behavior has done more good than harm to the field of finance.

What about (2)? That’s where Robert Lucas came in: trying to rationalize the observed facts of business cycles with perfectly rational behavior in the face of imperfect information. This approach had a huge effect on the practice of macroeconomics, at least academic macroeconomics. But at this point we can safely say that it took the whole field down a rabbit hole. Wage- and price-setting does not reflect the best available information about future monetary policies; if it did, we’d be seeing wage contracts moving rapidly around as Kevin Warsh’s prospects on Predictit fluctuate. Everything we know suggests that there is a lot of nominal downward rigidity and a lot of money illusion in general.

And assertions that this might be true in practice, but can’t be true in theory, and must therefore be assumed away both in research and in policy have been hugely destructive.

So, rationality is a lie. But in some parts of economics it seems to be a bit of a noble lie, useful as a guide for thinking as long as you keep your tongue firmly in your cheek. In other parts, however, it’s just a disaster.

As I said, I can think of some reasons why. In financial markets, smart investors can, within limits, arbitrage against the irrationality of others. There’s no equivalent in labor and goods markets (or in consumer behavior!). But in general, the uneven applicability of behavioral thinking is surely – of course – a subject for future research.",Rationality and Rabbit Holes,https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/rationality-and-rabbit-holes/?module=BlogPost-ReadMore&version=Blog Main&action=Click&contentCollection=Opinion&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body#more-41680

Other research published in the journal Health Economics supports the pollution hypothesis. In their analysis of the Great Recession in Europe, José Tapia Granados of Drexel University and Edward Ionides of the University of Michigan found that a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a one percent lower mortality rate for respiratory illnesses, as well as reductions in mortality for cardiovascular disease and heart conditions, which are known to be sensitive to air pollution. In countries where the recession was more severe — the Baltic States, Spain, Greece and Slovenia — respiratory disease mortality fell 16 percent during 2007-2010, compared with just a 3.2 percent decline in the four years preceding the recession.

Other factors contribute to rising mortality during expansions. Occupational hazards and stress can directly harm health through work. Some studies find that alcohol and tobacco consumption increases during booms, too. Both are associated with higher death rates. Also, employed people drive more, increasing mortality from auto accidents.

During recessions, people without jobs may have more time to sleep and exercise and may eat more healthfully. One study found that higher unemployment is associated with lower rates of obesity, increased physical activity and a better diet. On the other hand, suicides increase during economic downturns.

Some recent work suggests that economic booms may have become less deadly and busts more so in recent years. This could be a result of less polluting production in modern, expanding economies, or of better medical care for those with conditions sensitive to pollution. Safer roads and cars, and less driving under the influence of alcohol and other substances, could also play a role.

“It’s also possible that opioids and other drugs may have made recessions more harmful to health than they used to be,” Mr. Cutler said.

Other analysis shows that although smaller economic booms increase mortality, larger ones decrease it. Japan’s economic booms in the 1960s and 1970s are associated with longer life spans there, for example. Serious and lengthy downturns — like the Great Depression — are associated with shorter lives, even as smaller ones lengthen them.

Wealthier nations are healthier nations, an effect seen across generations. People in their formative years — children and teenagers — are particularly sensitive to the economic environment. Conditions in utero can have lasting health and economic effects. Graduating from college during a recession can depress one’s earnings for a decade. People growing up during a strong economy are more likely to have access to resources and to develop skills and opportunities that promote health. These benefits can last a lifetime, increasing longevity.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Once again, we have a lesson in paying attention and reading clues or any notes associated with the puzzle carefully. There’s got to be a reason the Across clues are so ... terse.

You did see the note, right? It says “The one-word Across clues all have an unusual relationship with their answers.” No kidding. That unusual relationship is for you to deduce, and when you do, prepare for a fun “Aha!” moment.

Today’s puzzle isn’t all that difficult once you get the hang of the theme, and the crossings are relatively gentle. If you’ve been looking forward to training your brain to think of alternate meanings in clues, this one by Alex Eaton-Salners might be just the Thursday puzzle for you.

Today’s Theme

It took me a while to get the hang of this one, but once I did, the rest of the puzzle fell quickly.

The Across clues in Mr. Eaton-Salners’s puzzle are all homophones, one of two or more words pronounced alike but different in meaning or derivation or spelling. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to figure out which homophone of the Across clue (if there is more than one) is really the clue to be solved, and then you solve it.

If you are solving using mostly the Down clues, as I sometimes do, this will be incredibly easy (except, of course, for BISTRE at 47D. Where did that come from? Answer: France), and you might miss a lot of the fun with the Across clues.

Majorities of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents favor raising tax rates on both corporations (69%) and high incomes (57%), while Republicans are more divided.
But while 70% of liberal Democrats say tax rates on household incomes over $250,000 should be raised, fewer than half of conservative and moderate Democrats (46%) say the same.

About a quarter of U.S. adults (24%) say tax rates on corporations and large businesses should be lowered, while roughly twice as many (52%) say they should be raised. Another 21% say corporate tax rates should be kept the same as they are now.

There is less public support for raising taxes on higher-income households. However, as with tax rates on corporations, just 24% say taxes on incomes over $250,000 should be reduced; 43% say they should be raised, while 29% favor keeping them the same as they are currently, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Aug. 15-21 among 1,893 adults.

Majorities of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents favor raising tax rates on both corporations (69%) and high incomes (57%), while Republicans are more divided.

Among Republicans and Republican leaners, 41% say tax rates on corporations and large businesses should be lowered, while 32% say they should be raised (23% want them kept as they are). And only about a third of Republicans (36%) say tax rates on household incomes above $250,000 should be reduced; nearly as many (33%) say they should be kept as they are and 26% want them raised.

There is more support for tax cuts for corporations among conservative Republicans (48%) than among moderate and liberal Republicans (28%). Similarly, conservative Republicans (41%) are more likely than GOP moderates and liberals (28%) to favor reducing taxes on household incomes above $250,000.

Democrats, regardless of ideology, support higher tax rates on corporations. But while 70% of liberal Democrats say tax rates on household incomes over $250,000 should be raised, fewer than half of conservative and moderate Democrats (46%) say the same.

In views of taxes, Republicans are divided by income

Among the public overall, there are only modest income differences in views of what should be done with tax rates for corporations and high incomes. For example, a 41% plurality of those with family incomes of $100,000 or more say tax rates on high incomes should be raised; 29% say they should be kept the same as now, while 27% say they should be lowered. These are comparable to opinions among those with lower family incomes.

Among Republicans, however, there are sizable differences in views of taxes by income. More than half (55%) of Republicans and Republican leaners with family incomes of $100,000 or more favor cutting tax rates on corporations and large businesses, as do 46% of those with incomes between $75,000 and $99,999. Republicans with lower incomes are more divided.

The differences are also stark in Republicans’ views of tax rates on household incomes over $250,000. Half of Republicans (50%) with family incomes of $100,000 or more favor cutting tax rates on high incomes, compared with no more than about a third of Republicans in lower income categories.

Large majorities of Democrats, across income categories, say tax rates on taxes on corporations and large businesses should be increased. Yet lower-income Democrats are less likely than higher-income Democrats to say tax rates on high-income households should be raised (47% of those earning under $30,000 vs. 63% of those earning $30,000 or more).

As it happens, his analysis bears pretty much directly on Howard Gleckman’s critique of Kevin Hassett’s disgraceful performance at the Tax Policy Center.

As Setser notes, Puerto Rico used to be a major tax haven for manufacturing corporations. Much of this tax advantage has now ended, but its legacy is still visible in trade statistics. Specifically, PR runs, on paper, a huge trade surplus in pharmaceuticals – $30 billion a year, almost half the island’s GNP. Yes, “N” not “D” – very important in this case, as in Ireland.

But the pharma surplus is basically a phantom, driven by transfer pricing: pharma subsidiaries in Ireland charge themselves low prices on inputs they buy from their overseas subsidiaries, package them, then charge themselves high prices on the medicine they sell to, yes, their overseas subsidiaries. The result is that measured profits pop up in Puerto Rico – profits that are then paid out in investment income to non-PR residents. So this trade surplus does nothing for PR jobs or income.

What does this have to do with Hassett? Well, he told TPC – while insulting the institution and impugning its integrity – that transfer pricing driven by high nominal US corporate taxes is responsible for half the U.S. trade deficit, and that cutting these taxes would therefore be a big job creator. Never mind whether his estimate is right: even if it were, as Gleckman says, changing the transfer pricing would affect the accounting, but nothing real.

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote.","To those among us fortunate enough to have known old-timers who regaled us with tales of tabloid derring-do, New York was once a place of outrageous characters both in front of and behind the camera. Like players in “The Front Page,” hordes of cigar-chomping, fedora-wearing men plied their trade as a contact sport that was not above recreating scenes or putting a prop or two — like a lonesome looking doll — into everyday moments of tragedy.

In this cast of characters, Weegee was the Dante of New York’s nighttime demimonde. His photos, of swells and speakeasies, crime and crowds, or perps and play, are a singular record of New York City in the 1930s and ’40s. And just when you thought you had seen all of his work, a new book, “Extra! Weegee,” features vintage prints — many previously unseen — that captures Weegee’s singular point of view.

Photo

Daniel Blau, the book’s editor, admitted that he had “never really liked Weegee.” Obviously, he has since come to his senses, putting together an impressive volume that captures the many sides of New York as it approached World War II. The images were found in the archives of the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a syndicate founded at the turn of the last century by Edward Willis Scripps. The photos — which had been taken for the association’s Acme Newspictures service — passed through the hands of several owners, and were discovered in storage in 2012 by Ryan Adams.

These prints, Mr. Blau wrote in the book, changed his mind, as he saw pictures vastly different from those he had encountered 30 years earlier in some badly reproduced volume. And in a nod to the current daily torrent of images, these photos had an air of mystery, he said, and the mark of a master.

Weegee, born Ascher Fellig in 1899 in what is now Ukraine, lived a spartan existence down by the old New York Police headquarters in Lower Manhattan. That’s not surprising, since his realm was the streets. And the images he shot revealed not just a knowledge of people and places, but an appreciation for the ironic, odd or absurd.

A car dangles off the roadway that encircles Grand Central Terminal, with a “ONE WAY” arrow pointing at it, while two men stand under an awning, not oblivious, but not impressed, either. In another, an overturned vehicle rests on its side, with a sign reading “SLOW DOWN” hovering behind it like an unheeded warning.

Photo

Working crowds, you have images of a sweaty, packed throng in Coney Island and people celebrating the end of World War II. A jubilant sailor is surrounded by four women, flanking a sign he held declaring: “$2,000 In Bank Now I’m Looking for a Wife,” with “18-40” added at the bottom. An image of gawkers at a murder scene is a collage of mostly children’s faces, some goofy, arrayed around one woman whose grief is etched on her face.

He also found the lighter side, showing teenaged bobbysoxers jitterbugging in the aisles of a theater, dogs and cats, and even a gorilla. The book is divided into chapters that all start with “EXTRA!” and are devoted to topics like Crime, Cool, Friends, Characters and more.

Of course, the main character on this sidewalk stage is Weegee himself. Mr. Blau deftly connects the man and his era to how we and Hollywood — to which Weegee decamped in 1947 to try his hand at acting — now perceive it.

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote. “Weegee made these possible. He was a game changer — breaking new ground in both photography and photojournalism. Using a camera to tell a story as others used their pen or speech.”

Mr. Blau concludes that while Weegee may have left to be a movie actor, he had long been on that path.

“By then he had already made all the films he wanted,” he wrote. “All films made of a single frame. All telling a story in one take. Today I love these short films.”

Nash typically spends only a few days a month with the Warriors in his role as a player development consultant, but he’s as close to Durant as anyone in the organization. They were introduced late in Nash’s playing career by the Brooklyn Nets assistant Adam Harrington — one of Nash’s former teammates in Dallas — and started building a friendship long before Durant made the polarizing (and landscape-changing) decision to leave Oklahoma City for the Bay Area in July 2016.

Golden State’s coach, Steve Kerr, and Kerr’s assistant Bruce Fraser are two more of Nash’s closest friends, which helps feed into what Nash, a two-time most valuable player, describes as an “intimate understanding” of how the N.B.A.’s reigning champions and prohibitive 2018 title favorites operate, no matter how rarely he actually shares their company.

It is Nash’s contention, along these lines, that he shouldn’t be featured as part of Golden State’s ring and banner ceremony on Tuesday night before their season opener at home against the Houston Rockets. The Warriors’ general manager, Bob Myers, and their relentless vice president of communications, Raymond Ridder, made it clear to Nash, 43, in recent days that he would indeed be receiving the championship ring that eluded him as a player. So, naturally, they wanted him to join Durant, Stephen Curry and the rest of the squad for the televised festivities before tipoff.

As of Monday evening, Nash was holding firm on his determination to decline.

“This is their moment,” Nash said in a phone interview. “I couldn’t be happier to be part of a championship team and, more importantly, this championship culture.

“But when you’ve played 18 years in the N.B.A. and you win it all as a consultant, it doesn’t feel right to do anything but stay in the background. I don’t want to disrespect anything or upset anyone, but I don’t feel like it’s my place to be there.”

Kerr understands. He’s not surprised by Nash’s stance and isn’t trying to talk him out of it. He insists that Nash, whose later years in Phoenix became synonymous with playoff heartbreak, is far from haunted by his lack of championship jewelry, even if basketball stars, maybe more than anyone else in the team-sports realm, are judged almost exclusively on titles won.

“I don’t think Steve, for one second, looks back on his career and thinks, ‘Oh, my God, I didn’t win a ring,’ ” said Kerr, who won five in his playing days as an off-the-bench contributor in Chicago and San Antonio. “He has such great work-life balance. John Stockton’s the same. Charles Barkley’s the same. Is there any happier guy out there than Barkley? You can tell he’s having so much fun on TV.”

Kerr added: “I think fans and the media kind of overrate that whole ring thing. I would trade my career for Nash’s in a heartbeat. Would I want to be a role player on championship teams or be a superstar like Steve was and dominate games and seasons?”

In his post-playing life, Nash is a busy father of four in Los Angeles who also serves as the general manager for the men’s senior national team in his native Canada. What’s left of his time, away from family and business interests, is reserved for Durant or any other Warriors player who feels they can benefit from his counsel, as well as providing unfiltered feedback on the team to Kerr from what they like to call “the 30,000-foot view.”

“I actually like that he’s not here every day,” Kerr said. “Sometimes as a staff we fall into groupthink. Steve will usually tell me something I haven’t thought of.

“The other thing is that Steve can go to Kevin or Steph and talk to them as a former superstar who’s been in their shoes. I can’t do that. He was a two-time M.V.P. He’s literally lived their life. I didn’t live their life as a player; I lived Ian Clark’s life.”

Clark, now in New Orleans after two seasons as an underrated backcourt wild card in the Warriors’ rotation, will have to wait to collect his ring until late November, when the Pelicans visit Oracle Arena. About 25 members of the Golden State organization, including front-office staffers and coaches, are scheduled as part of Tuesday’s program. The first-time ring winners, as always, will likely generate the most curiosity over their reactions.

We’re talking JaVale McGee, Zaza Pachulia and David West. And, of course, Durant, whose decision to team up with three fellow All-Stars in Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson brought him mostly scorn — until he rose above every ace on both sides, including LeBron James, in Golden State’s five-game demolition of the Cleveland Cavaliers in the finals.

“He took a lot of heat for his decision, so it hasn’t always been easy, but he was at his best when it counted most and I think he’s handled it all on the court incredibly well,” Nash said of Durant. “He made a life choice to go somewhere else and put himself in a new environment and challenge himself. It’s been fantastic for him as a man and winning a championship on top of it was the fruit of that decision.”

Asked to project what the coming season holds for the 29-year-old Durant after his title breakthrough, Nash used a word more typically reserved these days for Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo or the Knicks’ Kristaps Porzingis.

“We talk about some of these young players being unicorns,” Nash said. “What Kevin can do at his size, with his athleticism, with his skill set, with his agility — he’s a true unicorn.”

An anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim party won the Austrian elections on Sunday, and its leader might form a government with a party founded by ex-Nazis.

So much for the hopes of spring that election results in the Netherlands and France hinted that the political tide in Europe had turned away from the far right. Last month, Alternative for Germany became the first far-right party to enter Germany’s Parliament since World War II, winning 13 percent of the vote and 94 parliamentary seats.

In Austria, the leader of the victorious People’s Party, Sebastian Kurz, 31, has tried to put a fresh, young face on his stodgy conservative party, changing its traditional black color to a trendy turquoise. But there’s nothing forward-looking about his platform, which taps into the fears that the 90,000 migrants Austria took in from 2015 to 2016 are siphoning away social benefits from hard-working Austrians, and that Muslims pose a cultural and security threat.

And according to preliminary results, the Freedom Party, founded by ex-Nazis in the 1950s, was in a race for second, with about 26 percent of the vote, to the People’s Party’s more than 31 percent. A coalition government of the two parties could be in the cards.

Like right-wing extremists elsewhere in Europe, the Freedom Party enjoys good relations with people close to President Trump. A delegation of Freedom Party leaders attended an election-night party in Trump Tower last November, and a party leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, posted on Facebook that he had met with Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. And, like other right-wing European parties, it has close ties with President Vladimir Putin of Russia.

This presents a challenge to Mr. Kurz. “We have to establish a new political style in this country,” he told supporters on Sunday, “we have to create a new culture.” But if this is what he really wants to achieve, he must reject the Freedom Party, its ugly past, its unholy relationships with the Kremlin and with the baser impulses of the Trump administration, and form — as he well can — his new government with either the center-left Social Democrats, which received nearly 27 percent of the vote, or in coalition with a group of smaller parties.","In Election, Austria’s Nazi Past Raises Its Head",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/opinion/austria-election-sebastian-kurz.html

Americans have long struggled with the question of whether this country should be more involved in world affairs, or less. The contest of ideas between internationalists and isolationists has been particularly fierce among Republicans, going all the way back to Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft and continuing on to the beginning of World War II.

But since the end of that war, whatever the differences in their priorities and points of emphasis, every president has chosen engagement rather than retreat, sometimes with surprising and positive outcomes. Richard Nixon forged relations with communist China; Ronald Reagan, having consigned the Soviet Union to “the ash heap of history,” went on to negotiate arms control treaties with Mikhail Gorbachev. Even those like Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama who argued in various ways for scaling back America’s commitments overseas insisted on a leadership role, if not the leadership role, in building an international system grounded in democratic and free-market principles.

There have been plenty of mistakes and unforeseen developments that have tested the United States and raised questions about the wisdom of its policies. But, on the whole, the world has benefited greatly from America’s guidance and its willingness to engage with allies at every step of the way. NATO, the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are all part of the architecture of global security and development that American presidents helped create.

President Trump is now taking a sledgehammer to that system. His argument, if that term can apply to such an inchoate position, is that America for too long has been “losing,” a situation he has set out to correct with nonnegotiable demands and gratuitous confrontations. He promises both to achieve more and to retrench. He promises to put “America first” while at the same time condemning it to a secondary role in global deliberations. It is a bizarre and contradictory policy: In seeking to liberate the United States from international obligations, and in waging war on multilateral institutions, he is not only destroying America’s reputation as a trusted ally but also ceding the future to the very same aggressive powers, especially the authoritarian regimes of China and Russia, that he purports to protect Americans from. Meanwhile, his running feuds with the free press, the courts and Congress are diminishing America’s standing as a bastion of constitutional liberties.

President Trump’s news conference with Mr. McConnell sent a very clear message to Mr. Bannon, at least according to Ms. Wright. The president has, for the time being, aligned himself with the Senate majority leader and focused, as a point of pride, on the nominations of conservative judges. Read more »

Jonathan Chait in New York Magazine:



“Bannon doesn’t have any way of targeting potential impeachment votes directly. But Republican senators who don’t want to purge McConnell or eliminate the filibuster are a pretty decent proxy.”

While Mr. Chait admits that it might be “a mistake to attribute any serious strategic planning” to Mr. Bannon, he nonetheless speculates about why the former White House adviser might be targeting Mr. McConnell. Perhaps, he writes, Mr. Bannon is focusing his efforts on senators willing to impeach the president. Perhaps, he also posits, the Republican Party is used to running on a cycle of purges, starting with Newt Gingrich’s stint as speaker in the 1990s. Read more »

Kerry Eleveld in Daily Kos:



“Both Trump and McConnell made sure to play down expectations, reminding reporters that it took Ronald Reagan ‘years’ to get tax reform done in 1986.”

The main point of Monday’s news conference, Ms. Eleveld argues, is to reassure people that reports of Mr. McConnell’s rocky relationship with the president were false. However, she writes, the alliance may be short-lived. Particularly if “the G.O.P. fails to deliver on taxes,” then “all bets are off” and the president will have no hesitation to “tear congressional Republicans limb from limb.” Read more »

Greg Sargent in The Washington Post:



“Trump allies and Republicans are so desperate to pass this tax plan that they’re also doubling down on another strange argument: If Republicans don’t get this plan passed, their majority in Congress is doomed — and with it, so is the Trump agenda.”

It is possible that the public friendliness between Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell is about the Republicans’ desperation to pass tax reform, suggests Mr. Sargent. He is wary of the narrative supplied by Mr. Bannon and more establishment figures like Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. “The only conceivable way for the G.O.P. to save itself from the ‘economic populist’ ferment among G.O.P. voters is to pass an enormous tax cut for the wealthy and corporations?” He writes. “Can someone explain why we are supposed to believe this?” Read more »

Finally, From the Center

Al Cross in The Kentucky Standard:



“The chances of Republicans losing their Senate majority, or McConnell being ousted, seem remote at this point. But we said likewise of Trump when he began running.”

Mr. Cross, writing for The Kentucky Standard in Mr. McConnell’s home state, argues that the tension with the president marks Mr. McConnell’s biggest challenge so far. He warns that even if Mr. McConnell achieves a legislative win and sees tax reform through, that may not be enough to save him in the primaries. “Bannon seems out to cash in on the Trump base, and McConnell’s critics smell blood,” Mr. Cross writes.

If you use a product long or often enough, you can become vulnerable to an allergic reaction.
But these “are not necessarily unlikely to cause a reaction and may not be very effective,” Dr. Xu said.
They evaporate quickly on the skin and do not leave a greasy feeling that many consumers dislike.
Ultimately, the team concluded, “patient adherence and willingness to use a moisturizer is more important than a specific formulation or vehicle.”Ideally, moisturizers are best applied on damp skin within minutes of bathing, after patting the skin dry, to lock in moisture.","One of the most frequent complaints about skin care products like moisturizers is their all-too-common ability to trigger an allergic reaction, resulting in itchy, red, inflamed skin.

Dr. Xu and colleagues recently evaluated 174 best-selling moisturizers of different types across a price range of 10 cents an ounce to $9.51 an ounce, with special attention to the presence of allergenic ingredients. Two professional groups, the North American Contact Dermatitis Group and the American Contact Dermatitis Society, maintain reasonably up-to-date lists of moisturizers and their allergenic potential.

Lotions were by far the most popular, accounting for 59 percent of moisturizers sold, followed by creams at 13 percent, oils at 12 percent, butters at 8 percent and ointments at 2 percent. Based on the North American group’s list, the team found that only 12 percent of the best-selling moisturizers were free of allergens. The three most common allergens were fragrances, parabens and tocopherol.

Even among products labeled “fragrance-free,” 45 percent had at least one fragrance-related ingredient, the team reported. Dr. Xu said that if a company uses an ingredient that is both a preservative and a fragrance, it can still claim the product to be “fragrance-free” if preservation is the ingredient’s primary purpose.

Also, a product labeled “fragrance-free” or “unscented” could contain a masking agent (a fragrance that counters a chemical odor), a cross-reactive chemical that acts like a fragrance, or a botanical ingredient that is an allergen, Dr. Xu said.

“Fragrance labeling in the United States is really a nightmare,” he remarked. “It’s hard for dermatologists to guide patients to products that are truly fragrance-free.”

Among the 15 products claiming to be hypoallergenic, 83 percent had at least one ingredient on the allergen list, and 24 products contained five or more such ingredients. Interestingly, products that lacked any allergenic ingredients, costing on average 83 cents an ounce, “were not statistically more expensive per ounce (median, 60 cents) than products with one or more allergens,” the team found.

Furthermore, as Dr. Jonathan I. Silverberg, who directs Northwestern’s Contact Dermatitis Clinic and Eczema Center, explained, “Much of the labeling of products as hypoallergenic is nonsense. If you use a product long or often enough, you can become vulnerable to an allergic reaction. It’s not that the product is mislabeled – it’s that you can become allergic to almost anything, especially if you have a predisposition.”

An initial mild allergic reaction of itching and redness can progress to a profound reaction of stinging, burning, swelling and pain, Dr. Silverberg said. “With each exposure, the reaction gets stronger,” he said. Thus, the wise consumer with an allergic tendency might consider switching periodically to a different product and should certainly stop using any moisturizer that seems to be setting off an untoward reaction.

The American Academy of Dermatology suggests that in choosing a moisturizer, consumers wishing to avoid common allergic sensitizers pick one that is free of additives, fragrances and perfumes, though the new study showed this is clearly a challenge, even for knowledgeable physicians.

Cost is no guarantee of safety or effectiveness, the new study showed. Products labeled “dermatologist-recommended” are more expensive, but Dr. Xu said “the label doesn’t mean anything – is it 100 dermatologists, 10 dermatologists or one dermatologist?” The most expensive moisturizer his team analyzed contained the most allergens – a total of eight on the North American group’s list.

Health-conscious consumers sometimes turn to products labeled “organic” or “all-natural” for moisturizing in hopes of avoiding synthetic chemicals. But these “are not necessarily unlikely to cause a reaction and may not be very effective,” Dr. Xu said.

Olive oil, for example, increases water evaporation from the skin, he said, adding that the oils likely to be most protective and free of allergens are sunflower oil, coconut oil and shea butter.

However, for most people, moisturizing lotions, which contain more water than creams or ointments, are effective and least expensive. They evaporate quickly on the skin and do not leave a greasy feeling that many consumers dislike.

Nonetheless, people with very dry skin might invest in a cream or ointment, the cost of which is reduced by the need to use less of the product. Creams contain more water than ointments and offer what the team called “a middle ground” for people who dislike the greasiness of ointments. Ultimately, the team concluded, “patient adherence and willingness to use a moisturizer is more important than a specific formulation or vehicle.”

Vicki Eastus, a puzzle solver in Brooklyn, put it this way: “The more hectic life is, the more calming I find filling in those little boxes.”

Search the internet for research on the impact of puzzle-solving on the brain, and you’ll find plenty of studies. But the results are mixed, and it’s not clear whether puzzle solving has any purely physiological benefits.

The psychological benefits, though, are not in question.

“When you do a puzzle, the mind becomes completely absorbed in the task at hand,” said Joanne Cohen-Katz, a psychologist in Allentown, Pa. “There is total focus on what is happening in the moment, which is the definition of mindfulness. And we know that mindfulness results in all sorts of positive changes in the brain.”

For one, solving a crossword can be a path to serenity in a world of uncertainty.

“I don’t think I have to sell you on the increased demand for this type of pastime in an increasingly worried world,” wrote Margaret Farrar, the first crossword editor of The Times, in a memo to Lester Markel, the Sunday editor, after the Pearl Harbor attack. “You can’t think of your troubles while solving a crossword.”

In recent interviews, New York Times crossword enthusiasts shared their emotional connections to the pastime and described the value they find in the exercise.

Harry Hassell, of Jackson Heights, Queens, remembered his mother working on crosswords. “Amid the chaos of the household, it allowed her a personal pleasure and a routine all her own,” he said. “It also allowed me to see her not just as a car-pooling, tennis-playing mother, but also as a clever, intelligent, word-loving woman.”

Such intergenerational connections, forged over black-and-white grids, can have long-term implications.

“I first started doing crosswords as a child while visiting my Grandma Pat,” said Neil Padrick Wilson, a claims analyst in Tacoma, Wash. “She would sit at the big dining room table, dipping toast in her coffee. I would dip toast in my hot chocolate and we would work through a puzzle together. It got me to think, it got me to learn and it got me to know her better.”

Puzzles became so important to Mr. Wilson that he began to create them, and a crossword he made recently ran in The Times.

While not all enthusiasts go on to construct puzzles, it’s not uncommon for an early habit to persist.

“Rituals are often key in bonding with others, particularly family rituals,” said Ray Bepko, a clinical psychologist in Clinton, N.Y. “Pastimes and hobbies are very much a part of this and impact our adult relationships.”

That seems to be at least one reason people continue or develop a solving habit in adulthood, Dr. Bepko said. “Accessing this deep emotional connection is a source of comfort and reassurance anytime, particularly in difficult moments.”

Of course, puzzles are games, and they’re meant to be fun — especially in the addictive “aha!” moments that many solvers describe.

“In show-business parlance, Donald Trump is a show runner,” said Al Cross, a longtime Kentucky political journalist who has known Mr. McConnell for more than 30 years.
In the months since, Mr. McConnell and his aides have watched Mr. Trump buck the Senate, both publicly and privately.
That candidate — Senator Luther Strange — lost the election to Roy S. Moore, a defeat that Mr. Trump took personally.","On Monday, Mr. Trump insisted that he has a “fantastic relationship” with Republican members of the Senate, and he praised Mr. McConnell’s ability to shepherd the Republican agenda over what he called the nearly complete obstruction of Democrats in the Senate. The president also said that he will try to talk Mr. Bannon out of at least some plans to field hard-right primary candidates to challenge virtually every Senate Republican seeking re-election next year.

“The relationship is very good. We are fighting for the same thing,” Mr. Trump said during wide-ranging comments to reporters that also touched on immigration, health care, the opioid crisis, Cuba, military deaths and other topics. “We are fighting for lower taxes, big tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts in the history of our nation.”

White House officials described Monday’s lunch with Mr. McConnell as largely focused on efforts to cut taxes, and they said it ended with both men engaged and relaxed — a remarkable feat for two politicians whose personal styles could not be more different.

Mr. Trump has eagerly conducted his insurgent presidency in the glare of the cameras, antagonizing friends and foes alike and boasting of accomplishments large and small. Mr. McConnell, the definition of the Washington establishment, has always been a tight-lipped, back-room negotiator.

“In show-business parlance, Donald Trump is a show runner,” said Al Cross, a longtime Kentucky political journalist who has known Mr. McConnell for more than 30 years. “He’s all about the show — it’s all about getting good ratings for Donald Trump — and McConnell has never been about the show. He’s all about business.”

Mr. Trump mentioned in an aside at the news conference that he would soon outline an economic development plan, though he confessed that he had yet to tell Mr. McConnell about it.

Despite pledges by both men that they share the same agenda, any good will that may have once existed dissolved after the Senate twice failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. After the first defeat in July, Mr. Trump tweeted in August: “Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn’t get it done.”

In another tweet in August, he said, “The only problem I have with Mitch McConnell is that, after hearing Repeal & Replace for 7 years, he failed!”

Privately, Mr. Trump has repeatedly denigrated Mr. McConnell, most recently unloading about the Senate Republican leader during a dinner this month with a group of about a dozen conservative movement leaders in the Blue Room of the White House. According to two people with knowledge of the president’s remarks, he called Mr. McConnell “a weak leader” and said that he remained befuddled at Mr. McConnell’s inability to wrangle the votes needed to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

For his part, aides to Mr. McConnell say that he has been deeply frustrated by Mr. Trump’s willingness to lash out, even as the Senate leader successfully guided the chamber to confirm Mr. Trump’s cabinet and judicial nominations, including the president’s choice of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.

Soon after Mr. Trump took office, Mr. McConnell told associates that the new president had no clear sense of where he stood on most core issues, and he predicted that steering Mr. Trump — and taking the lead on policy — would be relatively easy.

The two disagreed early on political strategy: Mr. McConnell wanted the president to nominate a Democratic senator in a conservative state for a cabinet post to help Republicans pick up a seat. Instead, Mr. Trump plucked Ryan Zinke, a Republican representative from Montana, for the Interior Department, ending Mr. McConnell’s hopes that Mr. Zinke, a popular former Navy SEAL, would challenge Montana’s Democratic senator, Jon Tester, in 2018.

In the months since, Mr. McConnell and his aides have watched Mr. Trump buck the Senate, both publicly and privately.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly hectored Mr. McConnell to scrap Senate rules that require most legislation to clear a 60-vote hurdle before final passage, a demand that the leader has resisted, in part, for fear of a return to Democratic control.

Mr. McConnell has also been taken aback by Mr. Bannon’s decision to start a political crusade against establishment Republicans in the Senate by recruiting candidates who could put at risk the party’s control. So far, Mr. Bannon has backed conservative challengers to Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Dean Heller of Nevada, and could formally back a challenger to Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi.

Mr. McConnell said he was focused on keeping the Senate in Republican hands.

“The way you do that is not complicated,” Mr. McConnell said. “You have to nominate people who can actually win because winners make policy and losers go home.” He added a few moments later, “Our operating approach will be to support our incumbents.”

Mr. Trump said that Mr. Bannon “has been a friend of mine for a long time” and that his former strategist was doing “what Steve thinks is the right thing.”

But with Mr. McConnell standing next to him, the president hinted that he would not entirely support Mr. Bannon’s efforts to throw out of office Republicans who Mr. Bannon does not think are sufficiently supportive of Mr. Trump’s agenda.

“Some of the people that he may be looking at, I’m going to see if we talk him out of that,” the president said.

One person close to Mr. McConnell said Mr. McConnell has been very careful in his public comments about Mr. Trump in part because he did not want to put his wife, Elaine L. Chao — who serves as Mr. Trump’s secretary of transportation — in an awkward position with her boss.

Other advisers to Mr. McConnell said the two men both recognize that Republicans’ fate in 2018 hinges on whether Congress can pass the tax cuts that Mr. Trump is seeking.

“I feel like they are both under so much pressure to deliver — that’s what causes tension, real or imagined,” said Scott Jennings, a former adviser to Mr. McConnell who remains close to the majority leader. “They need to be able to jointly take something back to the voters next year to sell. I think winning on a major policy initiative like tax reform would allow for a further expansion of their relationship on politics.”

That level of cooperation — which has been so vital to the success of past presidents — was in danger of completely unraveling before Monday’s lunch. Over the objections of some of his advisers, the president had grown increasingly unwilling to set aside his insurgent tendencies to make Washington-style deals with Mr. McConnell.

Mr. Trump’s contempt grew even stronger after he backed Mr. McConnell’s preferred candidate last month in a special election in Alabama. That candidate — Senator Luther Strange — lost the election to Roy S. Moore, a defeat that Mr. Trump took personally.

And Mr. McConnell’s closest allies became increasingly aggrieved at the president’s treatment of the leader, especially because they view Mr. McConnell’s refusal to hold hearings for President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee as critical to Mr. Trump’s election.

On Monday, both men sought to minimize the conflict between them in the interest of sending a signal of unity of purpose that could soothe the despair of allies who fear the feud imperils any hopes for the tax and budget legislation before the end of the year.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — When you’ve had a busy or a tough week — a week where it feels as if your hair is on fire — your best bet is to find a distraction. Ideally, this distraction should be good for you (or at least not terribly harmful) and should allow you to focus hard on it so that you can temporarily displace thoughts about what kindled that hair fire to begin with.

My own go-to distractions are running, reading, cooking and knitting. When I really need to distract myself and focus down, I enjoy British-style cryptic crosswords. I’m sure you have your own distractions.

My point is, once the hair fire is extinguished and the smoke settles, you deserve a reward for making it through. The Venn diagram of “distractions from hair fires” and “rewards” probably overlaps quite a bit, but in my opinion, sitting down on a Friday with a lovely beverage and a Patrick Berry themeless crossword is one of the best ways to end the week. I put that firmly in the rewards circle.

Mr. Berry can bring some fresh entries to his grids and bring back entries that have not been seen for a while. The middle section — BARBARA JORDAN, SOCIAL STUDIES and ACCOUNT HOLDER — is O.K. in terms of liveliness, but those are all debuts, so bonus points there. What I really liked was the openness of the center, which gave Mr. Berry room to cross those center entries with ROBERT ALTMAN, METEOR SHOWERS and SENATOR ELECT.

Let us for a moment consider the Stalin versus Hitler question simply as a contest between two human beings.
“A map of the world that does not include Utopia,” Wilde said, “is not worth even glancing at.” In fact the opposite is true.
Utopia means “not place,” it means “nowhere.” In the 20th century the effort to create the Marxist variant cost close to 100 million lives (a mid-estimate not including warfare).","Nowadays, of course, the “unknown” Lenin is unknown no longer — though as late as 1989 Mikhail Gorbachev was rereading the complete works of “Ilyich” (55 volumes in Russian) in search of some last-hour remedy, even as the U.S.S.R. was melting away all around him. Lenin bequeathed a fully functioning police state to Joseph Stalin ; thus the experiment, in its fulminant form, lasted from 1917 to 1953, by which time there were many millions of supernumerary deaths (and if Stalin hadn’t died in March of the latter year there would have been a second Jewish Holocaust by Christmastime). The verdict of history has at last been returned. But the jury — i.e., informed opinion in the First World — stayed out until the late 1970s. What took it so long?

Western intellectuals deserve their usual share of the obloquy. As one historian of Russia put it, it is to the intellectuals that we turn for “real prowess of wrong-headedness.” But it wasn’t just the pundits, the writers (H. G. Wells, G. B. Shaw) and the philosophers (J.P. Sartre, A. J. Ayer) who swallowed the Moscow line; so did historians, sociologists, politicians, and even businessmen. To its supporters the allure of the Communist Party was twofold. The secondary appeal was that it gave you the (not quite delusive) impression that you were playing your part in world events; the primary appeal was that the program looked wonderful on paper, and spoke to the optimism and idealism of many of the most generous hearts and minds.

It was vaguely understood that there had been some loss of life: the terror and famine under Lenin, the Civil War, forced collectivization (“Ten millions,” Stalin said to Churchill, holding up both palms, in the Kremlin in 1942), the burgeoning system of state slavery known as the gulag (created under Lenin), the Great Purge of 1937-38.All that could be set aside, for now, because (a) revolutions are always violent, and (b) the ends supposedly justify the means.

As for the first point, the French revolutionary terror lasted from June 1793 to July 1794, and claimed more than 16,000 victims, no more than a busy couple of weeks for the Bolsheviks (and imagine if Robespierre had kept at it until 1830). As for the second point, well, there is a counterproposition: Means shape ends, and tend to poison them. We all know, now, what we think of the Good Intentions Paving Company. Anyway, the means were all the Soviet citizen was ever going to get. Western doublethink and selective blindness on this question is a very rich field; the wisest and most stylish guide to it is “Reflections on a Ravaged Century” (2000), by Robert Conquest, to whom we will necessarily return.

So far as I know, the first writer to see it all with an illusionless eye was that highly privileged observer Vladimir Nabokov (born 1899), whose family fled Russia in 1919. Once established in America, he was befriended by Edmund Wilson, and they engaged in a celebrated correspondence from 1940 to 1971 (published as “Dear Bunny, Dear Volodya”). Not lastingly duped by Stalin, the author of “To the Finland Station” was lastingly duped by Lenin and Trotsky. The Nabokov-Wilson letters are therefore very lively. Nabokov’s definitive rebuke is dated Feb. 23, 1948. It concludes:

“Under the Soviets, from the very start, the only protection a dissenter could hope for was dependent on governmental whims, not laws. No parties except the one in power could exist. Your Alymovs [Sergei Alymov was a showcase hack poet] are specters bobbing in the wake of a foreign tourist. Bureaucracy … took over immediately. Public opinion disintegrated. The intelligentsia ceased to exist. Any changes that took place between November [1917] and now have been changes in the décor which more or less screens an unchanging black abyss of oppression and terror.”

The correspondence ended in 1971, but the friendship died five years earlier. Nabokov could forgive Wilson’s mawkish indulgence of the Bolsheviks — but not his hostile and ignorant review of “Eugene Onegin” (Nabokov’s famously eccentric translation of Pushkin’s epic). Wilson died in 1972, just after his stern revision of “To the Finland Station”: “I have also been charged with having given a much too amiable picture of Lenin. … One can see the point of Lenin’s being short with the temporizing and arguing Russians but one cannot be surprised that he gave offense and did not show himself so benevolent as I perhaps tend to make him.” As for Trotsky (who said, inter alia, “We must rid ourselves once and for all of the Quaker-Papist babble about the sanctity of human life”), “I have not found anything,” Wilson wrote, “which obliges me to make any rectifications.” So this, among much else, went unrectified: “It is as a hero of the faith in Reason that Trotsky must figure for us.”

By 1972 Wilson might have found time to read the three outstanding memoirs of the period: “I Chose Freedom,” by Viktor Kravchenko (1946), “Journey Into the Whirlwind,” by Eugenia Ginzburg (1967), and “Hope Against Hope,” by Nadezhda Mandelstam (1970). Kravchenko was an apparat high-up who defected immediately after the war; Ginzburg was a provincial don and journalist who was found guilty of Trotskyism; and Mandelstam was the wife, and then the widow, of the great poet Osip (1891-1938). Cumulatively, these books persuade you of a disconcerting truth: Compared with Stalin’s Russia, Hitler’s Germany was a terrestrial paradise — except for Communists and Jews (and, later, Gypsies and homosexuals).

Kravchenko, Ginzburg and Mandelstam show us a society from which the concept of trust had been completely excised — a society where the conversational meaning of the question “Do they write?” was “Do they write letters of denunciation to the secret police?” You couldn’t trust your parents; you couldn’t trust your children. In addition, everyone was terrified all the time, right up to and including Stalin, who feared assassination at every waking minute. When he flew to Tehran for the first Big Three summit, his plane was escorted by 27 fighters; when he entrained for Potsdam (the third and final summit), his bodyguards numbered 18,500. By contrast, ordinary Germans knew no panic until 1943, as the reckoning loomed, and as the cities were being bombed nightly, then daily, then daily as well as nightly.

The truth about Russia dawned in cloud and mist. The first consciousness-shifting book was Conquest’s “The Great Terror” (1968). Very soon the samizdat version was circulating in Russia; and freshly enlightened parents would wonder if their growing teenagers were “ready for Conquest” and the attendant shock. Conquest had time to add “The Nation Killers” and “Lenin,” but not long enough to add ”Kolyma: The Arctic Death Camps” (1976) — before the translation of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s “The Gulag Archipelago” was complete in its three volumes (1973-75). This was and is a visionary nonfiction epic written by an artist in the Russian Orthodox, old-regime tradition of Gogol, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy. Hereafter the great argument (like the original Marxist idea) had only a vampiric existence — technically dead, but still animate.

For a while anything that could be mistaken for “Red-baiting,” in the United Kingdom at least, was considered bad form, like kicking a man when he was down. About five years later there was a reaction, then an overreaction, then a judgment. Having gone from wondering whether Stalin was “better” than Churchill and Roosevelt, the commentariat was suddenly asking itself whether Stalin was better than Hitler; half a decade after that, the finding of “equivalence” at last gave way to “broad parity.” Equivalence marks the overreaction. Hitler and Stalin were not equivalent.

One of the few developments in recent years, apart from a further downgrading of Lenin and Trotsky, has been a morally slight but otherwise highly significant upgrading of Stalin. This was the result of two very substantial books by Simon Sebag Montefiore, “Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar” (2003) and “Young Stalin” (2007). Montefiore is innocent of ideology; he is an honest Stakhanovite of the archives, and was genuinely embarrassed and apologetic about “changing the picture,” as his mentor, Conquest, “anti-Sovietchik number one” (according to the Kremlin), was the first to acknowledge.

What Montefiore has done is give flesh to the “Red Tsar.” For decades Trotsky’s jealous dismissal — “the gray blur,” the faceless bureaucrat — was the utterly misleading orthodoxy. Stalin was never a gray blur. Let us for a moment consider the Stalin versus Hitler question simply as a contest between two human beings. Until 1917 Stalin was a czarist dissident, a brawler, a boozer, a singer, a charmer, a womanizer and a brilliant mimic; he was not only a published but an anthologized poet; and he was wholly dedicated to the fight for universal equality and justice. Compare him with Hitler, the dank, sexless, humorless, milk-drinking vegetarian invert, nursing dreams, in his Viennese flophouse, of Judaeocide and world domination. Once established as the autocrat, Hitler went back to reading nothing but trash ethnology and the westerns of Karl May, whereas Stalin went back to reading Dickens, Chekhov, Gogol, Hemingway, Zola, Balzac, Maupassant and Oscar Wilde. Stalin was an Earthling; Hitler climbed up from the infernal regions.

“A map of the world that does not include Utopia,” Wilde said, “is not worth even glancing at.” In fact the opposite is true. Utopia means “not place,” it means “nowhere.” In the 20th century the effort to create the Marxist variant cost close to 100 million lives (a mid-estimate not including warfare). Literary history, here, provides an unignorable hint. Every imagined Utopia, from Plato to the present day, helplessly becomes a Dystopia, almost certainly because the writers just couldn’t resist the urge to make the “place” sound halfway interesting. Otherwise the Perfect Society is perfectly inhuman and perfectly inane. What would you do all day in Utopia?

The Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow applauded the movement. “The democratization of the spread of information can finally move faster than a powerful media mogul’s attempts to bury it,” she said by email.

In recent days, the singer Bjork, the “Riverdale” actress Lili Reinhart and the “Inside Edition” correspondent Lisa Guerrero lodged new accusations against other men who work in entertainment.

The singer and actress Courtney Love accused the powerful Creative Artists Agency of punishing her after she raised questions about Mr. Weinstein’s behavior in 2005, and a recently unearthed video clip of Ms. Love making the charge has gone viral.

The model Cameron Russell started a thread on her Instagram account on misconduct by men in fashion. It has led to more than 50 models anonymously sharing their stories of harassment.

Kicked off by reports on the allegations against Mr. Weinstein, the outpouring came a little more than a year after The Washington Post published leaked excerpts from an “Access Hollywood” tape in which Donald J. Trump, then a candidate for president, boasted of groping women.

At issue now is whether or not Hollywood can continue its old way of doing business, with self-styled “outlaw” executives and auteurs getting away with sexual misconduct as lawyers and publicists protect them.

“I think it’s upsetting and devastating, all of the stories that have come out,” said Nina Jacobson, a film producer who was formerly the president of the Walt Disney Company’s Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group. “But I think the floodgates being opened is something that had to happen and that finally brings a subject to the surface that has sort of gone unchecked for countless years.”

Beginning with an article about the allegations against Mr. Weinstein that The New York Times published on Oct. 5, more than 30 accusers have stepped forward with charges of harassment, assault and even rape against the mogul. The police in New York and London have started criminal investigations. (Mr. Weinstein has denied engaging in nonconsensual sex.)

Fatima Goss Graves, president and chief executive of the National Women’s Law Center, said that, since the story broke, “we’ve gotten twice the volume of calls of people who have said they’ve experienced harassment.”

The reaction has also led some senior women in Hollywood to predict that their longtime calls for change may finally come to something.

“I don’t think this is going back to the status quo,” said Ms. Berman, the producer. “You’ll see that there will be improvement.”

The industry took a step toward that on Monday, when the Producers Guild of America moved to terminate Mr. Weinstein’s membership and issued a statement that seemed to catch up with the wave of disapproval sweeping social media.

“Sexual harassment of any type is completely unacceptable,” it said in part. “This is a systemic and pervasive problem requiring immediate industrywide action.”

On Saturday, the board of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences stripped Mr. Weinstein of his academy membership. The move drew ridicule from the HBO comedy host John Oliver, given that it did no such thing in the cases of Mr. Cosby and Roman Polanski, who, in 1977, pleaded guilty to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl and then fled the country.

“So congratulations, Hollywood,” Mr. Oliver said. “See you at the next Oscars, where — and this is true — Casey Affleck will be presenting Best Actress.”

The reference was cutting: Mr. Affleck, who won the best actor award at this year’s Oscars for “Manchester by the Sea,” had settled sexual harassment allegations made against him by two female producers in civil suits. He has denied the accusations.

Woody Allen served as the imperfect messenger for those cautioning against what he termed a “witch hunt.” His warning was in line with the thinking of some executives, who said they were wary of false accusations getting easy play on social media.

In breaking the news about the allegations, The Times and The New Yorker carefully corroborated women’s stories. Social media has no such checks and balances.

A spreadsheet listing men in the media business accused of sexist behaviors ranging from inappropriate flirting to rape surfaced last week and was circulated by email. The BuzzFeed writer Doree Shafrir weighed in on the list, writing of men who were said to be guilty of behaviors like leering: “Things do get complicated when you start lumping all this behavior together in a big anonymous spreadsheet of unsubstantiated allegations against dozens of named men.”

Ms. Jacobson, the film producer, said, “There’s an importance to a careful vetting and a careful reposting and not just a free-for-all.” She added that she was in favor of more information, not less, which is why, she said, the industry has to tackle the use of nondisclosure agreements.

“It clearly feels like we have to take the burden away from people to come forward,” she said. “They should not fear that, because you have an NDA, that you can’t speak up.”

Each successive case of a powerful man’s misdeeds bursting into the open helps to embolden the next round, the feminist Gloria Steinem said.

“When dealing with deep bias like racism and sexism, it usually takes more than one injustice — or even a few,” Ms. Steinem wrote in an email. “The Weinstein scandal would probably have been taken less seriously if Cosby, Ailes and others hadn’t come first and been within easy memory.”

Melinda McGillivray, who stepped forward last year to accuse Mr. Trump of groping her at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida in 2003, told BuzzFeed last week that Ms. Paltrow and Ms. Jolie had an impact her accusation did not because of their star power. (Mr. Trump has denied harassment accusations.)

Mr. Trump’s election had put some women here on guard against a return to male misbehavior that was more common 40 years ago. And one list circulating among ranking female executives in the industry has tracked a string of promotions of men to senior jobs — at Apple and AMC, Sony and Hulu, Fox and CBS — amid fear that progress for women has stalled since November.

“Most of the available senior management television jobs this year have gone to men,” said Katie O’Connell, a chief executive of Platform One Media, and formerly the chief executive of Gaumont Television. “While those men were all qualified, it does highlight diminished access for these highest-level positions for women in 2017.”

As part of the general reaction to the articles on Mr. Weinstein, the Hollywood & Highland shopping center removed from its 17-year-old “Road to Hollywood” public art exhibit a daybed that some have taken to represent the proverbial “casting couch” — the symbol of ritualized abuse that studio chiefs meted out in trading roles for sexual favors. It was removed because it had “attracted increased public attention and it has been threatened with damage,” a spokeswoman for the mall said.

The artist behind the installation, Erika Rothenberg, said in an interview that her work was not meant to invoke the casting couch. Referring to Mr. Weinstein’s case, she said she was “completely sympathetic to people who have feelings about this, who are angry about this.”

Nonetheless, she said she hoped the daybed would return. “I don’t think this piece is the problem,” Ms. Rothenberg said.",Harvey Weinstein’s Fall Opens the Floodgates in Hollywood,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/business/media/harvey-weinsteins-fall-opens-the-floodgates-in-hollywood.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

There’s an excerpt from a ponderous essay she wrote when she was 14, and a drawing of a cat she sketched at age 12. She exhumes two fictional outtakes from discarded novels, including one about a linguistics scholar that she wrote more than 20 years ago.

Ms. Tan, who has published seven novels, also reflects on her writing life, and describes how she cried the day her debut novel, “The Joy Luck Club,” was published — not out of happiness, but out of dread and fear of criticism.

Mary Karr, the poet and memoirist, said “Where the Past Begins” gave her new insight into Ms. Tan’s evolution as a writer, and compared it to “Speak, Memory,” Vladimir Nabokov’s memoir. “It’s a book about the development of a sensibility as much as it is about the family trauma that led her to need a place of beauty and disassociation,” said Ms. Karr, a friend of Ms. Tan’s. “She’s an interesting person, because she’s both tortured and happy.”

Most books come into being through a mysterious alchemy between writer and editor. ut Mr. Halpern, a published poet and the publisher at Ecco, has helped to shape the careers of novelists like Joyce Carol Oates, Richard Ford, Robert Stone, T.C. Boyle and Jorie Graham. But he’s never been so visible in one of his writer’s books.

In Ms. Tan’s memoir, Mr. Halpern becomes a central, recurring character. She dedicates “our book” to him. His notes appear as interjections in the introduction. Later in the book, a chapter titled “Letters to the Editor” consists of dozens of email exchanges between the two. He sends her a poem he wrote. She tells him about attending a screening of a Woody Allen movie. In most of their exchanges, Mr. Halpern plays the role of muse and cheerleader as Ms. Tan oscillates between earnest reflection on her work and crushing self-doubt. “I keep asking myself how the hell I wrote such a long and bloated book,” she writes about her last novel in one message to him. In another, after seeking Mr. Halpern’s opinion on a scene, she writes: “Never mind. I deleted it. It was bad.”

Mr. Halpern and Ms. Tan have a warm, teasing relationship, which is on display in their email messages and even more evident in person. They got together two months ago in Manhattan, where Ms. Tan and her husband of 43 years, Louis DeMattei, a retired tax attorney, have a loft in SoHo. Over a bottle of wine at a restaurant on Park Avenue South, they discussed how the memoir came together.

They disagreed about whether the original book was supposed to be a book of essays or a collection of their emails to one another, but they concurred on other points.

“I’m a very slow writer,” Ms. Tan said.

“She’s not lying,” Mr. Halpern said. “It’s not slow so much as, there are a lot of psychological road blocks. You like to turn in a perfect piece of prose, and that almost never happens. This book was also a little bit of an anathema in that it started out as one thing, and slowly morphed into something else, and we were very careful not to say what that was, because we had our ground rules.”

“You never asked for a memoir,” Ms. Tan said.

“I knew you would never do it,” Mr. Halpern replied. “If you had thought that it was going to be a memoir, you never would have written it.”

“The test is going to be the book,” he later continued “Do you think that you will ultimately regret writing this book?”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“You know, it’s not regret,” Ms. Tan said. “My reluctance is always casting something out there that will be in the public and will be subject to public interpretation. I want nothing of that. It’s like taking the mask off, taking your clothes off, and having people say, oh my God. It’s nonfiction, and people can make fun of the way you think or say, oh that was trivial.”

In a way, it’s surprising that it took Ms. Tan this long to write about herself. Her fiction, which often features Chinese mothers and daughters, is full of family lore and semi-autobiographical material. Her 1989 debut novel, “The Joy Luck Club,” which has sold nearly 6 million copies in the United States, is an intergenerational epic about Chinese mothers and daughters. Her second novel, “The Kitchen God’s Wife,” features a Chinese-American girl in California who learns about dark secrets from her mother’s past, and is modeled partly on her own family.

There’s no shortage of dramatic material from Ms. Tan’s past, and she could have easily mined her childhood to write a traditional account of her life. Born in California in 1952 to Chinese immigrants, she grew up in fear of her volatile mother. Ms. Tan’s late mother, Daisy, was depressed and unstable, and repeatedly threatened suicide. She once tried to throw herself out of the car when the family was driving on the highway. When Ms. Tan was 16, her mother brandished a meat cleaver and threatened to kill her.

When she was 14, Ms. Tan’s family was struck by a double tragedy: her older brother Peter developed a brain tumor and died at age 16. Then her father, an electrical engineer and Baptist minister, was diagnosed with a brain tumor, and died not long after Peter. Her mother believed the family was cursed.

Ms. Tan also catalogs some of the trials and misfortunes she’s faced as an adult: her feeling of “relief and sadness” when she had a miscarriage at 28, and her struggle with chronic Lyme disease, which she contracted in 1999. The disease spread to her brain, causing seizures that sparked bizarre but benign hallucinations, like a Renoir painting or a spinning odometer. When she started taking medication to control the seizures, it made her giddy, and she worried it would make her write maudlin fiction. (The sideeffects eventually abated).

In the process of researching the memoir, Ms. Tan discovered more family secrets. She found a photograph of her maternal grandmother, a concubine who died of a possibly intentional opium overdose, dressed as a courtesan. She found letters to her parents from immigration officials, warning that their student visas had expired and they were at risk of deportation.

Now that the book is about to be published, Ms. Tan is feeling apprehensive. She worries about family members who might think she’s sullied her grandmother’s memory, and is terrified of the critical response. She’s accustomed to having her fiction critiqued, but this feels much scarier, and more personal. “There’s so much in there that’s raw,” she said.

Ms. Tan plans to have her papers destroyed when she dies, including her letters and the many partial novels she abandoned, so “Where the Past Begins” may be the most complete and intimate record of her life that her fans and readers will get.

And it very likely wouldn’t exist, she admits, had it not been for the gentle and insistent prodding from her editor. “In many respects,” she said, “This is his book.”","Amy Tan, the Reluctant Memoirist",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/books/amy-tan-memoir.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Q. How do people die from diabetes?

A. People who have diabetes cannot regulate their blood sugar levels and if the disease isn’t tightly controlled, blood sugar can spike to abnormally high levels, a condition called hyperglycemia, or dip below normal, a condition called hypoglycemia. Both conditions are potentially life-threatening and can lead to coma and death if not promptly treated.

But complications resulting from the disease are a more common cause of death. Heart disease strikes people with diabetes at significantly higher rates than people without diabetes, “and we don’t fully know why,” said Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. People with diabetes develop heart disease at younger ages and are nearly twice as likely to die of heart attack or stroke as people who do not have diabetes.

People with Type 2 diabetes, which is the more common form of the disease, are more likely to have elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure and obesity, Dr. Gabbay said, all risk factors for cardiovascular disease. “The good news,” he said, “is that a lot of treatments, like those for lowering cholesterol, are even more effective at lowering risk in people with diabetes than in people without.” Some new classes of diabetes medications used for Type 2 diabetes have also been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk, he said.

People with Type 1 diabetes are also at increased risk for heart disease, though the reasons are less clear.

Both types of diabetes can also lead to other long-term complications, like kidney disease, that may result in premature death. Problems like vision loss, nerve damage and infections that may lead to amputations can increase the likelihood of injuries and accidents. Good disease management starting early in the disease process helps people avoid some of these complications, Dr. Gabbay said.

Small fires seemed to pop up everywhere. As I raced down narrow country roads to meet deadlines, I caught glimpses of smoldering embers on tree stumps a few feet away. I felt vulnerable while driving through tunnels of vegetation — it would be easy to be surrounded by fire and trapped.

Everything smelled of smoke: my clothes, my car, my bag, my fingers.

I feel enormously grateful to the dozens of people who took the time to articulate their grieving, some while standing in the rubble of their homes. The fires stripped away their privacy. Their kitchens, their exercise equipment, their hobbies — their lives — were in cinders at our feet.

I think back to meeting Lisa Layman, her azure eyes staring at the ashes of her home at Coffey Park in Santa Rosa. She was recovering from cancer and recently had a kidney removed. The night before, she had escaped with her Bible and a scrapbook of her son’s early years. That is all she had.

It is a reporter’s job to bring empathy to disasters like this. But I wondered how I could ever comprehend the magnitude of her loss.

To battle the scourge of wildfires this past week, planes and helicopters have dropped several millions of gallons of fire retardant ahead of the flames. Unlike water, retardant is not distributed directly onto a fire.

“It’s not actually intended to put the fire out,” said George Matousek, the product steward for Phos-Chek, which makes the retardant used by government agencies. “It’s intended to reduce the intensity of the flame so a firefighter with a shovel or hand tool doesn’t get burned up.”

The key ingredient in retardant is ammonium phosphate, which produces nonflammable carbon — think of a diamond or pencil lead — when it chemically reacts with plant cellulose, Mr. Matousek said.

Fire retardant is essentially high-quality fertilizer and is not considered dangerous for people or plants. But it can be toxic to fish, Mr. Matousek said, by causing underwater plant life to grow and choke the oxygen from the water. The United States Forest Service bans its use within 300 feet of a waterway unless human life or property is threatened.

“When you dump that type of nutrient load on a landscape, it’s going to change a lot of dynamics,” said Richard Halsey, director of the California Chaparral Institute, which seeks to preserve native shrubland habitats. “It does cause significant harm to aquatic organisms.”

Where fire retardant lands is also important for its efficacy. Because it needs to be applied in a continuous line, it is typically dyed red or pink.

In Ms. Bauman’s production, which mixes professional actors and college students, Rosalind (Helen Cespedes), the daughter of a banished duke and Celia (Liba Vaynberg), her cousin, still flee a French duchy for the Forest of Arden. But don’t expect a dewy pastoral. This forest is a refugee camp, a tumble of wooden pallets and cracked cinderblocks. Its inhabitants busy themselves filling plastic jugs at a water pump and checking a bulletin board in the hope that some new country has accepted them. The uses of adversity are not so sweet.

After the intermission, several actors in the ensemble step forward and briefly detail how they arrived in America. “When I got here as a little kid, I was so nervous, I could only eat Wonder Bread and drink water,” a young man says. “I feel blessed,” a young woman says. “I am here because of the sacrifices of my mom and my ancestors.”

These brief speeches are the most affecting in the show and their consequence hints at some of the project’s problems. In effect, “As You Like It” isn’t a great fit for the tale that Ms. Bauman wants to tell. The substance of the plot — the political machinations, the romantic entanglements — doesn’t seem to interest her. Neither does the verse. And the comedy is a non-starter.

What does interest her is the refugee setting, but aside from some inspired details — the character of Corin is now a bilking shopkeeper — this vision of the Forest of Arden is unproductively at odds with the play. Yes, Shakespeare’s Arden is a weird place — there are lions and snakes and wandering monks. But it’s not intended as a bleak or unwelcoming one. It’s a shelter from the world, not a further hurt.

Ms. Bauman has altered a few words in the play’s last scene so that instead of nearly everyone returning happily to court, only the nobility get visas. The adjustment comes too late to really resonate. Unlike the joyous “As You Like It” produced by Public Works this summer, “Arden/Everywhere” sticks staunchly to Shakespeare’s text even when the words and plots just weigh it down. If it had been more daring, the play might have found its own language to tell its own stories — the strange, eventful histories its own cast members supply.

Textual fidelity does not seem to have kept the authors of the highly adulterated “Desperate Measures” up nights. Unlike the Elevator Repair Service production playing downtown, almost nothing remains of the “Measure for Measure” text — not the names, not the setting, not even much in the way of moral argument. About the only thing “Desperate Measures” hangs onto is the premise behind a nun’s being asked to bed a tyrant in order to free her brother.

It’s sometime in the 1800s in the Arizona territory when fiery Johnny Blood (Conor Ryan) shoots a mustached creep, probably in self-defense, and is sentenced to be hanged. His sister, Susanna (Emma Degerstedt), is about to make her devotions. But the good-hearted sheriff (Peter Saide) convinces her to appeal for her brother’s life. Governor von Richterhenkenpflichtgetruber (Nick Wyman, and see what I mean about the bad jokes?) sees how cute she looks in a wimple and tries to grab her by the rosary.

Reluctant to agree to her own rape, Susanna and the sheriff inveigle Bella Rose (Lauren Molina), a stripper and occasional prostitute, to fluff the governor’s pillows instead. Gary Marachek’s nihilist preacher rounds out the winning cast.

The songs, with music by David Friedman and book and lyrics by Peter Kellogg, are enthusiastically ordinary, except for the opening number, “The Ballad of Johnny Blood,” which is worse. Not even Tex Ritter could have saved it. The book is in rhyming couplets. The gags are hoary. (And whore-y.) Under Bill Castellino’s direction, somehow it’s a delight.

Early on, Mr. Nikolaou said the project felt like psychoanalysis, a dive into his soul and the way he learned how to feel. He became fixated on the notion of a shared, repressed Balkan identity, one that he could unearth and restore to the collective memory.

“I wish to describe the Balkan soul,” he said. “Which seems to be dark and intractable, but it becomes simple, warm and human when it flames up.”

Mr. Nikolaou said he allowed the places to which he journeyed to choose him, not the other way around. In his travels, he’s been to nearly a dozen countries, exploring bustling capital cities as well as Roma ghettos and mountain villages.

“I made more than 20 trips trying not just to take photos, but to feel the Balkan reality,” he said. “To see those deep characteristics of the Balkan people that I believe are common all over the peninsula.”

The Balkan people were very hospitable, Mr. Nikolaou said, though he preferred to stay in the remote, rural areas. “There I met the most important people,” he said. “People totally free from the stress of our civilization. People with pain in their eyes but firstly, with big, big heart.”

He bore witness to funerals, celebrated at weddings and made intimate connections with those who opened their homes and lives to him. That vulnerability fostered a sense of human unity that Mr. Nikolaou hopes to showcase.

“The Balkans are a place where people look so different, but they are so alike in the way they face life,” he said. “And that must be what will lead us in the future. It may seem utopian, but deep inside me I believe that all people can live without borders. Even in the war-crushed Balkans, we can. It is enough to look at what it is that unites us. And what unites us is more important than what keeps us divided.”

One unsettling encounter is with Ed Kemper (Cameron Britton), a necrophiliac murderer (popularly known as “The Co-Ed Killer”) who eluded capture until he turned himself in. In the flesh, he’s a garrulous, polite creep who discusses the mechanics of his crimes as dispassionately as he does the fine points of a prison egg-salad sandwich.

The series is very much a boys’ club early on. Hannah Gross has some screen time as Ford’s girlfriend, Debbie Mitford, a grad student whose flirt-talk includes “What do you think about Durkheim’s labeling theory on deviancy?” Anna Torv will eventually co-star as a behavioral psychologist.

Still, the series’ linking of irrational times and unspeakable acts resonates with today’s stories of mass shootings and a widening gyre of chaos in the headlines. “Mindhunter” doesn’t aestheticize or elevate the likes of Kemper. But the notion that killers like him can be figured out and foiled is like placing a bet on reason over chaos.

It was founded by Chris Sheldrick, a bassoonist who went into the live music events business after suffering a hand injury. Sheldrick was frustrated by equipment going astray, suppliers coming to the wrong place and musicians failing to find the venue. (Note: That may not be the only reason bands show up late.) He started looking for a better way to communicate location.

What3words isn’t a navigation or route optimization program; it provides a precise, easy-to-convey location you can type or speak into navigation or route optimization software.

Sheldrick and his colleagues laid an imaginary 10-foot-by-10-foot grid over the entire planet, creating 57 trillion squares. Every location, of course, already has a unique address — its longitude and latitude. These are represented by a set of Global Positioning System coordinates, a string of numbers up to 18 digits long. (A GPS device is something else, a machine that uses the Global Positioning System to lead you to an address you input.) What3words simply assigns each grid square’s GPS coordinates a unique three-word address that’s easier to remember, type and say.

Using this map or a phone app, you can find the three-word address of any location, or the exact location of any three-word address, in 14 languages — including Mongolian, Arabic, Swahili, and Russian.

Every 10-foot-by-10-foot place on earth has three-word addresses in all 14 languages, with 14 more in the works. Each language is coded independently; the same place that’s collar.senda.aire in Spanish is expect.twitchy.hazelnuts in English, which is very much not a translation. In each language, what3words tries to put a lot of distance between similar addresses — monkey.fork.coconut is in Japan, while monkey.forks.coconut is in Switzerland, for example. That way if you make a mistake, you realize it right away.

So what good is this?

Well, precise addressing is incredibly useful for delivery companies. One big client (and investor) is Aramex, a Dubai-based global transport and delivery company. Aramex recently did a test in two well-addressed neighborhoods in Dubai. It gave 100 packages each to two teams. One set of drivers, who knew the areas, used normal addresses. The other team, unfamiliar with the neighborhoods, used what3words addresses. The what3words drivers took 42 percent less time, drove a 22 percent shorter route and needed no phone calls; the street-address drivers had to make 25 calls to ascertain locations.

What3words was faster because the locations were precise, but also because that precision allowed Aramex to use route optimization software, which tells the driver the best way to sequence a string of deliveries.

“A standard geocoder off-the-shelf is not accurate enough,” said Jack Levis, a senior director of engineering at UPS, which uses a route optimization system Levis designed, called Orion. “Your navigation system says you’ve arrived, but you’re not there,” he said. “For you and your personal vehicle, that inaccuracy is just an annoyance. But you feed it into an algorithm like Orion and it becomes a disaster.” If every driver adds one mile to his or her daily route, that costs UPS $50 million a year. And then there are the environmental costs of fuel and idling.

UPS uses package delivery history to pinpoint exactly where a driver should go. “We know the difference between where the driver parks and where the driver delivers,” he said. “We ended up creating the most accurate maps in the world.”

Levis said that its data efforts since 2004 have saved the company 185 million miles per year.

The value of what3words is that it can be used by anyone, anywhere: a driver in Los Angeles who wants to get a kidney to a recipient at the right hospital wing and entrance. Earthquake rescue teams in Mexico City. Attendees at Burning Man trying to find one another’s tents. Ground crews of the Red Cross in the Philippines telling headquarters exactly where help is needed. Mongolia’s postal service, which has trouble reaching slum dwellers and nomads. All those people do, in fact, use it. (Eight postal services are using or preparing to use what3words, including Nigeria’s.)

The system works only if people are aware of these addresses and know or can find the one marking their location. Also, the person or institution trying to reach a destination must be able to handle and make sense of a three-word address.

This will be slow work. But here’s why it could be worthwhile:

Dr. Coenie Louw leads South Africa’s Gateway Health Institute. Gateway works in informal settlements (sometimes known as slums), using technology to improve health, nutrition and human rights.

A recent challenge, Louw said, was devising a way to transport pregnant women to the hospital if labor became complicated. Louw said that 34,000 babies die each year in South Africa before they get to the hospital. One reason is that an ambulance can take hours to arrive. And one reason for that is that 1.7 million dwellings in South Africa have no addresses, according to Louw.

“I could never really locate them accurately,” he said. “People will say: ‘I live three doors away from the blue shebeen across from the green crèche.’” (That’s the blue pub and the green child-care center.) “Ambulances don’t find that. The idea is to give them a proper location so they can drive right there and there’s no issue.”

Last year, he read an article about what3words and contacted them to see if the system might be able to save some babies. (What3words charges businesses but provides its software free to humanitarian or disaster efforts.)

Gateway first chose an area to work in, an informal settlement in the city of Durban called KwaNdengezi. The organization hired 11 young people to go door to door, helping residents find their addresses and writing them down on cards to be posted on the door or just kept somewhere safe. The Gateway workers also registered the name, phone number and if the resident was willing, her official identification number, at every house.

When someone calls an ambulance, she gives the three-word address to the dispatcher, who tells it to the driver, who plugs it into a navigation app that accepts such addresses (Navmii is one) or uses what3words’s navigation app.

KwaNdengezi has 11,500 dwellings. Registering them is a slow process, as people must work in teams for safety. The group has almost reached 4,000, Louw said — enough to start testing whether ambulances get there faster with the three-word address system.

Precise addresses could improve health in other ways. Only about half of new mothers in South Africa are still taking their H.I.V. medicines correctly a year after delivery. This could change if community health workers were able to track down people who stop coming into the clinic. Gateway just won a prize from Viiv, a pharmaceutical company that specializes in H.I.V., for a project to help women take their meds more successfully — including using what3words to allow health workers to find them.

Gateway is also mapping liquor outlets, and mapping incidents of rape and other violence against women, and overlapping the two. The group plans to identify hot spots for violence, allowing the government to focus its scarce resources on the most dangerous places.

If these pilot projects work, Louw hopes to take the evidence to the South African and other African governments, to persuade them to recognize what3words addresses — an enormous administrative challenge.

“You can’t get a SIM card activated in South Africa without proof of residence,” Louw said. “Employers want to be able to find you. If you don’t have a proper address, you’re seen as not stable. Even to vote you have to have proof of residence. This is much more than just emergency services.”","Beyond the GPS, Mapping Every Place, Everywhere",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/opinion/global-mapping-address.html

So the story of a corporate tax cut is as follows: initially we’re at a point like A.
That’s pretty slow: it will take a dozen years to achieve even half the adjustment to the long run.","These days, what passes for policymaking in America manages to be simultaneously farcical and sinister, and the evil-clown aspects extend into the oddest places. Hence the tale of the Mnuchin Treasury’s incompetent attempt to suppress an internal analysis – to send it down the mnemory hole? — on the incidence of corporate taxation. This paper reached the inconvenient conclusion that most of the tax stays where it’s applied – with the owners of corporate capital – with only a small share falling indirectly on workers. In general, attempts to suppress stuff like this fail thanks to leaks. But in this case the paper has already been published in a peer-reviewed journal, so that even if the Treasury were locked down tight everyone could read it anyway.

But let’s leave that story on one side; I want to talk a bit about the actual economics of corporate tax incidence. This is not usually my subject, but there’s an intersection with international economics that seems relevant, and which – as far as I can tell, although I’m not as familiar as I should be with the literature – isn’t being appreciated in the current discussion. Specifically: while global capital markets should tend to equalize after-tax rates of return in the long run, the imperfect integration of goods markets implies that the long run is pretty darn long – not enough for us to be all dead, but long enough that return equalization should take decades.

Oh, and a warning: I try to tell readers when something is going to be wonkish and incomprehensible, but this is going to be really, really, really wonkish and incomprehensible, unless you spent years doing perfect-foresight dynamic models. Actually, maybe this is being written for Olivier Blanchard and three or four other people. Whatever.

Anyway, to set the stage: this whole literature goes back to Harberger, who envisaged a closed economy with a fixed stock of capital. He showed that in such an economy a tax on profits would fall on capital, basically because the supply of capital is inelastic.

The modern counterargument is that we now live in a world of internationally mobile capital; this means that for any individual country the supply of capital, far from being fixed, is highly elastic, because capital can move in or out. In fact, for a small economy facing perfect capital markets, the elasticity of capital supply is infinite. This means that the after-tax return on capital is fixed, so any changes in corporate tax rates must fall on other factors, i.e. labor.

Most analysis of tax incidence nonetheless allocates only a small fraction of the corporate tax to labor, for three reasons.

First, a lot of corporate profits aren’t a return to capital: they’re rents on monopoly power, brand value, technological advantages, and so on. Inflows of capital won’t compete those profits away, so the international capital market isn’t relevant to the incidence of taxes on those profits.

Second, America isn’t a small country. We are, instead, big enough to have a strong effect on worldwide rates of return.

Third, imperfect integration of both capital and goods markets is a reality. Rates of return probably aren’t equalized even in the long run; anyway, if a corporate tax cut brings in more capital, this will drive down the relative price of US products, which will limit the return on additional capital and hence keep workers from getting the full benefit of the tax cut.

I’m fine with all that. But I think it’s also important to ask exactly how inflows of capital that equalize rates of return are supposed to happen. Once you ask that question, you see that long run analysis may not be good enough for policy purposes.

Suppose the US were to cut corporate tax rates. This would initially raise the after-tax rate of return on capital, which would provide an incentive for foreign capital (or overseas assets of US firms) to move into the country. This would, in turn, drive the after-tax rate of return back down. How would it do this? By increasing the U.S. capital stock, reducing the marginal product of capital (and raising that of labor).

But how would the capital stock be increased? One does not simply walk into Mordor unbolt machines in other countries from the floor and roll them into America the next week. What we’re talking about is a process in which U.S. investment exceeds U.S. savings – that is, we run current account deficits – which increases our capital stock over time.

There’s an immediate irony here: the rhetoric calling for corporate tax cuts is all about “competitiveness”, yet the initial impact would be bigger trade deficits. But never mind that: think about what it takes to have a bigger trade deficit.

I’ve spent three decades pointing out the fallacy of the doctrine of immaculate transfer – the notion that international flows of capital translate directly into trade imbalances. Exporters and importers don’t know or care about S-I; they respond to signals from prices and costs. A capital inflow creates a trade deficit by driving up the real exchange rate, making your goods and services less competitive. And because markets for goods and services are still very imperfectly integrated – most of GDP isn’t tradable at all – it takes large signals, big moves in the real exchange rate, to cause significant changes in the current account balance.

So, a U.S. corporate tax cut should lead to a stronger dollar, which affects the current account deficit that is the counterpart of an inflow of capital. But how much stronger does the dollar get? The answer, familiar to international macroeconomists, is that the dollar rises above its long-run expected value, so that people expect it to decline in the future – and the extent of the rise is determined by how high the dollar has to go so that expected depreciation outweighs the rise in after-tax returns compared with other countries.

The point is that the knowledge that we’re looking at a one-time adjustment limits how high the dollar can go, which limits the size of the current account deficit, which limits the rate at which the U.S. capital stock can expand, which slows the process of return equalization. So the long run in which returns are equalized can be quite long indeed.

Suppose we assume rational expectations. (I know, I know – but for a benchmark it may be useful.) Then we can think of the adjustment process I’m describing as a little dynamic system in e, the exchange rate, and K, the capital stock. High K means a low rate of return compared with r*, the foreign rate of return, so e must be rising. High e means large trade deficits. The phase diagram looks like this:

Photo

where the saddle path is the unique path along which expectations about the future exchange rate are fulfilled. You can solve for that path by linearizing around a steady state; the solutions to that system have two roots, one negative, one positive, and the negative root tells you the rate of convergence along the saddle path.

At any given time the capital stock K is given; the exchange rate e jumps to put the system on the saddle path, and then it converges over time to the long run equilibrium.

So the story of a corporate tax cut is as follows: initially we’re at a point like A. Then the tax cut raises the long-run equilibrium capital stock. But it takes time to get there: first we get a currency appreciation, as shown by the jump from A to B, and then over time we converge to C.

The question is, how fast is this convergence? And we do have enough information to put in some stylized-fact numbers. I assume Cobb-Douglas production, with a capital share of 0.3. The capital-output ratio is about 3, implying an initial rate of return of 0.1. And the modelers at the Fed tell us that the impact of the exchange rate on net exports is about 0.15 – that is, a 10 percent rise in the dollar widens the trade deficit by about 1.5 percent of GDP.

When I plug these numbers in, assuming I’ve done the algebra right, I get a rate of convergence of .059 – that is, about 6 percent of the deviation from the long run eliminated each year. That’s pretty slow: it will take a dozen years to achieve even half the adjustment to the long run.

What this says to me is that openness to world capital markets makes a lot less difference to tax incidence than people seem to think in the short run, and even in the medium run. If you’re trying to assess the effects of tax policies over the next decade, a closed-economy analysis is probably closer to the truth than one that assumes instant equalization of returns across nations.",The Transfer Problem and Tax Incidence (Insanely Wonkish),https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/the-transfer-problem-and-tax-incidence-insanely-wonkish/?module=BlogPost-ReadMore&version=Blog Main&action=Click&contentCollection=Opinion&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body#more-41674

OAKLAND, Calif. — My neighbors are picking lemons from their tree in gas masks. My husband is overnighting us particulate masks to breathe through because Home Depot and all the Ace Hardware stores nearby are sold out, just like they sold out of every single fan in August, during the heat wave. It’s the latest version of California’s new normal: Add masks to your emergency kit, don’t breathe deeply and try to stay inside.

When I woke up one morning last week with a nose bleed and a wracking cough, I decided to give in and order that particulate mask, but first I consulted with friends. “Is N95 the same as P95?” Liat asked, as we huddled over my laptop. My nurse friend said to search for N95, but the old bepreparedcalifornia.ca.gov pdf that is circulating uses a “P,” and Keally says the one put out by the pre-Pruitt Environmental Protection Agency is better. Seth sends out more links about smaller-size masks to a group of neighborhood parents because the ones we bought don’t come in kid sizes.

It’s been seven days now of some of the Bay Area’s worst ever air quality, and most of the fires north of us in Sonoma, Napa and Mendocino counties are minimally contained, or not at all. The smog enveloping Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose and other cities is literal and figurative: There has been little clarity about how best to protect ourselves. The consensus seems to be that we’re not supposed to exercise, that we should refrain from driving as much as possible and that if we do venture outside we should be wearing the kind of heavy-duty face masks that keep out the smallest particulate matter, these gray ashes that are falling from the sky.

My friend Iris and I brainstorm about the most airtight public spaces, places like movie theaters or hospitals that can filter air for large numbers of people, so we can gather there. She researches which filters really work for smoke pollution, and texts a group of us to say her living room will have the filter on at all times for anyone who needs to come over.

Q. When the recent hurricanes hit, how did animals seek refuge?

A. For most wildlife, there is no early warning system when a big storm approaches. Most animals have no choice but to shelter in their usual environments.

Some birds, however, respond to weather signals like changes in barometric pressure and fly ahead of the storm. A few get caught in high winds and sent many miles away. A displaced roseate spoonbill, presumably from Florida, recently was observed in New Jersey.

The American Bird Conservancy reported that after hurricanes Irma and Maria reached the Caribbean, many flamingos left the islands of Inagua in the Bahamas ahead of the storm, returning in force afterward. But flamingos on the Cuban island of Cayo Coco died in the thousands.

Interviewing Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran in 1979, Fallaci wore a chador. When she criticized the condition of women in Iran, Khomeini said, “If you do not like Islamic dress you are not obliged to follow it. The chador is only for young and respectable women.”

Fallaci tore it from her head, saying, “That’s very kind of you, Imam. And since you said so, I’m going to take off this stupid, medieval rag right now.”

Fallaci was sometimes criticized for being a poseur and a narcissist. But there was no one like her and there still isn’t.

Fallaci is the subject of a short new biography, “Oriana Fallaci: The Journalist, the Agitator, the Legend,” by the journalist Cristina De Stefano. Written in Italian, it has been translated into English by Marina Harss.

It’s the first authorized biography we have of Fallaci, with access to new personal records, and welcome for that reason. It is not particularly well-written or thoughtful but it gets her story onto the page and, thanks to its subject, is never dull.

Fallaci was tiny (five feet one, 92 pounds) but had an explosive personality. She was called La Fallaci. She did not take well to editing. She did not suffer fools.

She was born in Florence, where her father was a cabinetmaker and part of the anti-fascist resistance during World War II. As a young girl she became a courier for the resistance, smuggling hand grenades inside heads of lettuce.

Her mother was intelligent but stunted; she was forced to cook and clean for her husband’s extended family. Fallaci said she became a journalist, then largely a man’s profession, in part to vindicate her mother.

She first made her name with prickly social and celebrity reporting. In the mid-1950s she began working for Italian newspapers from Hollywood. Her profiles were cutting, but she was popular out there. Her friends included Ingrid Bergman and Sean Connery. She went on a long road trip with Shirley MacLaine.

In 1963 and 1964 she spent extended periods at NASA. She wrote two books about the space program. She charmed the astronauts, drinking and dancing with them. On the second trip to the moon, astronaut Charles Conrad carried with him a photo of Oriana as a baby.

Fallaci rarely made things easy on herself. A Ford Foundation grant for her writing about NASA was withdrawn because she would not provide an itinerary. “I may find myself in Saint Louis and decide, on the spur of the moment,” she wrote the foundation, “to take a quick trip to Mexico City to buy a sombrero.”

She was messy. She loved airplanes but was afraid of elevators. She smoked nearly three packs of cigarettes a day and had bad teeth. She opened her mail months late if at all. She was a hypochondriac. She put sticky notes on her apartment doorbell that said “Go Away.”

She never married but had several long love affairs. When she fell in love, it was as if from a cliff. She was given to composing yards of bad poetry (“I miss you like I miss the rain”) which De Stefano quotes at cruel and numbing length.

Fallaci liked to say that she had a degree in solitude from the Sorbonne. She needed to be alone to get her work done.

“I have trouble writing when someone is hanging around,” she wrote. “Men know how to isolate themselves to write because their wives don’t dare disturb them. But it’s different for women because men are always interrupting them, asking for a kiss or a cup of coffee.”

Fallaci split the final decades of her life between Tuscany and New York City. She knew her career was coming to an end when, in the 1990s, it became increasingly difficult to get her Olivetti typewriter repaired.

In 1991 she learned she had a tumor in her breast. After it was removed she asked to see it. “You goddamned bastard, don’t even think about coming back,” she told the tumor. “Did you leave offspring inside of me? I’ll kill you! You won’t defeat me!”

She was in Manhattan on September 11, 2001. She had long been a critic of Islam and the attacks reignited her loathing. She published three late, controversial books about Islam and the West, beginning with “The Rage and the Pride” (2002).

She wrote in one of them that the “sons of Allah breed like rats.” The right increasingly embraced her; the left criticized her for inciting hatred.

Fallaci’s books of interviews still pop off the page. They have the drama of prize fights; they are entrancing. She unhorsed her subjects. For our scrutiny, she brought them down to eye level.","The Life of Oriana Fallaci, Guerrilla Journalist",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/books/review-oriana-fallaci-biography-cristina-de-stefano.html

By a large margin, the general public wants to see taxes on corporations and the wealthy go up, not down; even Republicans are divided, with only a modest margin in favor of cuts.

Yet tax cuts for the rich are the overriding objective of the modern G.O.P. They were the principal motivation for the attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, since that would also mean repealing the high-income taxes that pay for it; from Republicans’ point of view, depriving millions of health care was just a minor side benefit. And now tax cuts for the wealthy are pretty much the only thing left on the G.O.P.’s legislative agenda.

In fact, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the hope for tax cuts is the main thing keeping congressional Republicans in line behind Donald Trump. They know he’s unfit for office, and many worry about his mental stability. But they’ll back him as long as they think he might get those tax cuts through.

So what’s behind this priority? Follow the money. Big donors are furious at missing out on the $700 billion in tax cuts that were supposed to come out of Obamacare repeal. If they don’t get big bucks out of tax “reform,” they might close their pocketbooks for the 2018 midterm elections.

Beyond that, modern conservatism is a sort of ecosystem of media outlets, think tanks, lobbying outfits and more that offers many lucrative niches — so-called wingnut welfare — for the ideologically reliable. And that means being reliable to the interests of the wealthy.

But how can an administration that pretends to be populist, to stand up for ordinary (white) working people, sell such elitist policies?

The answer is a strategy based entirely on lies. And I mean entirely: The Trump administration and its allies are lying about every aspect of their tax plan.

I’m not talking about dubious interpretations of evidence or misleading presentation of the facts — the kind of thing the Bush administration used to specialize in. I’m talking about flat-out, easily refuted lies, like the claim that America has the world’s highest taxes (among rich countries, we have close to the lowest), or the claim that estate taxes are a huge burden on small business (almost no small businesses pay any estate tax).

Nor do I mean that there are just one or two big lies. There are many — so many I literally don’t have space to so much as list them in this column. In a long blog post this past weekend I tried to provide a systematic list; I came up with 10 major Republican lies about tax cuts, and I’m sure I missed a few.

So, politically, can they really get away with this? A lot depends on how the news media handles it. If an administration spokesperson declares that up is down, will news reports simply say “so-and-so says up is down, but Democrats disagree,” or will they also report that up is not, in fact, down? I wish I were confident about the answer to that question.

One thing we know for sure, however, is that a great majority of Republican politicians know perfectly well that their party is lying about its tax plan — and every even halfway competent economist aligned with the party definitely understands what’s going on.

What this means is that everyone who goes along with this plan, or even remains silent in the face of the campaign of mass dissimulation, is complicit — is in effect an accomplice to the most dishonest political selling job in American history.",The G.O.P.

In praising his record in naming judges to the federal bench, Mr. Trump was eager to assess quality and quantity. He claimed that “some scholars that have been studying it” have given “great reviews” to his nominees.

Saying his judicial appointments will “set records,” Mr. Trump called this “one of the big unsung things of this administration.”

Roy Moore

‘He ran a very strong race’

Mr. Trump has plans next week to meet with Roy Moore, who won the Republican primary race in Alabama to fill the Senate seat of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Mr. Trump had campaigned against Mr. Moore and headlined a rally for the incumbent who lost, Senator Luther Strange. But even before the vote in September, the president had begun to make tepid statements supporting Mr. Moore’s candidacy, which was backed by Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House strategist. Mr. Trump was said to have been upset with members of his staff who had encouraged him to back Mr. Strange.

“We’ll be talking to him, and I can report to you then, O.K.?” Mr. Trump said of the coming meeting with Mr. Moore. “We’re going to talk to him about a lot of different things.”

“He ran a very strong race,” Mr. Trump added.

The Russia Investigation

‘I’d like to see it end’

Mr. Trump was asked at one point whether he had plans to fire Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating ties between his presidential campaign and Russia.

“No,” Mr. Trump said flatly. “Not at all.”

Mr. Trump has dutifully followed the advice of his legal team, standing back from Mr. Mueller’s continuing inquiry, after speculation that the president would fire the special counsel.

“I’d like to see it end,” Mr. Trump said of the investigation. “They ought to get to the end of it, because I think the American public is sick of it.”

The president then returned to one of his oft-repeated talking points: that attention to possible collusion between his campaign and Russia is an “excuse” from Democrats searching for reasons Mrs. Clinton lost the election in November.

Sexual Assault Allegations

‘Totally fake news’

In response to reports that his campaign had been subpoenaed for documents relating to accusations of sexual assault, Mr. Trump called the allegations “totally fake news.”

“It’s fake,” he said. “It’s made-up stuff, and it’s disgraceful what happens.”

“But,” Mr. Trump added, “that happens in the world of politics.”

Disaster Relief

‘The Puerto Rico situation — it’s been outstanding’

Mr. Trump said he spoke to Gov. Jerry Brown Jr. of California about the devastating fires that ravaged Northern California last week. He also cited “an A-plus” approval rating that James Lee Witt, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency under President Bill Clinton, gave to the Trump administration’s response in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.

Mr. Trump spoke of “tremendous amounts of water” and “massive amounts of food” being distributed across Puerto Rico by FEMA workers and the military.

“You look at the governor of Puerto Rico — he himself has said we’ve done an outstanding job,” Mr. Trump said. “Most people have said we’ve done an outstanding job.”

The president has been harshly criticized for what many see as a lackluster and delayed response to the island’s devastation — especially after he lashed out at the mayor of San Juan, who questioned Mr. Trump’s leadership.

Mr. Trump has said that Puerto Rico’s poor infrastructure and debt was partly to blame for the crisis. He later reassured the island territory, where more than 80 percent of the population remains without power, that he would “always be with them.”

Hillary Clinton

‘Hillary, please run’

In the final moments of the news conference, Mr. Trump said he hoped Mrs. Clinton, his opponent in the 2016 presidential campaign, would run again in 2020. It was a repeat of a tweet he posted in the morning.

“Oh, I hope Hillary runs,” he said. “Hillary, please run again.”

Asked about Mrs. Clinton’s defense of N.F.L. players kneeling during the national anthem, the president blamed her argument — that the players were protesting the criminal justice system, not the American flag or national anthem — as a reason she lost the election.

“There’s plenty of time to do knees and there’s plenty of time to do lots of other things,” Mr. Trump said. “But when you take a knee — well, that’s why she lost the election. Honestly, it’s that thinking. That is the reason she lost the election.”

He also urged the N.F.L. to suspend players who knelt during the anthem for multiple games.

“The people of our country are very angry at the N.F.L. All you have to do is look at their ratings and look at their stadiums. You see empty seats where you never saw them before,” Mr. Trump said. “A lot of people are very angry at it. It is highly disrespectful. They shouldn’t do it.”","Hillary Clinton, the N.F.L., Roy Moore and Other Asides From the President",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-nfl-roy-moore-trump.html

We tend to think of them as simple organisms, “but there is a lot we don’t give fish credit for.”

Dr. Pittman likes working with fish, in part, because they are so obvious about their depression. He can reliably test the effectiveness of antidepressants with something called the “novel tank test.” A zebrafish gets dropped in a new tank. If after five minutes it is hanging out in the lower half, it’s depressed. If it’s swimming up top — its usual inclination when exploring a new environment — then it’s not.

The severity of the depression, he says, can be measured by quantity of time at the top vs. the bottom all of which seemed to confirm my suspicions about Bruce Lee.

All of this, of course, may sound fishy to any of the one in six people who has experienced clinical depression. How could a striped minnow relate to what you’ve been through? Is “depression” the right word?

While scientists have used animals, like mice, to study emotional problems for decades, the relevance of those models to human experience is sketchy at best.

There’s the obvious issue that “We cannot ask animals how they feel,” says Dr. Diego A. Pizzagalli, the director of the Center For Depression, Anxiety and Stress Research at Harvard Medical School. Though researchers may find parallels in serotonin and dopamine fluctuations, neither fish nor rat can “capture the entire spectrum of depression as we know it,” says Dr. Pizzagalli.

There is a heated debate in the fish research community about whether anxious or depressed is a more appropriate term.

But what has convinced Dr. Pittman, and others, over the past ten years is watching the way the zebrafish lose interest in just about everything: food, toys, exploration — just like clinically depressed people.

“You can tell,” said Culum Brown, a behavioral biologist at Macquarie University in Sydney who has published more than 100 papers on fish cognition. “Depressed people are withdrawn. The same is true of fish.”

The trigger for most domestic fish depression is likely lack of stimulation, said Victoria Braithwaite, a professor of fisheries and biology at Penn State University, who studies fish intelligence and fish preferences.

Study after study shows how fish are defying aquatic stereotypes: some fish use tools, others can recognize individual faces.

“One of the things we’re finding that fish are naturally curious and seek novel things out,” said Dr. Braithwaite. In other words, your goldfish is probably bored. To help ward off depression, she urges introducing new objects to the tank or switching up the location of items.

Dr. Brown agrees, pointing to an experiment he conducted, that showed that if you leave a fish in an enriched, physically complex environment — meaning lot of plants to nibble on and cages to swim through — it decreases stress and increases brain growth.

The problem with small tanks is not just the lack of space for exploration, said Dr. Brown, but also the water quality tends to be unstable and there may not be sufficient oxygen.

“A goldfish bowl for example is the worst possible situation,” he said.

If you own fish, you might want to consider where Dr. Brown keeps his: an extensively-landscaped six-foot tank. He recommends a “two foot tank with lots of plants and stuff” for your average betta.

The last time a guest posted Bruce Lee to Instagram he was looking good and lively. Perhaps that new green leaf in his bowl had provided the enrichment he craved.

But then, my heart sank. The internet produced photos of other Bruce Lees from the same hotel in several colors — red, blue and purplish.
