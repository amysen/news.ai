A Texas girl’s priceless reaction to a birthday gift sent by her deployed father went viral this week in a heartwarming video.

David Villegas of San Antonio, Texas, sent his daughter, Ellianna, a teddy bear dressed as a soldier for her birthday to remember him while he was away in Fort Jackson, SC, for training, KSAT reported.

The sister of Villegas’ wife, Vanessa, captured the moment Elianna opened up her present, which she described, “looked like daddy,” but the real surprise was the message.

Vanessa told Elianna to press on the bear’s paw for a special message.

The bear, with her father's voice, told Elianna: “Hey baby, daddy loves you and misses you so, so much and I can’t wait for you to be in my arms again. I love you very much.”

The little girl’s eyes went wide before squealing in delight, “Oh my God that’s daddy!”

Elianna gave her new soldier teddy bear a big hug.

The touching moment was posted on Twitter by Vanessa’s sister and immediately went viral Wednesday. As of Saturday, the video was retweeted more than 49,000 times and liked by more than 100,000 Twitter users.

“Everyone has been basically saying ‘Oh my gosh I’m crying’ (and) another girl was even like ‘I just put on my makeup and now it’s all over my face,'” Vanessa told KSAT.

“There’s also a lot of people on Twitter saying that they wish they had that from their dad or their mom and if they can hear their loved ones voice one more time, it would have made their entire world,” Vanessa said.

She said David was ordered to travel to South Carolina for basic training in August, leaving the family of three a few weeks to spend together before he left.

“We only had three weeks to spend with him before he had to leave and, of course, we have no contact with him. Basically he’s gone for nine weeks and a couple of days,” Vanessa said. “And after that, he has to go again for longer and so he won’t be back until April (2018).”

Vanessa said the deployment as hard on her daughter who has never been away from her father for this long.

“It really meant a lot to give that to her so she can play it every time she misses him and it helps her a lot,” she said. “It’s tough but in the end, I know it’ll be worth it.”

McCain, who did not name any one by name, called the movement ""unpatriotic"" while at the National Constitution Center Liberty Medal ceremony.

“To abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history,” he said.

“We often argued — sometimes passionately,” McCain said of himself and the former Vice President Joe Biden who was also in attendance. “But we believed in each other’s patriotism and the sincerity of each other’s convictions. We believed in the institution we were privileged to serve in.”

McCain joined the Navy in 1958 and rose to the rank of captain during his 22 years of service. In 1967, his plane was shot down over Hanoi, Vietnam, during a bombing mission, and he spent years in a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp. He recently revealed that he’s fighting brain cancer.

I had been invited there by my friend, Jwan Zhumbes, the Anglican bishop of Bukuru.
These are Christians whose churches, homes, families and friends have been bombed, burned, and persecuted for their faith in Jesus Christ.
Indeed, just last month, 20 Christians were slaughtered by the Fulani only a short drive from where I was staying.
That said, Nigerian Christians are remarkable.","“Don’t go. I swore I would never go back there,” came the voice of my friend Jay Smith on a trans-Atlantic Skype call. “I’ve been in over sixty countries. I’ve been all over Africa. I lived there, and I’ve never felt unsafe the way I did in that country. There is something especially terrifying about that place.”

“Good to know,” I replied. “Alan said that he goes there all the time. He said he even takes his children.”

Alan was a British politician who had recently attended one of my lectures in London. To hear him tell it, Nigeria was like Club Med.

“Alan?” Jay was incredulous. “Did Alan also tell you that when he goes he’s traveling with the British government and is accompanied by heavily armed guards? You? You’re going to have an entirely different experience.”

This was my introduction to Nigeria. Jay’s opinion was not acquired from Trip Advisor. He had been there more than once. During a 2008 visit, he spent nine hours hiding in the wheel well of a car while a mob went up and down a blocked highway looking for Westerners to victimize. Nigeria was, in his view, unique to the African experience. It wasn’t that terrible things didn’t happen in other countries; it was the sheer magnitude of them in Nigeria. Even other Africans are afraid of Nigeria and its well-earned terrifying reputation.

I had been invited there by my friend, Jwan Zhumbes, the Anglican bishop of Bukuru. Jwan and I had done our doctoral work together. He had asked me some years ago to come and teach the members of the diocese on issues of faith and culture. Jwan is shepherd to a diocese that has been attacked by the Boko Haram and another Islamic group, the Fulani Herdsmen Militia. He was, in my estimation, a great man doing a great work.

Now, months later, the mission was complete and it was time for me to leave the country. My time in Nigeria had been one of great blessing. The experience defies a simple description or even a simple narrative. These are Christians whose churches, homes, families and friends have been bombed, burned, and persecuted for their faith in Jesus Christ. Indeed, just last month, 20 Christians were slaughtered by the Fulani only a short drive from where I was staying. This is not uncommon. And yet, optimism prevails with them where self-pity and a spirit of defeat might rule a lesser people.

Packing-up for the journey ahead, I noticed Jwan at my door. He looked upset.

“What is wrong?” I asked.

“It took the housekeeper a long time to answer the door,” he began. “For a moment, I feared something had happened to my friend during the night.”

“I’m fine,” I reassured him. “I slept well.”

Jwan, ever pastoral, inspected the mosquito bite on my upper arm. “It does not look good. You are taking your malaria medication?”

“Yes.”

This interaction is a neat summary of the dangers of Nigeria—they come from both man and nature. To quote one Nigerian writer, “Unfortunately, much like traveling on our roads, life and living in Nigeria is becoming alarmingly cheap, brutal and unpredictable.”

And, oh, the roads. Jwan and his driver, Moses, were here to take me back to the airport. The journey from Abuja to Jos had been harrowing. Now it was time to do it again, but in reverse. A long, perilous drive, it is not for the faint of heart. Going to Nigeria? Gird your loins.

Moses, our driver for this real-life version of “The Fast and Furious,” is a sturdy, quiet fellow in his mid-twenties. Being a bit prone to car sickness on these brutal Nigerian roads, I had opted to drive or sit in the front passenger seat during much of my visit. But when we were about an hour out of Jos and at the front end of this long, lonely highway, Jwan ordered Moses to pull over.

“We must now move you to the backseat,” he explained to me. “We know not what evil lurks for you in the bush.”

This sentence, spoken as it was in Jwan’s James Earl Jones-like baritone and in an older, more sonorous British English that is extinct in all but former British colonies, had an ominous quality to it. I moved to the back where the windows were tinted. Jwan reclined my seat slightly to conceal me further. He then gave Moses a uniform like that of a traffic cop and told him to put it on.

“He will look official,” Jwan explained. “The checkpoint guards are less likely to give us trouble.”

Sketchy people are not unique to Nigeria. But Nigeria’s sketchy types tend to be heavily armed, and that makes things a bit dicey. Moses, who clearly liked wearing the uniform, pulled the Toyota Sequoia back onto the highway and took aim at the far horizon. The engine roared as he pushed the RPMs into the gauge’s red limits just as the driver had done when we traveled this road a week before. I have never seen a vehicle endure such punishment, and I have punished a lot of vehicles. It wasn’t merely that we were going fast, it was the duration of it, the pounding of the road, the constant hard braking and re-acceleration. Five and a half hours is a long time to push a vehicle, any vehicle, so hard. I feared the engine might blow or …

“What happens if we blow-out a tire?” I asked, already knowing the grim answer.

Jwan’s reply was typical of the man’s penchant for the eloquent understatement: “It would be a very bad day for us all.”

What Nigeria’s Christians accept as normal is, for the typical Westerner—or even the typical African—extraordinary. Some accept it because they don’t know anything different. Others accept it because they have no choice. Intelligent Travel, an independent group providing risk assessment to travelers, rates Nigeria a 97 percent travel risk. Meanwhile, life expectancy in Nigeria is a mere 53 years. Regardless, God’s grace was evident in how these good people managed it. They didn’t worry about those things they could not control. They simply did the best they could and left the rest to God’s sovereign mercy.

Moses, whose named seemed perfectly suited to his task on this day, led us on at high speed through the African desert.

“Get me to the Promised Land, Moses,” I joked. The young man smiled and, having connected his smartphone to the car stereo, he started his playlist that began with something unexpected.

“You like Rascal Flatts, Moses?” I asked. He grinned and nodded enthusiastically in the rearview mirror. I just shook my head, wondering if Rascal had ever imagined a scenario like this when he—or whoever—wrote this piece of music. I cannot now recall the song, but it surely must have been “Bless the Broken Road.”

“Now that you have been with us, my friend,” Jwan began, “how does the reality of our country compare to your expectations?”

“A South African friend of mine had told me that Nigerians were a huge people,” I said. “He has never been to Nigeria, but he told me that Nigerians were like the actor Michael Clarke Duncan, the big guy in “The Green Mile.” Huge. So, I had expected to feel like a grasshopper in their sight.”

At this, Jwan and Moses roared in delight.

“Instead you discovered that it is you who are of the tribe of Anak!” Jwan joked, completing my biblical reference. “We are more like Asians in size. You saw how you were bigger than almost everyone you met in this country! But that myth is part of the reputation of Nigeria in Africa. Nigeria and Nigerians are feared. Even by other Africans. Nigeria is like a scarecrow—you only need see it from afar to be afraid.”

That, I knew, was true. Later, without exception, when other Africans learned that I had been in Nigeria, they practically shivered. “Other Africans don’t go to Nigeria,” one man told me. The reasons, I heard, ranged from drug trafficking to witchcraft, but violence was the most common theme.

That said, Nigerian Christians are remarkable. Tough, charismatic, and possessed of an irrepressible joy, no one could ever conquer a people of such spirit. Not the Boko Haram, not the Fulani Herdsmen, not a corrupt government, and not the liberal policies that the West has tried to force upon them. The unrelenting pressure of violence, corruption, and pestilence have combined to produce a pearl of a people.

But the West has failed them. Abandoned them, really. Deep into the country, away from the operations of oil companies with their heavy security and guarded compounds, Westerners are almost non-existent.

Even so, the anti-Western narrative of colonialism was not reflected among the Nigerians I met. Quite the opposite. I don’t mean to suggest here that Nigerians think British colonialism was all peaches and cream. But these are a sophisticated, educated people who recognize that the British, particularly the Anglican Church, brought many good things to Nigeria—education, hospitals, infrastructure, and, most importantly, Jesus.

Speaking at a conference in London some years ago, Peter Akinola, the Archbishop of the Anglican Church in Nigeria, boldly chastised the West:

“You came to my country and told us there is only one God through whom we could be saved, Jesus Christ, and we believed you, and followed Him. You told us there is only one true book to know him, the Bible, and we believed you, and read it. Now you tell us Allah of Islam is also god, and that we can use the Qur’an to learn about God. You invited the Muslims here as guests, and they have now become your hosts. So now I come to your country to remind you of what you have forgotten.”

Wow. A friend of mine who was present at this occasion said it was one of the most powerful talks he has ever heard. You see, to Nigerian Christians, there are two manifestations of the West:

The good one that brings freedom, education, health care, and the eternal hope of Jesus Christ; and the bad one that uses every coercive power it possesses to bully the Third World into implementing permissive policies on abortion and homosexuality. Regarding the first, they want to know where that West went. Why did the Western church start something and not finish it? Regarding the second, to say that they deeply resent it is a gross understatement.

Prior to President Obama’s 2015 visit to Kenya, his administration attempted, unsuccessfully, to force that country (and other African countries) to change their laws on homosexuality. Many Africans deemed this both arrogant and unwanted, which, of course, it was. For them, this is America at its worst. More than once I was asked if American churches were all gay.

“What’s wrong with the American church?” One man asked me. “On television, we see so many people in church”—they all get TBN and DayStar on satellite—“but then we read they are all liberal [his word], approving of gay marriage. Don’t they believe in the Bible anymore?”

Watching CNN International and BBC as their news sources, it is no wonder that they think this. But they have a point. Western churches, Western Christians, have gone soft. This is because they have confused Christ’s command to love others with being likable, as if that were an attribute of God. (It isn’t.) As such, they endeavor to be, above all else, inoffensive and polite. This doctrinal malpractice has given us a generation of men who are what C.S. Lewis called “men without chests.”

And yet, in spite of ourselves, these Nigerians were a people who felt an affection for America. Jwan’s brother-in-law, a minister of agriculture, said: “Not only do we think that America should be first, we think America should lead the world.”

Given the narrative we hear in the United States, chiefly, that America is bad for the world and is hated by it, that statement surprised me. San Antonio Spurs coach Greg Popovich recently made headlines when he said that “America is an embarrassment to the world.”

That may be, but not for the reason Popovich might suppose. America’s current identity crisis is one that makes people like those that I met in Nigeria (and elsewhere in the Third World) nervous. If America isn’t leading the world, the alternatives look grim. Who now? Russia? China? They hope not.

“What is wrong with America?” is a frequent refrain.

To Popovich’s point, I was embarrassed to have to answer such questions, but for precisely the opposite reason than he meant. Most embarrassing of all was having to answer questions about the West’s position on Islam.

“Why do they think Islam is a religion of peace?” another man asked me. “These people have been killing us for decades and your media just ignores it. Now they are killing you and still your President Obama called it a peaceful religion. We see Western leaders saying that over and over again. Why?”

I could do little more than shrug and hold my palms up in resignation, because the question is all too valid. It isn’t bad enough that these people should be murdered by Muslim militants, but their suffering is compounded by the West’s willful blindness to a religion that bears a striking resemblance to a war strategy.

Yes, I was embarrassed by these manifestations of bad America. That I have written and spoken so forcefully about Islam is an encouragement to these persecuted Christians. Watching a clip from my debate on Al-Jazeera with atheist Daniel Dennett and Muslim cleric Zaid Shakir, Nigerian clergy practically cheered. You’d never get that reaction in the West, and that’s because Westerners prefer the false narrative that comforts them to the truth which frightens them.

Approaching a military checkpoint, Moses slowed the Toyota. The guard, spotting the uniform Moses was now wearing, saluted and waved us on. Moses, loving every second of the respect the uniform garnered for him, smiled to the point of laughter.

“Moses,” I warned, “you’ve got to act like you get saluted every day. To them, this must appear old hat for you. If you look like you’re enjoying it too much, they might get suspicious.”

He tried to suppress his smile, but it was no use. Much to my amusement, the salute thrilled him. Punching the accelerator, we were once again blazing a dusty path across the African plain.

The World Health Organization considers Nigeria the most dangerous country in the world to travel by road and, brother, I can tell you they are right. Each year, there are roughly 615 fatalities in Nigeria for every 100,000 vehicles. Compare that astonishing figure to the United States: 12. That’s before you factor in terrorism and the constant threat of roadside ambushes. Nigeria is leading the world in all the wrong categories.

A few hours later, we reached the international airport in Abuja. I thanked Moses for his driving and I thanked God for Toyota. My heavens, did that Sequoia take a beating, and so did I. My multitude of formerly broken bones ached from the journey.

Jwan walked with me into the terminal until airport security permitted him to go no farther. We embraced as friends and brothers in Christ. Watching him leave, I again thought of what a great man he is and the task before him.

Turning to making my way to the Lufthansa check-in counter, I realized that Phil Collins’s “Take Me Home” was playing over airport speakers. Fitting. I took one more fleeting glimpse at the figure of Nigeria’s great Christian bishop in the distance.

Minutes later, I was through passport control and in line to board the plane. I approached the woman checking tickets and passports.

“Your ticket, please.”

I handed it over. Raising her eyebrows, she said, “Double-o-seven?” She then examined me dramatically from head to toe and added flatly, “Yes, I think so.”

Having no idea what she was talking about, I looked at my ticket for clues:

“Seat Assignment: 007.”

I gave a wan smile and joined the enthusiastic rush that always possesses passengers boarding a plane. Elsewhere, such enthusiasm baffles me, but here it made sense. Since the Nigerian crisis began, not even Lufthansa remained in the country a moment longer than was necessary. The planes land, unload their passengers, refuel, reload, and leave in just over an hour with the same crew.

Seated next to a Nigerian woman from Lagos who now lives in Atlanta, she asked me where I had been.

“Jos.”

“In the north?” she exclaimed. “Did you drive that road?!”

“Yes.”

“From Abuja to Jos and back again?”

“Yes.”

“You had armed escorts, I suppose.”

“No.”

She looked at me wide-eyed over her reading glasses. “No? I would never do it! Lagos is, hmm, okay, but the north? Even I, a Nigerian, would never go there! What company lets you do that? I’ve not heard of it being done!”

“It was for ministry.”

“Ah!” she said with a knowing look. “Then the Lord was your protection!”

After a momentary pause, she added: “Still, I would never do it.”

Her delivery, perfectly timed, and with just the right intonation, was classic. I laughed out loud.

Soon thereafter I received a text from Jwan:

“You are an awesome and a wonderfully daring figure, my friend. You have proved to me that you are a beloved brother and a friend indeed…. May the Lord be with you. Anticipating the news of your safe arrival.”

As the plane lifted-off, I thought about my courageous Nigerian friends and the extraordinary work God is doing through them and all that we, in the West, could learn from them. With a full heart, I reclined my seat and minutes later I was sleeping more deeply than I had in a very long time.",The forgotten Christians of Nigeria -- faithful while enduring incredible persecution,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/15/forgotten-christians-nigeria-faithful-while-enduring-incredible-persecution.html

""This event underscores the turbulent times we're living in when senseless killings are taken to such an extreme level,"" radio music exec Mike McVay told Fox News. ""You'd find many in the country music community supportive of the right to bear arms.

""There will be a debate,"" added McVay, EVP of content and Programming for Cumulus Media and Westwood One. ""We'll know more in a couple of weeks how it's going to change.""

The debate has already started; Caleb Keefer, the guitarist for the Josh Abbott Band, who performed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival hours before the shooting occurred, spoke out in favor of gun control on Monday.

""I've been a proponent of the 2nd amendment my entire life,"" Keefer wrote on Twitter. ""Until the events of last night. I cannot express how wrong I was...We need gun control RIGHT. NOW.""

Echoing Keefer's statements is the daughter of country music legend Johnny Cash, Rosanne Cash, a longtime advocate for gun control, who penned an op-ed urging her fellow musicians to take action.

Cash said the National Rifle Association (NRA) ""funds domestic terrorism"" and country music artists associated with its group ""NRA Country"" must speak up against it.

""For the past few decades, the National Rifle Association has increasingly nurtured an alliance with country music artists and their fans. You can see it in 'N.R.A.

The indictment Monday includes capital murder and rape charges and will allow prosecutors to pursue a death-penalty case against Darwin Martinez-Torres, 22, of Sterling.

He is accused in the slaying of Nabra Hassanen of Reston, whose death back in June rattled northern Virginia's Muslim community.

Prior to Monday's indictment, much of the discussion surrounding the case revolved around whether prosecutors should bring hate-crime charges — as sought by some activists — or whether it was a case of road rage, as police have long maintained.

Monday's indictment, though, brought into focus another aspect of the case: While police had said previously they were investigating whether Hassanen had been sexually assaulted, the indictment is the first court document to spell out any kind of sex-crime charges against Martinez-Torres.

Virginia law allows prosecutors to pursue a death penalty case only under certain conditions. Those include murder in the commission of a rape and murder during an abduction with intent to defile.

The seven-count indictment handed up Monday actually includes four counts of capital murder, with occasionally graphic detail on the ways in which prosecutors believe the slaying qualifies for the death penalty.

The teenager's death continues to resonate. More than 200 supporters wearing ""Justice for Nabra"" T-shirts showed up at a preliminary hearing Friday for Martinez-Torres. The hearing was delayed when the girl's parents had to be restrained from charging at Martinez-Torres. Her mother threw a shoe at him.

Police have said Hassanen was out with a group of more than a dozen friends at about 3:40 a.m. June 18. The group was walking back to their mosque, the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, after eating at a McDonald's ahead of a daylong fast. Observant Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset during Ramadan, which this year coincided with the summer solstice. As a result, teens from the mosque sometimes went out for fast-food meals in the overnight hours between the late-night and early morning prayer services.

Police say Martinez-Torres encountered the group and got into a confrontation with some of the kids who had been in the roadway. Martinez-Torres chased after the group and caught Hassanen, at one point bludgeoning her with a baseball bat, police said.

In a search warrant affidavit, police say Martinez-Torres admitted killing Hassanen and that he led them to where he had dumped her body in a nearby pond.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights group, is representing the girl's family. The group's lawyer Gadeir Abbas said the family ""is focused on ensuring that there is justice for Nabra and that the murderer is held accountable for his crimes. This tragedy has affected the family, but also the Muslim community across the country, coming as it did during Ramadan when the kids were gathering at the mosque to socialize and for prayer.""

Some Muslim activists called for hate-crime charges. Police and prosecutors said they have seen no evidence of anti-Muslim bias that would warrant such a charge.

The public defender appointed to represent Martinez-Torres, Dawn Butorac, did not return a call Monday seeking comment.

Let's dive deeper into these stories ...

THE LEAD STORY: The Mandalay Bay security guard who was allegedly shot before the Las Vegas massacre and who disappeared last week moments before scheduled television interviews has not been seen since he went to a walk-in health clinic, his union president said ... Las Vegas police say the guard, Jesus Campos, was shot shortly before gunman Stephen Paddock killed 58 at a music festival on the Las Vegas Strip – though the sequence of events is still in dispute. Campos' shooting raised questions about police response and whether the hotel did enough to prevent the bloodshed. David Hickey of the Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America (SPFPA) said Campos had requested to go public and wanted to tell his side of the story in Oct. 1 shooting investigation.

However, Campos disappeared shortly before his scheduled TV interviews, including one with Fox News' Sean Hannity. Hickey said he had received a text Thursday night saying Campos was taken to a UMC Quick Care facility, though he did not specify where or whom the text came from. A spokesperson at the UMC Quick Care, which has eight locations throughout the Las Vegas area, told Fox News on Monday that they had ""heard nothing"" about Campos visiting them.

PROOF OF COMEY RUSH TO JUDGMENT ON CLINTON? The FBI released documents proving former FBI Director James Comey began drafting a letter regarding Hillary Clinton's email investigation months before conducting several key interviews, including speaking to Clinton herself ... The document release was titled ""Drafts of Director Comeys July 5, 2016 Statement Regarding Email Server Investigation Part 01 of 01."" The contents of the email were largely unclear as nearly all of it was redacted. The now-public records show the email titled “Midyear Exam --- UNCLASSIFIED” was sent by Comey on May 2, 2016, to Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, general counsel James Baker and chief of staff and senior counselor James Rybicki.

Why is this important? The existence of such an email draft raised questions about Comey's Senate testimony in June 2017 regarding his decision to go public with findings in the Clinton email investigation. At the time, he testified that he was inclined to publicly announce the results of the probe to “protect the credibility of the investigation,” after then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton had an unscheduled meeting on a tarmac in Arizona. He also said “other things” encouraged him to make the announcement, including Lynch allegedly urging him to refer to the email scandal as a “matter” and not an “investigation.” Calls for Comey to return to Capitol Hill for questioning have mounted, including from Sen. Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who said he would subpoena Comey if he had to.

NBC NEWS PRESIDENT FEELS HARVEY HEAT: NBC is tentatively standing by its embattled news president, Noah Oppenheim, who killed its long-gestating investigation into scandalized producer Harvey Weinstein ... Oppenheim, who has denied any ties to Weinstein and moonlights as a Hollywood screenwriter, is now facing allegations that he sat at the same table as Weinstein at a glamorous New York gala in April. He spiked the story that would have outed Weinstein as a serial sexual harasser months before The New York Times and The New Yorker published the stories that derailed the Hollywood mogul's career. Oppenheim's decision to pass on the exposé has resulted in an avalanche of accusations that the network has conflicts of interest and is lying about its reasons for killing the story.

BEHIND THE RESCUE OF A COUPLE FROM TERRORIST CAPTIVITY: Armed with information from U.S. intelligence, Pakistani soldiers staged a dramatic but successful rescue operation last week to free American Caitlan Coleman, 31, and her Canadian husband Joshua Boyle, 34, and their three young children after five years in Haqqani network captivity ... According to multiple U.S. sources with close connections to the operation, no prisoners were exchanged and ransom money was not paid. The Canadian government also asserted that their longstanding policy of not fulfilling ransom demands remains, and no money was dished out. Because of information obtained from drone footage, it is believed that the U.S. had long known of their location, as did Pakistan’s military arm ISI, and it was ""always a matter of someone pulling the trigger to go over and get them.""

So why did the rescue happen now? Sources say the U.S. government started floating rumors some time ago within the Pakistani high military that a rescue operation was highly probable. It is believed that while the couple was moved around a few times in the early stages of their captivity, their location had remained static for some time and Joint Special Operations Command were getting ready to embark on a rescue, when ultimately the Pakistanis — fearing another national upstaging and embarrassment akin to the bin Laden raid in 2011 which exposed them as harboring major terrorists — took the reign.

In the latest episode, “The Explosion Implosion,” they branch out of their comfort zones in order to accommodate family.

[SPOILER ALERT: The remainder of this article will discuss the latest episode of “The Big Bang Theory.”]

The episode opened with Howard and Bernadette learning that their unexpected second child will be a boy. This comes as unwelcome news to Howard, who didn’t have a strong father-figure growing up to emulate.

“I barely know how to be a man myself, now I have to teach one?” he says, prompting Sheldon to bring up the old adage about those that can’t do.

One thing that Howard did have growing up was model rockets, which he and Sheldon bond over. They agree to test launch an old rocket in the desert.

Meanwhile, Leonard ducks out of the apartment just in time to miss a call from his mother, Beverly. Rather than let it ring, Penny answers and finds herself in a deeply personal conversation with her mother-in-law about what she did the night before.

“I had Cuban food at the home of a man I shared unsatisfying intercourse,” she reveals.

Uncomfortable but undeterred, Penny engages in the conversation. This prompts Beverly to continue reaching out to her daughter-in-law after confessing that she doesn’t have a lot of female friends of her own. When he hears the news, Leonard is worried at first that his mother will manipulate her for a case study as she often did him. However, when Penny reveals that she’s been getting support from Beverly, he starts to wonder why she received more pride from her in a few days than he did all his life.

He seeks advice from Amy, but the two end up ranting at each other in tandem over separate issues. Finally, he calls up his mother, who is very disappointed to hear from him, to ask if she’s proud of him. That’s when she reveals that, out of all her children’s spouses, Penny is her favorite and that she’s proud of her son for marrying well. The conversation ends abruptly as Leonard begins to cry.

The episode ends with Sheldon and Howard, packing it in and driving back to the city after a failed rocket launch. Howard is down on himself because the one thing that he thought he could teach a boy to do failed. Not wanting him to drive in his emotional state, Sheldon asks if he can take the wheel. It turns out he got his driver’s license a few years ago when he was “on a license kick,” but he only barely passed.

Once behind the wheel with Howard, he admits that he’s having fun thanks to the patience and teaching of the dad-to-be.

“Your son is going to be lucky to have you as his father,” Sheldon tells him in earnest.

The episode ends with Sheldon getting carried away with the joy he feels behind the wheel and ultimately getting pulled over for going 112 mph.

Of course you know October is Breast Cancer Awareness month, and women have been sharing their personal stories related to breast cancer in a number of ways for years. As a social campaign, “No Bra Day”—which may have been started as early as 2011 by a plastic surgeon in Canada—encourages women to go braless and share their photos (with the hashtag #nobraday) to support the cause of breast cancer awareness. Over 82,000 women have complied by posting pics on Twitter and Instagram:

So why are women so angry, then? Because #NoBraDay, they argue, is more about sexualizing breasts than raising cancer awareness. And if you look through the hashtag feed, it's clear that many of those 82,000 photos are more about sexy poses than breast cancer.

This year, 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed — 63,410 of which will be fatal, according to the American Cancer Society. Those frustrated with #NoBraDay are arguing that what women need is not sexy, quasi-topless photos touting #nobraday with little explanation; they need real information explaining how to perform self-exams, what unexpected symptoms to be on the lookout for, and what they should do if they find a lump in their breast.

And not for nothing, #NoBraDay plays up the myth that wearing a bra contributes to an antiquated myth that wearing bras could lead to breast cancer. A 2014 study published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers Prevention solidly debunked that idea, finding that that bra-wearing habits, such as underwire or average hours worn, were not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.

As great and important as it is to support breast cancer, taking your bra off doesn't do a whole lot to help the cause (although it probably will result in some creepy DMs). Instead, spread information instead of selfies. Share survivor stories.

However, like most other areas of the body, this helpful organ can turn cancerous, and detecting the early signs of ovarian cancer is key.

According to the American Cancer Society, over 20,000 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year. A staggering 14,000 will die from it, a rate that reflects the usual timing of the cancer’s diagnosis.

Because ovarian cancer can disguise itself in its early stages as a simpler problem, many patients don’t catch it until the later stages. However, if caught early, patients have over a 90 percent treatment success rate, according to ACS.

10 SIGNS THAT YOUR SNIFFLES ARE A SINUS INFECTION

Dr. Edward Tanner, from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, told Fox News that “we used to call ovarian cancer the silent killer but it’s really not completely silent.”

Always check in with your doctor about any abnormal symptoms, especially if the symptoms resemble early ovarian cancer.

Early Signs

The biggest factor to consider with the early signs of this disease is whether your symptoms are an abrupt change from what you’re used to experiencing.

Also, your symptoms will usually persist for weeks or months and even recur regularly throughout the day. You should get medical evaluation if you have one of these early signs:

Bloating

Abdominal pain or pressure

Increased urination or urge to urinate

Abnormal fullness during or after eating

Difficulty eating

As you can see, these symptoms are vague and can suggest a variety of health problems. If you do have ovarian cancer, though, the symptoms will persist and get worse over time.

Other symptoms that suggest a worsening of the cancer include pain during sex, irregular periods, fatigue, indigestion/constipation, heartburn or back pain.

How Genes Play a Role

Several factors can affect your risk of getting ovarian cancer, and one major factor is genetic mutation. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two genes in the body that suppress tumor proteins and repair damage to DNA cells.

If these genes have mutated, the body won’t be able to repair DNA damage effectively, and cancer can grow more easily.

10 SIGNS THAT YOUR SNIFFLES ARE A SINUS INFECTION

According to the National Cancer Institute, women with one of these gene mutations have a nearly 40 percent chance of getting ovarian cancer, compared to 1 percent in the general population.

Thankfully, you can undergo genetic testing if you suspect that you have this gene mutation. For instance, you may choose to do so if you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer.

What happens if you do have the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation? First, you can choose to start cancer screenings early. Some experts recommend as early as 25 years old in these cases.

You can also make lifestyle changes to reduce your risk of disease, such as eating a healthy diet and exercising. For ovarian cancer specifically, you may lower your risk by taking birth control, having a pregnancy, breastfeeding or removing your ovaries.

In addition to this genetic mutation, other risk factors for ovarian cancer are

Family history

Personal history of breast, colon or uterine cancer

Use of fertility or hormone medications

Endometriosis

Personal history of no pregnancy

Getting Treatment

Because of the nature of ovarian cancer, you will likely need surgery as part of your treatment. In the early stages, your doctor may only recommend a minimal surgery with removal of one ovary and fallopian tube.

TODDLER'S KIDNEY TRANSPLANT STALLED AFTER DONOR DAD VIOLATES PROBATION, FAMILY CLAIMS

However, if the cancer has progressed, your doctor may recommend removal of both ovaries as well as some surrounding tissue. Next, the surgery is usually followed by chemotherapy treatment to kill the cancer cells.

Some doctors may recommend targeted therapy drugs which actually hone in on the cancer cells’ ability to divide and multiply. In some cases, you may also have hormone therapy as an option, in which the drugs taken inhibit the body from making estrogen.

The ovaries are an important part of your reproductive system. While they can get cancerous tumors, you will greatly enhance your treatment success by catching early signs of the ovarian cancer. Be sure to look into any abnormal signs, especially if the symptoms persist or worsen.

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote.

Wildfires have ravaged communities across California. The mass murder of 58 people and the wounding of nearly 500 in Las Vegas was a reminder of our vulnerability and the fragility of life. And terrible damage caused by Hurricanes Harvey in Texas, Irma in Florida and Maria in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands will take years to recover from.

Too many lives were lost. Too many lives will never be the same.

Despite all this – or, rather, because of it – it’s an encouraging time to be an American. In times of great crisis, we put aside our political disagreements and come together to help those in need.

People from around the world have contributed more than $15 million to help Las Vegas victims and their families. People have stood in long lines to donate blood.

Volunteers have been streaming southward from all over the country to help those impacted by the hurricanes. Donations of food and supplies continue to come in.

As Americans, our political beliefs are part of our identity – but they’re not the sum of who we are and what we value. Every American wants a better life for the next generation. We’re also compassionate, hopeful citizens who want to help our neighbors.

I’m proud to say the consumer technology industry, which I represent, has been leading the way in helping these regions get back on their feet, through drones, donations and innovative apps.

We can’t allow this moment of unity to escape us. Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, we are all Americans – and we all are human beings moved to action by the suffering we see.

The tragic events of recent weeks prove we can still come together as a nation. We can’t afford to wait for another tragedy to force us to reach consensus on other crises we face, from the debt ceiling to the changing American workforce.

Here are three ways we can come together on critical issues:

Resist the polarizing pundits and politicians. Our news media and political system emphasize conflict. But conflict has reached such a fever pitch that the system has actually stopped working. Every day, it seems the media and politicians are trying to persuade us the people on the other side are our worst enemy and their ascension to power must be stopped at all costs.

But it’s just not true. Republicans and Democrats are people, not stereotypes. And the narrative of polarization just doesn’t stack up with the numbers: According to data from Gallup, far more Americans identify as independent than as Republican or Democrat.

So don’t add to the noise. Don’t feed the negativity with personal attacks, in person or on social media. Our nation’s future relies on our ability to put differing personalities and parties aside and focus on finding common ground on important policy decisions.

Listen to people on the other side. To reach consensus, we must learn to listen to those who have different opinions. That means varying the sources we seek out on social media and on TV.

We should go out of our way to spend time with people who differ from us – not just in terms of political perspective, but also race or gender identity, and social and educational background. By asking thoughtful questions and carefully considering our responses – both in person and online – we can create a healthier, more nuanced way of carrying out our national conversation.

Take a break from politics and focus on other things that unite us. I’ve worked in consumer tech for most of my career – a field that, at least explicitly, has little to do with politics. But the reality is that consumer tech – like everything else, from entertainment to education to energy – has a political dimension and is affected by political decisions. I spend much of my time advocating for the tech industry and reacting to policies that impact it.

But that’s not all I am. I’m also a husband, a father and a fitness geek. And the same is true of each and every one of us – we might be a Trump voter, but we’re also an “Outlanders” junkie, a wine snob, a sister. We might be a Bernie supporter, but we’re also a coffee lover, a son and a sports fan. For every one thing that divides us, hundreds of other things can bring us together.

As Americans, our political beliefs are part of our identity – but they’re not the sum of who we are and what we value. Every American wants a better life for the next generation. We’re also compassionate, hopeful citizens who want to help our neighbors.

It may have taken a series of natural and man-made disasters to remind us of that. And there certainly will be some hard conversations about national policy in the coming weeks. But if we can continue to remember that we are all Americans and that we all can come together, we will have done our country a great good.","Unity in the face of tragedy is good practice for unity, period.

The Latest on developments in Syria as Islamic State militants make their last stand in the city of Raqqa (all times local):

2 p.m.

A commander with the U.S.-backed Syrian forces battling the Islamic State group says the city of Raqqa has been liberated from Islamic State militants and that combing operations are underway to clear the city of land mines and extremist sleeper cells.

Brig. Gen. Talal Sillo told The Associated Press on Tuesday that there are no longer clashes going on in the city.

Sillo says a formal declaration will follow befitting ""the fall of the capital of terrorism.""

Dozens of militants who refused to surrender had made their last stand in the city's stadium, which had become notorious as a prison and dungeons for the group.

It wasn't immediately clear if the IS militants are still holed up inside the stadium.

“Being pregnant is supposed to be one of the most amazing journeys you will ever embark on,” Brianna wrote. “You're creating a new life. You are experiencing unconditional love for someone you have not even met.”

Austin's accident happened when Brianna was nine months pregnant, she wrote. She said she went to bed, then woke up to a life-changing scene.

Brianna wrote that her husband had suffered a brain hemorrhage, and says doctors blamed it on “excessive energy drink consumption” after running a toxicology screen and ruling out drugs.

Austin was already in surgery by the time Brianna and family arrived at the hospital. It wasn’t until nearly five hours later that she got to see her husband, Brianna wrote.

“The next day was round two of brain surgery. Following this were strokes, seizures, swelling, and more things we weren't prepared for.

I was going to be by his side through all of it.""

Judging by photos shared of Austin and Brianna shared on Endres Photography's Facebook page — which, too, appear to have been removed from the site — doctors had removed part of Austin's skull during his surgeries.

Brianna, meanwhile, was still unsure of her husband's fate. ""After two weeks of living in a hospital, wondering if he would survive or be taken from us, [the family] made our way back home. The time had come for me to deliver our baby.”

Austin was still in the hospital when Brianna delivered their baby, but she said that “a beautiful miracle happened as I delivered our son. Austin woke up.”

“I went about a week without seeing him. I thought about him every day. I cried as I looked at my child who looked just like his daddy. When the baby was only a week old, I left him with my in-laws. I knew I needed to see Austin. I needed to tell him that our baby was here,” she said.

Everyone was on the field, the coin toss had just happened, and players had their helmets off, standing at attention, ready for the anthem to be played, Coach Jeff Devanney told Fox News.

But after a few moments of silence, it was announced the PA system failed – and there would be no playing of the Anthem.

Trinity senior fullback Ethan Suraci told Fox News the silence “felt like forever, honestly. You could hear the crowd and the opposing team” expressing disappointment over the announcement.

Suraci said he immediately started belting out the words to what he calls “America’s song,” which also happens to be his favorite song, and it seemed everyone joined in.

""There were almost three different waves of the Star-Spangled Banner going,” Coach Devanney said. Trinity’s team, Hamilton’s team, and the crowd each had started singing “almost like an echo,” but he added, “It all seemed to end on the same note.”

“That was awesome!” said sportscaster Jake Donnelly, who captured the video and posted it on YouTube. “Not many tenors on either end of the field here this afternoon, but a bunch of players that absolutely love America and love the National Anthem. That was one of the coolest things I have ever seen,” Donnelly added.

“It was a fantastic display of unity and patriotism and gave everyone in the crowd, the teams, and hopefully those who watch the video; chills of hope for a better United States of America and happiness to see us as a society beginning to heal - despite the polarization we see among the citizens and our politicians,” Suraci said.

The incident came a day before Vice President Mike Pence’s decision to leave Sunday’s NFL game between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers, when several 49er players kneeled during the Anthem.

Coach Devanney said he discussed the NFL protests with his team, calling it a “complicated issue.”

President Trump tweeted Wednesday it’s “about time” NFL’s Goodell called on players to stand for the national anthem.

The senior political science major, who identifies as a Republican and voted for Trump, agrees.

“I am in total agreement with one's constitutional right to protest. However, these players are protesting in an incorrect forum,” he said. “Why insult an entire country and all those who fell for her?”

The 5-foot-10-inch, 225-pound fullback always stands and proudly holds his hand over his heart, just as he did on Saturday.

No one really knows who first started singing the anthem in at the Jessee/Miller Field, but Coach Devanney told Fox News, “I wouldn’t be shocked if Ethan was the first one, given his love of the song.”

In fact, Suraci listens to the “Star-Spangled Banner” as sung by Celine Dion every day after he’s done with school.

During all that time, the agency apparently did not even have a complete list of all the “high-risk” positions where detailed background investigations of outside contractors were required.

In other instances, the agency had assigned lower levels of background scrutiny to the positions than the importance of the positions -- and their information access -- deserved, according to preliminary investigations carried out by the EPA’s Office of Inspector General (OIG).

Moreover, despite much-touted efforts to tighten up cybersecurity by the Obama administration, the situation was still bad when Obama left office. An internal EPA tally in February 2017 showed that nearly 70 percent of 484 contractors carrying a special, embedded-chip card allowing “elevated access” to EPA computer systems for their work still had not gotten their higher-level background checks.

For their part, the EPA’s auditors noted that in their initial small sampling, five of nine contractor personnel were given sensitive access to EPA computer systems without strict background checks, even though they had worked for the EPA “for over five years.”

The gaping holes in EPA’s information security defenses were severe enough that the agency’s OIG investigators, who began an audit of the contractor background checks last March, stopped work and issued a rare “management alert” to the Trump administration’s EPA officials about the situation, which was released to the public at the end of September.

(EPA officials were, in fact, briefed about the situation in late August.)

“Contractor personnel with potentially questionable backgrounds are accessing sensitive agency data and could cause harm,” the alert concluded. “These initial investigations and timely reviews serve as a cornerstone for the EPA to verify whether contractor personnel are trustworthy.”

The OIG document did not say so, but contractor positions have been exploited by some of the most damaging intruders in U.S. computer systems. One of them was Edward Snowden, who in 2013 stole and leaked information on some of the most sensitive global surveillance programs carried out by the National Security Agency. Snowden remains at large in Russia.

Along with the lack of appropriate background checks, the OIG alert noted:

· “a lack of oversight by responsible offices” within EPA to confirm that background investigations were initiated and eventually completed when contractors got the supposedly temporary right to special access cards,

· conflicting totals among various EPA offices about how many working contractors would require high-level background checks,

· a “breakdown in communication” among various EPA computer system managers and oversight personnel over verification of the checks,

· a refusal on the part of one EPA bureau to provide a listing of personnel who did not even have the special computer access cards but nonetheless still had privileged access to EPA computers. (EPA gave the number of such un-carded accounts to Fox News in response to a query: 58. Of those, the agency said, 27 were disabled and 31 in active use.)

Such alerts “say that this is something the agency should respond to right away,” says Jennifer Kaplan, the agency’s deputy assistant inspector general for congressional and public affairs, told Fox News.

The same point was underlined in the alert itself, which noted that “many of these underlying issues could have been uncovered had EPA management conducted oversight and a timely review of these processes.”

“This is definitely disturbing,” observes Theresa Payton, one of the country’s leading cybersecurity experts and the first female chief information officer at the White House during the Bush administration. “If you are giving network access to someone, it’s a no-brainer to give them a thorough background check.”

“There has never been more reason to target us than now, on the part of North Korea, China and Russia. And there has never been more delicate and fragile trust in our government than right now.”

""This is definitely disturbing."" - Theresa Payton, cybersecurity expert

The lack of background investigations and consequent security risks were known — at least in large detail — to top EPA officials of the Obama administration as far back as August, 2015. That was two months after the White House Office of Personnel Management announced that it had been hit by the biggest hack of federal government personal information in history, eventually affecting an estimated 21.5 million federal employees, with much of the information extracted from outside contractors.

The August 2015 milestone marked the end of the Obama administration’s much-touted “30-Day Cybersecurity Sprint,” an effort to get a grip on cybersecurity lapses across the federal government in the wake of the massive information threat.

The “sprint” supposedly included a drastic upgrade to the safeguards around all such “privileged” or high-access users through the use of embedded-chip user ID cards that supposedly guaranteed they had appropriate clearances for their degree of access to EPA networks

Yet at EPA, at least the vaunted new levels of security alert were apparently something of a mirage, at least where outside contractors were concerned.

By the end of 2016, by EPA’s own estimate, half of the agency’s “privileged users” of sensitive computer systems still did not have the appropriate background investigations needed for the ID cards they were using. The strict-scrutiny background checks had simply been “temporarily” waived.

Two months later, when EPA learned that nearly 70 percent of contractors still were without appropriate background checks, the situation clearly was not much better.

The auditor’s main recommendation was fairly stark: get the controls in place to get the background checks done, and effective oversight established, before the inspectors come back to complete their detailed review.

According to EPA, it is doing just that. An EPA spokesperson told Fox News that “93 percent” of all current privileged access card holders have gotten “the appropriate level of investigation.”

Since, according to the spokesperson, EPA now has 628 privileged card-holders, that means 44 people still haven’t gotten the appropriate background check.

In veiled language, the spokesperson indicated that these personnel were, in effect, grandfathered into the system, as holding cards prior to August 15, 2015, when the strict regime of background checks was installed but essentially never implemented.

Moreover, all the security check issues of oversight and other matters have now been closed, the spokesman declared. “EPA has processes in place to ensure that investigations get initiated before a [privileged user card] is issued.”

Maybe so, but according to OIG’s Kaplan, the EPA still hasn’t provided its watchdogs with a statement “on how it will proceed with the recommendations,” meaning its exact plans.","Obama EPA did not do background checks on hundreds of cyber-contractors, watchdog warns",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/17/obama-epa-did-not-do-background-checks-on-hundreds-cyber-contractors-watchdog-warns.html

Trump claimed that Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million people because “millions of people … voted illegally.”

“In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,” Trump, then the president-elect, tweeted.

Trump took to Twitter in the morning to deride Clinton for focusing on the wrong states during her campaign.

“Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote,” Trump said on Twitter. “Hillary focused on the wrong states!”

Dec. 23, 2016: 45 days since the election

By this point, Trump has mentioned Clinton in his tweets quite often — but he usually mocked the media and celebrities who he said tried to help the Democratic candidate. Yet, on Dec. 23, Trump quoted Russian President Vladimir Putin to express his opinion on his former opponent.

TRUMP, CLINTON SPAR ON TWITTER AFTER SHE RIPS RUSSIA FOR ELECTION LOSS

“Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: ‘In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity.’ So true!” Trump tweeted.

Clinton, along with other Trump critics, have alleged that the president and his campaign colluded with the Russians to win the election.

Trump later tweeted in February that the “Russian connection non-sense” is just “an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton’s losing campaign.”

March 29, 2017: 141 days since the election

In one of her first public speeches since she lost the election, Clinton excoriated the Trump administration without actually using Trump’s name. She also blasted the current administration and Congress for not including enough women.

Of Trump’s policies, Clinton encouraged the women gathered to “resist, insist, persist, enlist.”

“These are bad policies that will hurt people and take our country in the wrong direction,” she said.

“New polls out today are very good considering that much of the media is FAKE and almost always negative,” Trump tweeted. “Would still beat Hillary in popular vote.”

Trump then cited an ABC News/Washington Post poll that he said showed “almost all stand by their vote” for Trump.

May 2, 2017: 175 days since the election

Clinton took a jab at Trump during a television interview as he has continuously focused on his loss of the popular vote in the election.

“He should worry less about the election and me winning the popular vote and more about other things,” the former secretary of state said.

“Remember, I did win more than 3 million votes than my opponent,” Clinton added.

She also said that she’s now a “private citizen” and “part of the resistance.”

Focusing on national security threats from North Korea, Clinton criticized Trump for his penchant for tweeting.

""If [Trump] wants to tweet about me I'm happy to be the diversion because we've got lots of other things to worry about. And he should worry less about the election, and my winning the popular vote, than doing some other things that would be important to the country,"" Clinton said at an event in New York City.

May 24, 2017: 197 days since the election

Clinton harshly condemned Trump’s proposed budget plan after she was honored by the Children’s Health Fund, a nonprofit in New York City. Clinton said Republican lawmakers are “mounting an onslaught against the needs of children and people with disabilities, women and seniors.”

The budget “shows an unimaginable level of cruelty and lack of imagination and disdain for the struggles of millions of Americans, including millions of children,” she said. “None of us can remain silent in the face of these attacks.”

TRUMP BUDGET PLAN: HILLARY CLINTON BLAST BLUEPRINT

""It hurts the well-being of children,"" Clinton continued. ""It's time to send a resounding message that we will not stand for this attack on the most vulnerable among us.""

May 26, 2017: 199 days since the election

Clinton didn’t miss an opportunity to criticize the president while she delivered the commencement address at Wellesley College in Massachusetts.

“When people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,” Clinton said. “That is not hyperbole; it is what authoritarian regimes throughout history have done … They attempt to control reality.”

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel responded to Clinton’s address by stating her remarks were “a stark reminder why [she] lost in 2016.”

May 31, 2017: 204 days since the election

After Clinton placed the blame of her presidential loss on a variety of reasons — misogyny, Facebook and the Democratic National Committee, to name a few — Trump took to Twitter to mock his former opponent.

“Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & the DNC,” Trump tweeted, using his favorite campaign trail nickname for Clinton.

Clinton fired back less than an hour later, mocking Trump for an erroneous but viral tweet he sent earlier in the day.

“People in covfefe houses shouldn’t throw covfefe,” she said.

This time, Trump’s son also got in on the Twitter war.

“What house is he in again??? That’s what I thought. You’re trying too hard,” Donald Trump Jr. tweeted Wednesday night.

The president’s tweet received more than 23,000 retweets; Clinton’s received more than 236,000.

As Trump came under fire for allowing his daughter, Ivanka, to sit in his place during a meeting at the G-20 summit, the president attempted to turn the tables on Clinton’s own daughter.

In a tweet Monday morning, Trump alleged that if Clinton would have let daughter Chelsea Clinton sit in for her, the media would have heralded the decision.

“If Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her mother, as her mother gave our country away, the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!” Trump tweeted.

Chelsea Clinton got in on the feud and responded on social media.

“Good morning Mr. President. It would never have occurred to my mother or my father to ask me. Were you giving our country away? Hoping not,” she tweeted.

July 12: 247 days since the election

Trump took to Twitter to rail on the alleged double standards for Democrats.

“Why aren’t the same standards placed on the Democrats,” Trump tweeted. “Look what Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with. Disgraceful!”

July 16: 250 days since the election

As Trump’s son is criticized for meeting with a Russian lawyer who was supposed to have damaging information about Clinton during the presidential campaign, Trump defended his son on social media – while still criticizing his former opponent.

“Hillary Clinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?” Trump tweeted.

Former CNN commentator and interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile admitted in March 2017 to sharing debate questions with the Clinton campaign ahead of the primary town hall event.

July 22: 256 days since the election

Trump asked – on Twitter – why a special counsel or the attorney general isn’t investigating more alleged crimes committed by former FBI Director James Comey and Clinton.

In his tweet, Trump referenced the emails deleted from Clinton’s private server she used during her tenure as secretary of state.

In an additional tweet, Trump again compared his son’s publishing of emails pertaining to a meeting with a Russian lawyer to Clinton’s own handling of her email server.

July 24: 258 days since the election

Trump addressed approximately 40,000 people in West Virginia for the annual Boy Scout Jamboree – and couldn’t resist taking a few jabs at Clinton.

He told the crowd that the reason he won Michigan was because he “worked hard there” unlike Clinton.

“You know, my opponent didn’t work hard there because she was told … she was going to win Michigan,” Trump said.

Trump also repeated his questions about the investigation into possible collusion between the Russian government and his campaign during the presidential election continues.

“So why aren’t the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered [Attorney General Jeff Sessions], looking into Crooked Hillarys [sic] crimes & Russia relations?” Trump tweeted.

July 25: 259 days since the election

Trump called into question the ability of his attorney general and the current F.B.I. chief to investigate Clinton.

The president said Sessions “has taken a very weak position” on her alleged crimes – this time linking her to the Democratic National Committee’s server as well.

As for acting F.B.I. director Andrew McCabe, Trump said that his wife, who ran for a Virginia state senate seat last year, received $700,000 in campaign donations from Clinton.

However, McCabe’s wife actually received $467,500 from a political action committee controlled by Gov. Terry McAuliffe, D-Va., a longtime Clinton ally. Dr. Jill McCabe received an additional $292,500 from another Democratic PAC.

Sept. 13: 309 days since the election

As Clinton begins her book tour across the country, promoting her memoir of the 2016 election called “What Happened,” Trump dusted off his favorite campaign nickname for her.

“Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing [sic]) but herself for her election loss. She lost the debates and lost her direction!” Trump tweeted late Wednesday night.

“The ‘deplorables’ came back to haunt Hillary. They expressed their feelings loud and clear,” he continued in another tweet. “She spent big money but, in the end, had no game!”

While Clinton apologized for calling Trump supporters “deplorable” at the time, she defended her use of the word earlier this month in an interview with CBS News.

“I thought Trump was behaving in a deplorable manner. I thought a lot of his appeals to voters were deplorable. I thought his behavior, as we saw on the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape was deplorable. And there were a large number of people who didn’t care. It did not matter to them,” Clinton said.

As the Daily Caller noted, the “deplorable” comment came almost a full month before the “Access Hollywood” tape was released.

Sept. 21: 317 days since the election

When Trump met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, the Asian leader used a word that Trump liked to hear – “deplorable.” Using a translator, Moon said North Korea’s actions were “deplorable.”

“I am very happy that you used the word 'deplorable,'” Trump said. “I was very interested in that word.”

“It’s been a very lucky word for me and many millions of people,” he continued.

In Clinton’s new memoir about the presidential election, she blamed her use of the word “deplorables” to describe Trump’s supporters, in part, for her loss.

Oct. 13: 339 days since the election

While discussing the multiple sexual assault and harassment allegations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, Clinton said there is “someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office.”

Clinton was most likely referring to the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape from 2005 that caught Trump bragging that he could “do anything” to a woman because of his status. He also said he could grab “them by the p----.”

Trump later apologized for his comments and chalked them up to “locker room talk.”

“The really sad part of the campaign was how this horrific tape, what he said about women in the past, what he said about women during the campaign, was discounted by a lot of voters,” Clinton told BBC.

Oct. 16: 342 days since the election

Trump said he would like to see ""Crooked Hillary Clinton"" challenge him in 2020.

""I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020,"" Trump tweeted. ""My answer was: 'I hope so!'""

Trump later reiterated his desire for Clinton to run during a press briefing in the Rose Garden. He also criticized her for sticking up for professional athletes who have chosen to kneel during the national anthem in a sign of protest.

A patent application recently filed by the automaker, and first uncovered by TTAC.com, depicts a storage system for SUVs that uses detachable bins that slip into the sidewalls of a cargo bay.

The application says they solve the problem of having a place to keep small items from rolling around in the vehicle, while also providing lockable compartments for them.

There’s one located on each side of the vehicle. They can slide out like drawers or be completely removed. Built-in wheels and haldes allow them to be transported like rolling luggage, and the two can be attached to make them easier to transport.

A smartphone dock is incorporated in the design that feeds into a passive sound-amplifying channel, and they’re potentially insulated and waterproof, so they can keep food warm or be filled with ice instead.

There’s no telling when or if the feature will show up in a Ford product, if ever, or even any guarantee that a patent on it will be granted, but it’s an interesting idea.

A traditional soft top and a removable hard top are both available. You can also take off the doors and, yes, fold the windshield down.

A “Trail Rail” cargo management system that appeared in the FCA dealer computer system earlier this year turns out to be a useful but not very exciting adjustable barrier that splits the cargo compartment into two sections.

Absent from the list is any mention of the confirmed diesel engine, which could either mean it will be added to the lineup at a later date or make its debut on the pickup version of the Wrangler that's scheduled to follow in a year.

Faulkner added, “Three years ago, we enhanced cable news with a show that combines news and opinion, predominantly from the female point of view, and immediately, Outnumbered became the number one show in its timeslot. I am proud of the work we’re continuing to do there, and blessed to have this added opportunity to create a new program that will help inform our viewers and keep them engaged in a conversation surrounding the day’s headlines.”

Smith commented, “There’s no one better in the business than Bill Hemmer and I am honored to kick off the network’s news hours with him, informing our viewers of the biggest stories and issues driving the day.”

With her understanding of what makes news, how to respond to it and her unique political expertise, Perino will break it all down with insight from key Beltway experts.

There are also big ways to save for those of us who aren't planning on flying home for Thanksgiving, and simply want to book a getaway for the holiday.

#1. Shop now

If you don’t have airline tickets but you're planning to travel for the holiday, buy your airfare ASAP. Since the start of October, procrastinators have been paying a daily ""delay surcharge"" for each day the ticket purchase is delayed. It adds up, and it's only going to get worse. After an analysis of airfare averages, delays generally cost procrastinators $2 per day in October, and $4 per day or more in November.

Can it get worse? Sure. On certain routes last year, the daily surcharge averaged over $10 a day; hikes for flights to Los Angeles in 2016 added an extra $14 per day on average. Again, shop now, and here’s another tip that’ll help.

CANCELED OR DELAYED FLIGHT? HERE'S 5 THINGS YOU CAN DO NOW

#2. Use a tool to find cheaper days to fly

There are various tools out there including one on FareCompare.com which guides you to cheaper days to fly based on the part of the country you’ll visit. It also tells you which airlines offer the most deals to various regions.

#3. Know the best and worst itineraries

Thanksgiving Day is usually the cheapest day to fly during the holiday period, while the most expensive day is usually the Wednesday before and the Sunday after Turkey Day.

Bonus tip for go-anywhere travelers: Be flexible

Maybe you hate turkey, or maybe you see your family all the time, so Thanksgiving gatherings aren't so special for you. But even though you're not heading to Grandma’s house, you might still want to get away.

Luckily for you, November can be a perfect month for travel outside the country, and here’s how to find the best deals: Use flexible date tools.

Again, FareCompare and other sites have tools for this, and what they have in common is that they’re all perfect for flexible travelers. Add your hometown and the month you want to travel and watch the deals pop up. The following fares — all round-trip — were found late last week: Boston to Amsterdam for $299.98; Los Angeles to Hong Kong for $388; New York to London for $376.

Colin Kaepernick’s newly-filed grievance accusing the NFL of colluding or conspiring against him is a legal “Hail Mary.”

He and his lawyers stand little chance of winning because both the law and the facts are against him.



The Facts

Kaepernick used to be an outstanding quarterback. Selected by San Francisco in the 2011 draft, he led the 49ers to the Super Bowl in the 2012 season and the NFC Championship game the following year. And then, he seemed to implode.

Over the next two years, his throwing arm regressed and his overall skills as a rushing quarterback diminished. Injuries only made matters worse. The team finally gave up on him, and he was benched during the 2015 season. He never recovered. It did not help that Kaepernick was twice fined by the NFL for inappropriate language and behavior. He tended to be selfish and tempestuous.

Kaepernick seems oblivious to the fact that he does not have the right to play in the NFL. No one does. It must be earned. And not just on the playing field, but elsewhere.

Kaepernick was already collecting bench splinters when he began his one-man protest of the national anthem and the American flag in the 2016 pre-season. So, let’s be clear: he was never punished by the 49ers or the NFL for sitting or kneeling. He was not starting games or playing much as a back-up quarterback because, quite simply, he was no longer good enough.",Gregg Jarrett: Colin Kaepernick's Case Against the NFL Is as Lame as His Skills at Quarterback,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/17/gregg-jarrett-colin-kaepernicks-case-against-nfl-lame-his-skills-quarterback

She said she figured her cat “could be in the backyard, she could be hiding somewhere.”

But three days later, Israel said she grew suspicious when she saw a neighbor’s post on Nextdoor, a neighborhood social network, detailing that a cat's body parts turned up across their neighborhood.

Of course, being able to count on a quarterback to take the snaps is nothing new for Green Bay.","Walking gingerly to the sideline with his throwing shoulder throbbing in pain, Aaron Rodgers turned back toward the field and barked at Minnesota Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr.

Rodgers likely already knew that his season was in jeopardy after Barr's hit broke his collarbone, and the fiery quarterback's frustration boiled over.

Now the Green Bay Packers have to try to make sure their season as a whole doesn't go down the drain with it.

Rodgers was knocked out of the 23-10 loss to the Vikings in the first quarter on Sunday with an injury that could cause him to miss the remainder of the season .

It's a crushing blow to a team that entered the season with Super Bowl aspirations, optimism based primarily on the right arm of one of the game's best quarterbacks.

""It's devastating,"" receiver Randall Cobb said. ""No question about it. First and foremost, that is one of my closest friends, so to see him go down with that is tough. We still have to play football. We have a long season ahead of us to figure out what we are going to do.""

Brett Hundley, the only other quarterback on the roster outside of practice squad player Joe Callahan, was rushed into duty. He finished 18 of 33 for 157 yards with one touchdown and three interceptions.

""Losing Aaron Rodgers speaks for itself,"" Packers coach Mike McCarthy said. ""In my opinion, he's the best player in football. This is the ultimate team game. We need to be better with the 11 people on the field that we have, regardless of the phase that we're in. Ultimately that's my responsibility.""

Colin Kaepernick, who has had difficulty finding a job since becoming the face of league-wide demonstrations during the national anthem that protest social injustice, and Tony Romo, who joined CBS as an analyst after retiring from the Dallas Cowboys, could be outside options to fill in for Rodgers. But McCarthy said after the game he was not considering anything like that yet.

""Brett Hundley and Joe Callahan, that's what we're going with,"" he said.

Despite several key injuries to the secondary, the Packers entered the game Sunday against their NFC North rivals at 4-1 after Rodgers engineered a game-winning touchdown drive to beat the Dallas Cowboys last week.

Vikings coach Mike Zimmer's defense has always gotten after Rodgers in these tense matchups, and it happened again in the first quarter when Barr drove him into the turf after he got rid of a roll-out pass.

The impact did not appear to be that violent at first glance as Rodgers rolled through the hit. But it became apparent quickly that he was in considerable pain. He writhed on the turf as McCarthy argued for a roughing the passer penalty.

""I know Anthony Barr personally,"" said Hundley, a fellow UCLA alum. ""I wouldn't imagine he's a dirty player. I didn't really get a good look at it.""

Rodgers rode a cart to the locker room for further tests and remained there throughout the first half. He was initially deemed questionable, but the Packers announced after halftime that he would not return to the game.

""He's the best in the game so I hate to see that for him,"" Vikings safety Harrison Smith said.

Since becoming the full-time starter in 2008, Rodgers has been remarkably durable. He missed seven games in 2013 with a fractured collarbone, but he has started 132 of the other 134 games during that time period.

Of course, being able to count on a quarterback to take the snaps is nothing new for Green Bay. Since Brett Favre took over for the injured Don Majkowski in the third game of the 1992 season, the Packers have had Favre and Rodgers for all but nine games.

Matt Flynn, Scott Tolzien and Seneca Wallace were forced to fill in while Rodgers was out in 2013 and the Packers went 2-4-1 in that stretch. Flynn started once in 2010 when Rodgers sat out with a concussion and again in 2011 when he rested during the regular-season finale with the Packers having clinched the top seed in the NFC playoffs.

Favre never sat at all.

Hundley had only thrown 11 passes over the course of his first two-plus seasons in the league before jumping in on Sunday.

The move comes after Pitino was put on unpaid administrative leave on Sept. 27. University of Louisville’s Interim President Greg Postel confirmed that the school was part of an FBI investigation into fraud and corruption in college basketball launched in September, ESPN reported.

Ten men, including a top Adidas executive and four assistant coaches, were charged by the FBI on Sept. 26 with using hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to influence incoming athletes.

Pitino, 65, is not specifically named in court complaints in the federal probe but Postel said in a disciplinary letter that the allegations violated the coach’s contract.

Louisville is accused of paying a prospective player $100,000 to sign with the basketball team, ESPN reported. The player in question is believed to be freshman Brian Bowen.

Pitino passed a polygraph test given by a former FBI agent, in which he was asked about Bowen and the allegations, Bleacher Report said.

The official decision to fire Pitino was made during a board meeting for the Louisville Athletic Association on Monday afternoon but the process began on Oct. 2 after the association authorized Postel to begin the process of dismissing the head coach for cause.

Pitino’s lawyer, Steve Pence, argued in front of the board meeting that the Cardinal’s coach should not be fired because he “could not have known” about the activities alleged in the investigation.

In an affidavit presented by Pitino’s lawyers during the meeting, Pitino said, ""I had no part -- active, passive, or through willful ignorance -- in the conspiracy described in the complaint,"" ESPN reported.

“I had no reason to know about the conspiracy described in the complaint, and no reason to know about the complicity of any UL assistant coach or staff member in any bribery conspiracy,” he said in the affidavit. “I never have had any part -- active, passive, or through willful ignorance -- in any effort, successful or unsuccessful, completed or abandoned, to pay any recruit, or any family member of a recruit, or anyone else on a recruit's behalf, as an inducement to attend UL.”

Kenny Klein, Senior Associate Athletic Director for Media Relations and Sports Information Director at the University of Louisville, confirmed to Fox News the board's decision to fire Pitino, citing violated sections of his employment contract, but did not offer additional comment on the situation.

The move Monday officially ends Pitino's 16-year tenure with the program, a run that included winning the 2013 NCAA championship but was tarnished by several embarrassing off-court incidents.

Colin Kaepernick’s newly-filed grievance accusing the NFL of colluding or conspiring against him is a legal “Hail Mary.”

He and his lawyers stand little chance of winning because both the law and the facts are against him.



The Facts

Kaepernick used to be an outstanding quarterback. Selected by San Francisco in the 2011 draft, he led the 49ers to the Super Bowl in the 2012 season and the NFC Championship game the following year. And then, he seemed to implode.

Over the next two years, his throwing arm regressed and his overall skills as a rushing quarterback diminished. Injuries only made matters worse. The team finally gave up on him, and he was benched during the 2015 season. He never recovered. It did not help that Kaepernick was twice fined by the NFL for inappropriate language and behavior. He tended to be selfish and tempestuous.

Kaepernick seems oblivious to the fact that he does not have the right to play in the NFL. No one does. It must be earned. And not just on the playing field, but elsewhere.

Kaepernick was already collecting bench splinters when he began his one-man protest of the national anthem and the American flag in the 2016 pre-season. So, let’s be clear: he was never punished by the 49ers or the NFL for sitting or kneeling. He was not starting games or playing much as a back-up quarterback because, quite simply, he was no longer good enough.",Gregg Jarrett: Colin Kaepernick's Case Against the NFL Is as Lame as His Skills at Quarterback,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/17/gregg-jarrett-colin-kaepernicks-case-against-nfl-lame-his-skills-quarterback#commenting

There are also big ways to save for those of us who aren't planning on flying home for Thanksgiving, and simply want to book a getaway for the holiday.

#1. Shop now

If you don’t have airline tickets but you're planning to travel for the holiday, buy your airfare ASAP. Since the start of October, procrastinators have been paying a daily ""delay surcharge"" for each day the ticket purchase is delayed. It adds up, and it's only going to get worse. After an analysis of airfare averages, delays generally cost procrastinators $2 per day in October, and $4 per day or more in November.

Can it get worse? Sure. On certain routes last year, the daily surcharge averaged over $10 a day; hikes for flights to Los Angeles in 2016 added an extra $14 per day on average. Again, shop now, and here’s another tip that’ll help.

CANCELED OR DELAYED FLIGHT? HERE'S 5 THINGS YOU CAN DO NOW

#2. Use a tool to find cheaper days to fly

There are various tools out there including one on FareCompare.com which guides you to cheaper days to fly based on the part of the country you’ll visit. It also tells you which airlines offer the most deals to various regions.

#3. Know the best and worst itineraries

Thanksgiving Day is usually the cheapest day to fly during the holiday period, while the most expensive day is usually the Wednesday before and the Sunday after Turkey Day.

Bonus tip for go-anywhere travelers: Be flexible

Maybe you hate turkey, or maybe you see your family all the time, so Thanksgiving gatherings aren't so special for you. But even though you're not heading to Grandma’s house, you might still want to get away.

Luckily for you, November can be a perfect month for travel outside the country, and here’s how to find the best deals: Use flexible date tools.

Again, FareCompare and other sites have tools for this, and what they have in common is that they’re all perfect for flexible travelers. Add your hometown and the month you want to travel and watch the deals pop up. The following fares — all round-trip — were found late last week: Boston to Amsterdam for $299.98; Los Angeles to Hong Kong for $388; New York to London for $376.

""My libido’s vanished""

A post shared by Nikki Harvey (@nikki_harvey_fitness) on Sep 11, 2017 at 10:46am PDT

Nikki Harvey worries that her “zero sex drive” will push away her 26-year-old partner Jordan Burgess, a personal trainer.

Nikki, from Wolverhampton, a city 125 miles north-west of London, was an overweight smoker who did not exercise but has transformed her body in three years. She says:

“In the autumn of 2014, I was a size 16, drinking, smoking, living off junk food and generally pretty miserable.”

“One night I met Jordan and we quickly became an item.”

“He’s a rugby player and he caught me crying to myself in my bedroom when I couldn’t fit into my size 14 clothes.”

“He told me anyone can turn their life around and inspired me to get healthy and take up fitness and bodybuilding.”

“I signed up for a 14-week intensive program, pushing me harder than I ever dreamed possible. I loved every second.”

“Every gram of excess weight was stripped from my body – better than any faddy diet.”

“I now train every morning at 5:30 a.m. for two hours, then do an hour’s cardio every evening.”

“It really impacts on my relationship. I haven’t been on a date night with Jordan since January and my libido has vanished.”

“Right now I have zero sex drive so Jordan and I haven’t made love for two months. Jordan hates it but he knows it’s not because I don’t fancy him. I love my training so much that two months ago I quit my job to do it full time.”

“In April I came second in the UK Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation National Finals and qualified for three inter-national champion-ships.”

“My libido might be gone but I look better and am now so much healthier.”

“I just hope that Jordan will stick by me without sex.”

""I don’t need a relationship""

A post shared by Gabriella Rose Prior (@gabriellaroseprior) on May 24, 2017 at 6:29am PDT

Fitness addict Gabriella Prior, 22, from Bournemouth, a city 100 miles south-west of London, would rather be in good shape than have a sex life. Gabriella has not had sex for more than 18 months. She says:

“At the start of 2016, I did almost no exercise. I went out drinking, enjoyed lazy weekends, had boyfriends and a healthy sex life. I wasn’t depressed but I felt like I didn’t have any hobbies.”

“One morning, on a whim, I decided to join the nearby House of Pain boxing gym. I was nervous but when I left I was so full of energy I couldn’t wait to do it again.”

“Exercising is now like a drug to me. Within weeks I was training twice a day for two hours each session, five or six days a week. I still do that now.”

“It’s 100 percent effort training with weights, sparring and cardio. Boxing isn’t a sport you do by halves. I can hardly tie my shoe laces after I have finished a session, let alone think about sex. I used to have boyfriends but they ran their course.”

“Now I don’t have time to meet men. I have realised I don’t need a relationship or sex to be happy. I value independence and fitness more than I thought possible. My sex life now is a dim and distant memory.”

“I hope that if I ever want to, I can reduce the intensity of my training and then get my libido back. But I’m not bothered now.”

“I’ve had a couple of short-lived relation-ships since I started training but quickly I’ve been dumped because they thought I was boring, as I did not want to have sex all the time.”

“I have been crowned Miss Fitness Inspiration UK, which means more to me than any amount of sex.”

The train that took Harry Potter to school was played onscreen by the Jacobite steam train, which runs on a remote and scenic route through the Scottish Highlands.

On Friday, it made an unscheduled stop to pick up a family of six that was stranded when a storm washed away their canoe.

Jon Cluett, his wife and four children between the ages of 6 and 12 were staying in a lakeside hut on Loch Eilt when they awoke to find their canoe was gone.

Faced with walking several miles over boggy ground to get back to the family car, Cluett called police to see if any form of rescue was available.

“The policeman said, ‘We’ve arranged for the next train passing to stop for you, and you’re not going to believe this but it’s the Hogwarts Express steam train. Your kids are going to love it,’’” Cluett said Sunday.

Cluett said his children, all Harry Potter fans, were “really excited” by the adventure.

“They know the Harry Potter films and they know that are filmed in the Highlands,” he said. “But they hadn’t put all of that together in their heads until they saw the train.”

Once friends — Clinton was even a guest at Trump’s third wedding in 2005 — the two New Yorkers haven’t left their squabbling behind in what was a volatile campaign season.

Here’s a look at the jabs Clinton and Trump have taken at one another since Nov. 8, 2016.

Nov. 27, 2016: 19 days since the election

Trump claimed that Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million people because “millions of people … voted illegally.”

“In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,” Trump, then the president-elect, tweeted.

Dec. 21, 2016: 43 days since the election

Trump took to Twitter in the morning to deride Clinton for focusing on the wrong states during her campaign.

“Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote,” Trump said on Twitter. “Hillary focused on the wrong states!”

Dec. 23, 2016: 45 days since the election

By this point, Trump has mentioned Clinton in his tweets quite often — but he usually mocked the media and celebrities who he said tried to help the Democratic candidate. Yet, on Dec. 23, Trump quoted Russian President Vladimir Putin to express his opinion on his former opponent.

TRUMP, CLINTON SPAR ON TWITTER AFTER SHE RIPS RUSSIA FOR ELECTION LOSS

“Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: ‘In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity.’ So true!” Trump tweeted.

Clinton, along with other Trump critics, have alleged that the president and his campaign colluded with the Russians to win the election.

Trump later tweeted in February that the “Russian connection non-sense” is just “an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton’s losing campaign.”

March 29, 2017: 141 days since the election

In one of her first public speeches since she lost the election, Clinton excoriated the Trump administration without actually using Trump’s name. She also blasted the current administration and Congress for not including enough women.

Of Trump’s policies, Clinton encouraged the women gathered to “resist, insist, persist, enlist.”

“These are bad policies that will hurt people and take our country in the wrong direction,” she said.

April 23, 2017: 166 days since the election

Trump is seemingly still competing with Clinton for the popular vote.

CLINTON CALLS OUT RUSSIA FOR ELECTION LOSS

“New polls out today are very good considering that much of the media is FAKE and almost always negative,” Trump tweeted. “Would still beat Hillary in popular vote.”

Trump then cited an ABC News/Washington Post poll that he said showed “almost all stand by their vote” for Trump.

May 2, 2017: 175 days since the election

Clinton took a jab at Trump during a television interview as he has continuously focused on his loss of the popular vote in the election.

“He should worry less about the election and me winning the popular vote and more about other things,” the former secretary of state said.

“Remember, I did win more than 3 million votes than my opponent,” Clinton added.

She also said that she’s now a “private citizen” and “part of the resistance.”

May 3, 2017: 176 days since the election

Focusing on national security threats from North Korea, Clinton criticized Trump for his penchant for tweeting.

HILLARY CLINTON USES COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS TO ATTACK TRUMP

""If [Trump] wants to tweet about me I'm happy to be the diversion because we've got lots of other things to worry about. And he should worry less about the election, and my winning the popular vote, than doing some other things that would be important to the country,"" Clinton said at an event in New York City.

May 24, 2017: 197 days since the election

Clinton harshly condemned Trump’s proposed budget plan after she was honored by the Children’s Health Fund, a nonprofit in New York City. Clinton said Republican lawmakers are “mounting an onslaught against the needs of children and people with disabilities, women and seniors.”

The budget “shows an unimaginable level of cruelty and lack of imagination and disdain for the struggles of millions of Americans, including millions of children,” she said. “None of us can remain silent in the face of these attacks.”

""It hurts the well-being of children,"" Clinton continued. ""It's time to send a resounding message that we will not stand for this attack on the most vulnerable among us.""

May 26, 2017: 199 days since the election

Clinton didn’t miss an opportunity to criticize the president while she delivered the commencement address at Wellesley College in Massachusetts.

“When people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,” Clinton said. “That is not hyperbole; it is what authoritarian regimes throughout history have done … They attempt to control reality.”

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel responded to Clinton’s address by stating her remarks were “a stark reminder why [she] lost in 2016.”

May 31, 2017: 204 days since the election

After Clinton placed the blame of her presidential loss on a variety of reasons — misogyny, Facebook and the Democratic National Committee, to name a few — Trump took to Twitter to mock his former opponent.

“Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & the DNC,” Trump tweeted, using his favorite campaign trail nickname for Clinton.

Clinton fired back less than an hour later, mocking Trump for an erroneous but viral tweet he sent earlier in the day.

“People in covfefe houses shouldn’t throw covfefe,” she said.

This time, Trump’s son also got in on the Twitter war.

“What house is he in again??? That’s what I thought. You’re trying too hard,” Donald Trump Jr. tweeted Wednesday night.

The president’s tweet received more than 23,000 retweets; Clinton’s received more than 236,000.

July 10: 244 days since the election

As Trump came under fire for allowing his daughter, Ivanka, to sit in his place during a meeting at the G-20 summit, the president attempted to turn the tables on Clinton’s own daughter.

In a tweet Monday morning, Trump alleged that if Clinton would have let daughter Chelsea Clinton sit in for her, the media would have heralded the decision.

“If Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her mother, as her mother gave our country away, the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!” Trump tweeted.

Chelsea Clinton got in on the feud and responded on social media.

“Good morning Mr. President. It would never have occurred to my mother or my father to ask me. Were you giving our country away? Hoping not,” she tweeted.

July 12: 247 days since the election

Trump took to Twitter to rail on the alleged double standards for Democrats.

“Why aren’t the same standards placed on the Democrats,” Trump tweeted. “Look what Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with. Disgraceful!”

July 16: 250 days since the election

As Trump’s son is criticized for meeting with a Russian lawyer who was supposed to have damaging information about Clinton during the presidential campaign, Trump defended his son on social media – while still criticizing his former opponent.

“Hillary Clinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?” Trump tweeted.

Former CNN commentator and interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile admitted in March 2017 to sharing debate questions with the Clinton campaign ahead of the primary town hall event.

July 22: 256 days since the election

Trump asked – on Twitter – why a special counsel or the attorney general isn’t investigating more alleged crimes committed by former FBI Director James Comey and Clinton.

In his tweet, Trump referenced the emails deleted from Clinton’s private server she used during her tenure as secretary of state.

In an additional tweet, Trump again compared his son’s publishing of emails pertaining to a meeting with a Russian lawyer to Clinton’s own handling of her email server.

July 24: 258 days since the election

Trump addressed approximately 40,000 people in West Virginia for the annual Boy Scout Jamboree – and couldn’t resist taking a few jabs at Clinton.

He told the crowd that the reason he won Michigan was because he “worked hard there” unlike Clinton.

“You know, my opponent didn’t work hard there because she was told … she was going to win Michigan,” Trump said.

Trump also repeated his questions about the investigation into possible collusion between the Russian government and his campaign during the presidential election continues.

“So why aren’t the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered [Attorney General Jeff Sessions], looking into Crooked Hillarys [sic] crimes & Russia relations?” Trump tweeted.

July 25: 259 days since the election

Trump called into question the ability of his attorney general and the current F.B.I. chief to investigate Clinton.

The president said Sessions “has taken a very weak position” on her alleged crimes – this time linking her to the Democratic National Committee’s server as well.

As for acting F.B.I. director Andrew McCabe, Trump said that his wife, who ran for a Virginia state senate seat last year, received $700,000 in campaign donations from Clinton.

However, McCabe’s wife actually received $467,500 from a political action committee controlled by Gov. Terry McAuliffe, D-Va., a longtime Clinton ally. Dr. Jill McCabe received an additional $292,500 from another Democratic PAC.

Sept. 13: 309 days since the election

As Clinton begins her book tour across the country, promoting her memoir of the 2016 election called “What Happened,” Trump dusted off his favorite campaign nickname for her.

“Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing [sic]) but herself for her election loss. She lost the debates and lost her direction!” Trump tweeted late Wednesday night.

“The ‘deplorables’ came back to haunt Hillary. They expressed their feelings loud and clear,” he continued in another tweet. “She spent big money but, in the end, had no game!”

While Clinton apologized for calling Trump supporters “deplorable” at the time, she defended her use of the word earlier this month in an interview with CBS News.

“I thought Trump was behaving in a deplorable manner. I thought a lot of his appeals to voters were deplorable. I thought his behavior, as we saw on the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape was deplorable. And there were a large number of people who didn’t care. It did not matter to them,” Clinton said.

As the Daily Caller noted, the “deplorable” comment came almost a full month before the “Access Hollywood” tape was released.

Sept. 21: 317 days since the election

When Trump met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, the Asian leader used a word that Trump liked to hear – “deplorable.” Using a translator, Moon said North Korea’s actions were “deplorable.”

“I am very happy that you used the word 'deplorable,'” Trump said. “I was very interested in that word.”

“It’s been a very lucky word for me and many millions of people,” he continued.

In Clinton’s new memoir about the presidential election, she blamed her use of the word “deplorables” to describe Trump’s supporters, in part, for her loss.

Oct. 13: 339 days since the election

While discussing the multiple sexual assault and harassment allegations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, Clinton said there is “someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office.”

Clinton was most likely referring to the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape from 2005 that caught Trump bragging that he could “do anything” to a woman because of his status. He also said he could grab “them by the p----.”

Trump later apologized for his comments and chalked them up to “locker room talk.”

“The really sad part of the campaign was how this horrific tape, what he said about women in the past, what he said about women during the campaign, was discounted by a lot of voters,” Clinton told BBC.

Oct. 16: 342 days since the election

Trump said he would like to see ""Crooked Hillary Clinton"" challenge him in 2020.

""I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020,"" Trump tweeted. ""My answer was: 'I hope so!'""

Trump later reiterated his desire for Clinton to run during a press briefing in the Rose Garden. He also criticized her for sticking up for professional athletes who have chosen to kneel during the national anthem in a sign of protest.

But just several years after opening the gas station, IRS investigators seized all the station’s cash – more than $59,000 – leaving the Kwon family cash-strapped, even though no evidence of criminal wrongdoing was found by the government, the paper reported.

After the IRS investigation ended, the station went bankrupt, Kwon’s wife passed away, and the IRS changed its policy regarding seizures like this; but the agency is still refusing to hand back Kwon his money.

His problems with the IRS started in 2011 when investigators showed up at his doorstep accusing him making money deposits in increments of less than $10,000 – a practice known as “structuring.""

Structuring is commonly used by terror groups in order to avoid scrutiny. The government requires banks to report all transactions larger than $10,000 under the 1970 Banking Secrecy Act.

""They did it for money, and they destroyed a good and honest man. It is shameful."" - Attorney Edward Griffin

“Of all the cases I have worked on, this one stands out for me,” Kwon’s attorney Edward Griffin told The Post. “I firmly believe that the government did wrong in choosing to prosecute Mr. Kwon and seize his assets. There was no good policy purpose for the prosecution. They did it for money, and they destroyed a good and honest man. It is shameful. Which is why I am still fighting for him.”

A spokesman for the IRS said Kwon pleaded guilty to the structuring charge. Kwon said he merely followed the advice given by a local bank, which suggested making smaller deposits to avoid paperwork.

He told the paper the guilty plea ruined his life. He said he also felt shame after the investigators spoke with his neighbors, forcing him later to move out of the neighborhood.

“They saw me as Korean. As a veteran,” he told The Post. “They were surprised to see me as a criminal. I will never forget that.”

It remains unclear whether he will get his money back. His attorney petitioned the IRS and Department of Justice this summer, but the request to hand back the money was not granted, citing lack of “additional information.”",Report: IRS refuses to give back $59G to vet after seizing his business cash,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/17/report-irs-refuses-to-give-back-59g-to-vet-after-seizing-his-business-cash.html

South Korea has announced it is building “blackout bombs.” And by doing so, the country has sent a clear message to North Korea that it has the power to “turn off the lights” throughout the country whenever South Korea chooses.

North Korea would be paralyzed. Electrical power plants would suddenly stop. Everything depending on electricity would instantly be shut off.

North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un would be cut off from his population and no longer able to communicate with his citizens since television and radio would be offline.

Paralyze North Korea

Without electricity, North Korean leadership, government and military would be instantly and utterly crippled.

For the North Korean military, this weapon would mean things like air defenses, radar, communication systems, transportation and much more would be unusable. There would be no military or government computers, no email and no way to transmit securely military communication.

With the runway lights shut off, it would make it very difficult for the North Korean military to mount an air force response. Hospitals, military and civilian alike, would be without critical power and rely on back-up generators – if they have them.

‘Lights Out’ for the North Korean Population

This sort of bomb would have widespread devastating effects on the North Korean population.

In modern life, many things rely on electricity. North Koreans would have no electricity, no lights, no water purification, no sewage management and with the looming freezing temperatures of winter … they would have no heating.

South Korea's Agency for Defence Development has obtained the necessary ingredients and

technologies to make these graphite bombs and is ready to develop them, Yonhap news agency reported. These bombs will be one element of the Kill Chain pre-emptive strike program.

So what is a blackout bomb?

Blackout bombs are graphite bombs – they are also sometimes called “soft bombs” because they are non-lethal weapons that target electricity supply, not humans.

The electricity attack system is used to shut down an enemy’s power supply. Once unleashed, the bombs can instantly paralyze an enemy’s regime.

Making Kim Jong Un Look Powerless to his People

These graphite bombs have simply enormous impact.

In general, there is no real material damage. Rather than blow things up, graphite bombs short circuit the targets.

But the impact of a country suddenly going dark can be very powerful.

And while less visible, but by no means less important, these graphite bomb weapons have a major psychological impact.

Kim Jong Un hardly looks like a powerful leader to his population when another country can choose to turn his nation’s power off whenever they want to or need to.

So while attacking the electrical grid has direct impact on military capabilities, it could also put immediate and intense psychological pressure on North Korea’s leadership and its population.

How does it work?

The bombs rely on the same ingredient as the humble, everyday, ordinary pencil – graphite.

Inside the bomb is graphite filament and graphite is a highly efficient electricity conductor.

Unlike conventional explosives, graphite bombs do not strike the target and blow up. The graphite bomb instead explodes in the air above a power plant.

When it explodes, the graphite filaments are so fine that they seem like a cloud. The bomb unleashes this cloud of graphite particles across the electricity system.

The graphite causes short circuits and electrical discharges, blowing safety devices and burning out essential parts in the electrical supply. The blackout graphite cloud can hit power plants, transformer stations, power lines and more.

The result is darkness. A nation’s electricity suddenly stops without warning.

PODCAST: FEARLESS FREEDOM WITH SPECIAL FORCES SNIPER AND ‘HUNTING HITLER’ STAR TIM KENNEDY

Is the blackout permanent?

The carbon-graphite particles can be easily brushed away. Short circuits can be removed. Blown switching stations can be replaced. But repairing the system can be costly and take time.

So a blackout is not necessarily permanent if North Korea took action to fix the power.

However, South Korea could just continue to drop graphite bombs so that every time North Korea came close to restoring power or managed to do so, the bombs would flick the nation’s switch and turn off the lights again.

But do they actually work?

Blackout bombs have been used in war already and been very successful.

They were first used by the United States in Iraq during the 1990 Gulf War. They succeeded in disabling about 85 percent of Iraq’s facilities that supplied electricity.

NATO has also deployed graphite bombs. They were used in former Yugoslavia in 1999 where they stopped about 70 percent of the national grid electricity supply.

The American version of the graphite bomb is the BLU-114/B and it works sort of like a cluster bomb. The bomb scatters many soda can-sized canisters that could be described as ""sub-munitions."" These canisters spray the fine carbon fiber that cause the short circuits.

The graphite bomb approach dates farther back that the Gulf War. It was under consideration during the Cold War as a possible method to defeat Soviet nuclear power plants.",Will one single bomb stop North Korea?,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/17/will-one-single-bomb-stop-north-korea.html

An old proverb says a leader with no followers is “only taking a walk.”

If that’s the case, then the strutting President Trump has turned his presidency into a very lonely walk.

A Morning Consult poll released last week found Trump losing support in states he easily carried last year. He is down 23 points in Tennessee since his inauguration in January, down 21 points in Mississippi, down 20 in Kentucky, down 19 in Kansas and down 17 in Indiana.

Overall, 55 percent of the country disapproves of the job he is doing as president, according the most recent RealClearPolitics average. At the three-quarter mark of his first year in office, Trump is the least popular new president in history.

On Capitol Hill, House and Senate Republicans are also walking away from Trump.

A new Quinnipiac poll last week found that 49 percent of voters disapprove of the way Trump is handling taxes and just 37 percent approve.

In part, this is due to his attacks on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.

Then there are the threats to incumbent Republicans from Stephen Bannon, formerly Trump’s chief strategist.

Bannon said last week he plans to challenge incumbent Republican senators in seven states, including Arizona’s Jeff Flake, Mississippi’s Roger Wicker, Nebraska’s Deb Fischer, Nevada’s Dean Heller and Wyoming’s John Barrasso.

“Creating a civil war inside the Republican Party may feel good, but I think as a strategy, it is stunningly stupid,” former Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said of Bannon’s plan.

Speaking on Sean Hannity’s radio show, Gingrich stated the obvious: It would be better for the GOP if the president and his allies spent their time trying to beat incumbent Democratic senators.

Instead, Trump has whipped up a very public feud with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn. Trump tweeted that Corker lacks “the guts” to seek reelection. Trump also belittled Corker as having “begged” for his endorsement.

Corker denied that, shooting back that it is a “shame the White House has become an adult day care center.” He added that Trump has hurt U.S. foreign relations with his impetuous tweets on world affairs, including “things that are not true.”

Rather than let it go, Trump responded by tweeting: “The Failing @nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording his conversation. Was made to sound a fool, and that's what I am dealing with!”

Corker was not “set up” by the Times. A transcript showed the senator stating, “I understand we’re on the record.”

Now, commentators who are open to Trump are starting to walk away from his parade as well.

“Last time I checked, you are the president of the United States, so tweeting out these tacky insults just seems beneath you,” Neil Cavuto of Fox News said on his show last week. “You are running out of friends faster than you are running out of time. You might not like Bob Corker, but a lot of senators do, and you need those senators, sir.”

Even Trump’s personal friends are turning away from him.

Thomas Barrack told The Washington Post he was “shocked” and “stunned” by Trump’s recent comments.

“I tell him all the time: I don’t like the rhetoric,” said Barrack, who has been friends with Trump for decades, since they were both Manhattan real estate developers.

To win back some followers, Trump needs a win.

Polls show Americans favor tax reform. They want a simpler tax structure, fewer brackets and loopholes to be closed. Trump repeatedly promised to deliver tax reform during the campaign.

But once again he is strutting with no one behind him as he abandons tax reform. He is focused on tax cuts for the rich.

Polls show that is not popular.

The New York Times analysis of the tax cut plan concluded it would be a “huge windfall for the wealthiest Americans” and “not directly benefit the bottom third of the population.” Polls show Americans oppose tax cuts for the rich.

A new Quinnipiac poll last week found that 49 percent of voters disapprove of the way Trump is handling taxes and just 37 percent approve.

Trump has also failed to deliver on his campaign promise to build a southern border wall and have Mexico pay for it. He continues to say it will get done. But, again, polls show voters don’t want a wall.

Similarly, Trump seems unaware that a majority of Americans now approve of the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, and want its problems fixed so it can continue.

Instead, having failed to win a full repeal of the health care law from the Republican majority in Congress, he signed an executive order allowing low-cost insurance to be sold across state lines.

That has been tried before and has a sad history of consumer fraud and regulatory confusion.

So it’s no wonder Trump now walks alone. He remains a celebrity figure for his hardcore base. But 10 months into his presidency, Republicans are starting to drift away as he fails to deliver on nearly every major campaign promise he made.

That’s not my opinion. That’s a demonstrable fact.

He then alerted the airline crew, who according to the suit, “refused [his] request to relocate his seat.” After several requests, Card says he was finally moved from the urine-soaked seat, but was “forced to endure the remainder of the flight to Newark/New Jersey while remaining in his urine drenched clothing.”

Once the plane landed in Newark Liberty International Airport, law enforcement was there to intervene. The FBI interviewed both Card and the drunk passenger once they were removed from the plane. The drunk passenger said he “had no recollection of the events on the flight, and only remembered being at a bar inside of Los Angeles International Airport, and then landing at Newark Airport.” The passenger also stated he had consumed at least four rum and cokes while at the airport bar in LA.

As part of United’s Contract of Carriage, there is an obligation of the airline to remove “passengers who appear to be intoxicated or under the influence of drugs to a degree that the Passenger may endanger the Passenger or another Passenger or members of the crew.”

Card believes law enforcement intervention would not have happened if his father, whom he called to inform of the incident, had not alerted them.

Card is suing for assault, negligence, breach of contract and emotional distress.

Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do.
But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","I sat on a parenting panel last month with a well-known and widely respected counselor by the name of Sissy Goff, M.Ed, LPC-MHSP. She is the Director of Child & Adolescent Counseling at Daystar in Nashville and when asked about the biggest issue facing kids today, she confirmed what you’ve probably read about recently on your news feed or even your Facebook feed – the increasing anxiety epidemic in our country.

But it’s not just an epidemic among our kids. It’s an epidemic among us -- their parents.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults.

In a recent article entitled “Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering from Severe Anxiety” we glean significant insight into the anxiety epidemic:

I’ll just share just two key points from the article:

* Privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic.

* For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop.’ Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.

If you’re reading this article as a mom, I imagine it breaks your heart like it breaks mine (as the mother of four boys who range in age from toddler to teenager) to learn that the pressure our kids are under “is relentless and getting worse.” Of course, I think we already assumed this to be true. But knowing it to be true leaves us responsible to do something to fight against it.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

See, we parents aren’t the only ones linking accomplishment to acceptance and success to significance. Our kids are attempting to answer the question, “Is who I am enough?” by how well they perform on the field, how much they excel in school, and how many likes they get on their Instagram feed.

They are attempting to answer that question, “Is who I am enough?” by proving they can do enough and be enough. Whatever “enough” is. Because you and I both know enough is never enough when the goal is perpetual perfection.

The primary message our kids receive is that they’d better be the best at everything, and this leaves them afraid to reveal their inadequacies and insecurities—and hiding behind the best version of themselves.

In turn, parents of anxious teens feel helpless and hopeless, questioning all of the steps we are -- or aren’t -- taking. Our confidence as moms crumbles as we try to help our kids navigate the battles they have to fight and the mountains they have to climb.

We are constantly second guessing ourselves: “Have I done too much? Have I not done enough? Am I helping or am I hurting my child?”

Our anxiety escalates and overflows into our parenting and onto our kids, who then take our anxiety on top of their own.

I won’t pretend to even begin to be able to solve this for us here. I don’t have all the answers. Not even a little bit. But I do have this one nugget – which is the primary message woven into my new book, ""Mom Set Free,"" and I believe it to be true with everything in me.

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.

It starts with us. It doesn’t end with us. But we are part of the solution.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

Of course, some kids are just more prone to perfection seeking than others. Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it. But often, we parents play a role in the pressure -- and therefore, anxiety -- our kids feel, so we have to be willing to take an honest look at how we pile our own pressure onto our kids.

And ultimately, it is our responsibility to help our kids push back the pressure they face with the truth of God’s Word. I am not at all suggesting that therapy and medication aren’t part of the solution. They often times are. But please let us not forget the alive and powerful Word of God that has the absolute power to show us where our significance comes from and ultimately set us free from proving our worth and our value in our performance.

Kids who constantly feel like they just don't measure up and who feel they have “everything” to prove need to be told – over and over again - they actually have “nothing” to prove. Because this pressure to prove our value and worth has left parents and children alike longing for what all our hearts most crave:

• to be known—truly and deeply known

• to be accepted—for who they are, not who they wish they were to be loved—with no strings attached

This isn’t sentimental fluff. This is solid truth from which freedom springs. There is absolutely no denying the inherent and deepest longing every human soul holds.

If we want to raise kids who find freedom from the pressure to get it ALL right in order to be accepted and welcomed, then we are going to need to walk in that freedom first. Or at least be willing to discover how to walk in that freedom alongside our kids.

We need to know that failing doesn’t make us failures and succeeding doesn’t make us significant. At least not in the eyes of our Creator -- the only One whose opinion of us really matters in the end.

In God’s eyes we are of great worth, not because of anything we have or haven’t done, but because of what has been done for us in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

The cross has the final word on our value. Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do. But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","America's teen anxiety epidemic is heartbreaking.

The beloved blue creature and his new friend, Gonger, will be operating a food truck together. In each segment, the pals receive a call from a child who wants to order a meal from their operation, Food & Wine reports. But, while preparing the dish, the pair will have to hit the road in their truck to find a main ingredient.

Through their travels, the team will explore places like a “cranberry bog, a pasta factories, an avocado farm,” the show said in a statement. At each of these locations, Cookie Monster and Gonger will learn how the ingredient is made by talking to a farmer or an artisan before being sent “home to get cooking.”

The goal is to help kids learn more about how food is made and through that knowledge, cultivate healthier eating habits.

“The video field trips to farms and factories are reminiscent of classic Sesame Street, and Cookie Monster—an enduring favorite with fans of all ages—is the original food fanatic,” said Brown Johnson, EVP and Creative Director, Sesame Workshop. “Who better to teach kids how food gets to their plates, putting a Sesame spin on the food truck culture that’s unfolding in communities across the country?”

The star clarified in a Facebook live video Monday that she regrets how her lengthy op-ed for The New York Times about the Harvey Weinstein scandal has been received. In the piece, the actress condemned a culture that puts women in situations like the ones Weinstein’s accusers found themselves in.

""It has become clear to me that there are people that think I implied, or overtly stated, that you can be protected from assault from the clothing you wear,"" Bialik said in a Facebook live video with the NY Times. ""That is absolutely not what my intention was and I think that it is safe for me to [say]...there's no way to avoid being the victim of assault by what you wear or the way you behave.""

She later added, ""I really do regret that this became what it became.""

Fans took issue with a portion of Bialik's op-ed in which she wrote how she avoided harassment in Hollywood by presenting herself in as a modest person.

While describing how she avoided such things by getting into the business at a young age and not being the typical Hollywood pretty-girl archetype, she mentioned how her choices in the business as an adult have helped her get by.

“I still make choices every day as a 41-year-old actress that I think of as self-protecting and wise. I have decided that my sexual self is best reserved for private situations with those I am most intimate with. I dress modestly. I don’t act flirtatiously with men as a policy,” she wrote.

Bialik immediately qualified the above statement by saying, “Women should be able to wear whatever they want. They should be able to flirt however they want with whomever they want. Why are we the ones who have to police our behavior?”

However, many still took her words as evidence that she was shaming the women who fell victim for the way they dressed or acted.

Remember when Democrats and the press corps complained about “dark money” and wanted to rewrite the First Amendment to ban certain campaign contributions? Well, well. Now the progressive operatives at Fusion GPS are invoking free-speech rights to block the House Intelligence Committee’s probe of the infamous Steele dossier.

Fusion GPS is the opposition research firm behind the Steele dossier claiming that Donald Trump colluded with Russians to win the 2016 election. Congress is investigating Russian influence, and former British spook Christopher Steele relied on Russian sources. The dossier is clearly of interest, perhaps even a Rosetta Stone in the probe.

Yet Fusion chief Glenn Simpson won’t cooperate, and on Monday the company’s lawyers sent a letter to the House Intelligence Committee refusing to comply with subpoenas for documents and testimony related to the dossier. The letter claims the subpoenas “violate the First Amendment rights of our clients and their clients, and would chill any American running for office . . . from conducting confidential opposition research in an election.”

Hello? Mr. Simpson must be having a good laugh at that one. Surely he knows that his many Democratic clients have spent most of the last decade moaning about “dark money” donations in politics. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders proposed rewriting the First Amendment to overturn the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling so government could regulate political speech. Fusion must also not have read the avalanche of press releases from Democrats like Chuck Schumer demanding disclosure of all political donations.

Citizens United protected the broadcast of a movie opposing Hillary Clinton—obvious political speech. But the House wants to know who paid Fusion to dig up dirt on Mr. Trump and whether any of that money or intelligence came from foreign sources. The First Amendment doesn’t protect attempts by foreign governments or agents to influence U.S. elections.

But I will write my complaint down,” Mallory told the Daily News. The pilot then responded by telling Mallory she was itching for a “one-way ticket” off her flight.

Mallory claims she later boarded the plane and took her assigned middle seat. Soon, though, she was summoned to the front of the plane, where the pilot pointed her out and demanded she get off.

“Then I asked why I was being removed. I asked why was this happening to me. I told him I felt completely disrespected,” explained Mallory, adding that she had begun to “weep.”

Mallory and her traveling companion later left the plane after police arrived on the scene.

AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT CANCELED AFTER SCORPION FOUND ON BOARD

American Airlines has since released a statement regarding the incident, explaining that there had been an “error” with Mallory’s seating assignment.

“Due to an error with a seat change request, Ms. Mallory was informed her requested seat was not available and she was given her original, pre-reserved seat,” said American spokesman Josh Freed in a statement obtained by Dallas News. “Our team members apologized for the error and attempted to de-escalate the situation.”

“Ms. Mallory was rebooked on the next flight to New York’s LaGuardia airport,” the statement continued.

However, judging by Mallory’s tweets, she’s not ready to let American off the hook.

“Doesn't matter how much we do and how hard we fight, white men are allowed to treat black women like s---,” she wrote on Oct. 15. “Other ppl stand by and watch it happen because it doesn't affect them. If I have to fight alone, .@AmericanAir will NEVER GET AWAY W/ THIS,” she added.

Brig. Gen. Talal Sillo told The Associated Press on Tuesday there were no longer clashes going on in the city, and that a formal declaration would follow.

Despite Sillo's announcement, a U.S. military spokesperson told Fox News the ISIS stronghold has been 90 percent recaptured and some fighting remains.

""There are still areas that have not been cleared,"" Army Col. Ryan Dillon told Fox News in an interviewfrom Baghdad.

The loss deprived the terror group of the capital of its so-called caliphate, which has dwindled from a land mass spanning two countries to a sliver of space in Syria.

The last group of Islamic State militants had been holed up Tuesday in a stadium in the Syrian city of Raqqa, their last stand as U.S. backed, Kurdish-led forces closed in around them.

Coalition forces captured the city hospital earlier in the day, which doubled as an ISIS command center.

Musafa Bali, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces, told the AP around 22 ISIS militants were killed in the advance on the hospital.

The remaining soldiers of terror were cornered in an area around the city's municipal stadium, which they had turned into a huge prison where they incarcerated anyone who opposed their brutal rule.

The Kurdish-run Hawar news agency said with the capture of the hospital, the last black ISIS flag raised in the city had been taken down. A video released by the news agency illustrated the clashes around the hospital building, which appeared riddled with bullets and partly blackened from a fire.

The U.S.-led coalition said it had not carried out any airstrikes in or around Raqqa for 24 hours, starting from noon Sunday.

The battle for Raqqa began in June and has dragged for weeks as the SDF fighters faced stiff resistance from the militants.

Losing Raqqa has been a huge blow for ISIS, which has steadily lost territory in Iraq and Syria, including Iraq's second largest city of Mosul a few months ago.

The group declared the city on the banks of the Euphrates River, which it seized from other Syrian rebels in early 2014, to be the capital of its self-styled ""caliphate,"" transforming the once vibrant metropolis into the epicenter of its brutal rule where opponents were beheaded and terror plots were hatched.

The former “Duck Dynasty” star is joining the growing team at Conservative Review TV (CRTV), a $99 per year digital streaming network for a show titled “In the Woods with Phil.” Robertson became a particularly controversial figure on the now-defunct A&E series after some comments he made in a GQ article, prompting the network to temporarily suspend him.

“What does a man do when they try to run him out of town for quoting a Bible verse? I tell you what he does; he goes deep in the woods,” Robertson says in a promotional video for the new show. “For far too long we have been told to shut up. No more. Here’s the deal, America.

Robertson joins commentators Mark Levin, Steven Crowder and Michelle Malkin on CRTV.

An article on raceconscious.org by Sachi Feris has been making the rounds on mommy Facebook groups. Feris writes that her 5-year-old daughter declared she wanted to be Polynesian Disney character Moana, which she worried would be “cultural appropriation.”

Her daughter’s other choice: Scandinavian Queen Elsa from the Disney movie “Frozen.”

“I had some reservations regarding both costume choices … about cultural appropriation and the power/privilege carried by Whiteness, and about Whiteness and standards of beauty,” she wrote.

Feris went on to describe a series of conversations with her daughter, particularly focusing on the ethics of dressing as Moana, who as a teen sets out on a treacherous sea journey to save her family’s island from famine and destruction — and succeeds.

In the end, Feris’s daughter decided to dress as Elsa — though Feris was concerned it might teach her short-haired brunette daughter that one must be white, blue-eyed and have long flaxen hair to be a “beautiful” princess.

But she nixed the Moana costume for Mickey Mouse, because, as Ferris wrote, “we don’t have to worry about making fun of anyone or dressing up as a culture different from our own because Mickey Mouse is a pretend mouse!

“One thing is for sure, our discussions around appropriate and inappropriate Halloween costumes will continue,” concluded Feris.

Her blog was almost universally praised by commenters. Yvette Brown, wrote: “I admire your perseverance in interacting with your daughter. … You also have given her essential values along with guidelines so she has the opportunity to grow, be creative, learn and find her way in the world.”

But another commenter named Amanda expressed reservations. “This feels murky,” she wrote. “I recognize the need to be sensitive, I’m just wondering how you parse the nuances for a child.”

Meanwhile, a New York mom of one daughter told The Post: “I think it’s silly to take children’s Halloween costumes so seriously. They’re kids, can’t they just be kids and not involved with the whole political correctness thing?

I know how this works. Say something unfavorable to the president and you’ve never gotten over being Never Trump. Say something kind and you’ve sold out. Trump Derangement Syndrome works both ways. There are those who can never, ever commend the actions of the president and there are those who can never, ever find fault. Both are apologists to a particularly partisan madness. Many times this president does dumb things, mean things, and wrong things. But sometimes he gets things right. Rarely does this president get so much right over a couple of weeks. This is one of those times.

For those keeping score at home, President Trump has kicked the immigration ball back to Congress where the Constitution says it belongs. His staff may be working to sabotage any deal, but the deal should be structured in Congress, not the White House, according to the Constitution.

President Trump has also refused to certify the deal with Iran. It is particularly bemusing to watch many vocal opponents of the Iran Deal decry the president’s actions given how long they’ve wanted the deal scrapped. But because it was President Trump doing it, suddenly they oppose the very thing they have long wanted. Despite the cry from the left, President Trump did a great thing here.

He has also scrapped the ObamaCare birth control mandate that penalized Christians and others. Republicans have supported a plan to allow birth control over the counter, without a prescription, but the left is opposed to that. The president’s actions expose how the left is really not concerned with access to birth control and is really in the pocket of the abortion lobby.

Last, but certainly not least, President Trump ended the ObamaCare subsidies for insurance companies. Almost every media outlet except Fox has badly misreported the facts. Federal courts had already determined President Obama had no power to issue those subsidies. Congress had sued. So two out of three branches of government said the president had no power to do that and President Trump has now conceded the fight instead of defying a court order.

These are all good and commendable things and the president deserves praise for them. Many on the right who hate him will not give him the thanks he deserves, but he’s done great on these issues.

Most notable, I think, is what Stephen Miller (not the president’s advisor) noted on Twitter. Much of the criticism of President Trump over the ObamaCare subsidies has everything to do with preserving Obama’s legacy and nothing to do with the substance of what President Trump did or why. I would say this extends to the other issues as well. President Obama’s legacy can be so easily undone because he did it all without congressional legislation.

The beloved blue creature and his new friend, Gonger, will be operating a food truck together. In each segment, the pals receive a call from a child who wants to order a meal from their operation, Food & Wine reports. But, while preparing the dish, the pair will have to hit the road in their truck to find a main ingredient.

Through their travels, the team will explore places like a “cranberry bog, a pasta factories, an avocado farm,” the show said in a statement. At each of these locations, Cookie Monster and Gonger will learn how the ingredient is made by talking to a farmer or an artisan before being sent “home to get cooking.”

The goal is to help kids learn more about how food is made and through that knowledge, cultivate healthier eating habits.

The weird sun sparked a flurry of activity on social media, with one Instagram user commenting that “It looks like the apocalypse is coming!”

You might if you have multiple sclerosis.

People with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States and Canada are traveling to Russia for an experimental treatment that’s a potential cure for the disease.

However, there are still a number of risks involved.

Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) is a therapy for MS that has, in many cases, been shown to halt progression of the disease with a single treatment.

However, in North America, the procedure is still considered experimental and isn’t widely available. It’s also costly.

The lure of a cure

For individuals facing a potential lifetime of MS, the allure of a cure abroad is tantalizing.

According to Bruce Bebo, executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, HSCT treatment is promising. But he cautions there still aren’t enough rigorous clinical studies on it to weigh the real risks and benefits.

MS is a demyelinating autoimmune disease in which the body’s immune system begins to attack the myelin, the protective insulation of the nervous system.

These attacks cause scarring (sclerosis) that leads to a host of neurological symptoms from tremors and loss of vision, to difficulty with speech.

It’s typically diagnosed in individuals between the ages of 20 and 40.

HSCT is a complex procedure that requires a bone marrow transplant similar to that used by oncologists for certain blood cancers.

The treatment is an attempt to “reboot” the immune system and stop it from attacking the brain and spinal cord.

“One way to think about it is that you are reeducating and creating a new immune system,” Bebo told Healthline. “It appears that in many cases when you do this, that new immune system learns that the central nervous system isn’t dangerous anymore and it doesn’t attack it anymore.”

How the treatment works

In the first step of HSCT treatment, chemotherapy is used to stimulate the production of bone marrow stem cells and promote their release into the bloodstream. This blood is then drawn and stored.

The patient is then given a strong dose of more chemotherapy, most often in a hospital setting, for up to 11 days.

During that time, immune cells are either dramatically weakened or killed entirely.

Finally, the patient’s stored stem cells are infused back into the body, learning to leave the nervous system intact.

The process can be strenuous.

Patients must take antibiotics to fight off infections while their immune systems are suppressed.

They must also stay in the hospital for weeks at a time while their immune system rebuilds.

A recent study said that the average hospital stay after the stem cell infusion lasted between 10 and 160 days.

That may be a small price to pay to stop a chronic illness, especially for individuals diagnosed young.

There’s also the matter of the real price — as in dollars.

“I think [the reason] people are leaving the country has to do with cost,” said Bebo. “I’m aware of many people who although they have to fight tooth and nail to get it, can get their insurance company to cover most or all the costs of this procedure in the U.S. It’s expensive.”

The cost is in the six-figure range. Healthline previously reported that it could be done in the United States for about $125,000.

It’s a lot cheaper to go to Mexico or Russia to get HSCT therapy, where “they will perform the therapy for a fraction of the cost,” said Bebo.

Relapsing vs. progressive

There are also caveats to the treatment, dependent on the MS diagnosis.

Broadly speaking, there are two major types of MS: relapsing and progressive.

Relapsing, the more common form, is identified by intermittent “attacks” or exacerbations in which symptoms will worsen for a period and then dissipate.

As the disease progresses, the exacerbations get worse and the overall disability of the person increases.

Bebo describes progressive MS as a “slow, steady progression of disability.” It’s less common but significantly more difficult to treat.

“What little evidence we have at this point suggests that people with progressive MS don’t respond to HSCT,” said Bebo.

Typical drug regimens for relapsing MS, called disease modifying therapies (DMTs), also tend to be less effective for progressive MS.

This “gap,” as Bebo puts it, in treatment between progressive and relapsing MS may be driving medical tourism abroad.

Against doctors’ recommendations, patients may still elect to travel abroad to seek out HSCT for progressive MS.

New drugs, such as Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), have been approved more recently by the FDA for the treatment of progressive MS.

Some serious risks

HSCT treatment isn’t without risks.

It’s not a trivial procedure and has been known for its serious mortality risk.

A study from 2017 concluded that while the procedure showed significant benefit against MS progression, the overall transplant-related mortality rate was about 2 percent.

As the procedure has improved, so have mortality rates. An older 2002 study of 85 MS patients treated with HSCT documented seven deaths in the group — a mortality rate of about 8 percent.

“I think there are still many neurologists who remember the older studies, the high risk of mortality,” said Bebo, “and until there is a rigorous, well-controlled study that documents the effectiveness and mortality risk, then I think some neurologists are going to be hesitant to recommend the therapy.”

What the future holds

But Bebo and his colleagues at the MS society are also enthusiastic about the growing interest and research being done on HSCT.

“I do see the neurology community being more accepting of this approach than they have in the past.”

However, he emphasizes that HSCT isn’t an MS panacea.

Depending on the diagnosis, the procedure must find its way into established therapy methods.

While HSCT is available in the United States today, it could still be years before it’s easily accessible — and affordable.

“We really look forward to the day when we have results from a really well-controlled, rigorous clinical trial to really tell us once and for all what’s the full benefit of this, what are the full risks, and who is the person most likely to benefit from it,” said Bebo.

Until then, people living with MS may choose to seek out treatment abroad, where the chance at a permanent cure may already be available.

In the race against a chronic illness, the U.S. medical system may just be moving too slowly for the young and the desperate.

Now he's getting death threats. The Times delves into the research—first highlighted by the Economist in early September—and the many bones its many critics have to pick with it.

Kosinski and co-author Yilun Wang pulled 35,000 photos of white Americans from online dating sites (those looking for same-sex partners were classified as gay) and ran them through a ""widely used"" facial analysis program that turns the location, size, and shape of one's facial characteristics into numbers.

Humans who looked at the photos correctly identified a woman as gay or straight 54% of the time, and men 61%; the program, when given five photos per person, got it right 83% of the time for women and 91% for men.

One critic explains that while 91% might sound impressive, it's not. In a scenario where 50 out of every 1,000 people are gay, the program would identify 130 as gay (.91 correct times 50 and .09 wrong times 950); it would be right about 45 of those people, and wrong about 85.

Daphne Caruana Galizia, 53, exposed the island nation's links to offshore tax havens through the leaked Panama Papers.

Caruana Galizia had just driven away from her home in Mosta, a large town on Malta's main island, when the bomb went off, sending the vehicle's wreckage spiraling over a wall and into a field, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said.

Her death resulted from a ""barbaric attack"" that also amounted to an assault on freedom of expression, Muscat said. He said the journalist ""was one of my harshest critics, on a political and personal level"" as he denounced her slaying.

""Shocking doesn't begin to describe this,"" journalist Mark Micallef wrote on Twitter.

One of the topics she examined was the Maltese content in the Panama Papers leaked in 2016. She wrote that Muscat's wife, the country's energy minister and the government's chief-of-staff had offshore holdings in Panama to receive money from Azerbaijan.

Muscat and his wife, Michelle, denied they had companies in Panama.

The slain journalist had written a twice-weekly column for The Malta Independent since 1996 and wrote a blog, ""Running Commentary.""

A half hour before she was killed, she posted to her website an item about a libel claim the prime minister's chief of staff had brought against a former opposition over comments the latter made about corruption.

Caruana Galizia herself had been sued for libel over blog entries. Opposition leader Adrian Delia sued her over stories linking him to a prostitution racket in London. Economy Minister Chris Cardona claimed libel when she wrote that he visited a brothel while in Germany on government business.

Monday evening's Parliament session was scrapped, except for briefings about the bombing given by Muscat and Delia, who called the reporter's slaying a ""political murder."" Muscat said he has asked the U.S. government and the FBI for help investigating the car bombing.

Caruana Galizia is survived by her husband and three sons. One son, Matthew, was on the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists team that won the Pulitzer Prize for its work on the Panama Papers scandal. The leak exposed the identities of rich and powerful people around the world who allegedly had offshore holdings in Panama.

Caruana Galizia's family has asked the Courts of Malta to replace the magistrate assigned to conduct the inquiry into the journalist's death. The family said the magistrate, Consuelo Scerri Herrera, ""in her personal capacity, had launched judicial procedures against (Caruana Galizia) regarding comments she had written.""

Caruana Galizia for many years was a harsh critic of Malta's Labor party and government. More recently she had expanded her criticism to include the opposition Nationalist Party.

Her slaying drew swift denunciations in the tiny EU nation. ""Daphne played a vitally important role in unearthing serious allegations of money laundering and corruption in Malta, including those involving senior figures in the Maltese government,"" said Sven Giegold, a Greens member in the European Parliament.

Italian newsweekly L'Espresso, which has also written about alleged corruption linked to Malta, said the reporter's murder demonstrated that a well-documented expose' `'is perceived as a danger by the powerful and by organized crime.""

European Parliament President Antonio Tajani in a tweet called the development a ""tragic example of a journalist who sacrificed her life to search for the truth.""

An old proverb says a leader with no followers is “only taking a walk.”

If that’s the case, then the strutting President Trump has turned his presidency into a very lonely walk.

A Morning Consult poll released last week found Trump losing support in states he easily carried last year. He is down 23 points in Tennessee since his inauguration in January, down 21 points in Mississippi, down 20 in Kentucky, down 19 in Kansas and down 17 in Indiana.

Overall, 55 percent of the country disapproves of the job he is doing as president, according the most recent RealClearPolitics average. At the three-quarter mark of his first year in office, Trump is the least popular new president in history.

On Capitol Hill, House and Senate Republicans are also walking away from Trump.

A new Quinnipiac poll last week found that 49 percent of voters disapprove of the way Trump is handling taxes and just 37 percent approve.

In part, this is due to his attacks on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.

Then there are the threats to incumbent Republicans from Stephen Bannon, formerly Trump’s chief strategist.

Bannon said last week he plans to challenge incumbent Republican senators in seven states, including Arizona’s Jeff Flake, Mississippi’s Roger Wicker, Nebraska’s Deb Fischer, Nevada’s Dean Heller and Wyoming’s John Barrasso.

“Creating a civil war inside the Republican Party may feel good, but I think as a strategy, it is stunningly stupid,” former Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said of Bannon’s plan.

Speaking on Sean Hannity’s radio show, Gingrich stated the obvious: It would be better for the GOP if the president and his allies spent their time trying to beat incumbent Democratic senators.

Instead, Trump has whipped up a very public feud with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn. Trump tweeted that Corker lacks “the guts” to seek reelection. Trump also belittled Corker as having “begged” for his endorsement.

Corker denied that, shooting back that it is a “shame the White House has become an adult day care center.” He added that Trump has hurt U.S. foreign relations with his impetuous tweets on world affairs, including “things that are not true.”

Rather than let it go, Trump responded by tweeting: “The Failing @nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording his conversation. Was made to sound a fool, and that's what I am dealing with!”

Corker was not “set up” by the Times. A transcript showed the senator stating, “I understand we’re on the record.”

Now, commentators who are open to Trump are starting to walk away from his parade as well.

“Last time I checked, you are the president of the United States, so tweeting out these tacky insults just seems beneath you,” Neil Cavuto of Fox News said on his show last week. “You are running out of friends faster than you are running out of time. You might not like Bob Corker, but a lot of senators do, and you need those senators, sir.”

Even Trump’s personal friends are turning away from him.

Thomas Barrack told The Washington Post he was “shocked” and “stunned” by Trump’s recent comments.

“I tell him all the time: I don’t like the rhetoric,” said Barrack, who has been friends with Trump for decades, since they were both Manhattan real estate developers.

To win back some followers, Trump needs a win.

Polls show Americans favor tax reform. They want a simpler tax structure, fewer brackets and loopholes to be closed. Trump repeatedly promised to deliver tax reform during the campaign.

But once again he is strutting with no one behind him as he abandons tax reform. He is focused on tax cuts for the rich.

Polls show that is not popular.

The New York Times analysis of the tax cut plan concluded it would be a “huge windfall for the wealthiest Americans” and “not directly benefit the bottom third of the population.” Polls show Americans oppose tax cuts for the rich.

A new Quinnipiac poll last week found that 49 percent of voters disapprove of the way Trump is handling taxes and just 37 percent approve.

Trump has also failed to deliver on his campaign promise to build a southern border wall and have Mexico pay for it. He continues to say it will get done. But, again, polls show voters don’t want a wall.

Similarly, Trump seems unaware that a majority of Americans now approve of the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, and want its problems fixed so it can continue.

Instead, having failed to win a full repeal of the health care law from the Republican majority in Congress, he signed an executive order allowing low-cost insurance to be sold across state lines.

That has been tried before and has a sad history of consumer fraud and regulatory confusion.

So it’s no wonder Trump now walks alone. He remains a celebrity figure for his hardcore base. But 10 months into his presidency, Republicans are starting to drift away as he fails to deliver on nearly every major campaign promise he made.

That’s not my opinion. That’s a demonstrable fact.

Snuggling in bed under a layer of cozy covers makes for a deliciously warm feeling, especially in the face of unrelenting winter chill. If you’re in the market for a new blanket or quilt, be sure to read this guide for advice on how to choose the best bedding for your needs.

Blankets

Shopping for a blanket can feel fairly straightforward. And maybe it is. But with a little information, you’ll be more likely to bring home a product that you’ll cherish and love using.

Start with size. Typically, you’re looking for a blanket that will cover the top and sides of the mattress with a few extra inches to tuck securely underneath. Be sure to measure your mattress before you shop.

Compare fabrics. You can choose from a wide range of materials, and narrowing them down should depend on your preferences. You may suffer from allergies or prefer a smoother texture over a fuzzier one, for example.

○ Blankets made of wool are warm and provide excellent insulation on cold winter nights. Being a natural fiber, wool is breathable. Another useful quality is its ability to wick sweat and moisture away from the body, promoting a dry and warm experience. Woolen blankets are naturally fire-resistant, which makes them relatively safe to use around heat sources.

○ Usually composed of a polyester blend, synthetic fleece blankets are popular because they feel plush, velvety soft and warm. They also can wick moisture from your body, keeping you warm, dry and snug through a cold night. Synthetic fleece blankets are lighter than their woolen counterparts. It pays to ask for ones that don’t pill (produce tiny balls of fibers from abrasion). On the downside, synthetic fleece can conduct static electricity and can attract hair and dust.

○ Ideal for warm weather, a 100 percent cotton blanket is also great during spring and autumn or with air conditioning in the room. Since cotton is a natural fiber, it’s breathable. It’s also hypoallergenic and soft, making it a smart choice for babies, allergy sufferers or those with sensitive skin. When buying a cotton blanket, consider yarn size, fiber quality, thread count and construction. Typically, a good cotton blanket will have a higher thread count.

○ Blankets made of acrylic are a great alternative to their woolen or cashmere counterparts since they’re light, hypoallergenic and warm. What’s more, they are machine-washable and retain their colors.

Do a quality check. “You can really feel a good-quality textile in your hands,” says Kate Pascoe Squires, director of Australian textile company Kate & Kate. “If it feels beautiful, it usually will be. If it’s flimsy, thin or shiny, you know it’s not going to last. Be prepared for balling and pills after the first wash. Good-quality natural fibers will wash beautifully and offer you a gorgeous product for years to come.”

Compare prices. You can pick up a twin blanket for under $20, but it won’t last very long, Pascoe Squires says. “You can also purchase stunning midrange blankets that are great quality but won’t break the bank. In terms of price, you should look at between [$60 and $120] for these items. Then there are super-premium blankets, which can run up to thousands of dollars. The price reflects the beautiful materials used to knit these items, usually stunning wools, creating real heirloom pieces.”

Electric Blankets

If you’d rather invest in an electric blanket, here’s what you need to know:

○ Electric blankets use an integrated heating device to spread warmth through your bed.

○ Electric blankets for children are normally available and labeled as waterproof electric blankets.

○ Thanks to the overheat protection feature, your blanket should sense any abnormal temperature changes and switch off if it gets too hot. However, you should never leave your blanket on all night.

○ Fitted blankets remain flat and taut through the night and feel the same as the mattress underneath it. Unfitted blankets won’t fit around the corners or provide the same level of comfort as fitted ones.

○ Before making a purchase, lie on the blanket to feel its thickness, and check that the wiring is undamaged.

○ Some blankets are available with dual controls, so each partner can control the temperature on one side of the bed.

○ If your blanket has removable controls, you can safely wash it as well.

○ If your feet feel cold easily, look for a blanket with warm foot zones, which focus more heat at the bottom of the blanket.

Quilts



Quilts offer luxurious comfort and add visual warmth to your bedroom. A quilt usually consists of three layers: a fabric backing, a layer of soft batting and a fabric top. Quilting is essentially the art of stitching or tying these layers together, often in sync with the pattern of the top.

Consider the user and the climate. Typically, adults prefer heavier quilts, whereas children are comfortable with lightweight ones. When you’re buying a quilt for your child, remember that you’ll be dealing with spills and other messes.

It pays to factor in climate. Are you looking for a quilt for very cold nights or just cool weather? Do you need something that is season-specific or something that works for all kinds of weather?

Know the types of filling. Quilts filled with natural materials such as cotton, wool, feathers and down are more breathable, softer, lighter and more comfortable. They also will last longer than synthetic or microfiber fillings. Cotton makes an excellent choice for lightweight quilts.

Although down and feather fillings provide the most warmth, they are more expensive and may not be ideal for those with allergies. In these instances, options like microfiber work well since they imitate the look and feel of down without attracting dust. Cotton and wool are naturally hypoallergenic options.

RELATED: Duvet vs. Coverlet - What’s the Difference?

If you’re tired of alternating between a lightweight quilt for summer and a heavier one for winter, consider an all-season quilt.

Care for your quilt. Air your quilt every couple of weeks to keep it in great shape and enhance its longevity. Certain quilts, such as down, are best dry-cleaned, while some can be machine-washed as well. A duvet cover can protect your quilt and add to your room’s decor. Remember to read the manufacturer’s care guide that comes with your purchase.",How to choose the best bedding for cold winter nights,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/how-to-choose-best-bedding-for-cold-winter-nights.html

Earlier this month San Diego granted paramedics the authority to administer vaccines to the area’s at-risk populations. The measure allows for paramedics to deliver necessary doses under the supervision of nurses and at vaccination events.

While many cases of hepatitis A stem from contaminated foods, the current outbreak focuses on person-to-person transmission. People without symptoms can carry the illness, and is spread through contact with an infected person’s feces. The virus can spread through food, objects, sex or sharing drug paraphilia. San Diego implemented power-washing streets and installed hand-washing stations, with plans to open an encampment for the homeless equipped with tents, showers, restrooms, food security and social services.

Medical experts warned the outbreak could last for more than a year.

In their years on HGTV’s show, ""Fixer Upper,"" hosts Chip and Joanna Gaines achieved far more than merely getting Americans to embrace open floor plans and shiplap; they made marriage look fun again.

The Texas couple’s decision to end the show after soon-to-be-aired Season Five ensures it won’t devolve into them simply playing certain roles, trying to recapture the magic of earlier seasons.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

“This is just us recognizing that we need to catch our breath for a moment,” the Gaineses wrote on their blog. “Our plan is to take this time to shore up and strengthen the spots that are weak, rest the places that are tired and give lots of love and attention to both our family and our businesses.” In a video accompanying their blog post, Joanna spoke specifically about how quickly the couple’s four children were growing, noting that their eldest was almost a teenager and expressing how they were ready to “hunker down with our kiddos” for a time.

This is exactly what made the Gaineses so appealing. They do care about time with their family—and they’re not the kind of reality TV professionals who want to turn their family into a permanent fixture on the screen by being “on” all the time. Part of the couple’s appeal has always been their family-friendliness, their down-to-earth qualities, and the clear priority they give to living in accordance with their values.

But their decision to end the show is also appealing because the Gaineses themselves have changed: in the years since ""Fixer Upper"" began, they’ve become involved in multiple home goods lines, launched a magazine, written a book, and even opened a bakery in their hometown of Waco, Texas. While I’m happy for the Gaines’ success, the fact is they’re not the same couple facing regular problems that they were when the show launched—and frankly, yes, a reality show true to their own current reality (exploring questions like what mega chain is worth trusting for a home goods line partnership, for example) would simply not be as relatable or enjoyable to watch.

But I’m grateful for the years they gave us on ""Fixer Upper.""

There’s a real dearth of shows or, frankly, any entertainment that depicts marriage as fun. And while no doubt the Gaineses amped it up a little for the camera, the dynamics under-girding the show—the push and pull between the goofy Chip and the more serious Joanna—certainly seemed authentic, as did the joy they had in just hanging out with each other, occasionally trying to get a rise out of one another.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

In her 2011 book, ""Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?"" TV writer and actress Mindy Kaling included a section, “C’mon, Married People,” in which she wrote:

""I don’t want to hear about the endless struggles to keep sex exciting, or the work it takes to plan a date night. I want to hear that you guys watch every episode of The Bachelorettetogether in secret shame, or that one got the other hooked on Breaking Bad and if either watches it without the other, they’re dead meat. I want to see you guys high-five each other like teammates on a recreational softball team you both do for fun. I’m not saying that marriage should always be easy. But we seem to get so gloomily worked up about it these days.""

Kaling, whose own show ""The Mindy Project"" unfortunately devolved into a gloomy look at the hardships of relationships these days, concluded with the following plea:

“Married people, it’s up to you. It’s entirely on your shoulders to keep this sinking institution afloat. It’s a stately old ship, and a lot of people, like me, want to get on board. Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.”

And that’s exactly what the Gaineses have done on ""Fixer Upper."" In an era when marriage rates are down, people flirt with notions of open marriages and polygamy, and singles scour Tinder for one-night-stands, a show about home renovation unexpectedly became a celebration of how a husband and wife could be friends and partners, could complement each other and have a genuinely good time just hanging out with each other. In their interactions with each other and their four children, the Gaineses proved happiness isn’t impossible for an old-fashioned family in our modern era.",What Chip and Joanna Gaines teach us about marriage,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/05/what-chip-and-joanna-gaines-teach-us-about-marriage.html

___This story has been corrected to reflect that Nations is jailed in Teller County, Colorado, not El Paso County.","Indiana investigators are looking into whether a man arrested in Colorado for allegedly threatening people along a hiking trail with a hatchet could be linked to the February killing of two teenage hikers in Indiana.

Sgt. Kim Riley, of the Indiana State Police, said the agency is speaking with Colorado authorities about 31-year-old Daniel Nations to determine if he could be a suspect in the killings of 14-year-old Liberty German and 13-year-old Abigail Williams.

Nations, a convicted sex offender who has lived in Indiana, was arrested Monday in Woodland Park, Colorado, in connection with recent cases where people were threatened with a hatchet on a popular hiking trail near Monument, which is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Denver.

Riley said the first question is whether Nations was in Indiana on Feb. 13, when the teens vanished while hiking near their hometown of Delphi, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of Indianapolis. Their bodies were found the next day.

""We have to look at whether he was even here at that time and then we'll go from there,"" Riley said Thursday.

In a news release, the State Police cautioned that it has received thousands of photos of people alleged to look like a composite FBI sketch released July 17 of a man who is considered the main suspect, and that it investigates all of those tips.

""We will give the same attention to the person arrested in Colorado, but right now there is nothing that definitively connects this person to our investigation,"" the statement said.

Nations is jailed in Teller County, Colorado, on a charge of possession of a weapon by a previous offender. The charge isn't related to the hatchet threats, but threat-related charges are pending, said Jacqueline Kirby, a spokeswoman for the El Paso County Sheriff's Office.

It wasn't immediately clear if Nations has an attorney who could speak on his behalf.

He was pulled over and arrested Monday in a car with expired Indiana plates, and KCNC-TV in Denver reports that his wife and two children were with him in the car.

No arrests have been made in the killings of the Indiana teens, who were slain after a relative dropped them off for a day of hiking near Delphi. Authorities have not disclosed details of their killings.

Police previously released two grainy photos of the suspect and an audio recording of a man saying ""down the hill."" That evidence came from German's cellphone.

Her grandmother, Becky Patty, told WXIN-TV that the family is aware of Nations' arrest.

""We pray that the truth will be revealed and we will keep searching for answers and passing out fliers until Abby and Libby's killer is behind bars,"" she said.

Nations was convicted of indecent exposure in 2007 for exposing himself in front of a woman in a Spartanburg County, South Carolina, parking lot, according to Indiana's sex offender registry. Prosecutors in Johnson County, Indiana, charged him Wednesday with failing to register as a sex offender in the county after he moved to a new address.

Nations has convictions in Indiana on drug, domestic battery and public indecency charges, online court records show.

He pleaded guilty in January 2016 in Bartholomew County, Indiana, to public indecency for allegedly fondling himself in a public place. A message was left Thursday for the attorney who represented Daniels in that case.

South Korea has announced it is building “blackout bombs.” And by doing so, the country has sent a clear message to North Korea that it has the power to “turn off the lights” throughout the country whenever South Korea chooses.

North Korea would be paralyzed. Electrical power plants would suddenly stop. Everything depending on electricity would instantly be shut off.

North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un would be cut off from his population and no longer able to communicate with his citizens since television and radio would be offline.

Paralyze North Korea

Without electricity, North Korean leadership, government and military would be instantly and utterly crippled.

For the North Korean military, this weapon would mean things like air defenses, radar, communication systems, transportation and much more would be unusable. There would be no military or government computers, no email and no way to transmit securely military communication.

With the runway lights shut off, it would make it very difficult for the North Korean military to mount an air force response. Hospitals, military and civilian alike, would be without critical power and rely on back-up generators – if they have them.

‘Lights Out’ for the North Korean Population

This sort of bomb would have widespread devastating effects on the North Korean population.

In modern life, many things rely on electricity. North Koreans would have no electricity, no lights, no water purification, no sewage management and with the looming freezing temperatures of winter … they would have no heating.

South Korea's Agency for Defence Development has obtained the necessary ingredients and

technologies to make these graphite bombs and is ready to develop them, Yonhap news agency reported. These bombs will be one element of the Kill Chain pre-emptive strike program.

So what is a blackout bomb?

Blackout bombs are graphite bombs – they are also sometimes called “soft bombs” because they are non-lethal weapons that target electricity supply, not humans.

The electricity attack system is used to shut down an enemy’s power supply. Once unleashed, the bombs can instantly paralyze an enemy’s regime.

Making Kim Jong Un Look Powerless to his People

These graphite bombs have simply enormous impact.

In general, there is no real material damage. Rather than blow things up, graphite bombs short circuit the targets.

But the impact of a country suddenly going dark can be very powerful.

And while less visible, but by no means less important, these graphite bomb weapons have a major psychological impact.

Kim Jong Un hardly looks like a powerful leader to his population when another country can choose to turn his nation’s power off whenever they want to or need to.

So while attacking the electrical grid has direct impact on military capabilities, it could also put immediate and intense psychological pressure on North Korea’s leadership and its population.

How does it work?

The bombs rely on the same ingredient as the humble, everyday, ordinary pencil – graphite.

Inside the bomb is graphite filament and graphite is a highly efficient electricity conductor.

Unlike conventional explosives, graphite bombs do not strike the target and blow up. The graphite bomb instead explodes in the air above a power plant.

When it explodes, the graphite filaments are so fine that they seem like a cloud. The bomb unleashes this cloud of graphite particles across the electricity system.

The graphite causes short circuits and electrical discharges, blowing safety devices and burning out essential parts in the electrical supply. The blackout graphite cloud can hit power plants, transformer stations, power lines and more.

The result is darkness. A nation’s electricity suddenly stops without warning.

PODCAST: FEARLESS FREEDOM WITH SPECIAL FORCES SNIPER AND ‘HUNTING HITLER’ STAR TIM KENNEDY

Is the blackout permanent?

The carbon-graphite particles can be easily brushed away. Short circuits can be removed. Blown switching stations can be replaced. But repairing the system can be costly and take time.

So a blackout is not necessarily permanent if North Korea took action to fix the power.

However, South Korea could just continue to drop graphite bombs so that every time North Korea came close to restoring power or managed to do so, the bombs would flick the nation’s switch and turn off the lights again.

But do they actually work?

Blackout bombs have been used in war already and been very successful.

They were first used by the United States in Iraq during the 1990 Gulf War. They succeeded in disabling about 85 percent of Iraq’s facilities that supplied electricity.

NATO has also deployed graphite bombs. They were used in former Yugoslavia in 1999 where they stopped about 70 percent of the national grid electricity supply.

The American version of the graphite bomb is the BLU-114/B and it works sort of like a cluster bomb. The bomb scatters many soda can-sized canisters that could be described as ""sub-munitions."" These canisters spray the fine carbon fiber that cause the short circuits.

The graphite bomb approach dates farther back that the Gulf War. It was under consideration during the Cold War as a possible method to defeat Soviet nuclear power plants.",Will one single bomb stop North Korea?,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/17/will-one-single-bomb-stop-north-korea.html

“Harvey Weinstein is our sacrificial beast.”This article originally appeared in the New York Post's Page Six.","Lauren Holly joined the long list of actresses to accuse Harvey Weinstein of dirty behavior, saying he disrobed and used the toilet in front of her – then showered and asked for a massage.

The “Beautiful Girls” actress described her sickening encounter with the pervy producer in a hotel room during her appearance on Canadian talk show “The Social.”

“I realized that I had a responsibility that I needed to come forward and say it,” she said (via Variety). “I didn’t want to go chasing after some publication, I didn’t want to post it on social media, it seemed like my voice was too quiet if I did that.”

Holly, 53, said she was stunned when she read the New York Times exposé on Weinstein because it reminded her of her brush with the brute.

“This happened in the late 1990s; I was in my 30s. I was not a young ingenue, and I was certainly not new to Hollywood; I was a seasoned, Hollywood person,” said Holly, who had already worked with the filthy filmmaker on “Beautiful Girls.”

She met Weinstein at a hotel to discuss her future with his company and described it as normal – at first.

“Everything was absolutely professional from the get-go,” she said.

But after some small talk, Holly said, Weinstein asked to be excused, then returned wearing a hotel bathrobe.

“No doubt it was odd,” she said. “However, when he walked in and he was in the bathrobe, he said, ‘OK, let’s get to it, this is what we’ve got going on at my company, these are the scripts we have in the pipeline, this is what I think might be right for you,’ and he gestured for me to follow him.”

Holly said she followed him into the suite’s bedroom, where he dropped his robe, went into the bathroom and used the toilet.

“At this point my head was exploding,” she said. “He keeps the conversation going, he finishes, he turns on the shower, he gets in the shower. He’s continually talking to me, he’s in the shower washing himself. Leaning out, asking me for responses.

“My head is going crazy at this point. He’s acting like the situation is normal. He’s acting like we’re having a normal encounter. I’m thinking to myself, ‘Am I just a prude? Am I supposed to be more open minded?’ I didn’t quite know how to handle myself at that moment.”

Weinstein then got out of the shower, dried himself and approached her while stark naked, she said.

“The adrenaline rush I felt, I wanted to flee, I was scared. He told me that I looked stressed and he thought maybe I could use a massage, maybe I could give him a massage,” she continued. “I began just sort of babbling like I was a child, I think it was just the fear.”

She told him she wasn’t a licensed masseuse and suggested that he could call the front desk to have one sent for him.

But Weinstein began to threaten her, she said, stating that she needed to “keep him as [her] ally” and that it would be a “bad decision” if she left the room.

At that point, Holly said, she “pushed him and ran.”

The actress later went to a previously planned dinner with other Hollywood types and told them why she was distraught. She said they told her that since Weinstein hadn’t raped or assaulted her, she should “keep [her] mouth shut because it’s Harvey Weinstein.”

Holly said she was so horrified by the incident that she stayed away from film for a number of years.

She also described a later experience with Weinstein, in which the two stayed at the same hotel and he asked to meet her – but she avoided him like the plague.

“Things need to change,” the actress said on Monday’s show. “Harvey Weinstein is our sacrificial beast.”

THE BEST WAY TO GRILL CORN? GO AGAINST THIS INSTINCT

“My wife and I wanted to reinvent the farm, and we saw that the kids were coming into the business and we needed to have more income coming in,"" says Lentini. ""I read about someone doing it out West, and that’s what gave me the idea.”

Lentini Farms is located in Newton, N.J., and during the fall season its 10-acre corn maze (complete with with 10-foot corn stalks) attracts adventure-seekers far and wide — and young and old.

“We’re always busy!” Lentini now says.

The adventure doesn't stop once visitors are done with the corn maze, either — although that alone can take between 20 minutes to 2 hours. Visitors can also stop by the pumpkin fields to pick their own pumpkins, or take a haunted hayride across a terrifying swath of Lentini Farms.

In a fair contest, candidates backed by dictator Nicolás Maduro would have been crushed. But Venezuela is now a police state at war with its people. The truth has little chance on a good day, even less on a so-called election day.

This is not to say opposition victories were impossible. As we went to press, results had not yet been announced. But Maduro controls the national electoral council (CNE) and therefore has significant power to influence the outcome. In states the regime considers strategically important, he will put his thumb on the scale as necessary. He might also allow some opposition victories to support his claim that Venezuela remains a democracy.

To interpret Sunday’s results requires context. Remember that this election was held—10 months after its regularly scheduled date—to ward off European Union sanctions. Maduro sought to showcase a fair election so that the EU will back his continuing charade of “dialogue” with the opposition. An international community that is paying attention won’t fall for it. Sunday’s exercise in the Cuba-backed dictatorship was a sham.

Pamela Dee Gaudry was on a flight toward Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport when she learned the body of a fallen soldier — 29-year-old Army Staff Sgt. Dusting Wright — was on her plane.

DELTA AIRLINES PAYS WOMAN $4,000 TO GIVE UP HER SEAT

Gaudry, the wife of a deceased Navy captain, wanted to honor the Special Forces soldier who was among four U.S. troops killed in an attack in Niger on Oct. 4, by singing the national anthem. She went around the cabin asking each passenger if they would join her in singing for the fallen soldier.

""I thought it would be so amazing if we sang as they were getting off,"" Gaudry said. ""It's a great honor to the boy's parents, wife and perhaps children.""

Some people were enthusiastic about singing and said they would join while others chose not to participate.

As the flight neared its destination, Gaudry says the chief flight attendant came up to her and informed her it was against Delta’s policy to sing the national anthem. The flight attendant said some people on the flight were from other countries and may be offended by them singing the national anthem. The staff also made an announcement to the cabin, instructing everyone to stay in their seats and remain quiet.

Gaudry said many were upset, and one passenger told her “all we can do is pray.”

""I'm humiliated by my lack of courage to sing the national anthem in my own country on American soil, with a deceased soldier on the plane. I wish I could have been an example for my children,"" Gaudry said. ""I’m glad my former husband is deceased because he would have been profoundly disappointed in me.""

Angered, Gaudry posted a video on Facebook once her plane landed, explaining the incident. Her video has since gone viral, garnering nearly one million views and the attention of Delta.

In a statement obtained by Fox News, a spokesperson for Delta Air Lines has confirmed that Delta does not have a policy the prevents people from singing the national anthem, and that they have reached out to Gaudry regarding the incident.

""Our employees worldwide take great pride in Delta’s longstanding support of the military. The respectful ceremony of the Delta Honor Guard is one symbol of Delta’s pledge to the men and women of the armed forces, and it represents our broad commitment to our veterans and active-duty service members,"" writes Delta in its statement.

""Delta does not have a policy regarding the national anthem. We have reached out to the customer and are looking into this situation.""

Gaudry says the airline did indeed contact her about the flight, offering an apology and explaning that the flight attendant had been misinformed — it is not company policy to prevent passengers from singing the national anthem.

""Evidently, they had a flight attendant that made some bad decisions in trying to make this situation go away. They are going to do some training for the future,"" she said. ""Delta was very reverent and let the honor guards do a wonderful thing to honor each and every soldier that comes home with this beautiful tribute. For just this reason, I personally do not believe in a boycott of Delta.""

""Delta has apologized to me. Profusely. I accept. Like many things in life … it should have been handled differently. I am not throwing any stones,” she added.

BOILING RIVER OF WINE FLOWS THROUGH BURNED DOWN CALIFORNIA WINERY

The wildfires ravaging northern California’s wine country for more than a week killed at least 40 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses. Most of the deaths were reported in Sonoma.

Homeowners came back to their houses over the weekend to find them completely demolished or damaged --but, in many cases, still standing. Tom Andrews told The Associated Press he was in “disbelief” to find his house still standing despite other surrounding structures having been completely destroyed.

""It was disbelief and just feeling like the luckiest guy on earth,"" Andrews said. ""I can't believe, I mean, total destruction 50 feet away and to have our house still standing here.""

Evacuation orders were lifted Monday night in two neighborhoods in Sonoma County, though the firefighters were still trying to put out the blaze. About 11,000 firefighters have been working to extinguish the wildfires.

He added: “A lot of people died over our flag. We’re able to voice our opinion because of it. If you’re going to show respect for anything, do it for the national anthem.”

Hanson has a track record of designing and digging massive messages – many political – using his old Massey tractor on his 850-acre farm.

And Hanson doesn’t use GPS or any technology for the work, which he says “works out pretty good in a harvested bean field.”

Then he flies his two-seater plane, and if his design passes the test, he snaps a pic with a Cannon camera and posts it on Facebook. He said he's only been unsuccessful twice.

Hanson told Fox News he got his “We Stand for the National Anthem” message right on the second try. During the first attempt, he was interrupted by a passerby with only two letters to go. He soon relocated to another section of the field.

Hanson said he initially wanted to add an addendum -- “We kneel at the cross” -- but the plan was foiled by the first frost of the season.

Hanson said, weather permitting, he plans to add that phrase soon.

Hanson and his wife, Darlene, are Lutherans and attend church regularly. He also describes himself as a Republican and Trump supporter, and he had the chance to get a picture of the president when Trump came to North Dakota for a tax reform speech in September.

“I was 20 feet away from him,” Hanson said. “It was a good meeting and the president stayed on script.”

Hanson said he believes Trump is trying to do well, but faces a “continuous battle” in Washington, D.C. And Hanson said he's doing all he can to send his support from his Edgeley farm.

Some of his previous messages include “Drain the Swamp,” “Blue Lives Matter,” “Feel the Bern,” “GOP, get your act together,” and “Vote Trump.”

He said his Prince symbol, plowed after the singer passed away, was one of his most popular for fans all over the world, but he caught a lot of flak for his “Never Hillary” message.

I know how this works. Say something unfavorable to the president and you’ve never gotten over being Never Trump. Say something kind and you’ve sold out. Trump Derangement Syndrome works both ways. There are those who can never, ever commend the actions of the president and there are those who can never, ever find fault. Both are apologists to a particularly partisan madness. Many times this president does dumb things, mean things, and wrong things. But sometimes he gets things right. Rarely does this president get so much right over a couple of weeks. This is one of those times.

For those keeping score at home, President Trump has kicked the immigration ball back to Congress where the Constitution says it belongs. His staff may be working to sabotage any deal, but the deal should be structured in Congress, not the White House, according to the Constitution.

President Trump has also refused to certify the deal with Iran. It is particularly bemusing to watch many vocal opponents of the Iran Deal decry the president’s actions given how long they’ve wanted the deal scrapped. But because it was President Trump doing it, suddenly they oppose the very thing they have long wanted. Despite the cry from the left, President Trump did a great thing here.

He has also scrapped the ObamaCare birth control mandate that penalized Christians and others. Republicans have supported a plan to allow birth control over the counter, without a prescription, but the left is opposed to that. The president’s actions expose how the left is really not concerned with access to birth control and is really in the pocket of the abortion lobby.

Much of the criticism of President Trump over the ObamaCare subsidies has everything to do with preserving Obama’s legacy and nothing to do with the substance of what President Trump did or why.

Last, but certainly not least, President Trump ended the ObamaCare subsidies for insurance companies. Almost every media outlet except Fox has badly misreported the facts. Federal courts had already determined President Obama had no power to issue those subsidies. Congress had sued. So two out of three branches of government said the president had no power to do that and President Trump has now conceded the fight instead of defying a court order.

These are all good and commendable things and the president deserves praise for them. Many on the right who hate him will not give him the thanks he deserves, but he’s done great on these issues.

Most notable, I think, is what Stephen Miller (not the president’s advisor) noted on Twitter. Much of the criticism of President Trump over the ObamaCare subsidies has everything to do with preserving Obama’s legacy and nothing to do with the substance of what President Trump did or why. I would say this extends to the other issues as well. President Obama’s legacy can be so easily undone because he did it all without congressional legislation.

I now see I was lucky to have been a Boy Scout at that time instead of today.
Rest in Peace Boy Scouts.","Editor's note: The following column originally appeared on The Resurgent.

We all knew this was coming. The Boy Scouts of America stood for over a century on its strong foundation of Judeo-Christian values, growing boys into young men, and young men into leaders. However, in recent years the BSA has allowed cracks to form in that foundation.

From the lifting of the ban on openly gay boys from joining the organization, to the sanctioning of openly gay adult leaders, to the encouragement of so-called “transgendered” boys to join, the BSA’s moral foundation has been rapidly and steadily eroding into dust.

As soon as the BSA changed the definition of the phrase “morally straight” in the generations-old Scout Oath back in 2013, allowing for homosexual membership, we all knew that this first compromise would not be the last. We all knew that it was only a matter of time before the BSA compromised itself into oblivion.

That day has now arrived.

From the BSA’s website:

""Today, the Boy Scouts of America Board of Directors unanimously approved to welcome girls into its iconic Cub Scout program and to deliver a Scouting program for older girls that will enable them to advance and earn the highest rank of Eagle Scout.""

This is incredibly disappointing news, but in light of the BSA’s changes over the last few years, it isn’t at all surprising. It does, however, mark a complete transformation for the organization. The Boy Scouts has always been exclusively for boys. As Ben Shapiro famously noted, it’s in the name.

There are plenty of organizations out there for all different varieties of youth. The Boy Scouts even have several co-ed programs for both boys and girls. The girls already have the Girl Scouts. If the Girl Scouts isn’t working, why not work to fix that organization instead? There is absolutely no need for the Boy Scouts to change who they are to be “inclusive.”

What now separates the Boy Scouts from any other youth organization? The BSA has now effectively rendered obsolete both the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts. If the Boy Scouts is a better youth organization for girls, why would any girl ever want to join the Girl Scouts?

More incredibly, I have to wonder why any parent would want their young teenage girls camping in the woods with young teenage boys? Who exactly is okay with this?

As an Eagle Scout myself, this is an incredibly difficult piece for me to write. My fondest memories from my youth come from my time in Boy Scouts. I learned a great deal about myself, about leadership, and about manhood in those years. The friendships I made with both adult leaders and fellow Scouts can never be replaced. Earning the rank of Eagle Scout in 2002 was the greatest achievement of my life at the time. Another honor was when my beloved Scout troop invited me back to town to participate in its centennial celebration earlier this year. My scouting experiences have guided me throughout my adulthood and will continue to do so.

I now see I was lucky to have been a Boy Scout at that time instead of today. Those experiences would not have been the same had the BSA not been so strict on its membership policies. It is important for boys and young men to grow together free from the distraction of girls.

I suspect the Almighty Dollar now motivates BSA more than the Almighty. Membership (and revenue) has been declining steadily for years. Suddenly membership eligibility is now opened to a whole new demographic. Draw your own conclusions there.

This is what the Left does best: target and destroy everything good in America. They cannot compete with us on ideas, so they have to eliminate everything that makes us who we are. If they were truly motivated to provide girls, homosexuals, and “transgenders,” with the same experiences Boy Scouts provides, then they would form their own youth organization. But it isn’t really about that, is it?

She was prescribed painkillers, and then approached her mother when she was 18 and admitted to using heroin, the news outlet reported.

Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it.
Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do.
But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","I sat on a parenting panel last month with a well-known and widely respected counselor by the name of Sissy Goff, M.Ed, LPC-MHSP. She is the Director of Child & Adolescent Counseling at Daystar in Nashville and when asked about the biggest issue facing kids today, she confirmed what you’ve probably read about recently on your news feed or even your Facebook feed – the increasing anxiety epidemic in our country.

But it’s not just an epidemic among our kids. It’s an epidemic among us -- their parents.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults.

In a recent article entitled “Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering from Severe Anxiety” we glean significant insight into the anxiety epidemic:

I’ll just share just two key points from the article:

* Privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic.

* For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop.’ Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.

If you’re reading this article as a mom, I imagine it breaks your heart like it breaks mine (as the mother of four boys who range in age from toddler to teenager) to learn that the pressure our kids are under “is relentless and getting worse.” Of course, I think we already assumed this to be true. But knowing it to be true leaves us responsible to do something to fight against it.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

See, we parents aren’t the only ones linking accomplishment to acceptance and success to significance. Our kids are attempting to answer the question, “Is who I am enough?” by how well they perform on the field, how much they excel in school, and how many likes they get on their Instagram feed.

They are attempting to answer that question, “Is who I am enough?” by proving they can do enough and be enough. Whatever “enough” is. Because you and I both know enough is never enough when the goal is perpetual perfection.

The primary message our kids receive is that they’d better be the best at everything, and this leaves them afraid to reveal their inadequacies and insecurities—and hiding behind the best version of themselves.

In turn, parents of anxious teens feel helpless and hopeless, questioning all of the steps we are -- or aren’t -- taking. Our confidence as moms crumbles as we try to help our kids navigate the battles they have to fight and the mountains they have to climb.

We are constantly second guessing ourselves: “Have I done too much? Have I not done enough? Am I helping or am I hurting my child?”

Our anxiety escalates and overflows into our parenting and onto our kids, who then take our anxiety on top of their own.

I won’t pretend to even begin to be able to solve this for us here. I don’t have all the answers. Not even a little bit. But I do have this one nugget – which is the primary message woven into my new book, ""Mom Set Free,"" and I believe it to be true with everything in me.

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.

It starts with us. It doesn’t end with us. But we are part of the solution.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

Of course, some kids are just more prone to perfection seeking than others. Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it. But often, we parents play a role in the pressure -- and therefore, anxiety -- our kids feel, so we have to be willing to take an honest look at how we pile our own pressure onto our kids.

And ultimately, it is our responsibility to help our kids push back the pressure they face with the truth of God’s Word. I am not at all suggesting that therapy and medication aren’t part of the solution. They often times are. But please let us not forget the alive and powerful Word of God that has the absolute power to show us where our significance comes from and ultimately set us free from proving our worth and our value in our performance.

Kids who constantly feel like they just don't measure up and who feel they have “everything” to prove need to be told – over and over again - they actually have “nothing” to prove. Because this pressure to prove our value and worth has left parents and children alike longing for what all our hearts most crave:

• to be known—truly and deeply known

• to be accepted—for who they are, not who they wish they were to be loved—with no strings attached

This isn’t sentimental fluff. This is solid truth from which freedom springs. There is absolutely no denying the inherent and deepest longing every human soul holds.

If we want to raise kids who find freedom from the pressure to get it ALL right in order to be accepted and welcomed, then we are going to need to walk in that freedom first. Or at least be willing to discover how to walk in that freedom alongside our kids.

We need to know that failing doesn’t make us failures and succeeding doesn’t make us significant. At least not in the eyes of our Creator -- the only One whose opinion of us really matters in the end.

In God’s eyes we are of great worth, not because of anything we have or haven’t done, but because of what has been done for us in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

The cross has the final word on our value. Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do. But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","America's teen anxiety epidemic is heartbreaking.

Yes, the issue is serious, but as long as a hacker isn't specifically looking to spy on your data, you should not worry about it.

The proof-of-concept exploit is called KRACK (or Key Reinstallation Attacks), according to Ars Technica. An advisory from US-CERT explains that the hack should be publicly disclosed on Monday:

US-CERT has become aware of several key management vulnerabilities in the 4-way handshake of the Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) security protocol. The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities includes decryption, packet replay, TCP connection hijacking, HTTP content injection, and others. Note that as protocol-level issues, most or all correct implementations of the standard will be affected. The CERT/CC and the reporting researcher KU Leuven will be publicly disclosing these vulnerabilities on 16 October 2017.

If you're worried about your security, various solutions can help you mitigate the problem while you wait for hardware companies to update router firmware.

Lawrence, who was being honored at Elle’s Women in Hollywood event in Los Angeles, stood at the lectern and detailed her experience of being mistreated in the entertainment industry.

“When I was much younger and starting out, I was told by producers of a film to lose 15 pounds in two weeks,” the 27-year-old actress said to a crowd that included Kristen Stewart, Margot Robbie and Ashley Greene.

“One girl before me had already been fired for not losing the weight fast enough,” she added. “During this time a female producer had me do a nude lineup with about five women who were much, much, thinner than me. We all stood side-by-side with only tape on covering our privates.”

Lawrence called it a “degrading and humiliating” experience and said the producer then told her she should “use the naked photos” of herself as “inspiration” for her diet.

When she did try to stand up for herself, another producer said she was “perfectly f—kable,"" Lawrence said.

“He said he didn’t know why everyone thought I was so fat, he thought I was ‘perfectly f--kable,’” Lawrence told the crowd.

Lawrence said she felt “trapped” by the experience, allowed the harassment to happen because she “didn’t want to be a whistleblower” and thought it was what she had to do to further her career in Hollywood.

“I’m still learning that I don’t have to smile when a man makes me uncomfortable,” she said. “Every human being should have the power to be treated with respect because they’re human.”

Lawrence’s speech comes on the heels of the Harvey Weinstein fallout. The disgraced movie mogul was accused of sexually assaulting multiple women.

“Harvey Weinstein is our sacrificial beast.”This article originally appeared in the New York Post's Page Six.","Lauren Holly joined the long list of actresses to accuse Harvey Weinstein of dirty behavior, saying he disrobed and used the toilet in front of her – then showered and asked for a massage.

The “Beautiful Girls” actress described her sickening encounter with the pervy producer in a hotel room during her appearance on Canadian talk show “The Social.”

“I realized that I had a responsibility that I needed to come forward and say it,” she said (via Variety). “I didn’t want to go chasing after some publication, I didn’t want to post it on social media, it seemed like my voice was too quiet if I did that.”

Holly, 53, said she was stunned when she read the New York Times exposé on Weinstein because it reminded her of her brush with the brute.

“This happened in the late 1990s; I was in my 30s. I was not a young ingenue, and I was certainly not new to Hollywood; I was a seasoned, Hollywood person,” said Holly, who had already worked with the filthy filmmaker on “Beautiful Girls.”

She met Weinstein at a hotel to discuss her future with his company and described it as normal – at first.

“Everything was absolutely professional from the get-go,” she said.

But after some small talk, Holly said, Weinstein asked to be excused, then returned wearing a hotel bathrobe.

“No doubt it was odd,” she said. “However, when he walked in and he was in the bathrobe, he said, ‘OK, let’s get to it, this is what we’ve got going on at my company, these are the scripts we have in the pipeline, this is what I think might be right for you,’ and he gestured for me to follow him.”

Holly said she followed him into the suite’s bedroom, where he dropped his robe, went into the bathroom and used the toilet.

“At this point my head was exploding,” she said. “He keeps the conversation going, he finishes, he turns on the shower, he gets in the shower. He’s continually talking to me, he’s in the shower washing himself. Leaning out, asking me for responses.

“My head is going crazy at this point. He’s acting like the situation is normal. He’s acting like we’re having a normal encounter. I’m thinking to myself, ‘Am I just a prude? Am I supposed to be more open minded?’ I didn’t quite know how to handle myself at that moment.”

Weinstein then got out of the shower, dried himself and approached her while stark naked, she said.

“The adrenaline rush I felt, I wanted to flee, I was scared. He told me that I looked stressed and he thought maybe I could use a massage, maybe I could give him a massage,” she continued. “I began just sort of babbling like I was a child, I think it was just the fear.”

She told him she wasn’t a licensed masseuse and suggested that he could call the front desk to have one sent for him.

But Weinstein began to threaten her, she said, stating that she needed to “keep him as [her] ally” and that it would be a “bad decision” if she left the room.

At that point, Holly said, she “pushed him and ran.”

The actress later went to a previously planned dinner with other Hollywood types and told them why she was distraught. She said they told her that since Weinstein hadn’t raped or assaulted her, she should “keep [her] mouth shut because it’s Harvey Weinstein.”

Holly said she was so horrified by the incident that she stayed away from film for a number of years.

She also described a later experience with Weinstein, in which the two stayed at the same hotel and he asked to meet her – but she avoided him like the plague.

“Things need to change,” the actress said on Monday’s show. “Harvey Weinstein is our sacrificial beast.”

However, no such planet has yet been discovered in our solar system, meaning that Planet Nine could be our missing ""super Earth,"" the researchers said.","Planet Nine is out there, and astronomers are determined to find it, according to a new statement from NASA. In fact, mounting evidence suggests it's hard to imagine our solar system without the unseen world.

The hypothetical planet is believed to be about 10 times more massive than Earth and located in the dark, outer reaches of the solar system, approximately 20 times farther from the sun than Neptune is. While the mysterious world still has yet to be found, astronomers have discovered a number of strange features of our solar system that are best explained by the presence of a ninth planet, according to the NASA statement.

""There are now five different lines of observational evidence pointing to the existence of Planet Nine,"" Konstantin Batygin, a planetary astrophysicist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, said in the statement. ""If you were to remove this explanation and imagine Planet Nine does not exist, then you generate more problems than you solve. All of a sudden, you have five different puzzles, and you must come up with five different theories to explain them."" [The Evidence for 'Planet Nine' in Our Solar System (Gallery)]

In 2016, Batygin and co-author Mike Brown, an astronomer at Caltech, published a study that examined the elliptical orbits of six known objects in the Kuiper Belt, a distant region of icy bodies stretching from Neptune outward toward interstellar space. Their findings revealed that all of those Kuiper Belt objects have elliptical orbits that point in the same direction and are tilted about 30 degrees ""downward"" compared to the plane in which the eight official planets circle the sun, according to the statement.

Using computer simulations of the solar system with a Planet Nine, Batygin and Brown also showed that there should be even more objects tilted a whopping 90 degrees with respect to the solar plane. Further investigation revealed that five such objects were already known to fit these parameters, the researchers said.

Since then, the astronomers have found new evidence that further supports the existence of Planet Nine. With help from Elizabeth Bailey, an astrophysicist and planetary scientist at Caltech, the team showed that Planet Nine's influence might have tilted the planets of our solar system, which would explain why the zone in which the eight major planets orbit the sun is tilted by about 6 degrees compared to the sun's equator.

""Over long periods of time, Planet Nine will make the entire solar-system plane precess, or wobble, just like a top on a table,"" Batygin said in the statement.

Finally, the researchers demonstrate how Planet Nine's presence could explain why Kuiper Belt objects orbit in the opposite direction from everything else in the solar system.

""No other model can explain the weirdness of these high-inclination orbits,"" Batygin said in the statement. ""It turns out that Planet Nine provides a natural avenue for their generation. These things have been twisted out of the solar system plane with help from Planet Nine and then scattered inward by Neptune.""

Going forward, the researchers plan to use the Subaru Telescope at Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii to find Planet Nine, and then deduce where the mysterious world came from.

The most common type of planets discovered around other stars in our galaxy has been what astronomers call "" super Earths "" — rocky worlds that are larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. However, no such planet has yet been discovered in our solar system, meaning that Planet Nine could be our missing ""super Earth,"" the researchers said.

They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.",Your planting guide for beautiful yellow daffodils,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/your-planting-guide-for-beautiful-yellow-daffodils.html

And whether or not President Trump would prevail in any such legal action does not support the overreaction to his tweets.
Yet the media continue to claim, since even before the election, that somehow it’s President Trump who is a threat to the First Amendment.","For the second time in as many months, Americans are demonstrating a profound ignorance of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. But this time, it’s not about the NFL and freedom of speech; it’s about our sacrosanct freedom of the press.

Backlash followed swiftly Thursday after President Trump’s tweet against mainstream media (specifically, NBC News). The president tweeted: “Network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked. Not fair to public!”

Commentators claimed this threatened freedom of the press.

In response to an NBC story claiming that the president called for a bigger U.S. nuclear arsenal, President Trump denied the story as flatly false during a White House meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

If one takes the time to actually read the tweets and understand the First Amendment, you’ll find that claiming President Trump is advocating for government regulation of the press is an absolutely baseless assertion and just another inane overreaction.

President Trump’s denial was bolstered by Defense Secretary James Mattis, who said: “Recent reports that the president called for an increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal are absolutely false. This kind of erroneous reporting is irresponsible.”

The president also tweeted: “With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!”

But if one takes the time to actually read the tweets and understand the First Amendment, you’ll find that claiming President Trump is advocating for government regulation of the press is an absolutely baseless assertion and just another inane overreaction.

First, let’s understand what the First Amendment actually says and what it actually does. Contrary to popular belief, our Bill of Rights does not confer rights upon individuals, nor are our rights absolute. The Declaration of Independence acknowledges that our individual, unalienable rights are endowed by our Creator, not our government. The mandate for American government is simply to best preserve and protect our preexisting rights.

Thus, the First Amendment acts as a redundancy safeguard, or a check, against the specific, limited powers given through our U.S. Constitution to government to operate in accordance with that mandate. In other words, just in case our federal government attempts to overreach its specific, limited powers provided in Articles I through III, the Bill of Rights tells Congress precisely what government cannot do.

The First Amendment reads in relevant part: “Congress shall make no law…abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press….” It is important to note here that the operative term is “abridging.” The Supreme Court has rightly acknowledged in Roth v. United States and other similar cases that rights protected by the First Amendment are not absolute.

Freedom of the press generally means that the government cannot interfere with the publication and distribution of information and opinions – not that the government may never impose restrictions.

For example, I cannot publish a story about my neighbor having an affair that I know is false. My neighbor could rightly sue me for damages in that instance. The law provides relief for defamation, including libel and slander.

The Supreme Court has routinely upheld defamation laws and afforded civil liability remedies. In the 1964 case New York Times v. Sullivan, the court held that where individuals and publications disseminated information published with reckless disregard of whether that information was false or not, even public officials could win a lawsuit for libel.

This is still the basic rule for mainstream media outlets like NBC. If NBC published a provably false story with reckless disregard for its truth or falsity, President Trump (like any other public official) can file suit. This legal remedy doesn’t amount to “government regulation” or remotely contravene the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of the press.

Whether or not the Federal Communications Commission would revoke licenses granted to NBC’s local stations based on demonstrably false content may be a lawsuit primed for today’s “fake news” era. And whether or not President Trump would prevail in any such legal action does not support the overreaction to his tweets. The president and Mattis are correct that the media bears responsibility for veracity and truthfulness.

Is it really too much to require that the media are at least accurately reporting facts, even if their constitutionally protected opinions are clearly biased? The law presumes that a reasonable person knows the difference between a reporting of fact versus an opinion. Facts cannot change depending on a reporter’s political agenda.

The president’s tweets and comments are often bombastic and pointed, but thus far he hasn’t actually advocated anything that would amount to an unconstitutional government infringement upon our individual rights that his office (and the entire scope of American government) is mandated to preserve and protect.

If the media are allowed to publish with reckless disregard for the truth in reporting facts, at that point we have lost all credibility and the original purpose for the freedom of press. Journalism is still rightly required in this country to operate with integrity. Yet the media continue to claim, since even before the election, that somehow it’s President Trump who is a threat to the First Amendment.

Perhaps this is why a few quarterbacks who may have inferior skills to Kaepernick’s have found positions as second and third-string back-ups.
Teams invariably make their player decisions based on need, skills, leadership, and the ability to coalesce with other players.","Colin Kaepernick’s newly-filed grievance accusing the NFL of colluding or conspiring against him is a legal “Hail Mary.”

He and his lawyers stand little chance of winning because both the law and the facts are against him.

The Facts

Kaepernick used to be an outstanding quarterback. Selected by San Francisco in the 2011 draft, he led the 49ers to the Super Bowl in the 2012 season and the NFC Championship game the following year. And then, he seemed to implode.

Over the next two years, his throwing arm regressed and his overall skills as a rushing quarterback diminished. Injuries only made matters worse. The team finally gave up on him, and he was benched during the 2015 season. He never recovered. It did not help that Kaepernick was twice fined by the NFL for inappropriate language and behavior. He tended to be selfish and tempestuous.

Kaepernick seems oblivious to the fact that he does not have the right to play in the NFL. No one does. It must be earned. And not just on the playing field, but elsewhere.

Kaepernick was already collecting bench splinters when he began his one-man protest of the national anthem and the American flag in the 2016 pre-season. So, let’s be clear: he was never punished by the 49ers or the NFL for sitting or kneeling. He was not starting games or playing much as a back-up quarterback because, quite simply, he was no longer good enough.

Only then did he decide, all on his own, to quit the 49ers in March of 2017. He chose to opt out of his contract with the club, making himself a free agent. Since then, no other NFL team has showed much interest in signing him.

The Law

Contract law governs Kaepernick’s “grievance” filed by his lawyer, Mark Geragos, against the NFL. He alleges that teams conspired to prevent Kaepernick from being signed with a club as “punishment” for precipitating other anthem protests. Geragos claims his client was “denied employment based on partisan political provocation.”

The case against the NFL and its teams is based on Article 17 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement negotiated by the players and the league. It states, in relevant part:

“No Club shall enter into any agreement, express or implied, with the NFL or any other Club… to restrict or limit individual Club decision-making on whether to offer or not offer a Player Contract to any player.”

In order to prevail, Kaepernick and his legal team would have the burden of proving, “by a clear preponderance of the evidence,” that two or more teams conspired to keep him out of the NFL. Does he have such proof? It is highly doubtful.

Will any club executive or owner come forward to say he verbally agreed with another team to exclude Kaepernick? Is there some incriminating document or email reflecting the same? Unlikely. It is more likely that teams made individual assessments about Kaepernick and concluded that he was not worth signing for a variety of reasons.

Since the case goes to arbitration under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, Kaepernick’s lawyers cannot subpoena documents nor can they compel witnesses to testify. So, good luck locating the evidence, assuming it even exists.

But most importantly, Section 6 of the CBA’s Article 17 states that “failure to sign a player…shall not, by itself or in combination only with evidence about the playing skills of the player, satisfy the burden of proof.”

In other words, Kaepernick cannot prove collusion by simply arguing that he is qualified, yet remains unsigned by any football team. It is not enough to win his case against the NFL.

The fact that he elected to leave the San Francisco 49ers voluntarily, while still under contract, undermines his already weak case. Opting out of his contract because, arguably, he thought the team would eventually cut him from the club, counts only as speculation. What he believes or suspects might have happened is of little consequence in such legal proceedings.

Kaepernick seems oblivious to the fact that he does not have the right to play in the NFL. No one does. It must be earned. And not just on the playing field, but elsewhere.

If any teams feels that a potential player might prove disruptive in the locker room or destructive on the playing field, or even if a club believes that fans will react negatively to a particular player, the team is well within its rights to decide not to hire that player.

Perhaps this is why a few quarterbacks who may have inferior skills to Kaepernick’s have found positions as second and third-string back-ups. Teams invariably make their player decisions based on need, skills, leadership, and the ability to coalesce with other players.

Temperamental quarterbacks who are lacking those qualities sometimes find themselves watching NFL football games at home.

An article on raceconscious.org by Sachi Feris has been making the rounds on mommy Facebook groups. Feris writes that her 5-year-old daughter declared she wanted to be Polynesian Disney character Moana, which she worried would be “cultural appropriation.”

Her daughter’s other choice: Scandinavian Queen Elsa from the Disney movie “Frozen.”

“I had some reservations regarding both costume choices … about cultural appropriation and the power/privilege carried by Whiteness, and about Whiteness and standards of beauty,” she wrote.

Feris went on to describe a series of conversations with her daughter, particularly focusing on the ethics of dressing as Moana, who as a teen sets out on a treacherous sea journey to save her family’s island from famine and destruction — and succeeds.

In the end, Feris’s daughter decided to dress as Elsa — though Feris was concerned it might teach her short-haired brunette daughter that one must be white, blue-eyed and have long flaxen hair to be a “beautiful” princess.

But she nixed the Moana costume for Mickey Mouse, because, as Ferris wrote, “we don’t have to worry about making fun of anyone or dressing up as a culture different from our own because Mickey Mouse is a pretend mouse!

“One thing is for sure, our discussions around appropriate and inappropriate Halloween costumes will continue,” concluded Feris.

Her blog was almost universally praised by commenters. Yvette Brown, wrote: “I admire your perseverance in interacting with your daughter. … You also have given her essential values along with guidelines so she has the opportunity to grow, be creative, learn and find her way in the world.”

But another commenter named Amanda expressed reservations. “This feels murky,” she wrote. “I recognize the need to be sensitive, I’m just wondering how you parse the nuances for a child.”

Meanwhile, a New York mom of one daughter told The Post: “I think it’s silly to take children’s Halloween costumes so seriously. They’re kids, can’t they just be kids and not involved with the whole political correctness thing?

“I just think if any woman chooses to wear me, or invest in me as a designer, that’s incredibly flattering,” Beckham added.

Trump wore the Beckham-designed piece, a slouchy navy blue turtleneck that retails for $1,050, while she was boarding the Marine One for Puerto Rico. The first lady paired the cozy sweater with cropped blue pants and sky high navy stilettos to match.

Victoria Beckham’s designs seem to have a place in the Trump family’s wardrobe. Ivanka Trump has been seen wearing a $35 dress from Beckham’s Target line.

Rushing told the officers they were likely bits of the Krispy Kreme doughnut he’d eaten earlier, but he was arrested for possession of methamphetamine after two roadside drug tests tested positive for an illegal substance.

""I couldn’t believe it,” Rushing told the Orlando Sentinel. “I’ve never even smoked a cigarette before, let alone meth.”

Weeks later, a state crime lab cleared Rushing of the drug allegations and charges against him were dropped.

“I haven’t been able to work,” Rushing said. “People go online and see that you’ve been arrested.”

Rushing, a retiree from the Orlando Parks Departments, received a check for $37,500 last week and told the Sentinel he’s pleased with the outcome of his case.

Cpl. Shelby Riggs-Hopkins wrote in a Dec. 11 arrest report that she noticed flakes on Rushing’s floorboard. The police department at the time said the arrest was lawful and didn’t explain why the glaze tested positive for amphetamine in both field tests.

Riggs-Hopkins was given a written reprimand for making an improper arrest, and the Orlando Police Department ended up training more than 730 officers on how to properly use field-test kits.

During all that time, the agency apparently did not even have a complete list of all the “high-risk” positions where detailed background investigations of outside contractors were required.

In other instances, the agency had assigned lower levels of background scrutiny to the positions than the importance of the positions -- and their information access -- deserved, according to preliminary investigations carried out by the EPA’s Office of Inspector General (OIG).

Moreover, despite much-touted efforts to tighten up cybersecurity by the Obama administration, the situation was still bad when Obama left office. An internal EPA tally in February 2017 showed that nearly 70 percent of 484 contractors carrying a special, embedded-chip card allowing “elevated access” to EPA computer systems for their work still had not gotten their higher-level background checks.

For their part, the EPA’s auditors noted that in their initial small sampling, five of nine contractor personnel were given sensitive access to EPA computer systems without strict background checks, even though they had worked for the EPA “for over five years.”

The gaping holes in EPA’s information security defenses were severe enough that the agency’s OIG investigators, who began an audit of the contractor background checks last March, stopped work and issued a rare “management alert” to the Trump administration’s EPA officials about the situation, which was released to the public at the end of September.

(EPA officials were, in fact, briefed about the situation in late August.)

“Contractor personnel with potentially questionable backgrounds are accessing sensitive agency data and could cause harm,” the alert concluded. “These initial investigations and timely reviews serve as a cornerstone for the EPA to verify whether contractor personnel are trustworthy.”

The OIG document did not say so, but contractor positions have been exploited by some of the most damaging intruders in U.S. computer systems. One of them was Edward Snowden, who in 2013 stole and leaked information on some of the most sensitive global surveillance programs carried out by the National Security Agency. Snowden remains at large in Russia.

Along with the lack of appropriate background checks, the OIG alert noted:

· “a lack of oversight by responsible offices” within EPA to confirm that background investigations were initiated and eventually completed when contractors got the supposedly temporary right to special access cards,

· conflicting totals among various EPA offices about how many working contractors would require high-level background checks,

· a “breakdown in communication” among various EPA computer system managers and oversight personnel over verification of the checks,

· a refusal on the part of one EPA bureau to provide a listing of personnel who did not even have the special computer access cards but nonetheless still had privileged access to EPA computers. (EPA gave the number of such un-carded accounts to Fox News in response to a query: 58. Of those, the agency said, 27 were disabled and 31 in active use.)

Such alerts “say that this is something the agency should respond to right away,” says Jennifer Kaplan, the agency’s deputy assistant inspector general for congressional and public affairs, told Fox News.

The same point was underlined in the alert itself, which noted that “many of these underlying issues could have been uncovered had EPA management conducted oversight and a timely review of these processes.”

“This is definitely disturbing,” observes Theresa Payton, one of the country’s leading cybersecurity experts and the first female chief information officer at the White House during the Bush administration. “If you are giving network access to someone, it’s a no-brainer to give them a thorough background check.”

“There has never been more reason to target us than now, on the part of North Korea, China and Russia. And there has never been more delicate and fragile trust in our government than right now.”

""This is definitely disturbing."" - Theresa Payton, cybersecurity expert

The lack of background investigations and consequent security risks were known — at least in large detail — to top EPA officials of the Obama administration as far back as August, 2015. That was two months after the White House Office of Personnel Management announced that it had been hit by the biggest hack of federal government personal information in history, eventually affecting an estimated 21.5 million federal employees, with much of the information extracted from outside contractors.

The August 2015 milestone marked the end of the Obama administration’s much-touted “30-Day Cybersecurity Sprint,” an effort to get a grip on cybersecurity lapses across the federal government in the wake of the massive information threat.

The “sprint” supposedly included a drastic upgrade to the safeguards around all such “privileged” or high-access users through the use of embedded-chip user ID cards that supposedly guaranteed they had appropriate clearances for their degree of access to EPA networks

Yet at EPA, at least the vaunted new levels of security alert were apparently something of a mirage, at least where outside contractors were concerned.

By the end of 2016, by EPA’s own estimate, half of the agency’s “privileged users” of sensitive computer systems still did not have the appropriate background investigations needed for the ID cards they were using. The strict-scrutiny background checks had simply been “temporarily” waived.

Two months later, when EPA learned that nearly 70 percent of contractors still were without appropriate background checks, the situation clearly was not much better.

The auditor’s main recommendation was fairly stark: get the controls in place to get the background checks done, and effective oversight established, before the inspectors come back to complete their detailed review.

According to EPA, it is doing just that. An EPA spokesperson told Fox News that “93 percent” of all current privileged access card holders have gotten “the appropriate level of investigation.”

Since, according to the spokesperson, EPA now has 628 privileged card-holders, that means 44 people still haven’t gotten the appropriate background check.

In veiled language, the spokesperson indicated that these personnel were, in effect, grandfathered into the system, as holding cards prior to August 15, 2015, when the strict regime of background checks was installed but essentially never implemented.

Moreover, all the security check issues of oversight and other matters have now been closed, the spokesman declared. “EPA has processes in place to ensure that investigations get initiated before a [privileged user card] is issued.”

Maybe so, but according to OIG’s Kaplan, the EPA still hasn’t provided its watchdogs with a statement “on how it will proceed with the recommendations,” meaning its exact plans.","Obama EPA did not do background checks on hundreds of cyber-contractors, watchdog warns",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/17/obama-epa-did-not-do-background-checks-on-hundreds-cyber-contractors-watchdog-warns.html

As reported by sources for the New York Post, the Obamas are apparently waiting for 10 Gracie Square’s housing board to approve the purchase of a unit in the building, which has been home to such famous folks as Gloria Vanderbilt, Anderson Cooper, and former first lady of China Madame Chiang Kai-shek — but it’s also got quite a tragic past, the Post reports.

SEE THE NYC TOWNHOUSE WHERE OBAMA LIVED AFTER COLLEGE

The building has been the site of two very high-profile suicides in the last 30 years, which is enough to make even a New York City real-estate agent think twice about living there.

“I don’t know of any buildings with two suicides,” said Dolly Lenz, CEO of Dolly Lenz Real Estate, in a statement to the New York Post. “It almost says that there is a cloud on the building.”

The first victim of these tragedies was Carter Cooper, the 23-year-old son of Gloria Vanderbilt and the older brother of CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. According to reports, Carter was acting strangely in the months leading up to his suicide, but had been in therapy. Then, on July 22, 1988, during a visit to his mother’s home, he abruptly ran out onto the terrace of his Vanderbilt’s two-story penthouse apartment, hopped over the ledge, and dangled there before letting himself drop from the 14th floor — all while Vanderbilt watched from feet away.

""He let go, and there was a moment when I thought I was going to jump over after him,” Vanderbilt remembered during a 2011 appearance of Anderson Cooper’s talk series.

In Vanderbilt’s 1997 book, “A Mother’s Story,” she also alleged that Carter’s suicide may have triggered by an allergy to medication.

The second, much more recent suicide at 10 Grace Square took place in April 2017, and claimed the life of author, heiress and socialite Jean Stein. Stein, whose works include “Edie: An American Girl” and “West of Eden,” had reportedly been suffering from depression, according to her daughter Katrina vanden Heuvel, and jumped from the 15th floor of the building on April 30, the New York Times reported in its obituary.

A fellow resident who witnessed the suicide has said it was a messy one, as Stein “miscalculated” the jump and landed an eighth-floor terrace. She had also severed her leg in the fall, according to reports.

10 Gracie Square, however, is also infamous for more than these two suicides: In 1982, it was also where sixth-floor resident Frances Schreuder was arrested for conspiring with her son Marco to kill Schreuder’s father, wealthy Utah businessman Franklin Bradshaw.

Schreuder had reportedly been unhappy with the amount of money Bradshaw was allotting her, and persuaded her then-17-year-old son to shoot his grandfather dead in 1978. He was eventually caught, and Schreuder was nabbed while trying to escape out the window of her 10 Gracie Square abode.

October is an exciting month for the family. Even if you or your kids aren’t into the haunted part of Halloween, you can still embrace the festivities of fall, warmth and togetherness. Encourage your kids to exercise their imagination and creativity with these Halloween-themed crafts that everyone can participate in.

1. Family Portrait Pumpkins

Skip the mess of carving pumpkins this year by investing in some good old fashioned chalk. Simply paint a circle on each pumpkin with chalkboard paint. You’ll probably have to apply at least three coats of paint. Then, draw a self-portrait using a piece of chalk. Voila!

2. Colorful Garland

Before kids jump in the pile of leaves this weekend, encourage them to collect a few especially vibrant ones. Press the leaves in a book for a couple of hours while the kids continue to play outside. Once they’ve been flattened, show your children how to clip the leaves to a string with miniature clothespins and find spots to hang them throughout the house together.

3. Harvest Vignettes

Look to nature’s bounty for easy decor ideas. Arrange apples, pears, pumpkins, squash and gourds in baskets throughout your kitchen and dining areas. Having easy access to fruits will also promote healthy eating for your family this season.

4. Candy Laboratory

First, gather vases, jars and dishes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Then fill each container with colorful treats, like candy corn, marshmallows and of course candy eyeballs. Challenge your family members to come up with a creative new name for each candy. Crows bones, zombie zingers and pumpkin teeth are excellent examples. Arrange the jars neatly on a tray or turn a bar cart into a wonderful candy buffet.

5. Candy Corn Checkerboards

A checkerboard made from a placemat can be quickly rolled up and easily tucked away. Cut a 1½-inch square from cardstock paper to make a stencil. Start at one edge of the square and paint every other square. Precise placement and straight lines aren’t necessary in this project, which makes it great for kids. Small imperfections can even give the game a rustic or quirky look. You can use candy corn or small plastic spiders as game pieces.

6. Gothic Deskscape

Fall break is the perfect time to take a break from work and transform your home office into a spooky showcase. Open a dictionary and lay a magnifying glass on the definition of “Halloween”. Stack a pile of literature to display your favorite fall titles, like The Tell-Tale Heart or Harry Potter. Swap out a desk lamp’s lightbulb for one with an orange glow or purple hue, and don’t forget an inkwell and quill pen!

7. Mantel Accessories

Fireplace mantels are the go-to spot for any holiday decor. Find wooden display letters at your local craft store to spell out “boo” or another ghastly term above the hearth. Place a mini pumpkin or two and add some candles. A stack of books and a vase of bare branches are also great ideas.

8. Stylish Spider Webs

Tulle is great for wrapping accessories, draping over doorways and even dressing up the bushes. Don’t overlook the nooks and crannies though. This fabric is even more effective in small corners of a room since that’s where spiders hang out most anyway. You might even have to dust off a few real webs before making your own.

9. Window Decals

Shadows and silhouettes can be extra spooky this time of year. Use your interior lighting and the long dark nights to your advantage by decorating windows with DIY decals. Sketch large outlines of your favorite Halloween characters on fade-resistant paper. Then cut out your witches, skeletons, bats, cats or ghosts and tape them to the inside of your home’s windows.

10. Dip-Dyed Baskets

Prepare for trick-or-treaters this year by sprucing up a traditional candy basket. Fill a plastic container (larger than your basket) with semigloss paint. Place the basket in the paint and push down until all sides are covered to your desired height. Let the basket sit overnight on an elevated rack you don’t mind getting dirty, like an old cookie sheet. Reuse this basket all year long as stylish storage!",10 DIY Halloween decorations for all ages,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/10-diy-halloween-decorations-for-all-ages.html

Finally, the R&D tax credit is one of the two current business tax credits retained in the reform proposals.
It is imperative that we not only move forward with tax reform, but ensure that it retains all the key provisions necessary to keep R&D happening here.","As President Donald Trump redoubles his efforts to fulfill campaign promises on tax reform, a critical part of his program is in jeopardy of being discarded, as a result of the efforts of uninformed or self-interested business lobbies.

The measure under attack is a proposal to increase taxes on importers of foreign goods and reduce taxes on exporters of American goods. It must be restored if tax reform is to achieve its objectives of stimulating investment, preventing American companies from continuing to off-shore R&D and manufacturing, and avoiding increases in the deficit.

The fundamental problem to be fixed by overall tax reform is that American companies pay the highest taxes in the developed world. As a result, U.S.-based multinationals have been moving their headquarters, research and development, and manufacturing activities overseas to lower-tax locales, forcing us to import goods that we used to produce at home.

Companies that do stay home get to keep such a small share of returns on their capital that they cannot afford to make investments that would be good for everyone.

This has other cascading effects. Research and development (R&D) is one of the most important categories of investment, in that it drives growth in productivity and wages as well as profits and output. Without R&D and the innovations it produces, our standard of living would hardly be better than it was at the end of the nineteenth century.

According to the National Science Foundation, business R&D spending is now three times as large as government R&D, but since 2010 the basic research share of R&D has declined. Basic research is the place where innovations start, and needs the most encouragement.

Lowering tax rates would improve the profitability of all long-term investments, and the payoffs from R&D are among the most long-term of all.

As happens too often in Washington, the one liner – border adjustments raise prices – seems to be winning, because it takes three sentences to prove it is wrong. And few politicians have a high enough opinion of the electorate to take that chance.

Another tax reform proposal, to eliminate the deductibility of interest paid by corporations, would level the playing field for high-tech companies with large R&D budgets, because these high-risk investments cannot be financed with loans. Failures are as common as success in the early stages of innovation, and require investors to spread those risks across a portfolio of projects rather than lenders who require collateral and assurance of repayment.

The subsidy that the current tax code provides to banks and lenders by making interest but not dividends deductible therefore directs investment away from just the kind of innovative companies whose discoveries drive growth.

Finally, the R&D tax credit is one of the two current business tax credits retained in the reform proposals.

Unfortunately, these provisions are not sufficient to make the U.S. competitive with the inducements offered by other countries to attract R&D activities to their shores. That difference was to be taken care of by border adjustment provisions in the original tax reform plan, which was presented to Congress by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Chairman Kevin Brady of the House Ways and Means Committee.

What the measure sought to redress is the fact that other countries try to attract R&D centers by offering extremely low tax rates on income generated by R&D activities, including income from patents and licensing of new products as well as income from manufacturing them.

The kicker is that the R&D and manufacturing must be done in the country offering the tax breaks.

When U.S. companies relocate overseas in response to these inducements, they avoid almost all taxes by hiring workers and keeping profits overseas while exporting manufactured goods back to the United States.

Not only that, companies that remain home must pay these off-shoring companies to use the patents that they registered overseas. Even if some of the new products are manufactured in the U.S., a large part of the profits are thereby siphoned off to other countries.

The border adjustment was intended to fix this by eliminating the opportunity to deduct payments for imports, including payments for foreign patents, from business income.

At the same time, it would level the playing field with companies doing business in these low-tax nations by making income from exports tax-free.

The whole package of lower taxes, a level playing field in capital markets, continued R&D tax credits and the border adjustment would provide powerful incentives to invest in R&D within the United States and to produce here the new and better goods that are the fruits of R&D.

Unfortunately, the lobbying campaign against the border adjustment was underway long before anyone had a chance to explain how it would work.

Executives from Walmart, Target, and other big retail chains and off-shoring manufacturers like Nike descended en masse on Republican senators of the states in which they had headquarters to extract promises to oppose the border adjustments.

Their pitch was that the border adjustment would drive their prices up by 25 percent, because almost everything they sold was imported.

The damage had been done by the time Chairman Brady and a number of economists correctly pointed out that the brunt of the import adjustment would be borne primarily by foreign companies which would have to adjust their prices downward in order to maintain market share for the foreign-made products they sell into the United States.

Any residual upward pressure on prices in the U.S. would for the same reason be absorbed by retailers and other importers or quickly be neutralized by an increase in the value of the dollar in import transactions.

In other words, no real increase in consumer prices would be likely to occur.

As happens too often in Washington, the one liner – border adjustments raise prices – seems to be winning, because it takes three sentences to prove it is wrong. And few politicians have a high enough opinion of the electorate to take that chance.

Turkey's president was in Poland on Tuesday for talks on international security and on his policies at home.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan was greeted with military honors by Polish President Andrzej Duda and then they held talks.

Duda's adviser, Andrzej Szczerski, said there would be no ""taboo"" topics and the talks would include the situation in Turkey, where tens of thousands of people have been arrested or dismissed from their jobs since last year's coup attempt.

Szczerski argued on radio RMF that it is important to maintain relations with Turkey because it is an important NATO member and European Union's partner with a key role in the migration crisis and in Middle East politics.

""We must talk with Turkey in order to be in touch and know the country's views and plans,"" Szczerski said.

During the welcoming walk before Poland's military, Erdogan missed the customary bow before the troop's banner and Duda grabbed his elbow to make him return to the site.

Erdogan will also meet with Prime Minister Beata Szydlo and the parliamentary speakers. He is expected to attend a Polish-Turkish business forum with Duda.

Poland's small opposition left-wing Party Razem (Together) said Erdogan shouldn't be received with state honors because his government is ""violating human rights.""","Turkey leader in Poland for talks on security, his policies",https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/17/turkey-leader-in-poland-for-talks-on-security-his-policies.html

Daniel Card was on flight 1871 back home from Los Angeles when he says an extremely drunk passenger boarded the flight and sat next to him.

UNITED AIRLINES LEFT MOM IN WHEELCHAIR STRANDED IN NEW JERSEY, SON SAYS

As the cross-country flight prepared for takeoff to Newark Airport, Card alleges in the suit, filed on Wednesday, that the inebriated man next to him in row 24 “took out his penis and aimed it at Card and proceeded to urinate all over Card’s leg, while Card was confined to his seat due to an imminent departure of the flight.”

Card said he tried to wake up the passed out passenger, who smelled strongly of alcohol, but could not. He then alerted the airline crew, who according to the suit, “refused [his] request to relocate his seat.” After several requests, Card says he was finally moved from the urine-soaked seat, but was “forced to endure the remainder of the flight to Newark/New Jersey while remaining in his urine drenched clothing.”

Once the plane landed in Newark Liberty International Airport, law enforcement was there to intervene. The FBI interviewed both Card and the drunk passenger once they were removed from the plane. The drunk passenger said he “had no recollection of the events on the flight, and only remembered being at a bar inside of Los Angeles International Airport, and then landing at Newark Airport.” The passenger also stated he had consumed at least four rum and cokes while at the airport bar in LA.

As part of United’s Contract of Carriage, there is an obligation of the airline to remove “passengers who appear to be intoxicated or under the influence of drugs to a degree that the Passenger may endanger the Passenger or another Passenger or members of the crew.”

The color-enhanced image — which Juno captured on Sept. 1, 2017, during its most recent close flyby of Jupiter — shows the 2,260-mile-wide (3,640 kilometers) moon Io hugging the gas giant's limb and the 1,900-mile-wide (3,100 km) Europa a bit farther out. NASA released the image on Friday (Oct. 6).

Io and Europa are two of Jupiter's four Galilean moons, which are so named because famed Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei discovered them back in 1610. (The other two Galilean satellites are Callisto and Ganymede.) Io is the most volcanic object in the solar system, and astrobiologists regard the ocean-harboring Europa as one of the best bets to host life beyond Earth. [More Amazing Jupiter Photos by Juno Citizen Scientists]

Juno was 17,098 miles (27,516 km) from Jupiter's cloud tops, at about 49.4 degrees south latitude when it took the image, NASA officials said.

Citizen scientist Roman Tkachenko processed the photo using raw data collected by Juno's JunoCam imager. Mission team members encourage anyone to do such work. If you're interested, go to the JunoCam page at www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam.

The $1.1 billion Juno mission launched in August 2011 and arrived in orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016. The spacecraft is studying the planet's composition and structure, as well as its gravitational and magnetic fields. Juno gathers most of its data during close flybys like the Sept. 1 encounter, which occur every 53.5 Earth days. (The spacecraft is looping around Jupiter in a highly elliptical orbit.)

And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts.
Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts?
Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts.","Sitting at my usual corner table in the back of Buzzy’s 8-Ball Tavern and Pool Room, It occurred to me on Thursday night that there are any number of serious issues and current crisis that we could talk about for this week’s dispatch from the front lines.

But setting all those issues aside, let me tell you something that may have escaped your attention while you’ve been busy digging a backyard bomb shelter or getting up to speed on which starlets haven’t been groped by Weinstein. Apparently, and I did not see this coming, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) leadership has decided to open the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts to, wait for it… girls.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts. Boys whittled wood into sharp, pointy things and set fire to stuff, while girls generated an incredible amount of revenue selling delicious cookies. I’m particularly fond of Samoas.

My oldest boy Scooter is in the Cub Scouts, and I can vouch for the fact that he and his Den cohorts love to whittle. They can take a 400 pound oak log and turn it into a sharp, pointy twig in less time than it takes to whistle the theme to ""The Andy Griffith Show."" To be honest, they’re a pack of smelly, loud boys with a remarkable ability to recite the entire Scout oath while actually burping. I can see why girls would be clamoring to join.

In reality, most are not. And the Girl Scouts of America, which after taking into account global cookie sales, I believe is the country’s 7th largest corporation, have criticized what they see as a blatant effort to increase membership dues by the BSA. Membership numbers are down in general for youth groups across America so this may be less about gender and more about dough. Which reminds me, I also like the Thin Mints.

Back in August of this year, the president of the Girl Scouts sent a letter to the BSA president stating “…I formally request that your organization stay focused on serving the 90 per cent of American boys not currently participating in Boy Scouts… and not consider expanding to recruit girls.” That, my friends, is how you win a merit badge for subtle insult.

At this point, It would be fairly easy to morph this into a high brow column about gender fluidity and the need to be considerate over what pronouns someone uses when referring to their particular identification. Or perhaps turn to the subject of gender equality and how girls and boys are really no different and so no association or organization should exclude one or the other.

But I’m a guy, raising a houseful of little guys, and so my thinking isn’t particularly complicated. I’m guessing the BSA’s decision is partly driven by a need for additional revenue, as suggested by the Girl Scouts leadership, and likely in part out of concern that they might be sued by some overly sensitive soul who wants to prove a point that most folks really don’t care about.

I admit to being a bit old fashioned. Believing that there’s a place for a Boy Scouts organization and a Girl Scouts organization that focus on their respective genders doesn’t make me a misogynist or a sexist or anything else ending in “ist” or even an “ism.” I happen to believe that there’s value and benefit in girls having their own space and boys having their own space on occasion…as long as they offer equal space and opportunity.

I know that Scooter and his pals at their current stage of life would prefer to keep the “no girls allowed” sign on their clubhouse door. And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts. Give them a couple years and they’ll see things differently…they may even realize girls don’t find it attractive when you make farting noises. Although to be fair, I didn’t have that epiphany until my mid 20s.

Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts? I would have done that research but it seems like a lot of work and I’ve been busy whittling.

Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts. For their part, the BSA leadership claims the change was designed to provide more options for parents. According to BSA’s Chief Scout Executive, “We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children.”

So there you have it. Sally can now be a Cub Scout. And soon, Sally can join the Boy Scouts and eventually earn the coveted Eagle Scout award. I haven’t raised this development with Scooter yet. He may or may not care, it’s hard to tell what a 10-year-old boy’s response will be. But I’ll bet you a box of cookies there’ll be a fart noise involved.",There’s a place for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.

BOILING RIVER OF WINE FLOWS THROUGH BURNED DOWN CALIFORNIA WINERY

The wildfires ravaging northern California’s wine country for more than a week killed at least 40 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses. Most of the deaths were reported in Sonoma.

Homeowners came back to their houses over the weekend to find them completely demolished or damaged --but, in many cases, still standing. Tom Andrews told The Associated Press he was in “disbelief” to find his house still standing despite other surrounding structures having been completely destroyed.

""It was disbelief and just feeling like the luckiest guy on earth,"" Andrews said. ""I can't believe, I mean, total destruction 50 feet away and to have our house still standing here.""

Evacuation orders were lifted Monday night in two neighborhoods in Sonoma County, though the firefighters were still trying to put out the blaze. About 11,000 firefighters have been working to extinguish the wildfires.

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you’re lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath — a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child’s former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book — a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant — I’m speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space — at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.",How to make use and better your life with a spare bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/28/how-to-make-use-and-better-your-life-with-spare-bedroom.html

They use drug-sniffing dogs, X-rays and hand-held laser detectors to examine every piece of mail that goes through the international mail facility, where 60 percent of the nation’s postage arrives. The federal agents, who gave Fox News a behind-the-scenes look at what they do, process 1 million packages a day looking for traces of illegal drugs.

TRUMP OFFICIALLY DECLARES OPIOID CRISIS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY

Their focus, right now, is on opioids.

“The No. 1 drug killing Americans is fentanyl,” said Richard Baum, acting White House drug czar said, “coming through mail in lots of small packages.""

The latest figures show more than 33,000 people in the U.S. died from drug overdoses involving opioids in 2015, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. CBP agents at JFK say day after day they find drugs hidden in unusual ways.

“We just found a package that contains GBL, which is a date rape drug,” said Frank Russo, JFK’s CBP port director, holding up a bottle of Turtle Wax. “As you can see, the package includes sponges to make us think it's turtle wax car wash equipment.”

2 PASSENGERS ON SAME FLIGHT BUSTED WEARING COCAINE PANTS

Fetanyl, one of the deadliest opioids, arrives in large numbers in concealed packages coming primarily from Hong Kong.

Screening is a challenge. But now, with updated technology, the fight to stop fentanyl and other opioids form entering the U.S. is getting easier.

More than 100,000 pounds of narcotics are seized each year at JFK’s international mail facility, once a substance like fentanyl is identified. The suspected illegal drugs are brought to a detention room at the airport, where they are tested and sent to a lab. Once confirmed, that's when the investigation begins.

One of the biggest legal hurdles is the lack of tracking information from international senders, which is still not a requirement.

While legislation demanding more data has been introduced, Baum and the CBP continue to work with their peers overseas to find those trying to cheat the system.

“I just think we can't stand still,” Baum said. “The sorting problem is so huge that we need better quality data earlier.”

But just because the international mail delivery guidelines are not stringent enough, Russo said, does not mean they won’t find those responsible.

“The message is,” Russo said, “we are working to find you and bring you to justice.”",Border agents at New York's JFK airport on the front lines of America's drug war,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/15/border-agents-at-new-yorks-jfk-airport-on-front-lines-americas-drug-war.html

He placed it in a thermos, the thermos in a leather pouch, and he buried it.

Now, for the first time, Marcel Nadjari's words have been published in full.

Historian Pavel Polian told Deutsche Welle the letter is one of nine buried documents found at the concentration camp. He described them as ""the most central documents of the Holocaust.""

The documents were written by Nadjari and four fellow members of the ""Sonderkommando"" unit, which was tasked with moving bodies from the gas chamber to the crematorium.

Nadjari's letter, found in 1980, was written in his native Greek and is mostly illegible. A yearlong project using multispectral image analysis helped reveal all but about 10 percent of its content.

Gizmodo describes the Sonderkommando's unthinkable tasks: remove the teeth from the dead, shave their heads, and ultimately dispose of their ashes into rivers. ""We carried the corpses of these innocent women and children to the elevator, which brought them into the room with the ovens, and they put them in the furnaces, where they were burnt without the use of fuel, because of the fat they have,"" he wrote.

""When you read what work I did, you will say, how could he ... burn his fellow believers,"" he wrote. ""Many times I thought of coming in with them [into the gas chambers] to finish, but I have always kept my revenge: I wanted to live to avenge the death of Papa and Mama, and that of my beloved little sister, Nelli.""

Nadjari didn't get his revenge, but he did survive Auchswitz. He died in New York in 1971.

Bleacher Report’s Mike Freeman said in a series of tweets that the controversial athlete has hired attorney Mark Geragos “who has represented numerous high profile clients.”

Geragos said in a statement posted on Twitter on Sunday that he filed the grievance “only after pursuing every possible avenue with all NFL teams and their executives.”

“If the NFL (as well as all professional sports leagues) is to remain a meritocracy, then principled and peaceful political protest — which the owners themselves made great theater imitating weeks ago — should not be punished,” Geragos said in the statement, “and athletes should not be denied employment based on partisan political provocation by the executive branch of our government. Such a precedent threatens all patriotic Americans and harkens back to our darkest days as a nation.”

Kaepernick threw for 2,241 yards, 16 touchdowns and four interceptions during the 2016 season. However, since becoming a free agent, Kaepernick has had difficulty finding a job over the league-wide demonstrations during the national anthem that protest social injustice.

The NFL players’ union said it would support the grievance, which was filed through the arbitration system that’s part of the league’s collective bargaining agreement.

According to Fox 13 Memphis, Kaepernick may have a good case as there have been owners, such as John Mara of the New York Giants, who have publicly said that they would not hire him and the Denver Broncos reportedly would not pursue him under any circumstances.

President Donald Trump began feuding with the NFL in September after asking at a political rally in Alabama: “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a b---- off the field right now, out. He’s fired. He’s fired!’”

Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity Wednesday that the NFL should have suspended Kaepernick for kneeling during the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”

“The NFL should have suspended him for one game and he would have never done it again,” Trump told host Sean Hannity in Harrisburg, Pa. “They could have then suspended him for two games and they could have suspended him again if he did it a third time, for the season, and you would never have had a problem.”

“I will tell you,” Trump told Hannity, “you cannot disrespect our country, our flag, our anthem, you cannot do that.”

During my years of painting people’s homes, I’ve learned that small spaces don’t have to be boring or go unnoticed. All it takes is a little paint. By adding paint in strategic places around the home, you can easily and inexpensively transform a space. Plus, there is a good chance you could accomplish at least one of these eight painting projects during the course of one weekend.

Here are eight spaces to consider painting and my tips and tricks on making even the smallest places have a big impact.

1. Entryway. When a guest arrives, their first impression is based on your home’s exterior and the front door. Realtors call this curb appeal. But the very next thing guests will notice is the area right inside your front door, so you should use it to make a statement.

If your home has a formal entry, choose a paint color that is one to two shades darker than the next room. A darker paint color in the entryway can make the space feel more inviting, like a warm hug.

If your home has an open floor plan without a defined entryway, use paint to create one. Try a bold color on the wall surrounding the front door and an adjacent wall as visual borders for the entry.

2. Hall bath. Small bathrooms might appear to be limited when it comes to design, but they can easily be transformed with a quick paint color update.

How do you pick a color for this small bathroom? Look around your home for spots of color that crop up in your art or drapes. For example, a living room that is mostly beige with blue accent pieces would coordinate well with a bathroom painted in that same shade of blue.

Dark colors also have been trending with homeowners I’ve worked with lately. To offset the dark nature of the paint, we typically recommend keeping the other design details, such as the floors and sink, light to make sure the room still feels open and bright.

Worried one color will overwhelm the small space? Consider installing a chair rail as a natural divider. Then paint the lower portion of the wall in a statement color while leaving the wall area above a neutral tone.

3. Bookshelf. Whether the bookshelves in your home are built-in or freestanding, you can easily create style with paint. Remove the shelves from the surround and paint the back wall of the case. Don’t be afraid to go bold with your paint color, because once the shelves and objects on the shelves are in place, your color choice will seem more subtle. You will get an instant pop of color without being too in-your-face.

4. Closet. This space is often overlooked when it comes to paint, but a fresh coat of paint on the walls and shelving in your closet can go a long way. With a small- or medium-sized closet, keep your paint color choice bright and light.

With a large walk-in closet, consider using a paint color that complements the attached room.

For shelving, use an oil-based paint for durability against scratches and scuffs.

5. Hallway. Hallways are typically long and narrow and, depending on the lighting, can also be dark. When choosing a paint color for the hallway, consider the paint colors in connecting rooms and then go one to two shades lighter. The colors will complement each other and coordinate the home’s overall design. Plus, a lighter shade will brighten up the passageway.

6. Accent wall. If you have a small amount of paint and want to make the biggest impact on your home’s design, then an accent wall is your best bet. Choose a wall in your living room or master bedroom that you want to highlight, such as the area behind the sofa or bed.

Once it is painted, hang coordinating artwork on the accent wall to finish the design.

7. Kitchen nooks and crannies. Typically, I find there isn’t too much paintable space in the kitchen. But when I do find it, it’s between the cabinets, appliances and backsplash.

When space is limited, I always encourage owners to go bold and use colors that offset the room’s features. For example, in a kitchen with white cabinets and natural stone countertops, pick a hunter green or dark blue. In large quantities, these dark shades might feel overwhelming, but in small quantities, they give the room a strong dimension.

8. Laundry room. You can’t avoid the task of laundry, so at least make it a room that is easy on the eyes and generates positivity. Think of a paint color you would never dream of using in the social areas of your home but would make you happy, such as a playful orange, a bold purple or a sunshine yellow. Who knows, being around your favorite color might even make the chore a little more enjoyable.",Transform a whole house by painting these 8 small spaces,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/22/transform-whole-house-by-painting-these-8-small-spaces.html

So she’s changing the subject to…Donald Trump.

Which is, of course, a classic tactic of deflection that others are trying as well.

The former presidential candidate said she was “shocked and appalled” by the mounting sexual assault and harassment allegations against Weinstein, a big-time Democratic donor who threw a fundraiser for her. The movie mogul also donated $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation.

Yet it took Clinton nearly six days to be shocked and appalled, even as some of her fellow Democrats were speaking out and returning or donating Weinstein’s donations.

My view is that this is the kind of hyper-caution she exhibited during the campaign. Hillary couldn’t figure out what to do about Harvey, so she said nothing until the pressure got too great. And that drew criticism even from many mainstream journalists.

On Sunday, Clinton told the BBC’s Andrew Marr that we shouldn’t just focus on Weinstein but “recognize that this behavior cannot be tolerated anywhere, whether it is in entertainment, or politics–after all, we have someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office. There has to be a recognition that we must stand against this kind of action, which is so sexist and misogynistic.”

Taking a deep breath.

First, Trump has not “admitted” to engaging in sexual assault. On the “Access Hollywood” outtakes, made public a year ago, he talked to Billy Bush about grabbing women—but in his apology, Trump said it was just locker-room talk.

In the wake of that tape, a number of women accused the candidate of harassing or groping them, allegations that Trump denied. Many in the media thought that would derail his campaign, but it didn’t.

It’s worth pointing out, without minimizing those allegations in any way, that five women have now accused Weinstein of rape.

And by the way, the Clinton Foundation isn’t returning Weinstein’s 250K, saying the money’s already been spent. (Clinton did tell CNN she might donate a similar amount to charity.)

But in decrying sexual assault in the Oval Office, Hillary seems to be airbrushing from history a recent president who did admit having sex with a young staffer in that very space…her husband.

Even if you leave aside the allegations involving Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broaddrick and others, there is no evading the fact that Bill Clinton lied about his sexual misconduct with Monica Lewinsky.

When Marr, to his credit, asked about Trump bringing some of her husband’s accusers to the second debate, Hillary Clinton said “that had all been litigated. That was the subject of a huge investigation as you might recall in the late '90s and there were conclusions drawn and that was clearly in the past.”

So, it’s old news? That’s all she’s got?

Trump slapped back with this tweet: “I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020? My answer was, ‘I hope so!’”

Clinton is done running for office, as Trump well knows. She’s out there facing questions because of her book tour, and there was no way she could duck the Weinstein mess.

But by trying to turn the controversy against Trump, she left herself wide open for questions about the 42nd president, unintentionally turning the focus back to the dark days of impeachment.","Assault allegations: Hillary pivots from Harvey to Donald, spotlight swings to Bill",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/17/assault-allegations-hillary-pivots-from-harvey-to-donald-spotlight-swings-to-bill.html

Before this, scientists came up with two slightly different answers using different techniques.","It was a faint signal, but it told of one of the most violent acts in the universe, and it would soon reveal secrets of the cosmos, including how gold was created.

Forbes estimated that the collision created an estimated $10 octillion in gold, which is $10 billion, billion, billion.

What they witnessed in mid-August and revealed Monday was the long-ago collision of two neutron stars — a phenomenon California Institute of Technology's David H. Reitze called ""the most spectacular fireworks in the universe.""

The crash happened 130 million years ago, while dinosaurs still roamed on Earth, but the signal didn't arrive on Earth until Aug. 17 after traveling 130 million light-years. A light-year is 5.88 trillion miles.

""We already knew that iron came from a stellar explosion, the calcium in your bones came from stars and now we know the gold in your wedding ring came from merging neutron stars,"" said University of California Santa Cruz's Ryan Foley.

Measurements of the light and other energy emanating from the crash have helped scientists explain how planet-killing gamma ray bursts are born, how fast the universe is expanding, and where heavy elements like platinum and gold come from.

""This is getting everything you wish for,"" said Syracuse University physics professor Duncan Brown, one of more than 4,000 scientists involved in the blitz of science that the crash kicked off. ""This is our fantasy observation.""

It started in a galaxy called NGC 4993, seen from Earth in the Hydra constellation. Two neutron stars, collapsed cores of stars so dense that a teaspoon of their matter would weigh 1 billion tons, danced ever faster and closer together until they collided, said Carnegie Institution astronomer Maria Drout.

The crash, called a kilonova, generated a fierce burst of gamma rays and a gravitational wave, a faint ripple in the fabric of space and time, first theorized by Albert Einstein.

""This is like a cosmic atom smasher at a scale far beyond humans would be capable of building,"" said Andy Howell, a staff scientist at the Las Cumbres Observatory. ""We finally now know what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object and it's a kilonova.""

Signals were picked up within 1.7 seconds of each other, by NASA's Fermi telescope, which detects gamma rays, and gravity wave detectors in Louisiana and Washington state that are a part of the LIGO Laboratory , whose founders won a Nobel Prize earlier this month. A worldwide alert went out to focus telescopes on what became the most well-observed astronomical event in history.

Before August, the only other gravity waves detected by LIGO were generated by colliding black holes. But black holes let no light escape, so astronomers could see nothing.

This time there was plenty to see, measure and analyze: matter, light, and other radiation. The Hubble Space Telescope even got a snapshot of the afterglow.

Finding where the crash happened wasn't easy. Eventually scientists narrowed the location down to 100 galaxies, began a closer search of those, and found it in the ninth galaxy they looked at.

It is like ""the classic challenge of finding a needle in the haystack with the added challenge that the needle is fading away and the haystack is moving,"" said Marcelle Soares-Santos, an astrophysicist at Brandeis University.

""The completeness of this picture from the beginning to the end is unprecedented,"" said Columbia University physics professor Szabolcs Marka. ""There are many, many extraordinary discoveries within the discovery.""

The colliding stars spewed bright blue, super-hot debris that was dense and unstable. Some of it coalesced into heavy elements, like gold, platinum and uranium. Scientists had suspected neutron star collisions had enough power to create heavier elements, but weren't certain until they witnessed it.

""We see the gold being formed,"" said Syracuse's Brown.

Calculations from a telescope measuring ultraviolet light showed that the combined mass of the heavy elements from this explosion is 1,300 times the mass of Earth. And all that stuff — including lighter elements — was thrown out in all different directions and is now speeding across the universe.

Perhaps one day the material will clump together into planets the way ours was formed, Reitze said — maybe ones with rich veins of precious metals.

The crash also helped explain the origins of one of the most dangerous forces of the cosmos — short gamma ray bursts, focused beams of radiation that could erase life on any planet that happened to get in the way. These bursts shoot out in two different directions perpendicular to where the two neutron stars first crash, Reitze said.

Luckily for us, the beams of gamma rays were not focused on Earth and were generated too far away to be a threat, he said.

Scientists knew that the universe has been expanding since the Big Bang. By using LIGO to measure gravitational waves while watching this event unfold, researchers came up with a new estimate for how fast that is happening, the so-called Hubble Constant. Before this, scientists came up with two slightly different answers using different techniques. The rough figure that came out of this event is between the original two, Reitze said.

The first optical images showed a bright blue dot that was very hot, which was likely the start of the heavy element creation process amid the neutron star debris, Drout said. After a day or two that blue faded, becoming much fainter and redder. And after three weeks it was completely gone, she said.

This almost didn't happen. Eight days after the signal came through, the LIGO gravitational waves were shut down for a year's worth of planned upgrades. A month later the whole area where the crash happened would have been blocked from astronomers' prying eyes by the sun.

Scientists involved with the search for gravitational waves said this was the event they had prepared for over more than 20 years.

The findings are ""of spectacular importance,"" said Penn State physicist Abhay Ashtekar, who wasn't part of the research. ""This is really brand new.""

Almost all of the discoveries confirmed existing theories, but had not been proven — an encouraging result for theorists who have been trying to explain what is happening in the cosmos, said France Cordova, an astrophysicist who directs the National Science Foundation.

""We so far have been unable to prove Einstein wrong,"" said Georgia Tech physics professor Laura Cadonati. ""But we're going to keep trying.""

“Unless the hostile policy and the nuclear threat of the U.S. is thoroughly eradicated, we will never put our nuclear weapons and ballistic rockets on the negotiation table under any circumstance,” the North Korean official told the committee.

Pots and pans sure look gleaming and gorgeous coming out of the box, but after years of spaghetti dinners, roast chickens and holiday feasts, a well-used cookware arsenal is bound to show its age. Make your sauté pans, stockpots and skillets worthy of the hanging pot rack once again with a little elbow grease and a couple of easy-to-find, mild cleaning products (including ketchup, of all things) — and learn how keep the glow once you've got it back.

Below you'll find daily care and stain removal tips for cookware made of stainless steel, copper, enameled cast iron and more.

Good practices for all cookware. No matter the type of cookware, it is best to wash it as soon as possible after cooking (cleaning as you go is ideal), and use the least abrasive cleaning method you can. Washing by hand is always preferable, even for pots and pans that claim to be dishwasher safe. Washing by hand will prevent the scratches and discoloration that can happen in a dishwasher over time.

The tips and techniques that follow are good general guidelines, but you may also want to check the manufacturer's suggestions. If your cookware is under warranty, using the wrong cleaning product can void your agreement, so it pays to do your homework.

Stainless Steel

Everyday care: Ideally, wash your stainless steel pots and pans by hand soon after use, using regular dish soap. That said, stainless steel pans are one of the few types that can handle a trip through the dishwasher — so if you are in a rush, don't worry about tossing it in with the dishes. Regular cleaning in the dishwasher may create spots or a cloudy surface.

Stain removal: To brighten up cloudy or spotty stainless steel, rub the surface with a rag dampened with white vinegar. To treat stains on the bottom of the pan caused by high heat, sprinkle a gentle scouring powder (like Barkeeper's Friend) on a wet sponge or rag to create a paste, and rub it onto the stained area. Rinse with water.

Copper

Everyday care: Wash copper pots and pans by hand, using warm, soapy water.

Stain removal: Bring that lustrous finish back to discolored copper by covering your pan with ketchup (yes, ketchup) or lemon. Let the ketchup sit on your pan for at least 10 minutes, then rub the discoloration away with a rag or sponge. Rinse clean with warm water.

Enameled Cast Iron

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool before washing it — a sudden temperature change may crack the enamel. Soak the pan in warm water first, then use a soft sponge and a mild dishwashing detergent to clean it. Do not use abrasive scrubbing pads, as they can damage the enamel finish.

Stain removal: Treat discoloration on the outside of the pan using a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. For tough stains on the inside surface, fill the pan with white vinegar and water and bring to a boil on the stovetop. Turn off the heat and let the pan soak with the vinegar solution, then wash as usual.

Hard Anodized Aluminum

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool completely before washing it, and never place a hot pan in cold water, which can cause warping. Wash by hand, using a mild dishwashing detergent and warm water — putting your hard anodized pans in the dishwasher may void your warranty.

Stain removal: For stains on the outside only, use a paste of baking soda or a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. Rinse with warm water.

Nonstick

Everyday care: Use low to medium heat only — higher temperatures can permanently damage nonstick pans. Wash promptly with a soft sponge and warm, soapy water. If scratches or flakes begin to appear on the nonstick surface of your pan, recycle or toss it immediately. Otherwise those flakes will end up in your food ... not something you want to happen!

Stain removal: On the outside only, try using a paste of Barkeeper's Friend or a similar scouring powder.

Cast Iron

Initial seasoning: When you buy a new cast iron pan, wash it by hand in warm, soapy water. Dry the pan with a towel, then put it in a 300-degree oven for about five minutes to dry it completely — even a bit of remaining moisture can cause rust to form on cast iron pans. Next, using a paper towel, rub about a tablespoon of olive or vegetable oil over the surface of the pan, inside and out. Wipe away excess oil — you are aiming for a thin coat. Put the pan in a 300-degree oven for an hour, let it cool, then rub it all over with a clean rag.

Everyday care: Never use soap on your cast iron pan. Promptly after each use, wipe out the pan using a paper towel and a bit of oil. If food is stuck on, run the pan under hot water and scrub the food off with a soft brush or plastic scouring pad — remember, no soap! Soap will remove the seasoning, which is what creates that wonderful nonstick surface.

Stain removal and long-term care: For really tough, stuck-on food, boil water in your pan on the stovetop for a few minutes, then clean it as usual. Reseasoning occasionally will help maintain the finish.

Clay Pot

Everyday care: Most clay pots must be soaked in water for 15 to 30 minutes before each use. Always place your clay pot in a cold oven so the pot can come up to temperature gradually. Do not use your clay pot on the stovetop or under a broiler, and never put a hot pot on a cold surface — any sudden temperature changes can break it.

Clean it promptly, using a paste of baking soda; rinse with warm water. Soap is not recommended for unglazed clay pots, though you may be able to use a mild soap on clay pots that have been glazed; check with the manufacturer.

Stain removal: Try leaving a paste of baking soda on the discolored area for at least 10 minutes, then wipe away and rinse with water. Do not use abrasive sponges or harsh cleaning products on a clay pot.",Essential cleaning tips for the 7 most popular cookware materials,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/essential-cleaning-tips-for-7-most-popular-cookware-materials.html

As the reclamation party begins in Key West, many residents feel that, because the cleanup is still underway, the party is happening too soon.
Officials said tourism will return to Key West in a limited capacity on Sunday with the arrival of a cruise ship at the Margaritaville Pier.","As Florida Keys residents continue to pick up their lives after Hurricane Irma, they are still coming to grips with the fact that cleanup is nowhere near complete, but on Thursday, some of them got a visit from two well-known public figures committed to helping the region.

Bruce Hornsby could be heard at Key West’s Mallory Square as a “reclamation party” got underway, Thursday afternoon. The feeling was positive and the outlook was bright.

Hours later, Key West Mayor Craig Cates came in to Two Friends Patio Restaurant for dinner, as nearby Duval Street began to show signs of life.

“Key West is going to be open for business soon,” said Cates.

When asked about the higher volume of people out and about, the mayor replied, “Well, we’re taking visitors now. We haven’t advertised yet,” he said.

Cates, however, pointed out that the hardest hit parts of the Keys are still picking up the pieces from Irma’s devastation. “We understand our neighbors to the north in the Florida Keys got more damage than us,” he said.

In nearby Big Pine Key, the cleanup is still ongoing.

Among those cleaning up are 85-year-old Wes Harris and his wife. “We’ve been married 63 years,” he said.

The couple rode out the storm near their now beat-up home.

The wheelchair ramp into Harris’ home was just recently repaired by first responders, but there’s still so much more to do.

“See that rock? You see how big that rock is?” Harris said as he pointed to a large boulder in his yard. “That’s not my rock. I don’t know where the hell it came from.”

The legally blind U.S. Army veteran, who suffers from spinal stenosis, lost his orchid ranch, which he says had between 7,000 and 8,000 flowers.

Harris is so tough that the idea of getting a little emotional over the relief effort in the aftermath of the storm makes him annoyed.

“I just can’t believe how everybody has helped. It’s absolutely unbelievable,” Harris said.

Harris’ post-storm story isn’t necessarily unique. Residents told 7News about problems with their house, their boat, or in some cases, both.

Big names also came to help out the Keys, in the form of former football player Tim Tebow and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.

“So many people are so tough, and what they’ve gone through,” said Tebow. “You know what’s even more special? So many people, who don’t know what’s even going on with their houses, but they’re still volunteering for other people that need help.”

Residents appreciated Tebow’s visit. “He’s such a huge model for me, so it’s a nice thing that he came down here to the Keys,” said one woman.

7News cameras captured Rubio posing for pictures, as food, ice and relief supplies got to those in need.

When asked what he would say to those residents who fear they may be forgotten, Rubio responded: “They won’t be forgotten by us — I don’t know if someone else will — primarily because we’ve spent a lot of time, personally, in the Keys, up and down this place. I mean my family, we’ve had so many incredible memories here. We want to see the Keys come back.”

Meanwhile, Harris indicated he will make it through that strong current called adversity, probably because of his big heart. “You’ve got to keep stroking, bud. That’s all you can do,” he said.

As the reclamation party begins in Key West, many residents feel that, because the cleanup is still underway, the party is happening too soon. however, others feel that it needs to happen to show that the Florida Keys are still alive.

Officials said tourism will return to Key West in a limited capacity on Sunday with the arrival of a cruise ship at the Margaritaville Pier. It is scheduled to arrive at noon.

Now, the man himself, Kevin James, is finally speaking up on the matter.

As previously reported, Hayes was written out of the show in a rather unceremonious way, with James’ character offhandedly mentioning that she died. In her place, James’ former “King of Queens” co-star, Leah Remini, joined the cast as a series regular after her memorable guest starring role on the Season 1 finale. Still, many fans are wondering why Hayes had to go for the series to continue.

Speaking to New York Daily News, James revealed that the real issue had to do with the show’s longevity.

“I get that people are like ‘Whoa, why would you do this?’ But it really felt like a thing like this was needed for this show to drive forward,” he said.

Now, the character will have to run all his family interactions through the filter of being a newly single parent, which James believes will set the show apart from others and will help guarantee a longer run.

“The plot of the show didn’t have enough drive,” he said of Hayes Season 1 arc. “If we got through a second season, I wouldn’t see us getting through a third one. We were literally just running out of ideas.”

Although the choice outraged many fans, “Kevin Can Wait” is sticking to its decision, which producer Rob Long defended to TV Line in August, saying that the decision to kill off the Donna character and to avoid addressing it too directly was all part of the plan, and the only move to make.

“The goal was to give Kevin’s character a real drive and a real predicament [involving] how a family comes back together [after tragedy],” he said. “Also, out of respect for the character of Donna - and certainly the way that erinn Hayes portrayed her - it seemed like the only right and fair way to treat her character.”

An abandoned funeral home in Rogersville, Mo., will be transformed into a haunted house for a high school fundraiser. But some of the town’s residents are crying foul – saying it’s an inappropriate and insensitive place to hold the Halloween-themed event.

The Preston-Marsh Funeral Home has been abandoned for some time and was slated to be demolished. But the owner of the building granted permission to students from Logan-Rogersville High School to use it for a haunted house fundraiser, WYMT reported.

The Logan-Rogersville High School said proceeds from the “Rogersville Horror Story” event would go to an event for the school’s seniors on graduation night. The organizers said they were going to utilize the leftover equipment left inside the funeral home as a way to enhance the spooky experience.

""I understand why people are upset. But, it is just a building,"" Christie Davis, a resident, told WYMT. ""But, the [deceased] people are no longer there. Everybody in Rogersville has had friends or family go through this funeral home. I know I have.""

""Some of us have friends that have lost their children on graduation nights in years past, and this is just a great way to prevent that from happening to somebody else,"" Davis said.

Residents took to Facebook to express their anger at the funeral home being used as a haunted house. WYMT reported some users said it was “distasteful” and “insensitive” to use “a place for grief and mourning to make a mockery of death.”

But others said it was an appropriate use of the building.

: “So much sadness occurred in this building. Now, for its last service to the community it gets to bring happiness and laughter, as well as some good scares to everyone...and for a good cause. What better way to end things?”

Three songs into his show in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the singer launched into a five-minute speech that honored the 58 killed and nearly 500 hurt in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. But Aldean took a defiant tone in telling concertgoers to resist living in fear, and he called for more of the national unity he's seen since the attack.

""These people are going to continue to try to hold us down,"" Aldean said. ""To those people that keep trying to do that, I say (expletive) you, we don't really care.""

Fans agreed. They pumped their fists and held up American flags as Aldean continued.

""I want to play the show for you guys that the people in Las Vegas came to see and didn't get a chance to,"" he said.

Friends Audra Miller, Lee Holstein and Amanda Zmak were some of those fans. They were in the audience when the shooting happened and ran for cover like thousands of others.

They traveled from Dallas for the Tulsa show and wore T-shirts they decorated themselves that said ""Vegas Strong,"" a popular meme since the attack.

Miller, 34, said Aldean made them proud and viewed the evening as a triumph.

""It was therapeutic and kind of like a cleansing all at the same time,"" she said. ""We just wanted to represent family, friends, love and hope.""

Aldean gave fans the show they wanted. The Georgia native is one of country music's biggest stars, touring in support of his album ""They Don't Know,"" which debuted atop the Billboard 200 in 2016. Much of his catalog includes Southern rock, pop and hip-hop influences, a mix of hard-charging party anthems and ballads with lyrics about farm work, drinking and small-town life.

He blasted through hits including ""Big Green Tractor,"" ''Fly Over States"" and ""She's Country,"" and popped open a can of beer onstage after the encore.

Aldean canceled shows in California last week to mourn those killed Oct. 1 at the outdoor Route 91 festival. He resumed his tour in an arena where concertgoers walked through metal detectors, and police presence was visible.

The singer visited shooting victims still in a Las Vegas hospital Sunday. The day before, Aldean performed Tom Petty's ""I Won't Back Down"" on ""Saturday Night Live"" in tribute to the victims and the late rock superstar.

Petty died the day after the shooting in Los Angeles after suffering cardiac arrest.

Meet the world’s hottest nurse — Instagram star Lauren Drain.

The gorgeous 31-year-old started her career in healthcare at age 16 and has been a cardiac registered nurse for more than eight years.

She has worked in various different roles during her accomplished career, including intensive care units as well acting as a charge nurse in operating theatres.

MILITARY DENTIST MOONLIGHTS AS INSTAGRAM FITNESS MODEL

Lauren, from Florida, has a strong passion for health, wellness and quality of life. She believes an active lifestyle is key to long lasting health.

""After eight years in professional healthcare, I have never seen a natural athlete stuck in a terrible health crisis,"" she said.

""There's a reason for that: Fit, active lifestyles reduce the risk of disease and promote overall wellness.""

After years of helping patients in hospitals, Lauren realized it was having a detrimental effect on her on well-being.

She felt overworked, overstressed, overweight, fatigued and extremely unhappy, so she decided to take control of her life and get her priorities straight.

She said: ""I wanted to be a healthy, fit, strong, confident woman, actively preventing disease instead of treating everything with pills and medication.

""I wanted to change my life for the better and I wanted to help others before they lost control of their health too.""

The ultra-fit beauty never set out to become a ""fitness model.""

""I let the winter and holiday seasons get the best of me. I was unhappy with what I saw in the mirror and I felt even worse, so I decided to make a change for the better.""

FITNESS TRAINER RESPONDS TO FAT-SHAMING AFTER USA TODAY SEGMENT

She embarked on a paleo challenge, which involves eating a caveman-style diet and produced motivating results leading her to research entering competition shows.

After YouTubing to find out about the scene, she bit the bullet and signed up for her first bikini show where she placed 9th out of 30 competitors.

This spiked her interest and gave her the thirst to go for her professional card.

She hired a coach, entered more and more shows, and finally got the top spot in an amateur show, giving the opportunity to compete for money in professional body building, fitness and aesthetic shows.

She has since opened up her private Instagram account and now has over 3.6 million followers to whom she shares inspirational images of her stunning figure and workout routines, as well as the odd sexy picture of her self in tiny lingerie and bikinis.

To improve the state of marriage in this country, what we need are fewer feminists and fewer Uncle Tims.
We need real men who aren't afraid to stand up to feminist gobbledygook.","Editor's note: The following column first appeared on SuzanneVenker.com.

Have you ever made your husband a sandwich? If so, you should be ashamed of yourself. Don't you realize such behavior sets women back decades?

That's the message of a new article in The Daily Telegraph, entitled ""When making a sandwich is a crime against feminism,"" about an Australian woman named Maddie who asked a Facebook group of 26,186 mothers whether anyone had some yummy alternatives for her husband's lunches, which she said she makes for him every day.

Now that's what anyone I know would call a nice wife.

But that's not what Maddie was called on Facebook. Instead, she was told she was nothing but a “slave” and a “1950s housewife."" She was also “weird,” as no woman in her right mind would do something so demeaning as to make her husband lunch.

The feminist worldview is antithetical to love because its focus is solely on women: their needs, their wants, their desires, and their rights. Love can’t possibly be sustained with an attitude like that.

Here's just a sampling of some of the responses Maddie got:

“Your husband is a grown up, and you’re not his mother!”

“My husband can make his own damn lunch.”

""I make my husband the same thing he makes me. Nothing!!”

“Stuff that, hubby is a grown man. I already do his laundry and keep his children alive.”

“Our advice is to stop making his lunches.”

“My role is childcare during working hours and that’s it.”

“He’s lucky if I decide to make dinner some nights.""

That, my friends, is what feminists brought to America in the 1970s.

And it stuck.

The idea that a wife would—or God forbid, should—do anything for her husband with no expectation for anything in return—just to be nice, because, as Maddie put it, she ""loves her man"" and they ""can't afford to eat out""— makes her weak.

Honestly, is it really any wonder why the relationship between the sexes is such a mess today? Or why, as Bloomberg published just last week, married Americans are unhappier than ever? In my opinion, it is largely because there are so many women in America today who, either knowingly or unknowingly, have a feminist mind.

Feminists teach women, above all else, to stand up for themselves against the evil men of the world. Even harmless husbands fall into the category of 'evil men' since they supposedly long to lord over their wives. Thus, the knee-jerk reaction to the suggestion that a wife might serve her husband in some way—make him a drink or a meal—is to become defensive. Yet, if we turn the scenario around, if a husband were to serve his wife in any way, well, that's acceptable.

The feminist worldview is antithetical to love because its focus is solely on women: their needs, their wants, their desires, and their rights. Love can’t possibly be sustained with an attitude like that.

Of course, there are men who support feminists. My friend Helen Smith, Ph.D., refers to these type of men as ""Uncle Tims"" in her book ""Men on Strike."" An Uncle Tim is a male sellout who kowtows to feminists because he's (a) just as left-wing as they are and thus agrees with the feminist worldview, or (b) too weak to stand up for himself and knows that if he says anything he's not suppose to, he won't get sex.

Most Uncle Tims who fall under category A live on the East and West coasts. Those who fall under category B can live anywhere, but the one area of the country they're scarce is in the South and the Midwest. Because that's where the real men live.

And real men don't marry feminists.

The men who do have been feminized and are proud of not being ""the man of the house."" They see that as backwards and take pride in their progressive, non manly ways. Of course, don't expect an Uncle Tim to kill the intruder in the house on his wife's behalf—he's given up the role of provider and protector. He and his wife are equals!

Unfortunately, the Uncle Tims are often the ones who lose in the end because all too often feminist wives regret their choice to make their marriages androgynous—and the men who give up their manhood, because they thought that's what women and society wanted—are left in the dust.

To improve the state of marriage in this country, what we need are fewer feminists and fewer Uncle Tims. We need real men who aren't afraid to stand up to feminist gobbledygook. A fantastic example is Chad Prather, aka Political Cowboy—who, not coincidentally, is from Texas. Check out his very funny (and very true) video on gender INequality!

Now there's a real man.

And I'd bet my life savings his wife isn't a feminist.",Are you weak if you make your man a sandwich? This is why real men don’t marry feminists,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/14/are-weak-if-make-your-man-sandwich-this-is-why-real-men-don-t-marry-feminists.html

As the weather turns cooler, you might be looking for ways to keep outdoor living part of your routine. These 10 ideas can help make the most of enjoying the fresh air on your porch and patio or in your yard this season, whether you’re bookmarking dates for fall outings or looking for ways to keep your garden inviting.

1. Host a backyard party. Invite guests to bundle up and come outside to enjoy the crisp air for all or part of the evening. Make an outdoor lounge spot feel cozy with extra throw blankets and pillows brought out from inside the house. Light candles for an inviting glow or move chairs around an outdoor fire pit to take advantage of the warmth.

2. Move a porch swing outside. Admire the changing leaves from a front-row seat by hanging a porch swing in the garden. Look for a large lateral branch from a mature tree or — even easier — hang from a backyard shade pergola, if you have one. Finishing touches like pumpkin-colored pillows and pots of mums on either side make the swinging lounge even more festive.

3. Pick for a good cause. This year, why not trade a visit to a U-pick farm for a harvesting day out that will leave both you and the greater community a little richer in fall produce? Nonprofit organizations like San Francisco Bay Area-based Village Harvest host weekly picking trips to local backyards and small orchards where volunteers harvest the excess produce for community members in need.

You can also expect to take home fruit that’s not fit for donation (but may be perfect for pie) like those that are extra ripe, fragile or slightly damaged. You can join a trip or list your backyard if you have a couple of fruit trees with more ripe fruit than you can handle.

This time of year, expect to harvest apples, pears, persimmons and pomegranates, among others.

4. Find a sun trap. Gardens this time of year can feel damp and chilly but often have areas that catch the sun’s rays. Seek out these warm places or follow your cat or dog in the afternoon — they always seem to find them — as spots to linger and appreciate the last of the season’s warmth.

5. Embrace indoors-outdoors. Moving outdoor furniture under an overhang can be a great way to extend your ability to enjoy a meal or relax outside in a transitional season. If fall in your region means rain, the covered roof can make the difference of eating outside or indoors.

6. Invest in landscape heaters. Adding heat can make a big difference if you’d like to linger outside in cool weather. Installing small wall-mounted or ceiling-mounted outdoor heaters may be easier than you think. The units run from $120 to $200 in big-box stores and can be plugged in to regular home electricity systems. Most wall- or ceiling-mounted models cast about a nine-foot-square “heat blanket” — one heater would be enough for a cafe set, while two can heat an outdoor dining table.

7. Get cozy with sheepskins. Instantly make cold outdoor furniture feel more inviting by covering the seats or seat backs with a cozy material. Sheepskins (faux and real) provide warmth and a cushy padding, while throw blankets can double as wraps later in the evening.

8. Pick out a portable fire pit. It’s no surprise that adding a fire pit can really make your patio functional in the cooler months, providing warmth, light and a great excuse to go outside — s’mores! While large-scale fire pits and outdoor fireplaces can be pricey investments, smaller, portable gas-burning models come at a more wallet-friendly price. Plus, being portable, they can easily be moved from one area of the garden to another or brought in the garage for the winter.

9. Brighten up your porch. Hanging a few strings of lights can be all it takes to transform a shadowy porch into an alluring spot. Set the lights on your front porch on a timer so they turn on when you’re coming home in the evening, making for a bright and welcoming entry.

So she’s changing the subject to…Donald Trump.

Which is, of course, a classic tactic of deflection that others are trying as well.

The former presidential candidate said she was “shocked and appalled” by the mounting sexual assault and harassment allegations against Weinstein, a big-time Democratic donor who threw a fundraiser for her. The movie mogul also donated $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation.

Yet it took Clinton nearly six days to be shocked and appalled, even as some of her fellow Democrats were speaking out and returning or donating Weinstein’s donations.

My view is that this is the kind of hyper-caution she exhibited during the campaign. Hillary couldn’t figure out what to do about Harvey, so she said nothing until the pressure got too great. And that drew criticism even from many mainstream journalists.

On Sunday, Clinton told the BBC’s Andrew Marr that we shouldn’t just focus on Weinstein but “recognize that this behavior cannot be tolerated anywhere, whether it is in entertainment, or politics–after all, we have someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office. There has to be a recognition that we must stand against this kind of action, which is so sexist and misogynistic.”

Taking a deep breath.

First, Trump has not “admitted” to engaging in sexual assault. On the “Access Hollywood” outtakes, made public a year ago, he talked to Billy Bush about grabbing women—but in his apology, Trump said it was just locker-room talk.

In the wake of that tape, a number of women accused the candidate of harassing or groping them, allegations that Trump denied. Many in the media thought that would derail his campaign, but it didn’t.

It’s worth pointing out, without minimizing those allegations in any way, that five women have now accused Weinstein of rape.

And by the way, the Clinton Foundation isn’t returning Weinstein’s 250K, saying the money’s already been spent. (Clinton did tell CNN she might donate a similar amount to charity.)

But in decrying sexual assault in the Oval Office, Hillary seems to be airbrushing from history a recent president who did admit having sex with a young staffer in that very space…her husband.

Even if you leave aside the allegations involving Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broaddrick and others, there is no evading the fact that Bill Clinton lied about his sexual misconduct with Monica Lewinsky.

When Marr, to his credit, asked about Trump bringing some of her husband’s accusers to the second debate, Hillary Clinton said “that had all been litigated. That was the subject of a huge investigation as you might recall in the late '90s and there were conclusions drawn and that was clearly in the past.”

So, it’s old news? That’s all she’s got?

Trump slapped back with this tweet: “I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020? My answer was, ‘I hope so!’”

Clinton is done running for office, as Trump well knows. She’s out there facing questions because of her book tour, and there was no way she could duck the Weinstein mess.

But by trying to turn the controversy against Trump, she left herself wide open for questions about the 42nd president, unintentionally turning the focus back to the dark days of impeachment.","Assault allegations: Hillary pivots from Harvey to Donald, spotlight swings to Bill",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/17/assault-allegations-hillary-pivots-from-harvey-to-donald-spotlight-swings-to-bill.html

Weinstein announced in August that he would direct “Mila 18,” an adaptation of Leon Uris’ novel about the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.

“It was a book that inspired me,” Weinstein, who directed the 1986 comedy “Playing for Keeps” with his brother Bob, wrote in a Deadline Hollywood piece. “It’s the triumph of a few Jewish rebels (men and women) who think they’re going to die and instead defeat thousands of German soldiers in the ghetto.”

With the film exec now in rehab, questions are swirling about what will happen with various Weinstein Co. projects. The company’s name has already been stripped from the Amazon series “The Romanoffs,” and the phones at the Weinstein Co. are being answered “TWC.”

Weinstein’s supposed next big Oscar contender, “The Current War” — starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Thomas Edison — was scheduled to be released in November, but has now been postponed indefinitely into next year.

“The Upside,” with Kevin Hart and Bryan Cranston is still slated for wide release in March, but it will not be getting an Oscar-qualifying run, as had been previously discussed.

Two other Weinstein projects may be in limbo: the movie version of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Broadway show “In the Heights,” and an adaptation of Lisa Bloom’s book about the Trayvon Martin case, “Suspicion Nation.”

“Harvey’s name is toxic now. No one wants to be associated with him,” one Hollywood veteran told me.

The Weinstein Co. had no comment, but an insider said, “This is speculation. None of the things you’re reporting seem to be known at all right now.”

It was announced Monday that Colony Capital would be giving the struggling business a cash infusion.

The new funds will be needed to distribute three films from Bob’s genre division, Dimension Films, including the Robert De Niro comedy “The War With Grandpa,” and “Paddington 2,” with Hugh Grant as the villain.

""My libido’s vanished""

A post shared by Nikki Harvey (@nikki_harvey_fitness) on Sep 11, 2017 at 10:46am PDT

Nikki Harvey worries that her “zero sex drive” will push away her 26-year-old partner Jordan Burgess, a personal trainer.

Nikki, from Wolverhampton, a city 125 miles north-west of London, was an overweight smoker who did not exercise but has transformed her body in three years. She says:

“In the autumn of 2014, I was a size 16, drinking, smoking, living off junk food and generally pretty miserable.”

“One night I met Jordan and we quickly became an item.”

“He’s a rugby player and he caught me crying to myself in my bedroom when I couldn’t fit into my size 14 clothes.”

“He told me anyone can turn their life around and inspired me to get healthy and take up fitness and bodybuilding.”

“I signed up for a 14-week intensive program, pushing me harder than I ever dreamed possible. I loved every second.”

“Every gram of excess weight was stripped from my body – better than any faddy diet.”

“I now train every morning at 5:30 a.m. for two hours, then do an hour’s cardio every evening.”

“It really impacts on my relationship. I haven’t been on a date night with Jordan since January and my libido has vanished.”

“Right now I have zero sex drive so Jordan and I haven’t made love for two months. Jordan hates it but he knows it’s not because I don’t fancy him. I love my training so much that two months ago I quit my job to do it full time.”

“In April I came second in the UK Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation National Finals and qualified for three inter-national champion-ships.”

“My libido might be gone but I look better and am now so much healthier.”

“I just hope that Jordan will stick by me without sex.”

""I don’t need a relationship""

A post shared by Gabriella Rose Prior (@gabriellaroseprior) on May 24, 2017 at 6:29am PDT

Fitness addict Gabriella Prior, 22, from Bournemouth, a city 100 miles south-west of London, would rather be in good shape than have a sex life. Gabriella has not had sex for more than 18 months. She says:

“At the start of 2016, I did almost no exercise. I went out drinking, enjoyed lazy weekends, had boyfriends and a healthy sex life. I wasn’t depressed but I felt like I didn’t have any hobbies.”

“One morning, on a whim, I decided to join the nearby House of Pain boxing gym. I was nervous but when I left I was so full of energy I couldn’t wait to do it again.”

“Exercising is now like a drug to me. Within weeks I was training twice a day for two hours each session, five or six days a week. I still do that now.”

“It’s 100 percent effort training with weights, sparring and cardio. Boxing isn’t a sport you do by halves. I can hardly tie my shoe laces after I have finished a session, let alone think about sex. I used to have boyfriends but they ran their course.”

“Now I don’t have time to meet men. I have realised I don’t need a relationship or sex to be happy. I value independence and fitness more than I thought possible. My sex life now is a dim and distant memory.”

“I hope that if I ever want to, I can reduce the intensity of my training and then get my libido back. But I’m not bothered now.”

“I’ve had a couple of short-lived relation-ships since I started training but quickly I’ve been dumped because they thought I was boring, as I did not want to have sex all the time.”

“I have been crowned Miss Fitness Inspiration UK, which means more to me than any amount of sex.”

A patent application recently filed by the automaker, and first uncovered by TTAC.com, depicts a storage system for SUVs that uses detachable bins that slip into the sidewalls of a cargo bay.

The application says they solve the problem of having a place to keep small items from rolling around in the vehicle, while also providing lockable compartments for them.

There’s one located on each side of the vehicle. They can slide out like drawers or be completely removed. Built-in wheels and haldes allow them to be transported like rolling luggage, and the two can be attached to make them easier to transport.

A smartphone dock is incorporated in the design that feeds into a passive sound-amplifying channel, and they’re potentially insulated and waterproof, so they can keep food warm or be filled with ice instead.

There’s no telling when or if the feature will show up in a Ford product, if ever, or even any guarantee that a patent on it will be granted, but it’s an interesting idea.

Brig. Gen. Talal Sillo told The Associated Press on Tuesday there were no longer clashes going on in the city, and that a formal declaration would follow.

Despite Sillo's announcement, a U.S. military spokesperson told Fox News the ISIS stronghold has been 90 percent recaptured and some fighting remains.

""There are still areas that have not been cleared,"" Army Col. Ryan Dillon told Fox News in an interviewfrom Baghdad.

The loss deprived the terror group of the capital of its so-called caliphate, which has dwindled from a land mass spanning two countries to a sliver of space in Syria.

The last group of Islamic State militants had been holed up Tuesday in a stadium in the Syrian city of Raqqa, their last stand as U.S. backed, Kurdish-led forces closed in around them.

Coalition forces captured the city hospital earlier in the day, which doubled as an ISIS command center.

Musafa Bali, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces, told the AP around 22 ISIS militants were killed in the advance on the hospital.

The remaining soldiers of terror were cornered in an area around the city's municipal stadium, which they had turned into a huge prison where they incarcerated anyone who opposed their brutal rule.

The Kurdish-run Hawar news agency said with the capture of the hospital, the last black ISIS flag raised in the city had been taken down. A video released by the news agency illustrated the clashes around the hospital building, which appeared riddled with bullets and partly blackened from a fire.

The U.S.-led coalition said it had not carried out any airstrikes in or around Raqqa for 24 hours, starting from noon Sunday.

The battle for Raqqa began in June and has dragged for weeks as the SDF fighters faced stiff resistance from the militants.

Losing Raqqa has been a huge blow for ISIS, which has steadily lost territory in Iraq and Syria, including Iraq's second largest city of Mosul a few months ago.

The group declared the city on the banks of the Euphrates River, which it seized from other Syrian rebels in early 2014, to be the capital of its self-styled ""caliphate,"" transforming the once vibrant metropolis into the epicenter of its brutal rule where opponents were beheaded and terror plots were hatched.

“Let’s hope it all works out for your boyfriend,” she claims Weinstein told her during the incident.","Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct toward women spanning decades. Newly detailed allegations include rape, harassment and assault.

Actresses Angelina Jolie, Ashley Judd and Gwyneth Paltrow are among the women who have spoken publicly about alleged incidents involving Weinstein.

Here's what he has been accused of, based on recent reports.

Thursday, October 5

An Oct. 5 expose from The New York Times detailed Weinstein's alleged misconduct -- and said that the Hollywood titan has made eight settlements with women.

“Scream” actress Rose McGowan was paid a $100,000 settlement from Weinstein in 1997 following a hotel room incident, The Times reported. The settlement wasn't an admission of guilt, the paper described a legal document as saying.

The Times report also detailed how Weinstein, while in a bathrobe in his hotel room, had asked if he could give actress Ashley Judd a massage or if the star could watch him take a shower.

""How do I get out of the room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein?"" Judd told the newspaper she recalled thinking.

Former employees told The Times that an unnamed Miramax employee left the company not long after an alleged incident involving the producer. The employees said that the woman received a settlement.

In 1998, Zelda Perkins, a former production assistant with Miramax, allegedly confronted Weinstein, and told him to stop his “inappropriate requests or comments in hotel rooms,” The New York Times reported.

Perkins, now working as a theater producer in London, was reportedly concerned for other women working in the office, and threatened Weinstein’s behavior with legal action, according to former coworkers.

The Times reported that Miramax negotiated a settlement with Perkins and her lawyer, and Perkins declined to discuss what happened with the newspaper.

Emily Nestor, a temporary employee of Weinstein’s, said he’d made sexual advances to her as well, promising he’d help with her career, according to the report.

Additionally, The Times reported an incident with Weinstein and an unnamed assistant, who he reportedly tried to convince to give him a massage while he stood naked in front of her at a hotel, which left her “crying and very distraught,” according to a memo by Lauren O’Connor.

In O’Connor’s 2015 memo, in which she penned several accounts of women in the company and the atmosphere Weinstein’s advances created, she recalled how Weinstein would ask her to meet with aspiring actresses after they’d have meetings with him in his hotel room.

She wrote how she felt that she was being used to build relationships with “vulnerable women who hope he will get them work.” O'Connor reportedly settled with Weinstein.

Laura Madden detailed to The Times how Weinstein had asked her more than once for massages at hotels and how he would constantly make her re-evaluate herself after rejecting him.

“It was so manipulative,” Madden said. “You constantly question yourself – am I the one who is the problem?”

Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, an Italian model and actress, met with Weinstein at his office in New York’s SoHo neighborhood in 2015, The Times reported. But Gutierrez reportedly called the police hours later saying Weinstein had grabbed her breasts, while asking if they were real, and put his hand up her skirt.

Charges were ultimately not filed against Weinstein, and he and Gutierrez reportedly agreed to a settlement, according to anonymous sources who spoke with The Times.

Overall, eight women detailed their alleged inappropriate interactions with Weinstein to The New York Times. The report alleges that various employees were asked to perform ""turndown duty"" for Weinstein, which included getting him ready for bed at night and also waking him up in the morning.

“I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it,"" Weinstein told The Times in a statement. ""Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go.""

Rebecca Traister, a reporter for The Cut, discussed in an essay about how she encountered Weinstein while covering one of his book parties in early 2000. She claimed he screamed at her for a question she asked, calling her an obscene name.

When her boyfriend and colleague intervened and tried to get Weinstein to apologize to her, she said “Weinstein went nuclear.” He reportedly pushed her boyfriend down a set of stairs and dragged him out to the street in a headlock.

Traister said the altercation was later described as “a case of an aggressive reporter barging into a party she wasn’t invited to and asking impertinent questions.”

Friday, October 6

Fox 11’s Lauren Sivan detailed an alleged 2007 encounter with Weinstein in a HuffPost report. Sivan said that while working for local station News 12 Long Island, Weinstein cornered her in the hallway of a Manhattan restaurant closed to the public and masturbated in front of her.

Sivan said she had rejected an attempt by Weinstein to kiss her and told him she had a boyfriend. “Well, can you just stand there and shut up,” she claims he responded prior to allegedly masturbating.

“Luckily I didn't need a job or favor from him + didn't have to be polite,” Sivan tweeted Friday. “Others did. Keep that in mind.”

In another tweet, she said, “For those asking why I waited? YOU try telling that story 10yrs ago. Only possible now because of women with bigger names far braver than me.”

She later spoke about the alleged incident on Megyn Kelly’s NBC show Monday.

In a tweet which has since been deleted, “Shaun of the Dead” actress Jessica Hynes recounted an alleged incident involving Weinstein, People reported.

“I was offered a film role at 19,” the 44-year-old reportedly wrote on Twitter. She alleged that Weinstein “came on board and wanted me to screen test in a bikini. I refused & lost the job.”

Saturday, October 7

Former model Zoe Brock wrote in a blog post for Medium that in 1997, when she was 23, she was ""Harveyed."" Brock said she ""had no intention of leading"" Weinstein on, and ""felt safe in his company to be"" herself.

Weinstein allegedly tricked her into going to his hotel room, where she found herself with no phone and no cash. He appeared naked and asked her for a massage, she said, adding that she felt ""uncomfortable.""

Brock eventually, according to her blog post, got Weinstein to let her leave.

Sunday, October 8

The Wrap founder Sharon Waxman claimed in an article that while working for The New York Times in 2004, she “got the green light to look into oft-repeated allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein.”

Waxman said she was able to find the man in charge of Miramax Italy. Citing “multiple accounts,” she alleged that “his real job was to take care of Weinstein’s women needs, among other things.”

Waxman claimed she was able to find “a woman in London who had been paid off after an unwanted sexual encounter with Weinstein,” she recalled in her piece.

However, Waxman alleged that there had been “intense pressure from Weinstein,” with the article “gutted.”

“The story was stripped of any reference to sexual favors or coercion and buried on the inside of the Culture section, an obscure story about Miramax firing an Italian executive,” she wrote.

“Our former colleague Sharon Waxman wrote about a story that was published in The Times in 2004,” a Times spokesperson told Fox News. “No one currently at The Times has knowledge of editorial decisions made on that story. But in general the only reason a story or specific information would be held is if it did not meet our standards for publication.”

British writer Liza Campbell alleged in an essay published in The Sunday Times of London that Weinstein suggested she take a bath with him at a hotel. Weinstein had earlier ""offered me freelance script-reading for Miramax,"" she wrote.

""Soon I was sent the script of Shakespeare in Love to summarise and critique, followed by The Usual Suspects,"" she wrote. ""And then the scripts stopped coming. I rang the Miramax offices, but nothing happened.""

She says that in a phone call with Weinstein, she told the producer that ""everything had stuttered to a halt. He said: ""You better come to my hotel and we’ll sort this out.""""

When she met him at his suite, there were initially several assistants present, but ""suddenly all the assistants vanished,"" Campbell claimed. She said they talked for several minutes before Weinstein left the room, and that she thought he'd gone to the restroom.

""I could hear him moving around and suddenly the sound of bath taps running. 'What do you say we both jump in the bath?' he hollered,"" she wrote.

Weinstein also allegedly told her, “Come on, it’ll be fun. We can drink champagne. You can soap me — whaddaya say?”

Campbell claimed to tell the producer loudly, “If you come back into this room with no clothes on I’m going to f****** lose my temper.”

She says she got out using one door, after she found that two others were locked.

A Weinstein representative told the newspaper that the producer ""will not respond to allegations about private matters in a public forum.""

Monday, October 9

Louise Godbold alleged in an essay published online Monday that ""in the early ‘90s, I too was one of the young women he preyed upon."" Godbold is an executive director for a Los Angeles nonprofit, Variety reports.

""The details of what I have learned was not unique to me are out there now – the office tour that became an occasion to trap me in an empty meeting room, the begging for a massage, his hands on my shoulders as I attempted to beat a retreat… all while not wanting to alienate the most powerful man in Hollywood,"" she wrote.

Godbold recalled ""the girlfriend who had introduced me to Harvey and was angry with me after he called her wanting to make sure I wasn’t going to make a complaint about his behavior.""

Tuesday, October 10

Ronan Farrow published a piece in The New Yorker which reported that 13 women alleged they were sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein.

Former aspiring actress Lucia Evans went on the record to allege Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex during a meeting.

""I tried to get away, but maybe I didn’t try hard enough,"" she told The New Yorker. ""I didn’t want to kick him or fight him.""

Actress-director Asia Argento, the daughter of famed horror filmmaker Dario Argento, claimed that when she was 21 in 1997, she was invited to what she believed was a Miramax party, but ended up in a hotel room with just Weinstein in it, the report said.

Weinstein left the room, but came back in a bathrobe and asked her for a massage, the report claimed. She ""reluctantly"" said she would before Weinstein went on to forcibly perform oral sex, the report alleged.

Argento claimed that Weinstein would contact her after the alleged assault, and that she would later have consensual relations with the movie mogul.

“I felt I had to,” Argento explained to The New Yorker regarding the initial such time. “Because I had the movie coming out and I didn’t want to anger him.”

An unnamed woman claimed to The New Yorker that Weinstein brought her to a hotel room before he changed into a bathrobe and “forced himself” on her. She reportedly thought about going to authorities, but decided not to.

She later maintained professional relations with the producer, the report said. “I was in a vulnerable position and I needed my job,” she explained.

Actress Mira Sorvino described an alleged 1995 hotel room incident with Weinstein to the publication.

""He started massaging my shoulders, which made me very uncomfortable, and then tried to get more physical, sort of chasing me around,"" Sorvino said. She reportedly left after saying it went against her faith to date married men.

An unnamed actress locked herself in a bathroom at a hotel so as to avoid the producer, she told The New Yorker. The actress also reportedly alleged that Weinstein masturbated in front of her.

The article also cited a 2015 audio recording made by the New York Police Department wherein Weinstein admits to groping Battilana Gutierrez, mentioned earlier in the Times piece.

The New Yorker article also described a meeting at a Beverly Hills hotel between Weinstein and Weinstein Company temp Emily Nestor, who was also mentioned in the Times report. Nestor, it said, refused his offer to be placed in his London office and be his girlfriend, and she also refused to hold his hand.

Weinstein, she alleged, told her, ""Oh, the girls always say ‘no.’ You know, ‘No, no.’ And then they have a beer or two and then they’re throwing themselves at me.""

The producer, she claimed, also allegedly said ""that he’d never had to do anything like Bill Cosby.""

""Nestor had a conversation with company officials about the matter but didn’t pursue it further: the officials said that Weinstein would be informed of anything she told them, a practice not uncommon in smaller businesses,"" Farrow wrote.

The report also described how French actress Emma de Caunes had a lunch meeting with Weinstein at a Paris hotel, and that he mentioned he had a movie adaptation of a book in the works.

Weinstein, according to the report, allegedly asked her to go with him to his room to get the book, and de Caunes answered her phone while Weinstein went into the bathroom. de Caunes recalled Weinstein later allegedly emerging from the bathroom nude with an erection.

The producer, she claims, told her to lie on the bed. de Caunes ultimately fled the room.

Actress Rosanna Arquette and the producer were to have a dinner meeting during which she'd get a script at a hotel in Beverly Hills, and Arquette was told to go to his room, The New Yorker report said. Weinstein allegedly was wearing a bathrobe when he opened the door and claimed to need a massage.

Arquette, according to the report, said that she could give him a masseuse recommendation. During the encounter, she alleges that Weinstein tried to lead her hand to his erect penis. She turned him down.

Both Arquette and Sorvino allege that refusing Weinstein impacted their careers.

""There may have been other factors, but I definitely felt iced out and that my rejection of Harvey had something to do with it,"" Sorvino told The New Yorker.

The New Yorker article recounted an alleged incident between Weinstein and actress Jessica Barth at a Beverly Hills hotel. At his hotel room, the report described how Weinstein allegedly ""alternated between offering to cast her in a film and demanding a naked massage in bed.""

Barth refused to give him a massage and while she was leaving Weinstein offered a meeting with a female executive, according to the article.

“Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein,"" Weinstein spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister told The New Yorker. ""Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. Mr. Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual. Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path. Mr. Weinstein is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance.”

Actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie were among the women in a follow-up New York Times piece published Tuesday who allege Weinstein harassed them. Arquette also spoke to the newspaper.

Paltrow described Weinstein's attempt to lure her, as a then-22-year-old aspiring actress, into giving him a massage in a hotel room. The incident prompted her then-boyfriend Brad Pitt to confront Weinstein at a film premiere. The producer, according to the report, allegedly ordered Paltrow not to tell people about what happened.

Jolie also turned down Weinstein, who allegedly hit on her in a hotel room in the 1990s, the report said.

""I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did,” Jolie, now 42, told the Times in email. “This behavior towards women in any field, any country is unacceptable.”

The Times report also recounted a meeting between Tomi-Ann Roberts and Weinstein. Weinstein was naked in a bathrobe when she showed up, Roberts alleges. He also allegedly said her audition would be better if she got naked. She turned him down and left, according to the Times report.

Actress Katherine Kendall told the Times that she was at Weinstein's apartment when he came back from the bathroom in a bathrobe and requested a massage. Weinstein exited the room and came back naked after she said no, Kendall alleged.

Kendall claims that Weinstein chased her around the room and that he also asked her to show him her breasts, which she declined.

While in a hotel suite with Weinstein in 1996, French actress Judith Godrèche turned down his alleged request for a massage, the Times reported. She claimed Weinstein later tried ""pressing against me and pulling off my sweater."" She left the room.

Actress Dawn Dunning claims that Weinstein offered her contracts for his next three movies as long as she would have three-way sex with him, according to the Times report. She took off.

“Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein,"" Hofmeister told the Times in a statement. ""Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. He will not be available for further comments, as he is taking the time to focus on his family, on getting counseling and rebuilding his life.”

A report published early Tuesday by The Guardian described how Weinstein allegedly wore just a robe during a hotel room meeting with British actress Romola Garai.

“Like every other woman in the industry, I’ve had an ‘audition’ with Harvey Weinstein, where I’d actually already had the audition but you had to be personally approved by him,” Garai told the publication. “So I had to go to his hotel room in the Savoy, and he answered the door in his bathrobe. I was only 18. I felt violated by it, it has stayed very clearly in my memory.”

“The point was that he could get a young woman to do that, that I didn’t have a choice, that it was humiliating for me and that he had the power,” the 35-year-old ""Atonement"" actress said.

Also Tuesday, former actress and screenwriter Louisette Geiss alleged that Weinstein appeared in an open bathrobe with no clothes on during a meeting at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. She claims that Weinstein asked several times that she watch him masturbate during the 2008 encounter.

Geiss made the allegations during a news conference with attorney Gloria Allred, who invited Weinstein to meet with his alleged victims in a mediation or arbitration process.

Geiss said in a statement that she is coming forward to help give voice to other alleged victims of sexual harassment. She said her experience with Weinstein led to her departure from the entertainment industry. She now works in real estate.

Actress Heather Graham said Weinstein implied she would have to sleep with him for a role in a Tuesday column for Variety.

She described a meeting with Weinstein in the early 2000s ""in which he mentioned that he had an agreement with his wife. He could sleep with whomever he wanted when he was out of town.""

""There was no explicit mention that to star in one of those films I had to sleep with him, but the subtext was there,"" she alleged.

Graham says she later skipped a meeting with Weinstein at a hotel because her actress friend who was supposed to come along said she was unable to attend.

""That was the end of that encounter — I was never hired for one of his films, and I didn’t speak up about my experience,"" she wrote. ""It wasn’t until Ashley Judd heroically shared her story a few days ago that I felt ashamed.""

Wednesday, October 11

Actress and supermodel Cara Delevingne took to Instagram to describe her encounters with Weinstein.

""When I first started to work as an actress, I was working on a film and I received a call from Harvey Weinstein asking if I had slept with any of the women I was seen out in the middle with,"" the statement said. The model said she didn't answer his questions and ""hurried off the phone.""

She also described a later incident where Weinstein asked her to come his hotel room.

""I quickly declined and asked his assistant if my car was outside,"" the statement said. ""She said it wasn't and wouldn't be for a bit and I should go to his room.""

A post shared by Cara Delevingne (@caradelevingne) on Oct 11, 2017 at 10:39am PDT

The model said she felt ""powerless"" and that in the room, there was a second woman.

""He asked us to kiss and she began some sort of advances upon his direction,"" she alleged. ""I swiftly got up and asked him if he knew that I could sing. And I began to sing....i thought it would make the situation better....more professional....like an audition....i was so nervous. After singing I said again that I had to leave. He walked me to the door and stood in front of it and tried to kiss me on the lips. I stopped him and managed to get out of the room.""

Actress Léa Seydoux told The Guardian that at the beginning of her career, during a conversation with Weinstein, he jumped toward her and attempted to kiss her.

“We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me,” Seydoux said. “I had to defend myself. He’s big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him.""

The ""Spectre"" actress added: “He tried more than once,” and described Weinstein as “very domineering” and “losing control.” Seydoux told the news outlet that she ""pushed him physically. I think he respected me because I resisted him.”

Actress Sarah Ann Masse described to Variety how Weinstein allegedly was in just his undergarments during her 2008 interview for a nanny position at his house in Connecticut.

“Harvey Weinstein opened the door in his boxer shorts and an undershirt. My first thought was, ‘Oh, this is weird. Maybe he forgot this interview is happening. Maybe he thought I was the mailman. I’m sure he’ll be embarrassed and excuse himself and get changed.’ But he didn’t,” she told the publication.

She claims he asked in the job interview, “You would never flirt with my friends or anyone to get ahead?” and that she told him no.

Masse claimed at the end he ""gave me this really tight, close hug that lasted for quite a long period of time. He was still in his underwear. Then he told me he loved me. I left right after that.""

Thursday, October 12

Actress Kate Beckinsale said in an Instagram post that when she was 17 years old, she was invited to meet Weinstein at a hotel.

She says she thought the meeting would happen in a conference room, but she was directed to Weinstein's room instead.

A post shared by Kate Beckinsale (@katebeckinsale) on Oct 12, 2017 at 6:02am PDT

“He opened the door in his bathrobe. I was incredibly naive and young and it did not cross my mind that this older, unattractive man would expect me to have any sexual interest in him,"" she alleged. ""After declining alcohol and announcing that I had school in the morning I left, uneasy but unscathed.”

Weinstein, she claims, asked her a few years down the line ""if he had tried anything with me in that first meeting.""

The actress said she ""realized he couldn't remember if he had assaulted me or not.""

""I said no to him professionally many times over the years-some of which ended up with him screaming at me calling me a c*** and making threats, some of which made him laughingly tell people oh ""Kate lives to say no to me,"" she wrote.

British actress Claire Forlani also posted a statement on Twitter in which she claimed that she “escaped 5 times.”

She said there had been two night meetings at a hotel with Weinstein “and all I remember was I ducked , dived and ultimately got out of there without getting slobbered over, well just a bit. Yes massage was suggested.”

Forlani alleged there were three dinners and she recalled him listing “all the actresses who had slept with him and what he had done for them.”

Earlier in her statement, Forlani revealed Ronan Farrow had contacted her, but that she didn’t take part in The New Yorker expose.

“Today I sit here feeling some shame,” she confided.

French actress Florence Darel alleged to Le Parisien in a French-language interview that Weinstein hit on her in a hotel room in 1995 -- with his wife in the next room.

“He started to tell me that he found me very attractive and wanted to have relations with me,” Darel, now 49, said. “I told him I was very in love with my companion. He replied that didn’t bother him at all and offered to have me be his mistress a few days a year. That way we could continue to work together. Basically, it was ‘If you want to continue in America, you have to go through me.’”

Darel says she left.

English actor Sophie Dix, who was 22 in the 1990s when she met Weinstein, said her possible career path was ""massively cut down"" after an experience with the producer, according to The Guardian.

Dix said she found herself in a hotel room with Weinstein, and ""all the alarm bells starting ringing."" She was in bed with Weinstein ""tugging at her clothes,"" before she hid in the bathroom. Once she opened the door, she saw him ""standing there masturbating.""

It was then she decided not to pursue acting. ""I decided if this is what being an actress is like, I don't want it,"" Dix said.

In a Variety article published Thursday, actress Tara Subkoff said Weinstein grabbed her to sit on his lap during an afterparty, and she felt Weinstein's erection.

After Subkoff got up from Weinstein's lap, she said he made requests that prompted Subkoff to laugh in Weinstein's face and leave the party.

Also Thursday, actress Rose McGowan tweeted that ""HW raped me.""

Friday, October 13

Actress and former model Angie Everhart claimed Weinstein masturbated in front of her on a yacht more than 10 years ago, according to an interview she did with TMZ.

The incident allegedly occurred after Everhart had arrived in France for the Cannes Film Festival, she said. Feeling jetlagged, she reportedly fell asleep in one of the cabins. She later woke up to the sight of Weinstein in her room, blocking the door and masturbating, she said.

Despite him telling her not to, Everhart said she ""told everyone"" about what happened, including producers and other actors. But everyone reportedly shrugged off the situation saying, ""oh that's just Harvey.""

She said everybody knew what he was doing to women but no one said anything about it until the Times article was published on Oct. 5.

Actress Minka Kelly also described an alleged encounter with Weinstein in a Friday Instagram post.

She claimed that one day after meeting him at a party, ""my agent said he wanted to see me for a general meeting. The location was set for his hotel room. I wasn’t comfortable with going to his room & said so. The following day, we sat down with an assistant in the hotel restaurant.""

""He bulls--- me for 5 minutes re: movies he could put me in, then asked the assistant to excuse us,"" she continued. ""As she walked away, he said, 'I know you were feeling what I was feeling when we met the other night' and then regaled me with offers of a lavish life filled with trips around the world on private planes etc. IF I would be his girlfriend. Or, 'We could just keep this professional.' All I knew was not to offend this very powerful man and to get out of the situation as quickly as possible.""

Kelly claimed that when she told Weinstein she preferred to keep their relationship professional, he said that he trusted she wouldn't tell others about the conversation.

Model Trish Goff met Weinstein at a 2003 party, and they later had a lunch meeting, The New York Times reported.

""When I arrived, I discovered we were seated in a private room,” she told the newspaper of their meeting. “I asked him why he had wanted to have lunch, and he said ‘You were looking at me’ — as if to imply I was interested. I said, ‘Yes, I was looking at you because you are Harvey Weinstein, and I had never seen you before.’”

""Then he started asking me if I had a boyfriend, and if we had an open relationship,"" she continued. ""I said I wasn’t interested in an open relationship, but he was relentless, and I kept trying to shut that down and move on. Then he started putting his hands on my legs, and I said, ‘Can you stop doing that?’ When we finally stood up to go, he really started groping me, grabbing my breasts, grabbing my face and trying to kiss me. I kept saying, ‘Please stop, please stop,’ but he didn’t until I managed to get back into the public space.""

In a HuffPost article, actress Melissa Sagemiller claimed that in 2000, she was invited to Weinstein's hotel room ostensibly to discuss a movie script. Weinstein allegedly wore a robe and offered drinks, requested a massage, and said he needed a shower, according to her account.

Sagemiller claimed that as she left, Weinstein blocked the door and insisted she kiss him, listing other actresses he said kissed him.

""He literally would not let me leave,"" she told the outlet. ""I said fine and kissed him on the lips. He sort of held my head and made me kiss him, and then he’s like, 'OK, you can go now. That’s all I wanted. Just do what I say and you can get your way.'""

Canadian actress Erika Rosenbaum described several encounters where Weinstein allegedly harassed her in an CBC/Radio-Canada interview published online Friday.

She alleged that in one such incident, she was ushered into a meeting in Weinstein’s hotel during the Toronto International Film Festival. Weinstein, she claimed, exited the bathroom wearing only a dress shirt and no pants -- and soon after grabbed her by the neck and asked her to watch in a mirror as he began to masturbate.

“I think I was just too shocked to move or say anything …” Rosenbaum recalled.

Lisa Rose spoke about allegedly being harassed by Weinstein while she was an assistant in Miramax's London office in a BBC article published Friday.

Rose was sent to work for a day at The Savoy hotel, she told the outlet. She claimed that while alone in a suite with Weinstein, he requested a back rub and a massage, saying others complied. She left immediately.

An op-ed piece written by Canadian actress Mia Kirsher published in the Globe and Mail touched on a hotel room incident “where he attempted to treat me like chattel that could be purchased with the promise of work in exchange for being his disposable orifice.”

She said she wouldn’t give him “the privilege of more ink.”

“There are broader and more urgent issues to address,” she went on. “And if we don't address them now, I fear that when the headlines about Harvey Weinstein fade, what will remain is a disease in my own industry.”

Saturday, October 14

French actress Eva Green has spoken out about an alleged business meeting with Weinstein, Variety reported Saturday.

""I met him for a business meeting in Paris where he behaved inappropriately and I had to push him off,"" Green said in a statement to the outlet. ""I got away without it going further, but the experience left me shocked and disgusted.""

A former Miramax employee alleged that Weinstein raped her in the basement of his London office in 1992, the Mail on Sunday reported.

""He grabbed me and he was so big and powerful,"" the woman in her 50s recalled to the paper. ""He just ripped my clothes away and pushed me, threw me down. Then… I kept shouting, 'No! Stop!' and tried to push him off. But he forced himself on me.""

The woman was considering making a complaint to authorities, the Mail on Sunday reported.

Weinstein's spokesman told the paper that the mogul ""obviously can't speak to anonymous allegations, but he unequivocally denies allegations of non-consensual sex.""

Australian actress Natalie Mendoza wrote about a supposed meeting with Weinstein on Facebook in several posts, the Herald Sun reported.

“I might have told Mr W mid-script ‘meeting’ after he sent his assistant out that I'd punch him if he didn’t take his hands off me,” she was quoted as writing, per the Hollywood Reporter. “Shook all the way home but high-fived myself for knowing my self worth in my early 20s.”

A report published by the Washington Post covered how Weinstein allegedly tried to kiss a young woman working on the crew of the movie “Playing for Keeps” in a hotel room and tried to perform oral sex on her. The woman reportedly managed to get Weinstein to cease and declined to file a police report.

Actress-director Lina Esco spoke about her alleged experience with Weinstein to the newspaper. Weinstein, the Post report said, allegedly repeatedly pushed her for a kiss during a dinner.

Actress and comedian Chelsea Skidmore told the Post that during a meeting with Weinstein, two assistants left, before the mogul told her they’d go upstairs. Skidmore turned down Weinstein’s alleged request for a massage in his room, according to the newspaper. The producer allegedly masturbated in front of Skidmore.

There were allegedly three additional incidents where Weinstein exposed himself to Skidmore or attempted to make her be physical with women, the Post reported.

British actress Alice Evans alleged in an essay published in The Telegraph that Weinstein came up to her with a drink at a hotel bar in 2002 during the Cannes Film Festival. They allegedly spoke about her now-husband Ioan Gruffudd’s recent screen test, with Weinstein calling the actor “a talented guy.”

During the conversation, Weinstein tried to get her to join him a bathroom, she alleged. Evans claimed that she gave him different excuses.

“Let’s hope it all works out for your boyfriend,” she claims Weinstein told her during the incident.

""The next day Ioan still hasn’t heard anything about the audition,"" Evans wrote. She said that at lunch, Gruffudd went to the restroom, and that she told a former member of Gruffudd’s management team about what happened with Weinstein.

“I was worried you might say that,” she claims the man told her. “They called this morning. It’s not going Ioan’s way.”

“I was never again considered for a Weinstein film, and neither was Ioan,” Evans wrote. “I’ll never know if my refusal to be sexually available for Mr Weinstein at the moment he fancied his little fix had me blacklisted, or whether I’m inflating my own importance in a much bigger picture.”

Sunday, October 15

British police were investigating five allegations of sexual assault made by three women against Weinstein, The Guardian reported.

In the new British allegations, London's Metropolitan Police force said Sunday that a woman reported being assaulted in London in 2010, 2011 and 2015. The force said officers from its Child Abuse and Sexual Offenses Command are investigating.

The woman's name has not been made public. The force also did not name Weinstein, in keeping with its policy of not identifying suspects who have not been charged.

But it said the allegations involve a man against whom another accusation was made Wednesday. That alleged assault -- reported to have taken place in west London during the late 1980s -- also is being investigated.

British actress Lysette Anthony said she reported to police on Wednesday that Weinstein raped her in her west London home in the late 1980s.

Anthony, 54, who appears on the British soap opera ""Hollyoaks,"" told the Sunday Times newspaper that Weinstein raped her in the late 1980s after showing up at her London home. She said she was left feeling ""disgusted and embarrassed"" after the attack.

""It was pathetic, revolting,"" she was quoted as saying in a Thursday interview. ""I remember lying in the bath later and crying.""

On Sunday, another woman, not named by police, came forward with claims that Weinstein sexually assaulted her in 1992 in London.

Separately, Paula Wachowiak alleged Weinstein asked her for a massage in 1980 -- when she was a 24-year-old production assistant intern who had been asked by an auditor to drop off a folder containing checks at Weinstein's room, the Buffalo News reports.

Wachowiak, 62, claims that Weinstein was wearing a hand towel in his room, and that when he grabbed the folder, he let it drop.

""He sat on the bed with the folder over his groin and pointed to checks and asked me why we were paying for this or that,"" she told the newspaper.

He later requested a massage, but Wachowiak told him it wasn't part of her duties, according to her account.

Juls Bindi claims Weinstein masturbated in front of her during a 2010 massage appointment in a hotel room, ABC News reported in a story published Sunday. Bindi was 29 when the incident allegedly occurred.

“I’m like, ‘Please, this is not appropriate, I do not feel comfortable. No. Do not do this in front of me. This is not OK. This is not professional behavior,’” Bindi told “20/20.” “He continued to do it, and I tried to get by him. He grabbed me, started groping on my chest, and he kept going, and I pushed him away.”

Paula Williams claims that after meeting at a 1990 party, the Hollywood heavyweight invited the 20-year-old model to a dinner party, ABC News reports.

Williams alleged to “20/20” that when she showed up at a home, only Weinstein was there.

“He immediately starts massaging my neck as I walk in so I know right away that this … is going to be uncomfortable,” she claimed. Williams took off after Weinstein allegedly exposed himself, according to her account.

Monday, October 16

""Dumb and Dumber"" actress Lauren Holly told the New York Daily News that in a Los Angeles hotel room in the late 1990s, Weinstein got naked, used the toilet in front of her, and asked for a massage.

“He dropped his robe, went into the bathroom in front of me and began to use the toilet. All the time talking. Now, at this point my head’s exploding,” Holly said.

The actress said she didn't know what to do -- Weinstein began getting angry when she wouldn't give in, and Holly said she ""began to get really afraid.""

Holly said she ran from the room, and went straight to a dinner party where people asked if Weinstein touched or raped her. When she described what happened, those at the dinner party allegedly said, ""Then you need to keep your mouth shut, because it's Harvey Weinstein.""

And, economic consequences aside, addiction has deep emotional consequences and can destroy what is an otherwise healthy family business.
How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business?
Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does.
It’s a genuine investment that will pay dividends – for your family business, yes, but more importantly, for your family’s sense of belonging.","Just last month, the Department of Health and Human Services announced its intention to dedicate an extra $144 million towards fighting the opioid crisis – a decision which, while helpful, is long overdue. Substance abuse, and opioid abuse in particular, continues to wreak havoc on this country. Ninety-one Americans die each day from opioid abuse, and drug offenders make up the large part of our nation’s incarcerated population.

It’s a health care problem, it’s a criminal justice problem – but it’s also a family problem, and it’s one that is especially challenging for families who run a family business. I’ve spent all of my life and much of my career observing and advising family businesses, and time and time again I’ve seen that substance abuse plays a large role in the sad fact that 70 percent of family-owned businesses don’t make it past one generation. The collateral damage when a family business falls apart extends to the employees, the stockholders, the lenders, the suppliers, the customers, and even the tax base and economic health of the entire community.

And, economic consequences aside, addiction has deep emotional consequences and can destroy what is an otherwise healthy family business. A longtime friend of mine recently confided in me his sorrow over his two sons, both of whom had been doing wonderfully in college – until they discovered alcohol and quickly become addicted.

My friend tried putting his sons in treatment programs, but it didn’t work. He tried tough love, but his kids wound up hating him. His business prospered, but today his children won’t speak to him. He can’t hand his business on to them, his hoped-for legacy is in tatters, and much of what gave his life meaning has vaporized. What good, he asks himself, does it do to succeed financially and fail as a family?

I was deeply saddened by my friend’s story, but even more saddened to learn that he’s not alone.

One study found that more than half of family businesses had or were struggling with an addiction issue within the family. This may sound shocking, but it stacks up with other statistics: One in ten Americans have struggled with some kind of drug abuse and one in eight with alcohol abuse. Many American families don’t know whether their life’s work will live beyond them into the next generation or whether addiction and substance abuse will have the final say.

So – what to do? How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business? How to avoid heartbreaking situations like the one my friend found himself in?

There’s no one single answer, and even among healthy families, things will look different. But I’ve generally found that among the families that last, three core values were emphasized:

Be clear. Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does. Parents have far more influence than they know. According to Joe Califano, former Secretary of Health Education and Welfare under President Carter and the founder of the Center on Addiction and Substance (CASA), “Parent power is the greatest weapon we have to curb substance abuse.”

He encourages parents to emphasize that substance abuse is not simply illegal but seriously dangerous, and to take the same attitude towards it that they do towards asbestos. Most parents would be in an uproar if they found out their child’s school has asbestos, but are willing to let substance abuse in school slide. And kids respond to this kind of clear condemnation: Those who know their parents would be “very upset” are more likely to abstain from drugs and alcohol than those who know their parents would only be “a little” or “not upset at all.”

Be together. Oftentimes, risky behaviors result from unloving homes. When children do not feel loved and valued by their parents, they are far more likely to look for love elsewhere – and oftentimes, that means succumbing to peer pressure to win admiration and acceptance.

Simply spending time together – without screens and without distractions – will increase family bonding and a child’s sense of worth and belonging. CASA found that teens who eat dinner with their parents fewer than three nights each week are more susceptible to smoking, drinking and drug abuse than those who eat with their parents five nights or more each week.

Be fun. Teach kids early on that you can have fun and be creative without substances. If they see you getting creative and enjoying yourself without alcohol and drugs, they’re less likely to turn to those things as a way to have fun.

Whatever you do, whether it be sports, board games, arts and crafts, or music, it’s important to intentionally set aside time to do it.

These things are important for all families that want to develop a strong family culture – but they are especially important for parents who themselves come from families that struggle with substance abuse. Creating a stable family is particularly hard when you have genetics and family patterns working against you – but not impossible.

Dr. Falk Lohoff, a scholar at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, argues that “While genetic factors can increase the risk of becoming addicted, they are not deterministic. There are also protective factors.” And one of the biggest protective factors is simple delay. CASA found that with each year of delay in substance use, the likelihood of addiction drops.

By putting the hard work in now of establishing clear values, spending quality time together and having creative, clean fun, you can create the kind of culture where your children will not only be able to perpetuate the family business, but will actually want to work for you and with you. It’s a genuine investment that will pay dividends – for your family business, yes, but more importantly, for your family’s sense of belonging. ​",Mitzi Perdue: Substance abuse is sinking America's family businesses.

Poultry industry workers suffered a higher rate of serious injuries than much of the construction industry, auto industry, steel industry, saw mills, and other high-risk industries.
Workers were sent to the hospital for fractured hips from slippery floors and burns from chemical leaks,” the report reads.
”The workers who put food on our table should not have to sacrifice their health for a paycheck.”","The National Chicken Council (NCC) has filed a petition to rescind an Obama-era policy that allowed only 140 chickens to be slaughtered per minute — a change the Obama administration denied after learning it would endanger workers and increase cross-contamination, according to NBC News.

Yet, the NCC has requested the Food and Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) to implement a waiver that would permit establishments to slaughter chickens “at any speed,” as long as they are enrolled in the New Poultry Inspection System and the Salmonella Initiative Program. A repeal of the 140-bird cap would increase the industry’s ability to compete in the global marketplace.

“Moreover, this deregulatory action would advance the President’s objective to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens,” the petition reads.“There is no indication that higher line speeds would result in increased food safety or worker risk.”

But worker safety advocates are worried that increasing production speeds will have a negative effect on line workers, many of whom are immigrants and refugees already working under poor conditions, NBC News reports.

A 2017 report by OSHA shows that in 29 states, poultry processing is already among the most dangerous industries even under the current policy. Out of ten companies, chicken giant Tyson Foods has the fourth-highest number of reported severe injuries or amputations, and Pilgrim’s Pride — another meat and poultry company — holds the sixth-highest spot. Poultry industry workers suffered a higher rate of serious injuries than much of the construction industry, auto industry, steel industry, saw mills, and other high-risk industries.

“Workers at Tyson Foods and Pilgrim’s Pride suffered amputations of fingers and hands when the companies failed to provide machine safety guards, adequate training, or mandatory protective equipment. Workers were sent to the hospital for fractured hips from slippery floors and burns from chemical leaks,” the report reads. ”The workers who put food on our table should not have to sacrifice their health for a paycheck.”",Chicken council wants 140-bird-per-minute Obama-era production cap removed,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2017/10/16/chicken-council-wants-140-bird-per-minute-obama-era-production-cap-removed.html

Have you ever made your husband a sandwich? If so, you should be ashamed of yourself. Don't you realize such behavior sets women back decades?

That's the message of a new article in The Daily Telegraph, entitled ""When making a sandwich is a crime against feminism,"" about an Australian woman named Maddie who asked a Facebook group of 26,186 mothers whether anyone had some yummy alternatives for her husband's lunches, which she said she makes for him every day.

Now that's what anyone I know would call a nice wife.

But that's not what Maddie was called on Facebook. Instead, she was told she was nothing but a “slave” and a “1950s housewife."" She was also “weird,” as no woman in her right mind would do something so demeaning as to make her husband lunch.

The feminist worldview is antithetical to love because its focus is solely on women: their needs, their wants, their desires, and their rights. Love can’t possibly be sustained with an attitude like that.

Here's just a sampling of some of the responses Maddie got:

“Your husband is a grown up, and you’re not his mother!”

“My husband can make his own damn lunch.”

""I make my husband the same thing he makes me. Nothing!!”

“Stuff that, hubby is a grown man. I already do his laundry and keep his children alive.”

“Our advice is to stop making his lunches.”

“My role is childcare during working hours and that’s it.”

“He’s lucky if I decide to make dinner some nights.""

That, my friends, is what feminists brought to America in the 1970s.

And it stuck.

The idea that a wife would—or God forbid, should—do anything for her husband with no expectation for anything in return—just to be nice, because, as Maddie put it, she ""loves her man"" and they ""can't afford to eat out""— makes her weak.

Honestly, is it really any wonder why the relationship between the sexes is such a mess today? Or why, as Bloomberg published just last week, married Americans are unhappier than ever? In my opinion, it is largely because there are so many women in America today who, either knowingly or unknowingly, have a feminist mind.

Feminists teach women, above all else, to stand up for themselves against the evil men of the world. Even harmless husbands fall into the category of 'evil men' since they supposedly long to lord over their wives. Thus, the knee-jerk reaction to the suggestion that a wife might serve her husband in some way—make him a drink or a meal—is to become defensive. Yet, if we turn the scenario around, if a husband were to serve his wife in any way, well, that's acceptable.

The feminist worldview is antithetical to love because its focus is solely on women: their needs, their wants, their desires, and their rights. Love can’t possibly be sustained with an attitude like that.

Of course, there are men who support feminists. My friend Helen Smith, Ph.D., refers to these type of men as ""Uncle Tims"" in her book ""Men on Strike."" An Uncle Tim is a male sellout who kowtows to feminists because he's (a) just as left-wing as they are and thus agrees with the feminist worldview, or (b) too weak to stand up for himself and knows that if he says anything he's not suppose to, he won't get sex.

Most Uncle Tims who fall under category A live on the East and West coasts. Those who fall under category B can live anywhere, but the one area of the country they're scarce is in the South and the Midwest. Because that's where the real men live.

And real men don't marry feminists.

The men who do have been feminized and are proud of not being ""the man of the house."" They see that as backwards and take pride in their progressive, non manly ways. Of course, don't expect an Uncle Tim to kill the intruder in the house on his wife's behalf—he's given up the role of provider and protector. He and his wife are equals!

Unfortunately, the Uncle Tims are often the ones who lose in the end because all too often feminist wives regret their choice to make their marriages androgynous—and the men who give up their manhood, because they thought that's what women and society wanted—are left in the dust.

To improve the state of marriage in this country, what we need are fewer feminists and fewer Uncle Tims. We need real men who aren't afraid to stand up to feminist gobbledygook. A fantastic example is Chad Prather, aka Political Cowboy—who, not coincidentally, is from Texas. Check out his very funny (and very true) video on gender INequality!

Now there's a real man.

And I'd bet my life savings his wife isn't a feminist.",Are you weak if you make your man a sandwich? This is why real men don’t marry feminists,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/14/are-weak-if-make-your-man-sandwich-this-is-why-real-men-don-t-marry-feminists.html

During the same interview, the 79-year-old was asked if she had a ""sense of regret"" for her visit to North Vietnam in 1972.

The ""Grace and Frankie"" star said while she doesn't ""regret going to Vietnam,"" she does regret appearing at an anti-aircraft ceremony that made her appear to be ""siding with the enemy.""

""The thing that I regret is that on my last day there, I made the mistake of going to a ceremony at an anti-aircraft gun,"" she added. ""It wasn’t being used. There were no airplanes or anything like that. There was a ceremony. I was asked to sing and people were laughing and so forth and I was led, and I sat down.
