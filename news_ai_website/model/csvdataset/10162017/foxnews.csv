And, economic consequences aside, addiction has deep emotional consequences and can destroy what is an otherwise healthy family business.
How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business?
Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does.
It’s a genuine investment that will pay dividends – for your family business, yes, but more importantly, for your family’s sense of belonging.","Just last month, the Department of Health and Human Services announced its intention to dedicate an extra $144 million towards fighting the opioid crisis – a decision which, while helpful, is long overdue. Substance abuse, and opioid abuse in particular, continues to wreak havoc on this country. Ninety-one Americans die each day from opioid abuse, and drug offenders make up the large part of our nation’s incarcerated population.

It’s a health care problem, it’s a criminal justice problem – but it’s also a family problem, and it’s one that is especially challenging for families who run a family business. I’ve spent all of my life and much of my career observing and advising family businesses, and time and time again I’ve seen that substance abuse plays a large role in the sad fact that 70 percent of family-owned businesses don’t make it past one generation. The collateral damage when a family business falls apart extends to the employees, the stockholders, the lenders, the suppliers, the customers, and even the tax base and economic health of the entire community.

And, economic consequences aside, addiction has deep emotional consequences and can destroy what is an otherwise healthy family business. A longtime friend of mine recently confided in me his sorrow over his two sons, both of whom had been doing wonderfully in college – until they discovered alcohol and quickly become addicted.

My friend tried putting his sons in treatment programs, but it didn’t work. He tried tough love, but his kids wound up hating him. His business prospered, but today his children won’t speak to him. He can’t hand his business on to them, his hoped-for legacy is in tatters, and much of what gave his life meaning has vaporized. What good, he asks himself, does it do to succeed financially and fail as a family?

I was deeply saddened by my friend’s story, but even more saddened to learn that he’s not alone.

One study found that more than half of family businesses had or were struggling with an addiction issue within the family. This may sound shocking, but it stacks up with other statistics: One in ten Americans have struggled with some kind of drug abuse and one in eight with alcohol abuse. Many American families don’t know whether their life’s work will live beyond them into the next generation or whether addiction and substance abuse will have the final say.

So – what to do? How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business? How to avoid heartbreaking situations like the one my friend found himself in?

There’s no one single answer, and even among healthy families, things will look different. But I’ve generally found that among the families that last, three core values were emphasized:

Be clear. Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does. Parents have far more influence than they know. According to Joe Califano, former Secretary of Health Education and Welfare under President Carter and the founder of the Center on Addiction and Substance (CASA), “Parent power is the greatest weapon we have to curb substance abuse.”

He encourages parents to emphasize that substance abuse is not simply illegal but seriously dangerous, and to take the same attitude towards it that they do towards asbestos. Most parents would be in an uproar if they found out their child’s school has asbestos, but are willing to let substance abuse in school slide. And kids respond to this kind of clear condemnation: Those who know their parents would be “very upset” are more likely to abstain from drugs and alcohol than those who know their parents would only be “a little” or “not upset at all.”

Be together. Oftentimes, risky behaviors result from unloving homes. When children do not feel loved and valued by their parents, they are far more likely to look for love elsewhere – and oftentimes, that means succumbing to peer pressure to win admiration and acceptance.

Simply spending time together – without screens and without distractions – will increase family bonding and a child’s sense of worth and belonging. CASA found that teens who eat dinner with their parents fewer than three nights each week are more susceptible to smoking, drinking and drug abuse than those who eat with their parents five nights or more each week.

Be fun. Teach kids early on that you can have fun and be creative without substances. If they see you getting creative and enjoying yourself without alcohol and drugs, they’re less likely to turn to those things as a way to have fun.

Whatever you do, whether it be sports, board games, arts and crafts, or music, it’s important to intentionally set aside time to do it.

These things are important for all families that want to develop a strong family culture – but they are especially important for parents who themselves come from families that struggle with substance abuse. Creating a stable family is particularly hard when you have genetics and family patterns working against you – but not impossible.

Dr. Falk Lohoff, a scholar at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, argues that “While genetic factors can increase the risk of becoming addicted, they are not deterministic. There are also protective factors.” And one of the biggest protective factors is simple delay. CASA found that with each year of delay in substance use, the likelihood of addiction drops.

By putting the hard work in now of establishing clear values, spending quality time together and having creative, clean fun, you can create the kind of culture where your children will not only be able to perpetuate the family business, but will actually want to work for you and with you. It’s a genuine investment that will pay dividends – for your family business, yes, but more importantly, for your family’s sense of belonging. ​",Mitzi Perdue: Substance abuse is sinking America's family businesses.

At the annual Association of the United States Army (AUSA) exhibition, US Army Soldiers and their families get the chance to explore innovation from around the world created for future combat.

Many vehicles from giant tanks through to tiny rolling surveillance robots were on display this year.

AUSA 2017 IN PICTURES

Here are four of the most popular draws throughout the week.

JLTV – Advanced armor plus laser

As far as draws go, it is hard to beat a vehicle responsible for keeping soldiers safe – and one that now has a laser weapon.

Oshkosh is celebrating its 100th birthday this year and it went big on the AUSA floors. The company featured not just one of their Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV), but three – and three mounted with a serious amount of firepower that no enemy would ever want to face.

One JLTV was equipped with a Boeing Compact Laser Weapon System (CLWS) and a Kongsberg Protector LW 30 Remote Weapon System with a M230LF cannon.

Another JLTV featured the Boeing Maneuver Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) Launcher including a M3P .50 cal machine gun and a M299 launcher with four Longbow Hellfire missiles.

JLTV General Purpose equipped with Rafael Samson RWS Dual Stabilized Remote Weapon Systems with M230 LF, and the Trophy Light Active Protection System.

One of the popular features from a soldier’s point of view is that no matter the terrain, the ride is surprisingly smooth, thanks to OshKosh’s TAK-4i suspension system. The JLTV can tackle extreme terrain leveraging design like the 20 inches of wheel travel.

Families can take comfort in the advances for protection like the MRAP-level underbelly to protect against improvised explosive devicesand the vehicle wide armoring that provides enhanced protection against blasts and ballistic threats.

The Core-1080 Crew Protection System provides a very comprehensive advanced approach to crew protection. Features like the capsule design, energy absorbing floor, seats and even floor mats all enhance protection and help to keep American soldiers safe.

SilentHawk Motorcycle

Tucked away in the sprawling, massive AUSA floors was the very impressive SilentHawk - a hybrid-electric, two-wheel drive all-terrain motorcycle. Not only can it handle very tough terrain, it can do so while running nearly silently.

The quiet operation could provide a range of advantages to the Army like the element of surprise and avoiding detection. And a bike that can handle challenging off-road effortlessly gives teams advantages as well. For example, teams would have the option to travel unexpected routes to targets.

At 350 pounds, the bike is lightweight but it can reach speeds of 80 mph and run for up to 170 miles without refueling.

It has a two-mode hybrid propulsion system. The battery-only mode provides the ultra-quiet operation. SilentHawk can travel two hours in this quiet mode on a single charge.

The multi-fuel mode can be used when long-range is needed. The bike is compatible with gasoline, JP-5, JP-8, Jet-A1, propane and AVGAS so there are lots of fuel options to harvest along the way during a mission.

There’s also an interactive graphical interface to display mission data and system status and integrated mount and power for an Android Tactical Assault Kit (ATAK).

SilentHawk is currently in development with Alta Motors and Logos Technologies.

PODCAST: LEARN TO DRIVE YOUR ATV LIKE SPECIAL FORCES

MRZR-X

The intense competition to win a SMET contract served as a backdrop and the subject of much conversation at AUSA. Nine companies have submitted ten robots for selection as an Army SMET – a robot that would serve alongside soldiers in Brigade Combat Teams.

The wildly popular Polaris Defense ATVs always draw crowds and this year there was also much curiosity surrounding the MRZR-X. This is the Polaris submission for SMET and unsurprisingly Soldiers and their families were fascinated by what a “thinking” MRZR ATV would be like.

Polaris kept the MRZR-X under wraps, but featured MRZRs that provide hints as to what a smart MRZR could bring to combat. We can expect the “brains” laid out in the Army requirements combined with the MRZR’s assets.

MRZRs can handle heavy off-roading in tough terrain. They have on-demand, advanced all-wheel drive with the already in-built smarts to automatically engage all four wheels and revert to two-wheels

The vehicles can reach speeds of about 60 miles per hour and deliver maximum agility. They are air transportable and quickly adaptable for different mission requirements.

The military regularly takes advantage of features like instant black out jump and go keyless ignition.

ZH2 Chevy truck

Another crowd favorite this year was a Chevy truck unlike any other.

This new General Motors prototype, known as the Chevrolet Colorado ZH2, runs on hydrogen fuel cells. It's based on a Chevrolet Colorado truck – but with lots of modifications for military purposes.

US Army TARDEC – renowned for their tank work – and GM have teamed up to explore a new method of power for Army vehicles. The prototype has been designed to deliver near silent operation and very hard to detect heat signatures.

How else is it different to a typical Chevrolet Colorado? For starters, it is reinforced inside and out. To tackle the sort of extreme terrain the military faces, it has a specially modified suspension.

And it doesn’t take gasoline. This one uses a futuristic fuel source that has often been thought to be dangerous.

The star, who typically gives her opinion on the issues of the day and her life by way of her blog, changed things up a bit by publishing a lengthy op-ed in The New York Times about the Harvey Weinstein scandal, in which she condemned a culture that puts women in situations like the ones Weinstein’s accusers found themselves in. However, after including a portion about how she’s avoided Hollywood harassment for so long, many who read the piece are accusing her of blaming the victims for their own assaults.

While describing how she avoided such things by getting into the business at a young age and not being the typical Hollywood pretty-girl archetype, she mentioned how her choices in the business as an adult have helped her get by.

“I still make choices every day as a 41-year-old actress that I think of as self-protecting and wise. I have decided that my sexual self is best reserved for private situations with those I am most intimate with. I dress modestly. I don’t act flirtatiously with men as a policy,” she wrote.

Bialik immediately qualified the above statement by saying, “Women should be able to wear whatever they want. They should be able to flirt however they want with whomever they want. Why are we the ones who have to police our behavior?”

However, many still took her words as evidence that she was shaming the women who fell victim for the way they dressed or acted.

“I have never seen a kangaroo be so defensive – it definitely looked like he was puffing his chest muscles up.","This is the bizarre moment a gardener spotted a threatening ‘bodybuilder’ 100 [kilogram] kangaroo bathing its bulging biceps in an Australian creek.

Jackson Vincent snapped these astounding photographs of the huge roo tensing its rippling muscles in Boodjidup Creek in Margaret River, Western Australia.

The 27-year-old couldn’t believe his eyes when he clocked the mammoth two meter mammal standing in the water – and feared it could be preparing to attack beloved pet dog Dharma.

Jackson, from Freemantle, Perth, had been visiting his grandmother in Margaret River and saw the gargantuan animal on her property at about 11.30am.

He said: “I have been going to that creek since I was a little boy and there have always been kangaroos on the property.

“I was walking my dog and we saw this huge roo standing in the water. I have never seen a kangaroo standing in the water like that, we could just see his head at first.

“As I ran around him to take a picture he came closer and that was when I realised he was coming right at me and he was really big – one of the biggest I have ever seen.

“I am pretty confident around animals but the moment when he started to come out of the water my heart definitely jumped and I decided to take a few steps back.

“He looked to be at least two meters tall or taller and must have weighed at least 100 [kilograms].

“He had a really big body and was taller than me. There are a lot of roos at my grandma’s place but I have never seen one that muscular before – he was a big macho male.

“I decided to get Dharma out of there as we thought the kangaroo was going to lure her into the water to drown her.”

Jackson’s Facebook post with his images of the kangaroo’s muscular physique instantly went viral, racking up thousands of likes and shares.

Online commenters were quick to point out the animal’s impressive bodybuilder-like muscular shoulders, biceps and chest and threatening posture.

After dropping Kelpie Dharma back at his grandmother’s house Jackson returned to the creek to see the kangaroo was still there.

Jackson added: “His claws were really big – they were as long as my hand. That for me was even scarier than his muscles, they looked nasty.

“I have never seen a kangaroo be so defensive – it definitely looked like he was puffing his chest muscles up.

“I definitely wouldn’t like to take him on in a boxing match.”

The Associated Press previously reported that he's expected to plead guilty to charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy.
Bergdahl, who's from Hailey, Idaho, previously chose to have his case heard by a judge alone, rather than a jury.
Serious wounds to service members who searched for Bergdahl are expected to play a role in his sentencing.
Bergdahl has been assigned to desk duty at a Texas Army base while his case unfolds.","Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is set to plead guilty Monday to charges he endangered comrades by walking away from his post in Afghanistan in 2009 -- the court case wrapping up just three years after a stunning Rose Garden spectacle in which former President Barack Obama, flanked by Bergdahl's parents, triumphantly announced the soldier's release from captivity.

Bergdahl was released in May 2014 after a highly-criticized deal in which five Taliban terrorists were set free. At the time, Obama administration officials said Bergdahl had ""served with honor and distinction.""

The U.S. Army said Bergdahl asked to enter his plea before the military judge at Fort Bragg. The Associated Press previously reported that he's expected to plead guilty to charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy.

It's not clear if Bergdahl, 31, has a deal with prosecutors to limit his punishment, or if he's simply pleading guilty in hopes of leniency from the judge, Army Col. Jeffery R. Nance. The misbehavior charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, while the desertion charge is punishable by up to five years.

Bergdahl's lawyers are expected to reveal in court Monday whether there's a plea agreement in place to cap his punishment, or if he's pleading guilty without such a deal in what's known colloquially as a ""naked plea."" In either scenario, his punishment won't be known until after the judge holds the sentencing hearing that's expected to start on Oct. 23. Bergdahl, who's from Hailey, Idaho, previously chose to have his case heard by a judge alone, rather than a jury.

BERGDAHL DECLARED JIHAD IN CAPTIVITY, DOCUMENTS SHOW

A naked plea would be a risky move, Eric Carpenter, an assistant law professor at Florida International University and a former Army defense attorney and prosecutor, told Task & Purpose.

“It can backfire,” Carpenter said. “If he doesn’t have a deal, they could go in there and enter this naked plea and come out with a life sentence.”

Guilty pleas would bring the highly politicized saga closer to an end eight years after Bergdahl's disappearance in Afghanistan set off search missions by scores of his fellow service members. President Obama was criticized by Republicans for the 2014 Taliban prisoner swap that brought Bergdahl home, while President Donald Trump harshly criticized Bergdahl on the campaign trail.

Serious wounds to service members who searched for Bergdahl are expected to play a role in his sentencing. While guilty pleas would allow him to avoid a trial, he'd still face a sentencing hearing in late October. Bergdahl's five years of captivity by the Taliban and its allies also will likely play a role in what punishment he receives.

At one point during his captivity, Bergdahl converted to Islam, fraternized openly with his captors and declared himself a ""mujahid,"" or warrior for Islam, Fox News reported in 2014, citing secret documents prepared on the basis of a purported eyewitness account.

The reports indicate that Bergdahl's relations with his Haqqani captors morphed over time, from periods of hostility, where he was treated very much like a hostage, to periods where, as one source told Fox News, ""he became much more of an accepted fellow"" than is popularly understood. He even reportedly was allowed to carry a gun at times.

The documents show that Bergdahl at one point escaped his captors for five days and was kept, upon his re-capture, in a metal cage, like an animal. In addition, the reports detail discussions of prisoner swaps and other attempts at a negotiated resolution to the case that appear to have commenced as early as the fall of 2009.

SEAL, SOLDIER INJURIES IN BERGDAHL HUNT TO BE FOCUS OF HEARING

Legal scholars have said that several pretrial rulings against the defense have given prosecutors leverage to pursue stiff punishment against Bergdahl, The Associated Press reported. Perhaps most significant was the judge's decision in June to allow evidence of serious wounds to service members who searched for Bergdahl at the sentencing phase. The judge ruled that a Navy SEAL and an Army National Guard sergeant wouldn't have wound up in separate firefights that left them wounded if they hadn't been searching for Bergdahl.

The defense also was rebuffed in an effort to prove President Donald Trump had unfairly swayed the case with scathing criticism of Bergdahl, including suggestions of harsh punishment.

“We may as well go back to kangaroo courts and lynch mobs that got what they wanted,” Bergdahl said to a British filmmaker in 2016 when asked about trials, according to an interview obtained by ABC News. “The people who want to hang me, you’re never going to convince those people.”

Defense attorneys have acknowledged that Bergdahl walked off his base without authorization. Bergdahl himself told a general during a preliminary investigation that he left intending to cause alarm and draw attention to what he saw as problems with his unit. He was soon captured.

But the defense team has argued that Bergdahl can't be held responsible for a long chain of events that included many decisions by others on how to conduct the searches.

Bergdahl has been assigned to desk duty at a Texas Army base while his case unfolds.

The 8.5-ton Tiangong-1, or “Heavenly Palace”, satellite is now out of control and is doomed to plunge into the atmosphere, a top academic has warned.

“I expect it will come down a few months from now – late 2017 or early 2018,” Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard University astrophysicist, told The Guardian.

He previously warned that there was no way of telling exactly where the space station was going to plunge to Earth.

Sessions has been criticized by civil rights advocates for rolling back protections for transgender people.

""This is just one example of the attorney general's commitment to enforcing the laws enacted by Congress and to protecting the civil rights of all individuals,"" said Devin O'Malley, a spokesman for the Justice Department, in a statement to the New York Times.

The Iowa case involves a 16-year-old student in Burlington, Kedarie Johnson, who was shot to death in March 2016. Family and friends told local newspapers that he was gay and identified as both male and female. The New York Times said Sessions assigned Christopher Perras, a Justice Department lawyer, as a county prosecutor in the case.

Sessions since becoming attorney general has said transgender people are not protected under federal law from discrimination in the workplace. He reversed an Obama administration policy encouraging schools to allow transgender students to use a bathroom according to the gender they identify with.

But he has also condemned hate crimes, the Times noted. He publicly supported a case brought in the final weeks of the Obama administration in which a Mississippi man was sentenced to 49 years in prison for killing a transgender woman, the first U.S. federal prosecution of a hate crime based on gender identity.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts.
And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts.
Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts?
Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts.","Sitting at my usual corner table in the back of Buzzy’s 8-Ball Tavern and Pool Room, It occurred to me on Thursday night that there are any number of serious issues and current crisis that we could talk about for this week’s dispatch from the front lines.

But setting all those issues aside, let me tell you something that may have escaped your attention while you’ve been busy digging a backyard bomb shelter or getting up to speed on which starlets haven’t been groped by Weinstein. Apparently, and I did not see this coming, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) leadership has decided to open the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts to, wait for it… girls.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts. Boys whittled wood into sharp, pointy things and set fire to stuff, while girls generated an incredible amount of revenue selling delicious cookies. I’m particularly fond of Samoas.

My oldest boy Scooter is in the Cub Scouts, and I can vouch for the fact that he and his Den cohorts love to whittle. They can take a 400 pound oak log and turn it into a sharp, pointy twig in less time than it takes to whistle the theme to ""The Andy Griffith Show."" To be honest, they’re a pack of smelly, loud boys with a remarkable ability to recite the entire Scout oath while actually burping. I can see why girls would be clamoring to join.

In reality, most are not. And the Girl Scouts of America, which after taking into account global cookie sales, I believe is the country’s 7th largest corporation, have criticized what they see as a blatant effort to increase membership dues by the BSA. Membership numbers are down in general for youth groups across America so this may be less about gender and more about dough. Which reminds me, I also like the Thin Mints.

Back in August of this year, the president of the Girl Scouts sent a letter to the BSA president stating “…I formally request that your organization stay focused on serving the 90 per cent of American boys not currently participating in Boy Scouts… and not consider expanding to recruit girls.” That, my friends, is how you win a merit badge for subtle insult.

At this point, It would be fairly easy to morph this into a high brow column about gender fluidity and the need to be considerate over what pronouns someone uses when referring to their particular identification. Or perhaps turn to the subject of gender equality and how girls and boys are really no different and so no association or organization should exclude one or the other.

But I’m a guy, raising a houseful of little guys, and so my thinking isn’t particularly complicated. I’m guessing the BSA’s decision is partly driven by a need for additional revenue, as suggested by the Girl Scouts leadership, and likely in part out of concern that they might be sued by some overly sensitive soul who wants to prove a point that most folks really don’t care about.

I admit to being a bit old fashioned. Believing that there’s a place for a Boy Scouts organization and a Girl Scouts organization that focus on their respective genders doesn’t make me a misogynist or a sexist or anything else ending in “ist” or even an “ism.” I happen to believe that there’s value and benefit in girls having their own space and boys having their own space on occasion…as long as they offer equal space and opportunity.

I know that Scooter and his pals at their current stage of life would prefer to keep the “no girls allowed” sign on their clubhouse door. And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts. Give them a couple years and they’ll see things differently…they may even realize girls don’t find it attractive when you make farting noises. Although to be fair, I didn’t have that epiphany until my mid 20s.

Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts? I would have done that research but it seems like a lot of work and I’ve been busy whittling.

Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts. For their part, the BSA leadership claims the change was designed to provide more options for parents. According to BSA’s Chief Scout Executive, “We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children.”

So there you have it. Sally can now be a Cub Scout. And soon, Sally can join the Boy Scouts and eventually earn the coveted Eagle Scout award. I haven’t raised this development with Scooter yet. He may or may not care, it’s hard to tell what a 10-year-old boy’s response will be. But I’ll bet you a box of cookies there’ll be a fart noise involved.",There’s a place for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.

Of course you know October is Breast Cancer Awareness month, and women have been sharing their personal stories related to breast cancer in a number of ways for years. As a social campaign, “No Bra Day”—which may have been started as early as 2011 by a plastic surgeon in Canada—encourages women to go braless and share their photos (with the hashtag #nobraday) to support the cause of breast cancer awareness. Over 82,000 women have complied by posting pics on Twitter and Instagram:

RELATED: JESSICA SIMPSON JUST POSTED A STUNNING TOPLESS PHOTO TO CELEBRATE HER BIRTHDAY

So why are women so angry, then? Because #NoBraDay, they argue, is more about sexualizing breasts than raising cancer awareness. And if you look through the hashtag feed, it's clear that many of those 82,000 photos are more about sexy poses than breast cancer.

This year, 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed — 63,410 of which will be fatal, according to the American Cancer Society. Those frustrated with #NoBraDay are arguing that what women need is not sexy, quasi-topless photos touting #nobraday with little explanation; they need real information explaining how to perform self-exams, what unexpected symptoms to be on the lookout for, and what they should do if they find a lump in their breast.

And not for nothing, #NoBraDay plays up the myth that wearing a bra contributes to an antiquated myth that wearing bras could lead to breast cancer. A 2014 study published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers Prevention solidly debunked that idea, finding that that bra-wearing habits, such as underwire or average hours worn, were not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.

""The patient continues to be hospitalized in isolation until completion of the antibiotic treatment. He is currently asymptomatic and in stable condition,"" the WHO said.

Nearly 70 percent of cases in Madagascar have been pneumonic plague, a form spread human-to-human that is more dangerous than bubonic plague and can trigger epidemics. The pneumonic form invades the lungs, and is treatable with antibiotics. If not treated, it is always fatal and can kill a person within 24 hours.

An initial diagnostic test on the Seychelles man had been ""weakly positive"" for pneumonic plague, but definitive laboratory results are expected from the Institute Pasteur in Paris, the WHO said.

Eight of his contacts ""developed mild symptoms and have been isolated,"" it said, adding that two other suspected cases, without any known link, had been isolated and were on treatment.

In all, 11 close contacts and one foreign national, who was not exposed to the probable case but recently arrived from Madagascar, are hospitalized as a precautionary measure but do not present signs of respiratory distress, the WHO said.

Nearly 1,000 people who were exposed to the man or his close circle were given a prophylactic course of antibiotics to prevent infection and spread, it said. They included children, teachers, passengers, flight crew and health workers.

Seychelles, which has 93,000 people, largely depends on tourism for government revenues.

""Air Seychelles flights to-from Madagascar were stopped from 8 October to reduce likelihood of further importation of cases from Madagascar,"" the WHO said. However, the WHO did not recommend restrictions on travel or trade.

Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, 31, will reportedly plead guilty and sentencing will begin Oct. 23, according to the Associated Press. During sentencing, U.S. troops who were seriously wounded while searching for Bergdahl are expected to testify.

Bergdahl’s story has left the nation debating for eight years about whether he is a hero or traitor, and the importance of the long held American commitment not to leave troops behind. Former President Barack Obama defended swapping prisoners at Guantanamo Bay for Bergdahl’s release in 2014 while President Donald Trump said Bergdahl should “face the death penalty.”

Read on for more about what Bergdahl did and the greater controversy.

Why is Bergdahl on trial?

Then 23, Bergdahl went missing from his remote infantry post near the Pakistan border in June 2009. His disappearance launched a massive search operation.

Bergdahl was quickly captured by the Taliban after leaving his post. The U.S. tracked him for several years before successfully negotiating his release in 2014. The U.S. does not ""leave our men or women in uniform behind,"" Obama said then, regardless of how Bergdahl came to be captured.

BERGDAHL BEARS SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR RISKY MISSIONS TO FIND HIM, JUDGE SAYS

Bergdahl has said that he left his post and intended to alert people about problems he perceived within his unit. Investigators said Bergdahl suffered from schizotypal personality disorder when he left his post.

The Army charged him with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy in 2015.

What could happen?

Bergdahl could face up to five years in prison on the desertion charge. But he could also be sentenced to life in prison for the misbehavior charge.

It’s unclear if prosecutors and the defense reached some sort of agreement ahead of sentencing about Bergdahl’s fate. Bergdahl’s lawyer declined to comment when contacted by Fox News.

What has Trump said?

Trump has been a vocal critic of Bergdahl and the Obama administration’s decision to exchange five prisoners in Guantanamo Bay for his release in May 2014.

BERGDAHL HAD PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER WHEN HE LEFT POST, DOCUMENTS SAY

""We're tired of Sgt. Bergdahl, who's a traitor, a no-good traitor, who should have been executed,"" Trump said at a Las Vegas rally in 2015.

On Twitter, Trump has also said Bergdahl should face the death penalty and repeatedly referred to him as a “traitor.”

Is there anything else to know about the case?

Bergdahl elected to be tried by a judge, not a panel of military officers, in August.

Defense attorneys had attempted to get the case thrown out because of Trump’s ardent and harsh criticism of the soldier. But the judge, Army Col. Jeffrey R. Nance, rejected the request.

Of course you know October is Breast Cancer Awareness month, and women have been sharing their personal stories related to breast cancer in a number of ways for years. As a social campaign, “No Bra Day”—which may have been started as early as 2011 by a plastic surgeon in Canada—encourages women to go braless and share their photos (with the hashtag #nobraday) to support the cause of breast cancer awareness. Over 82,000 women have complied by posting pics on Twitter and Instagram:

RELATED: JESSICA SIMPSON JUST POSTED A STUNNING TOPLESS PHOTO TO CELEBRATE HER BIRTHDAY

So why are women so angry, then? Because #NoBraDay, they argue, is more about sexualizing breasts than raising cancer awareness. And if you look through the hashtag feed, it's clear that many of those 82,000 photos are more about sexy poses than breast cancer.

This year, 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed — 63,410 of which will be fatal, according to the American Cancer Society. Those frustrated with #NoBraDay are arguing that what women need is not sexy, quasi-topless photos touting #nobraday with little explanation; they need real information explaining how to perform self-exams, what unexpected symptoms to be on the lookout for, and what they should do if they find a lump in their breast.

And not for nothing, #NoBraDay plays up the myth that wearing a bra contributes to an antiquated myth that wearing bras could lead to breast cancer. A 2014 study published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers Prevention solidly debunked that idea, finding that that bra-wearing habits, such as underwire or average hours worn, were not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.

In August, Trump tweeted blame for failure to repeal ObamaCare on McConnell, saying, “Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn’t get it done.
It will be the end of Mitch McConnell as we know it.","Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is set to sit down with President Donald Trump Monday in a White House meeting that could help patch their relationship, which fractured in a big way over the summer, when the two leaders took shots at each other over health care reform and the effectiveness of Congress.

Back in August, Trump said he was “very disappointed in Mitch,” after McConnell said Trump had “excessive expectations” about the legislative process.

The meeting comes as conservative groups demand McConnell step down from his leadership role.

“We call on all five members of the GOP Senate leadership to step down, or for their caucus to remove them as soon as possible,” Ken Cuccinelli, the former attorney general of Virginia who now leads the Senate Conservatives Fund, said Wednesday on Capitol Hill.

McConnell “will join the President and Vice President for a working lunch where they will discuss the fall agenda which includes completing the budget resolution, passing tax reform to help American families and workers, confirming well-qualified judicial and other nominees, and continuing to provide resources to communities affected by the recent hurricanes,” the Senate GOP leader's spokesman David Popp told Fox News.

Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to Trump, said Saturday in a speech to religious conservatives that he’s committed to dumping McConnell.

Bannon put on notice some of those incumbents who are at risk of a challenge from his flank of the party. He said lawmakers possibly can avoid that wrath if they disavow McConnell and meet other conditions.

""This is our war,"" Bannon said. ""The establishment started it. ... You all are gonna finish it.""

But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said, “Mitch McConnell’s not our problem. Our problem is that we promised to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and we failed. We promised to cut taxes and we have yet to do it.”

The senator added: ""If we're successful, Mitch McConnell's fine. If we're not, we're all in trouble. We lose our majority and I think President Trump will not get reelected.""

Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate from Maine who was a critical “no” vote on health care, said Bannon’s rhetoric is what Americans are tired of.

""They don't want this hyperpartisanship. They want us to work together. And they want us to get things done,"" she said.

Collins added that ""over-the-top rhetoric is not helpful. Mitch McConnell is the Senate majority leader. The president needs him. I'm glad they're working together on tax reform and a lot of other issues. And I'm glad they're meeting this week.""

In August, Trump tweeted blame for failure to repeal ObamaCare on McConnell, saying, “Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn’t get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!”

McConnell responded to Trump’s Twitter barrage by saying the challenges of governing shouldn’t be a surprise.

""A lot of people look at all that and find it frustrating, messy. Well, welcome to the democratic process. That's the way it is in our country,"" McConnell said at a GOP event in Kentucky this summer.

Meanwhile, the senators’ weeklong recess also drew criticism from the White House.

""They're on another vacation right now. I think that we would all be a lot better off if the Senate would stop taking vacations, and start staying here until we actually get some real things accomplished,"" Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said.

Recently, a McConnell-backed political committee spent millions and Trump endorsed Alabama Sen. Luther Strange in a recent primary election, but Bannon-backed Roy Moore prevailed. Moore, a former judge, has defied federal court orders, described Islam as a false religion and called homosexuality evil.

Senate Republicans had been upbeat about adding to their 52-48 edge in the chamber, especially with Democrats defending more seats next year — 10 in states Trump won in last year's presidential election. But the Bannon challenge could cost them, leaving incumbents on the losing end in primaries or GOP candidates roughed up for the general election.

""If we don't cut taxes and we don't eventually repeal and replace ObamaCare, then we're going to lose across the board in the House in 2018. And all of my colleagues running in primaries in 2018 will probably get beat. It will be the end of Mitch McConnell as we know it. So this is a symptom of a greater problem,"" Graham said.

He added that Bannon ""can't beat us if we're successful. And if we're not successful, it doesn't matter who tries to beat us, they'll be successful.""

Terry Smiley said he was disgusted by Jaguars players who took a knee during the national anthem in London last month, and he decided he needed to make his voice heard.

So Smiley hired a pilot to fly his banner, which read ""BE AMERICAN. BOYCOTT THE JAGS AND THE NFL,"" over EverBank Field on Sunday before the Jaguars faced off against the Los Angeles Rams.

“I have the right to protest and I’m going to protest it with bumper stickers, airplanes – whatever I got to do. I will continue to protest,” Smiley told WFOX-WJAX-TV.

While Smiley may feel the players' actions are disrespectful, other Jaguars fans said the players are kneeling to garner awareness for a greater cause.

“They are taking it in a peaceful manner,"" Jaguars fan Jaumari Day told WFOX-WJAX-TV. ""They are trying to use their words and use their actions instead of taking it to violence.""

Another fan, Jay Crossman, said people need to realize the ""true message"" of the protests.

""This event underscores the turbulent times we're living in when senseless killings are taken to such an extreme level,"" radio music exec Mike McVay told Fox News. ""You'd find many in the country music community supportive of the right to bear arms.

""There will be a debate,"" added McVay, EVP of content and Programming for Cumulus Media and Westwood One. ""We'll know more in a couple of weeks how it's going to change.""

The debate has already started; Caleb Keefer, the guitarist for the Josh Abbott Band, who performed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival hours before the shooting occurred, spoke out in favor of gun control on Monday.

""I've been a proponent of the 2nd amendment my entire life,"" Keefer wrote on Twitter. ""Until the events of last night. I cannot express how wrong I was...We need gun control RIGHT. NOW.""

Echoing Keefer's statements is the daughter of country music legend Johnny Cash, Rosanne Cash, a longtime advocate for gun control, who penned an op-ed urging her fellow musicians to take action.

Cash said the National Rifle Association (NRA) ""funds domestic terrorism"" and country music artists associated with its group ""NRA Country"" must speak up against it.

""For the past few decades, the National Rifle Association has increasingly nurtured an alliance with country music artists and their fans. You can see it in 'N.R.A.

""That wholesome public relations veneer masks something deeply sinister and profoundly destructive.""

Who’da thunk?

Who would possibly have thought Tennessee Republican and Trump-supporting Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn - a candidate to succeed out-going Senator Bob Corker - would have anything in common with Rose McGowan, the hardworking film, television actress and LGBT activist? Two worlds, and worlds apart.

Until it came to Twitter.

McGowan, it was revealed by the New York Times in the ever burgeoning Harvey Weinstein scandal, had:

“…reached a $100,000 settlement with Mr. Weinstein in 1997 after a hotel room incident at the Sundance Film Festival, and in recent days has been vocal in her support of women who have stepped forward to reveal that the producer sexually harassed them or worse.

On Tuesday, after the actor Ben Affleck tweeted that the allegations against Mr. Weinstein “made him sick,” Ms. McGowan called him a liar, saying he had long been aware of what Mr. Weinstein had done. She has also attacked Hollywood players who failed to criticize Mr. Weinstein, writing in a tweet, ‘You all knew.’”

Of a sudden, McGowan found that Twitter had “locked” her account. The Times headline read:

Rose McGowan’s Twitter Account Locked After Posts About Weinstein

The Times story began:

“The actress Rose McGowan said in an Instagram post overnight that her Twitter account had been temporarily locked after a series of posts about Harvey Weinstein’s misconduct, including toward her.

“TWITTER HAS SUSPENDED ME. THERE ARE POWERFUL FORCES AT WORK. BE MY VOICE,” Ms. McGowan wrote on her Instagram page after midnight Eastern time on Thursday. She included a snapshot of a message from Twitter saying she would be able to send only direct messages from her account unless she deleted tweets that violated Twitter rules.

The screenshot announced a temporary freeze that prevented her from tweeting, retweeting or liking for 12 hours. Unlike a full suspension, this measure left her account visible.”

Hold that thought and move on to Marsha Blackburn. The Tennessean headline is here:

Twitter pulls Marsha Blackburn's Senate campaign ad over 'sale of baby body parts' line

This story begins:

“Republican U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn's online video announcing her campaign for U.S. Senate has been blocked in any Twitter advertisements after the social media company objected to a line that refers to the lawmaker stopping the ‘sale of baby body parts.’

Blackburn's campaign announced Twitter's decision on Monday after a representative from Twitter informed her campaign that the line ‘had been deemed an inflammatory statement that is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.’ The language violates Twitter's policy for advertisements, the company said.

‘If this is omitted from the video it will be permitted to serve,’ a Twitter representative said in an email to a political ad agency working for the campaign.”

Eventually, the fans and friends of each woman rallied and Twitter recanted in both cases. McGowan’s tweet, Twitter said, included a private phone number in the screen shot. Once corrected her account was unlocked. In Blackburn’s case, Twitter also recanted the day after it had blocked the Congresswoman’s video. The Twitter statement read:

“Our ads policies strive to balance protecting our users from potentially distressing content while allowing our advertisers to communicate their messages. Nowhere is this more difficult than in the realm of political advertising and the highly charged issues that are often addressed therein. After further review, we have made the decision to allow the content in question from Rep. Blackburn’s campaign ad to be promoted on our ads platform.”

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you’re lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath — a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child’s former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book — a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant — I’m speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space — at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.",How to make use and better your life with a spare bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/28/how-to-make-use-and-better-your-life-with-spare-bedroom.html

“This helps me recover from my PTSD and TBI that I received while I was in the Persian Gulf,” Benjamin Woods, a veteran, told Fox 5 New York. “The horse just goes along with how you feel. If you’re tense and not relaxed, the horse will tend to be the same way.”

Stone offers the program free-of-charge for veterans, and relies on donations to keep it running.

Mark Otto, a combat veteran who served two tours and is now vice president of the United War Veterans Council, said the program can help those who aren’t outwardly suffering.

“Horses can really feed off your emotions,” he told Fox 5 New York. “So if you’re one of those people that walks around with a big smile on your face all day long, but on the inside more is going on, the horses are going to pick up on that and sort of mirror it back to you.”

PTSD: WHAT IT IS AND HOW TO SPOT IT

Another veteran said the horses make him feel safe.

“It’s very calming, and soothing for me,” the Afghanistan veteran, who was not identified, told the news outlet. “I could be in the worst mood and the horses just make me happy. I feel warm inside, I feel good.”",Horse therapy program for veterans with PTSD needs donations,https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/10/13/horse-therapy-program-for-veterans-with-ptsd-needs-donations.html

Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who faces more than a dozen charges of fraud and bribery. And now all eyes are on the judge who will determine whether the case can continue.

Menendez is accused of accepting donations, trips and gifts in exchange from an eye-doctor friend in exchange for pressuring government officials to act in ways that would be beneficial to his friend’s business interests.

Menendez has maintained his innocence, and U.S. District Judge William Walls now has to decide if the trial will go on or if he will dismiss it, using a 2016 Supreme Court ruling which outlined a stricter definition of what an “official act” is. The defense has argued that the allegations against Menendez do not meet that narrower definition.

Walls had said he wanted to hear the prosecution’s arguments before he made a decision on whether to dismiss the case. Should he determine to go ahead with the trial, the defense is expected to take the rest of the month for its case.

It’s the first time in nine years that a sitting U.S. senator is facing a federal bribery charge.

What is Menendez accused of?

Menendez, 63, accepted a plethora of campaign donations, gifts and vacations from Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist.

In return, Menendez used his position to lobby on behalf of Melgen’s business interests, according to prosecutors.

Melgen allegedly directed more than $750,000 in campaign contributions to entities that supported Menendez, according to the indictment, which prosecutors said were inducements to get Menendez to use his influence on Melgen's behalf. Prosecutors have also accused Menendez of trying to hide the gifts.

Melgen also paid for Menendez and his girlfriend to stay for three nights at a Parisian hotel where rooms typically cost about $1,500 per night and allowed the senator the use of his private jet, according to prosecutors.

NBC NEWS CALLS MENENDEZ A REPUBLICAN IN CORRUPTION CASE REPORT

Federal prosecutors said that Menendez “sold his office for a lifestyle that he couldn’t afford.”

The indictment also alleged that Menendez pressured State Department officials to give visas to three young women described as Melgen's girlfriends.

What is the senator’s defense?

Both Menendez and Melgen have pleaded not guilty – and Menendez has vehemently denied the accusations against him.

Throughout the trial thus far, defense attorneys have sought to prove that Menendez and Melgen have been friends since before the former became a senator, and the trips were nothing more than friends traveling together.

At times emotional, Menendez has maintained his innocence throughout the trial.

What has happened in the trial so far?

Defense attorney Raymond Brown got into a spat with U.S. District Court Judge William H. Walls at the start of the trial. Brown accused Walls of being “extremely prejudicial to the defense.”

MENENDEZ CASE MAY IMPACT VOTES

Walls had denied Menendez’s request that the trial be recessed during critical Senate votes, stating that his job should not be treated differently from that of a construction worker or cab driver.

The trial has also focused on a meeting former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D, set up with Menendez and former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to discuss a nearly $9 million Medicaid billing dispute.

Sebelius testified in court this week that the incident was the first time in her role in government that she was asked by a senator to take a meeting with another senator. She said that Meglen wasn’t specifically mentioned in the meeting but that she assumed his case was the topic.

Prosecutors didn’t call Reid to testify before it rested its case on Oct. 11.

Is there anything else to know about Salomon Melgen?

Melgen, 63, was convicted of 67 counts of health care fraud in April in what the Palm Beach Post called one of the biggest Medicare fraud cases in the U.S.

During that case, prosecutors argued that Melgen, who was born in the Dominican Republic, robbed Medicare of as much as $105 million, according to the newspaper. His sentencing has been delayed until after this trial.

Aside from Menendez, Melgen has given significant amounts of money to a variety of Democratic lawmakers, according to public records.

What happens if Menendez is convicted?

If Menendez is convicted and goes to prison, Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., would pick a replacement.

That prospect is troublesome for Democrats who fear that Christie would pick a Republican to fill the Senate seat – giving the GOP an additional edge for legislative fights.

Menendez is up for reelection next year. He was selected to replace former Gov. Jon Corzine, D-N.J., in the Senate in 2005.

Trump started the Twitter battle by suggesting Democrats want to increase taxes and block the Republican reform plan.

“The Democrats only want to increase taxes and obstruct. That’s all they are good at!” Trump tweeted.

Schumer, D-N.Y., fired back, tweeting that the president’s tax plan was based on “fake math.”

“POTUS complains about fake news – this tax plan’s fake math is as bad as any of the so-called fake news he has complained about,” Schumer tweeted. “This deliberate manipulation of #s & facts could lead to messing up the good economy inherited from @POTUS44 & hurting the middle class.”

Schumer continued, “History shows tax cuts like these benefit the wealthy and the powerful to the exclusion of the middle class.”

Minutes later, Trump took a pointed shot at Schumer -- this time, over the Democratic leader’s stance on the Iran nuclear deal.

“Dem Senator Schumer hated the Iran Deal made by President Obama, but now that I am involved, he is OK with it. Tell that to Israel, Chuck!” Trump wrote. He was referring to criticism of the administration's move last Friday to decertify the Iran nuclear agreement, leaving to Congress whether to re-impose sanctions, change the law or do nothing.

Trump on Monday went on to tout the economy and the “record business enthusiasm” since the election, including a stock market ""up more than 25%"" and a drop in unemployment.

But Schumer wasn’t finished and blasted out a final Twitter rebuttal for the morning.

“As @POTUS points out, the stock market is at record highs & cos are raking in unprecedented profits, yet wages remain relatively flat. That’s proof that companies already have a cash windfall, but they’re not using it to boost wages,” Schumer tweeted. “Rather than helping biggest corps avoid paying their fair share, #taxreform should reward those cos that create jobs & raise US wages.”

The social media clash between Trump and Schumer follows weeks of discussions between the two. Earlier this month, the president and the Democratic leader spoke over the phone about a possible bipartisan plan on health care. Last month, Trump hosted Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., at the White House to discuss potential bipartisan strategies on immigration, hurricane relief funding and the overall budget.

But the outreach seems to have taken a turn, with Schumer and Pelosi frequently clashing with the president -- including over the president's recent move to cut off subsidies to insurers under ObamaCare.","Trump and Schumer clash on Twitter over Iran deal, taxes: 'Tell that to Israel, Chuck'",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/16/trump-and-schumer-clash-on-twitter-over-iran-deal-taxes-tell-that-to-israel-chuck.html

To be blunt, there are too many media fails this week to hit them all.","It takes a disaster to get more attention in the media than President Trump. Hollywood A-lister Harvey Weinstein delivered just that – with his career and life in the eye of the storm this week.

By now, Weinstein has been accused of everything from sexual harassment to rape and then decades of coercion and intimidation to hide his alleged actions. Collateral damage has rippled through the company he helped build and into the rest of Hollywood – even hitting other celebrities like Ben Affleck, who was forced to apologize for groping a woman several years ago.

An enormous number of Hollywood celebrities have claimed they were sexually harassed by Weinstein or others in power. Even actors Terry Crews and James Van Der Beek complained about harassment.

The Weinstein chaos was set in motion by the excellent work of New York Times writers Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey.

Unfortunately, the revelations about Weinstein also exposed both Hollywood corruption and news media cooperation that has lasted many years. They showed the lengths that Hollywood PR people and the media have gone to hide bad or compromising stories about Weinstein over the years.

NBC led the pack, but even late-night comics were reluctant to call Weinstein out. And even The Washington Post had zero print coverage the day after the scandal broke. Former Trump press secretary Sean Spicer gleefully criticized the paper for this failure.

The media tolerance of or complicity in Weinstein’s mistreatment of women calls to mind how many thousands of times journalists have used the term “war on women” against Republicans. In fact, GQ is still using that term against the GOP. Shockingly, in a story that mentions Weinstein.

To be blunt, there are too many media fails this week to hit them all. So let’s hit the high (or low) points.

● For all that Kantor and Twohey deserve credit for by exposing the dark side of Hollywood, their own paper choked when it had the chance to report the story 13 years ago. Former Times reporter Sharon Waxman wrote a story in The Wrap headlined: ""Harvey Weinstein’s Media Enablers’? The New York Times Is One of Them.” Waxman wrote that she investigated “oft-repeated allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein” in 2004. She said that she learned that the head of Weinstein’s film studio in Italy “had no film experience and his real job was to take care of Weinstein’s women needs, among other things.” Waxman wrote that she “also tracked down a woman in London who had been paid off after an unwanted sexual encounter with Weinstein.” However, Waxman said “the story I reported never ran” because of “intense pressure from Weinstein.”

● NBC certainly humiliated itself. NBC News correspondent Ronan Farrow couldn’t even get the network where he worked to run the story. CNN anchor Jake Tapper called out NBC’s “media complicity.” Farrow had to take his report to The New Yorker to get it published. MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow told him in an on-air interview, “NBC says that the story wasn’t publishable.” Farrow proved the network wrong.

● NBC failed at every level. Its newscast ignored the story. Its news department squelched it. NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” the network’s anchor comedy show, didn’t even make one joke about Weinstein. The Huffington Post skewered NBC and deservedly so. ""Becoming more and more clear that what happened at NBC is straight-up journalistic malpractice,"" it wrote, adding an awesome illustration of a chicken with the network’s famous peacock feathers. NBC’s “Today” co-host Matt Lauer shockingly gave the network credit, saying Farrow had “been working this story for a long time, both for NBC News and The New Yorker.”

● Actress Rose McGowan, named in the original Times piece, has now come out and said that Weinstein, “raped me.” Just hours before that, she had bashed Weinstein favorite actor Ben Affleck for allegedly lying about what he knew about Weinstein. Twitter actually suspended her account, though Twitter claimed it was because she tweeted a phone number. McGowan, who reportedly had a settlement with Weinstein, seemed to be enjoying a measure of justice despite the bizarre suspension.

● All three broadcast networks reported in 2015 that Weinstein had been accused of groping an Italian model. Then they promptly forgot it and spent two years treating Weinstein like it never happened. This included NBC “Today” co-host Kathie Lee Gifford telling on air how she became friends with Weinstein. Both ABC and NBC reported how first daughter Malia Obama landed an internship with the mogul. Neither network mentioned the allegations against him. But I suppose the Obamas are still perfect parents even though they let an accused sex harasser give an internship to their daughter.

2. NFL Can’t Stand Getting The Knee From Trump: The NFL and its players union both look like the pathetic Cleveland Browns against Trump’s anti-protest air attack. Ever since Trump sacked the protesting players and said they should be fired, the protesters have been fired up.

Only so have the fans and they outnumber the players thousands to one. This week found protest ally ESPN abandoning one of its own star players – Jemele Hill. The “SportsCenter” anchor had touched off a furor by calling Trump a “white supremacist.” ESPN didn’t even suspend her for that.

This week she commented on how Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones vowed to bench protesting players. “If you feel strongly about JJ's statement, boycott his advertisers,” she tweeted. Calling the president a “white supremacist” was OK to ESPN. But messing with advertisers was a bridge too far. The network suspended her for two weeks, annoying the social justice community. Another ESPN staffer, Michael Wilbon, called Jones’ attitude a “plantation mentality.”

That was only part of the league’s problem this week. Vice President Mike Pence attended a Colts game and walked out after the player protest. That set more media tongues wagging, especially at MSNBC. The “Morning Joe” team was all set to be annoyed and host Joe Scarborough called Pence’s actions, an “abuse of power!” NBC’s Kate Snow criticized it as another “divisive issue” for the Trump administration.

The result of this continued bad PR is the league making a new rule that says players should stand for the anthem. Both owners and the players association are planning to meet to come up with a strategy to keep from further harming their sport. And the broadcast networks are doing their part to hide the NFL’s collapse on the field. They gave 10 times more coverage to the reaction to Trump’s initial criticism of the league than the announcement that the NFL appears to be backing down.

3. The Media And the Giant Impeach: What do comedian Amy Schumer, Democrat mega-donor Tom Steyer and Washington Post Republican Jen Rubin have in common? All three were pushing some form of removing the president – either by impeachment or a 25th Amendment remedy.

And, because it’s anti-Trump, many in the media swallowed the argument to make the president look bad. Schumer urged Instagram followers to push “#25thamendment” for several reasons, including, “because we don’t want WW3 on our ovaries.” (That sounds painful.) Billionaire eco-nut Steyer sent a letter to top Democrats making it clear the 2018 election will be about Trump’s impeachment. And, while Rubin said she’s been against using the 25th Amendment, she sure opened the door to it in a column headlined: “When do we reach 25th Amendment territory?”

The “news” channels ate it up. MSNBC's Chris Matthews and CNN’s Wolf Blitzer were just two of the TV talking heads to talk about removing Trump from office. Matthews naturally blamed the GOP’s “unbelievable cowardice” for the idea not moving faster.

The 25th Amendment gives the Cabinet that power of removal if the president is unable to perform his duties. Liberals, who talked impeachment before Trump even took office, now see this as the latest in a long series of anti-Trump strategies.

4. Playing Nuclear Football: Nuclear weapons launched another media feeding frenzy this week, enough to make even diehard conservatives fondly remember the “No nukes” movement.

NBC fired the first shot, saying “Trump Wanted Tenfold Increase in Nuclear Arsenal, Surprising Military.” Trump called out the network as “Fake @NBCNews” in a tweet response that also compared NBC to CNN. Trump followed with an attack that freaked out the media world, asking, “at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License?”

The result was more media mania, led by the Lord of Lies Brian Williams, claiming the U.S. was “the only nation on Earth to have set off nuclear weapons in anger.” Williams, who has manufactured enough of his own history, has now graduated into manufacturing U.S. history.

For all that liberals lament America’s use of the nuclear weapons, those two nukes ended a drawn-out and deadly war and set Japan on a path to become a free nation and saved American lives. That’s not an act of anger, it’s one of practicality.

New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof went nuclear on “Morning Joe,” aka Resistance HQ, and proceeded to contradict himself in dangerous ways. On one hand, he painted a picture of a terrifyingly dangerous North Korea: “Everywhere you go in Pyongyang, the capital, there are posters showing missiles striking the U.S. Capitol.” On the other, he depicted a nation the U.S. can’t stop from expanding its nuclear capacity and ability to strike the U.S. “I came back really feeling that we are not gonna be able to stop them,” he said.

Nowhere did he mention that the U.S. has followed his strategy of endless talk and that has gotten us in the fix we are in now. Kristof’s employer was so concerned that it ran an editorial calling for Congress to take away the president’s ability to use nuclear weapons in a first strike, effectively neutering America’s defense, As the anti-Trump paper put it: “He could unleash the apocalyptic force of the American nuclear arsenal by his word alone, and within minutes.” So could Obama, yet somehow no one in the media cared.

Hurray For Hollywood: While Tinseltown celebs like Julianne Moore are calling for new gun regulations, it’s important to see the entertainment industry for what it is – hypocritical. The week of the Las Vegas attack, four of the top five movies in the U.S. were incredibly violent – with more than 200 incidents of gun violence, along with another 377 incidents of other types of violence. Two of the movies – “American Assassin” and “Kingsman: Golden Circle” – assaulted the senses with so much bloodshed that it is challenging to tally all the violence. And automatic weapons that were part of the Vegas massacre figured prominently in three of the four films.

Nearly forgotten rapper Eminem (No, not these guys) is back and desperate to be relevant by being faux edgy – attacking Trump like almost every other media figure on Earth. He bashed Trump with rhymes so embarrassingly silly that he would lose “Epic Rap Battles of History” to J.R.R. Tolkien. Along with calling Trump “orange,” he gave the obligatory four-letter word salute to Trump fans.","Week’s top media fails: Weinstein scandal; NFL gets the knee from Trump + ESPN, Eminem and more",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/14/week-s-top-media-fails-weinstein-scandal-nfl-gets-knee-from-trump-espn-eminem-and-more.html

Hours later, Key West Mayor Craig Cates came in to Two Friends Patio Restaurant for dinner, as nearby Duval Street began to show signs of life.

“Key West is going to be open for business soon,” said Cates.

When asked about the higher volume of people out and about, the mayor replied, “Well, we’re taking visitors now. We haven’t advertised yet,” he said.

Cates, however, pointed out that the hardest hit parts of the Keys are still picking up the pieces from Irma’s devastation. “We understand our neighbors to the north in the Florida Keys got more damage than us,” he said.

In nearby Big Pine Key, the cleanup is still ongoing.

Among those cleaning up are 85-year-old Wes Harris and his wife. “We’ve been married 63 years,” he said.

The couple rode out the storm near their now beat-up home.

The wheelchair ramp into Harris’ home was just recently repaired by first responders, but there’s still so much more to do.

“See that rock? You see how big that rock is?” Harris said as he pointed to a large boulder in his yard. “That’s not my rock. I don’t know where the hell it came from.”

Harris is so tough that the idea of getting a little emotional over the relief effort in the aftermath of the storm makes him annoyed.

“I just can’t believe how everybody has helped. It’s absolutely unbelievable,” Harris said.

Harris’ post-storm story isn’t necessarily unique. Residents told 7News about problems with their house, their boat, or in some cases, both.

Big names also came to help out the Keys, in the form of former football player Tim Tebow and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.

“So many people are so tough, and what they’ve gone through,” said Tebow. “You know what’s even more special? So many people, who don’t know what’s even going on with their houses, but they’re still volunteering for other people that need help.”

Residents appreciated Tebow’s visit. “He’s such a huge model for me, so it’s a nice thing that he came down here to the Keys,” said one woman.

7News cameras captured Rubio posing for pictures, as food, ice and relief supplies got to those in need.

When asked what he would say to those residents who fear they may be forgotten, Rubio responded: “They won’t be forgotten by us — I don’t know if someone else will — primarily because we’ve spent a lot of time, personally, in the Keys, up and down this place. I mean my family, we’ve had so many incredible memories here. We want to see the Keys come back.”

Meanwhile, Harris indicated he will make it through that strong current called adversity, probably because of his big heart. “You’ve got to keep stroking, bud. That’s all you can do,” he said.

As the reclamation party begins in Key West, many residents feel that, because the cleanup is still underway, the party is happening too soon. however, others feel that it needs to happen to show that the Florida Keys are still alive.

Officials said tourism will return to Key West in a limited capacity on Sunday with the arrival of a cruise ship at the Margaritaville Pier. It is scheduled to arrive at noon.

Waclaw Kieltyka and Michal Lysejko of the band Decapitated appeared in court on Friday where their bail were set at $100,000 each, and both men were ordered to surrender their passports, The Spokesman-Review reported.

All four members of the band were arrested in Los Angeles in September.

The band's other two members, lead singer Rafal Piotrowski and bassist Hubert Wiecek, are set for an initial court appearance Oct. 19 in Spokane. Piatrowski is charged with second-degree rape, while Wiecek is charged with third-degree rape.

In a statement posted on social media, the band says the allegations are false and that they are ""confident that once the facts and evidence have been seen and heard, they will be released and able to return home.""

Two women told police they were invited onto the band's tour bus after the show, The Spokesman-Review reported.

The star, who typically gives her opinion on the issues of the day and her life by way of her blog, changed things up a bit by publishing a lengthy op-ed in The New York Times about the Harvey Weinstein scandal, in which she condemned a culture that puts women in situations like the ones Weinstein’s accusers found themselves in. However, after including a portion about how she’s avoided Hollywood harassment for so long, many who read the piece are accusing her of blaming the victims for their own assaults.

While describing how she avoided such things by getting into the business at a young age and not being the typical Hollywood pretty-girl archetype, she mentioned how her choices in the business as an adult have helped her get by.

“I still make choices every day as a 41-year-old actress that I think of as self-protecting and wise. I have decided that my sexual self is best reserved for private situations with those I am most intimate with. I dress modestly. I don’t act flirtatiously with men as a policy,” she wrote.

Bialik immediately qualified the above statement by saying, “Women should be able to wear whatever they want. They should be able to flirt however they want with whomever they want. Why are we the ones who have to police our behavior?”

However, many still took her words as evidence that she was shaming the women who fell victim for the way they dressed or acted.

Iran closed its three official crossings with the Kurdish region Sunday, Kurdish media reported.","Kurdish forces were withdrawing from Kirkuk on Monday as Iraqi federal forces moved in to the disputed city and seized oil fields and other infrastructure amid soaring tensions over last month's Kurdish vote for independence.

Kurdish officials accused the Iraqi army of carrying out a ""major, multi-prong attack,"" and reported heavy clashes on the city's outskirts, but a spokesman for Iraq's state-backed militias said they encountered little resistance.

By midday, federal forces had moved into several major oil fields north of the city, as well as its airport and an important military base, according to Iraqi commanders. Kurdish party headquarters inside Kirkuk had been abandoned.

The U.S., which has armed, trained and provided vital air support to both sides in their shared struggle against the Islamic State group, described Monday's events as ""coordinated movements, not attacks,"" while bemoaning the dispute as a distraction against a common enemy. It said the limited exchange of fire was a ""misunderstanding.""

After initial reports of clashes in and around the city, it appeared by the afternoon as though the vastly outnumbered Kurdish forces, known as the peshmerga, were pulling out with hardly a fight.

Local police stayed in place in Kirkuk as Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi called on civil servants to remain at their posts to serve the city. ""We have only acted to fulfill our constitutional duty and extend the federal authority and impose security and protect the national wealth in this city,"" he said.

Still, thousands of civilians could be seen leaving with their belongings heading north along the country roads that lead to Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region.

Kirkuk, home to some 1 million Arabs, Kurds, Turkmen and Christians, has been at the heart of a long-running dispute between the autonomous Kurdish region and the central government in Baghdad. Both are close allies of the U.S.

The Kurdistan Region Security Council said early Monday that the peshmerga destroyed at least five U.S.-supplied Humvees being used by Iraq's state-sanctioned militias following the ""unprovoked attack"" south of the city.

Brig. Gen. Bahzad Ahmed, a spokesman for Kurdish forces, said federal forces seized an oil and gas company and other industrial areas south of Kirkuk in fighting with Kurdish forces that caused ""lots of casualties,"" without providing a specific figure.

He said Iraqi forces have ""burnt lots of houses and killed many people"" south of the disputed city. His claims could not be independently verified.

A spokesman for Iraq's state-sanctioned militias said they had ""achieved all our goals"" in retaking areas from Kurdish forces in and around the northern city. Ahmed al-Assadi said federal forces came under fire from ""some rebels"" after launching the operation early Monday and returned fire. He did not say whether they suffered any casualties.

He said federal forces have been deployed in the area of the K-1 military base, the Kirkuk airport and a number of oil fields and installations. The Iraqi military said it seized two major oil fields outside the city.

Al-Assadi said the state-backed militias, mainly Shiite Arab fighters known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, have not entered the city center, but Associated Press reporters saw Turkmen PMF militiamen taking up posts in the western part of the city.

Tensions have soared since the Kurds held a non-binding referendum last month in which they voted for independence from Iraq. The central government, along with neighboring Turkey and Iran, as well as the United States, rejected the vote.

The central government and the autonomous Kurdish region have long been divided over the sharing of oil revenues and the fate of disputed territories like Kirkuk that are controlled by Kurdish forces but are outside their self-ruled region.

The Kurds assumed control of Kirkuk, in the heart of a major oil-producing region, in the summer of 2014, when IS militants swept across northern Iraq and the country's armed forces crumbled.

Iraq has since rebuilt its armed forces with considerable U.S. aid, and they are battle-hardened and flush with victory after driving IS from most of the territory it once held. Fighting alongside the armed forces are tens of thousands of state-sanctioned militiamen, mainly Shiite Arab fighters backed by Iran, whom the Kurds view as an instrument of demographic change. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has said the militias will remain outside the city.

State-run Al-Iraqiya TV had earlier reported that federal forces rolled into parts of the countryside outside Kirkuk without facing resistance. However, some residents of the city and an Iraqi militia commander reported shelling.

Al-Iraqiya carried a statement from al-Abadi's office saying he had ordered federal forces to ""impose security in the city in cooperation with the inhabitants and the peshmerga,"" indicating he was willing to share administration.

Baghdad has been turning the screws on the Kurdish region since the September referendum, pushing Kurdish leaders to disavow the vote and accept shared administration over Kirkuk.

Iraq's government barred international flights to and from the region and asked neighboring Turkey and Iran to close their borders. Iran closed its three official crossings with the Kurdish region Sunday, Kurdish media reported. It also froze currency transfers to four banks operating in the Kurdish region.

Al-Abadi's Cabinet said Sunday that fighters from Turkey's Kurdish insurgency, the PKK, were beginning to appear in Kirkuk, and declared that would be tantamount to an act of war.","Kurds withdraw as Iraqi forces launch 'major, multi-pronged' attack on disputed city",https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/16/kurds-withdraw-as-iraqi-forces-launch-major-multi-pronged-attack-on-disputed-city.html

Three songs into his show in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the singer launched into a five-minute speech that honored the 58 killed and nearly 500 hurt in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. But Aldean took a defiant tone in telling concertgoers to resist living in fear, and he called for more of the national unity he's seen since the attack.

""These people are going to continue to try to hold us down,"" Aldean said. ""To those people that keep trying to do that, I say (expletive) you, we don't really care.""

Fans agreed. They pumped their fists and held up American flags as Aldean continued.

""I want to play the show for you guys that the people in Las Vegas came to see and didn't get a chance to,"" he said.

Friends Audra Miller, Lee Holstein and Amanda Zmak were some of those fans. They were in the audience when the shooting happened and ran for cover like thousands of others.

They traveled from Dallas for the Tulsa show and wore T-shirts they decorated themselves that said ""Vegas Strong,"" a popular meme since the attack.

Miller, 34, said Aldean made them proud and viewed the evening as a triumph.

""It was therapeutic and kind of like a cleansing all at the same time,"" she said. ""We just wanted to represent family, friends, love and hope.""

Aldean gave fans the show they wanted. The Georgia native is one of country music's biggest stars, touring in support of his album ""They Don't Know,"" which debuted atop the Billboard 200 in 2016. Much of his catalog includes Southern rock, pop and hip-hop influences, a mix of hard-charging party anthems and ballads with lyrics about farm work, drinking and small-town life.

He blasted through hits including ""Big Green Tractor,"" ''Fly Over States"" and ""She's Country,"" and popped open a can of beer onstage after the encore.

Aldean canceled shows in California last week to mourn those killed Oct. 1 at the outdoor Route 91 festival. He resumed his tour in an arena where concertgoers walked through metal detectors, and police presence was visible.

The singer visited shooting victims still in a Las Vegas hospital Sunday. The day before, Aldean performed Tom Petty's ""I Won't Back Down"" on ""Saturday Night Live"" in tribute to the victims and the late rock superstar.

Petty died the day after the shooting in Los Angeles after suffering cardiac arrest.

As previously reported, the powerful producer behind Miramax and The Weinstein Company, recently took off to a rehab center in Arizona after numerous women came forward to bring allegations of sexual harassment and assault against him.

“He doesn’t need sex rehab,” Jost began. “He needs a specialized facility where there are no women, no contact with the outside world, metal bars and it’s a prison.”

Che turned things up to eleven while explaining the difficult situation the story puts comedians in.

“This is a tough spot for a comedian because it’s so hard to make jokes about sexual assault, but it’s so easy to make jokes about a guy that looks like this,” he said, gesturing to an image of Weinstein. “I mean, he looks like chewed bubble gum rolled in cat hair.”

Elsewhere in the show, it featured a sketch in which cast member Aidy Bryant moderated a panel of female actresses including Viola Davis, played by Leslie Jones, Marion Cotillard, played by Cecily Strong and Kate McKinnon’s fictional character Debette Goldry. Naturally, the segment was rife with jokes about Weinstein. However, the jokes come a week after the show could have initially made jokes about the scandal, prompting many, including Donald Trump Jr., to ask, “Why?”

Trump last month excoriated the North Korean regime during his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, saying of dictator Kim Jong Un, “Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.""

Trump added North Korea’s “reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.” North Korea continues to defy the U.N. with prohibited nuclear and missile tests.

North Korean military images and propaganda are common in the South, Reuters reported. The Hermit Kingdom has repeatedly demanded the U.S. cease preparations for an invasion it believes is coming and also has the ultimate goal of reunifying the Korean peninsula under one government -- Kim Jong Un's.

“I do think it is a problem that men use sexually violent language when women [don't] abide,” she wrote. “I mainly get concerned for the women that [have] to be around these men, because having that kind of abusive language coming from somebody that you know or are physically around you is very painful and damaging.”

Adidas originally posted the ad featuring Byström to their Instagram page, praising the model and artist for her photography, “which questions femininity and gender standards using so-called ‘girly’ aesthetics.”

While many people were praised the photo, defending Byström’s choice to not shave her legs, others were quick to judge, leaving comments like “I’m attracted to girls not monkeys,” and “hairy legs = gross.”

The ""sacred"" flame from Tokyo's 1964 Olympics was meant to burn forever... but an embarrassed official has revealed that it actually went out four years ago.

Before the 1964 Games, the flame, lit in Olympia, Greece, wound its way through 10 countries before landing in Okinawa.

It was then divided and sent to the cities of Kagoshima, Miyazaki and Chitose.

The flame in Kagoshima was kept in a a sports training facility where it remained without incident for many years.

But the flame found its way back into the spotlight in September 2013, when Japan's capital was awarded the right to host the 2020 Games.

An official, who - perhaps understandably - asked to remain anonymous, has admitted to AFP news agency that the flame actually went out a few months later, in November 2013.

""At that time, I could not say something that could destroy (people's) dreams,"" said the man, who had been in charge of the facility at the time.

""I saw with my own eyes that the flame went out on 21 November,"" he said. ""We re-lit the fire and kept it going for about two weeks but I thought that was not good.""

This was only a few months after Japan had won the right to host the 2020 Games, and the flame's fame was at its peak.

""We kept receiving a number of requests from various people to use the sacred flame for town festivals and weddings,"" he said. ""I decided to come clean.""

And it appears the same may be true for Weinstein’s donations to The Clinton Foundation.","Harvey Weinstein is no stranger to sex scandals – back when Bill Clinton was battling allegations he lied about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, Weinstein had the president’s back, and a hefty check in hand.

A recently uncovered 1998 story in The Washington Post lists the powerful producer – now accused of sexual harassment and assault by numerous women – among several Hollywood heavyweights who gave the maximum $10,000 to Clinton’s legal defense fund.

The detail gives a fuller picture of the longstanding financial relationship between the former first family and one of their best West Coast fundraisers. That relationship has been under the microscope after Hillary Clinton came under criticism for waiting five days to condemn Weinstein.

In eventually saying she was “shocked and appalled” by the allegations against the producer, Clinton said in a CNN interview that she would donate Weinstein’s political contributions to charity, as other Democratic beneficiaries have done. Weinstein’s contributions to her various campaigns, as well as a political committee she used to support other Democrats and a joint fund with the DNC in 2016, total more than $46,000.

Hillary Clinton, though, moved to shift the focus during a BBC interview that aired Friday, bringing up allegations against President Trump – a move that inadvertently brought up her husband’s past.

WEINSTEIN TIES TO CLINTON, OBAMA RUN DEEP

“This kind of behavior cannot be tolerated anywhere, whether it's in entertainment, politics,” Clinton said. “After all, we have someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office.”

The BBC's Andrew Marr responded by pointing out that Clinton has dismissed allegations made by women against her husband.

“That has all been litigated,” Clinton replied. “That was subject of a huge investigation in the late '90s and there were conclusions drawn. That was clearly in the past.”

Clinton, in her accusation against Trump, was referring to the infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape of Trump in 2005 in which he said he can “do anything” to women as a star, including grabbing “them by the p----.” Trump later apologized for his comments and called it “locker room talk” but has never admitted to sexual assault.

REPORT: CLINTON FOUNDATION TO KEEP WEINSTEIN DONATION

Meanwhile, the litigation Clinton referenced led to a big out-of-court settlement: $850,000 to Paula Jones, who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment.

The money Weinstein donated to the related legal defense fund is long gone. And it appears the same may be true for Weinstein’s donations to The Clinton Foundation.

The Daily Mail reported the foundation will not return as much as $250,000 in donations from the disgraced movie mogul.

The move to keep the money was expected following tweets from the foundation’s spokesman Craig Minassian.

Pots and pans sure look gleaming and gorgeous coming out of the box, but after years of spaghetti dinners, roast chickens and holiday feasts, a well-used cookware arsenal is bound to show its age. Make your sauté pans, stockpots and skillets worthy of the hanging pot rack once again with a little elbow grease and a couple of easy-to-find, mild cleaning products (including ketchup, of all things) — and learn how keep the glow once you've got it back.

Below you'll find daily care and stain removal tips for cookware made of stainless steel, copper, enameled cast iron and more.

Good practices for all cookware. No matter the type of cookware, it is best to wash it as soon as possible after cooking (cleaning as you go is ideal), and use the least abrasive cleaning method you can. Washing by hand is always preferable, even for pots and pans that claim to be dishwasher safe. Washing by hand will prevent the scratches and discoloration that can happen in a dishwasher over time.

The tips and techniques that follow are good general guidelines, but you may also want to check the manufacturer's suggestions. If your cookware is under warranty, using the wrong cleaning product can void your agreement, so it pays to do your homework.

Stainless Steel

Everyday care: Ideally, wash your stainless steel pots and pans by hand soon after use, using regular dish soap. That said, stainless steel pans are one of the few types that can handle a trip through the dishwasher — so if you are in a rush, don't worry about tossing it in with the dishes. Regular cleaning in the dishwasher may create spots or a cloudy surface.

Stain removal: To brighten up cloudy or spotty stainless steel, rub the surface with a rag dampened with white vinegar. To treat stains on the bottom of the pan caused by high heat, sprinkle a gentle scouring powder (like Barkeeper's Friend) on a wet sponge or rag to create a paste, and rub it onto the stained area. Rinse with water.

Copper

Everyday care: Wash copper pots and pans by hand, using warm, soapy water.

Stain removal: Bring that lustrous finish back to discolored copper by covering your pan with ketchup (yes, ketchup) or lemon. Let the ketchup sit on your pan for at least 10 minutes, then rub the discoloration away with a rag or sponge. Rinse clean with warm water.

Enameled Cast Iron

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool before washing it — a sudden temperature change may crack the enamel. Soak the pan in warm water first, then use a soft sponge and a mild dishwashing detergent to clean it. Do not use abrasive scrubbing pads, as they can damage the enamel finish.

Stain removal: Treat discoloration on the outside of the pan using a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. For tough stains on the inside surface, fill the pan with white vinegar and water and bring to a boil on the stovetop. Turn off the heat and let the pan soak with the vinegar solution, then wash as usual.

Hard Anodized Aluminum

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool completely before washing it, and never place a hot pan in cold water, which can cause warping. Wash by hand, using a mild dishwashing detergent and warm water — putting your hard anodized pans in the dishwasher may void your warranty.

Stain removal: For stains on the outside only, use a paste of baking soda or a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. Rinse with warm water.

Nonstick

Everyday care: Use low to medium heat only — higher temperatures can permanently damage nonstick pans. Wash promptly with a soft sponge and warm, soapy water. If scratches or flakes begin to appear on the nonstick surface of your pan, recycle or toss it immediately. Otherwise those flakes will end up in your food ... not something you want to happen!

Stain removal: On the outside only, try using a paste of Barkeeper's Friend or a similar scouring powder.

Cast Iron

Initial seasoning: When you buy a new cast iron pan, wash it by hand in warm, soapy water. Dry the pan with a towel, then put it in a 300-degree oven for about five minutes to dry it completely — even a bit of remaining moisture can cause rust to form on cast iron pans. Next, using a paper towel, rub about a tablespoon of olive or vegetable oil over the surface of the pan, inside and out. Wipe away excess oil — you are aiming for a thin coat. Put the pan in a 300-degree oven for an hour, let it cool, then rub it all over with a clean rag.

Everyday care: Never use soap on your cast iron pan. Promptly after each use, wipe out the pan using a paper towel and a bit of oil. If food is stuck on, run the pan under hot water and scrub the food off with a soft brush or plastic scouring pad — remember, no soap! Soap will remove the seasoning, which is what creates that wonderful nonstick surface.

Stain removal and long-term care: For really tough, stuck-on food, boil water in your pan on the stovetop for a few minutes, then clean it as usual. Reseasoning occasionally will help maintain the finish.

Clay Pot

Everyday care: Most clay pots must be soaked in water for 15 to 30 minutes before each use. Always place your clay pot in a cold oven so the pot can come up to temperature gradually. Do not use your clay pot on the stovetop or under a broiler, and never put a hot pot on a cold surface — any sudden temperature changes can break it.

Clean it promptly, using a paste of baking soda; rinse with warm water. Soap is not recommended for unglazed clay pots, though you may be able to use a mild soap on clay pots that have been glazed; check with the manufacturer.

Stain removal: Try leaving a paste of baking soda on the discolored area for at least 10 minutes, then wipe away and rinse with water. Do not use abrasive sponges or harsh cleaning products on a clay pot.",Essential cleaning tips for the 7 most popular cookware materials,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/essential-cleaning-tips-for-7-most-popular-cookware-materials.html

Mattis made the announcement Friday in regard to the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest, or MAVNI, program, which was halted last year when the Pentagon assessed it did not have proper safeguards in place against potential insider threats, the Military Times reported.

“We are taking the steps obviously to save the program, if it can be saved,” Mattis told reporters Friday. “If it can, you do due diligence for it to make sure what you are bringing in is what you think you are bringing in.”

Since 2009, more than 10,000 recruits have entered the military through the MAVNI program, the paper reported.

Supporters of the MAVNI program says it allows the military to recruit legal immigrants with vital skills such as foreign language proficiency, the Times reported. Critics said the program lacked adequate screening that left the military vulnerable.

“We could not continue what we’d been doing without an espionage potential,” Mattis said, according to the paper.

PENTAGON INVESTIGATORS FIND ‘SECURITY RISKS’ IN GOVERNMENT'S IMMIGRANT RECRUITMENT PROGRAM, ‘INFILTRATION’ FEARED

Defense Department investigators discovered “potential security risks” in the MAVNI program after a year-long investigation, Fox News reported exclusively in August.

Sources told Fox News that MAVNI’s problems included a vetting backlog that led to enrollment of many soldiers prior to completion of their background checks, and an attendant “drift” in the program’s criteria, with MAVNI being used as a vehicle for the hiring of workers – like cooks, drivers and mechanics – who did not possess the specialized skills the program was created to exploit.

Effective immediately, recruits will have to complete the background check before being shipped to basic training.

Mattis’ announcement is the first clear sign the Pentagon has backed away from internal recommendations to kill the MAVNI program and scuttle the contracts of those waiting to serve, The Washington Post reported.

Not much is happening in Washington these days. Just more of the same as President Trump continues to change or scrap the policies of the previous president and the media responds by insisting each time that the sky is falling.

This is hardly the first case of increasing sensitivity at schools. For instance, last year a district in Virginia removed classroom copies of “Mockingbird” as well as Mark Twain’s “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” when a parent complained.

Indeed, both “Huck Finn” and “Mockingbird” are among the most frequently challenged books in school curricula over the last decade or so. This is largely because both books use racial slurs.

The argument of those in favor of banning such titles is that to allow them validates these ugly words. But that’s both a misunderstanding of the books, and of how literature works.

Encountering how other people think can be a shock to the system, but it’s a helpful one. And if it may temporarily make some students feel uncomfortable, in the long term it empowers them.

Yes, both books do use hateful language, but in the service of a humane message. They have enough depth that their meaning can’t be summed up in a pat sentence or two, but they certainly aren’t racist works, and expose the hypocrisy behind bigotry.

They’re also powerful works, and entertaining enough that they’ve encouraged a lifelong love of reading in countless students.

Literature, at its best, can take you outside yourself. It allows you to experience things through the eyes of a person of a different age, a different gender, a different culture.

The people who run our educational system regularly talk about the value of diversity. Well this is diversity in its purest form. Every book lets you enter into a different world, and learn to see things from a different angle.

True, encountering how other people think can be a shock to the system, but it’s a helpful one. And if it may temporarily make some students feel uncomfortable, in the long term it empowers them.

First, it gives them useful historical information—this is how people spoke and acted in the past. But it leads to more than that. It leads to questions about why things were that way, how they’ve changed, and if they might change again before too long.

Meanwhile, banning the books not only takes away some great literature from students, but teaches them the wrong lesson. To fear mere words. They’ll be facing the real world soon enough. If they’re armed with the knowledge they can deal with painful or offensive concepts, they’ll be that much stronger.

By the way, the students don’t even need to agree with the books they read. In essays, or classroom discussion, they can explain how Harper Lee or Mark Twain got it wrong, or missed something. Reading is not a passive activity—it’s all part of a give-and-take the author, the reader and others engage in.

So books like “Mockingbird” and “Huck Finn,” if taught with sensitivity, open up dialogue about topics that mean something to students. And will continue meaning something to them as adults.

SEE THE NYC TOWNHOUSE WHERE OBAMA LIVED AFTER COLLEGE

The building has been the site of two very high-profile suicides in the last 30 years, which is enough to make even a New York City real-estate agent think twice about living there.

“I don’t know of any buildings with two suicides,” said Dolly Lenz, CEO of Dolly Lenz Real Estate, in a statement to the New York Post. “It almost says that there is a cloud on the building.”

The first victim of these tragedies was Carter Cooper, the 23-year-old son of Gloria Vanderbilt and the older brother of CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. According to reports, Carter was acting strangely in the months leading up to his suicide, but had been in therapy. Then, on July 22, 1988, during a visit to his mother’s home, he abruptly ran out onto the terrace of his Vanderbilt’s two-story penthouse apartment, hopped over the ledge, and dangled there before letting himself drop from the 14th floor — all while Vanderbilt watched from feet away.

""He let go, and there was a moment when I thought I was going to jump over after him,” Vanderbilt remembered during a 2011 appearance of Anderson Cooper’s talk series.

In Vanderbilt’s 1997 book, “A Mother’s Story,” she also alleged that Carter’s suicide may have triggered by an allergy to medication.

The second, much more recent suicide at 10 Grace Square took place in April 2017, and claimed the life of author, heiress and socialite Jean Stein. Stein, whose works include “Edie: An American Girl” and “West of Eden,” had reportedly been suffering from depression, according to her daughter Katrina vanden Heuvel, and jumped from the 15th floor of the building on April 30, the New York Times reported in its obituary.

A fellow resident who witnessed the suicide has said it was a messy one, as Stein “miscalculated” the jump and landed an eighth-floor terrace. She had also severed her leg in the fall, according to reports.

10 Gracie Square, however, is also infamous for more than these two suicides: In 1982, it was also where sixth-floor resident Frances Schreuder was arrested for conspiring with her son Marco to kill Schreuder’s father, wealthy Utah businessman Franklin Bradshaw.

Schreuder had reportedly been unhappy with the amount of money Bradshaw was allotting her, and persuaded her then-17-year-old son to shoot his grandfather dead in 1978. He was eventually caught, and Schreuder was nabbed while trying to escape out the window of her 10 Gracie Square abode.

Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, 31, will reportedly plead guilty and sentencing will begin Oct. 23, according to the Associated Press. During sentencing, U.S. troops who were seriously wounded while searching for Bergdahl are expected to testify.

Bergdahl’s story has left the nation debating for eight years about whether he is a hero or traitor, and the importance of the long held American commitment not to leave troops behind. Former President Barack Obama defended swapping prisoners at Guantanamo Bay for Bergdahl’s release in 2014 while President Donald Trump said Bergdahl should “face the death penalty.”

Read on for more about what Bergdahl did and the greater controversy.

Why is Bergdahl on trial?

Then 23, Bergdahl went missing from his remote infantry post near the Pakistan border in June 2009. His disappearance launched a massive search operation.

Bergdahl was quickly captured by the Taliban after leaving his post. The U.S. tracked him for several years before successfully negotiating his release in 2014. The U.S. does not ""leave our men or women in uniform behind,"" Obama said then, regardless of how Bergdahl came to be captured.

BERGDAHL BEARS SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR RISKY MISSIONS TO FIND HIM, JUDGE SAYS

Bergdahl has said that he left his post and intended to alert people about problems he perceived within his unit. Investigators said Bergdahl suffered from schizotypal personality disorder when he left his post.

The Army charged him with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy in 2015.

What could happen?

Bergdahl could face up to five years in prison on the desertion charge. But he could also be sentenced to life in prison for the misbehavior charge.

It’s unclear if prosecutors and the defense reached some sort of agreement ahead of sentencing about Bergdahl’s fate. Bergdahl’s lawyer declined to comment when contacted by Fox News.

What has Trump said?

Trump has been a vocal critic of Bergdahl and the Obama administration’s decision to exchange five prisoners in Guantanamo Bay for his release in May 2014.

BERGDAHL HAD PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER WHEN HE LEFT POST, DOCUMENTS SAY

""We're tired of Sgt. Bergdahl, who's a traitor, a no-good traitor, who should have been executed,"" Trump said at a Las Vegas rally in 2015.

On Twitter, Trump has also said Bergdahl should face the death penalty and repeatedly referred to him as a “traitor.”

Is there anything else to know about the case?

Bergdahl elected to be tried by a judge, not a panel of military officers, in August.

Defense attorneys had attempted to get the case thrown out because of Trump’s ardent and harsh criticism of the soldier. But the judge, Army Col. Jeffrey R. Nance, rejected the request.

This weekend the ""Groundhog Day""-like horror pic ""Happy Death Day"" scored a first-place finish, surpassing expectations and blowing the much costlier and star-driven ""Blade Runner 2049"" out of the water.

Studio estimates Sunday show ""Happy Death Day"" took in $26.5 million from 3,149 North American theaters. With a $5 million production price tag, ""Happy Death Day"" is already a hit.

With a PG-13 rating, the film scored big with younger audiences — 63 percent were under 25.

It's the latest success story from Blumhouse Productions, which earlier this year released ""Split"" and ""Get Out,"" with the help of Universal Pictures, which distributed.

Jim Orr, executive vice president of domestic distribution for Universal, said ""Happy Death Day"" is an original film that's reimaging the genre.

""It's as much thriller as it is horror film. It's scary, it's funny, and it has an extraordinarily clever script that is very well executed,"" Orr said. ""Blumhouse owns this space no doubt about it, and they do this better than anybody consistently.""

The film also had the benefit of coming on the heels of the massive success of ""It,"" which has earned $314.9 million domestically to date. The ""Happy Death Day"" trailer played in front of ""It"" at theaters, which ""exponentially increased"" audience awareness, said comScore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian.

Horror continues to be one of the bright spots during a roller-coaster year at the box office.

""This is a horror gold rush at the theaters,"" Dergarabedian said. ""It's been perhaps the most consistently positive story this year.""

One film that does not look destined for a happy ending is ""Blade Runner 2049,"" which fell 54 percent in its second weekend in theaters, adding $15.1 million to bring its domestic total to $60.6 million.

The film was a costly endeavor with a production price tag north of $150 million and was well-reviewed by critics. But it couldn't manage to draw in significant audiences beyond the fans of the 1982 original, which was also a flop upon release.

Jackie Chan's ""The Foreigner"" debuted in third place with $12.8 million from 2,515 screens, while ""It"" landed in fourth place in its sixth weekend in theaters.

The Kate Winslet and Idris Elba disaster pic ""The Mountain Between Us"" rounded out the top five with $5.7 million.

Other new releases landed outside the top 10. The Thurgood Marshall biopic ""Marshall"" took in a promising $3 million from 821 theaters.

""Marshall is off to a solid start,"" said Open Road Films CEO Tom Ortenberg in a statement. ""We expect Marshall to hold very well and run well into the fall.""

But the Wonder Woman creator biopic ""Professor Marston and the Wonder Woman"" failed to capitalize from the massive success of ""Wonder Woman"" earlier this year. The film earned only $737,000 from over 1,200 locations.

""Goodbye Christopher Robin,"" about author A.A. Milne and the creation of the beloved children's books and characters, also got off to a poor start with $56,000 from nine theaters.

""October is off to a slow start,"" Dergarabedian said.

Lockwood tried to get her company’s promotional materials printed at Williams’ firm, but he refused, saying taking up the contract would “make pressure worse” for other Christians.

“The new model of diversity is used (or misused) to marginalize (or indeed discriminate against) Christians in their workplaces and other parts of society if they do not subscribe to it,” Williams wrote to the transgender diversity expert, explaining his decision to turn down the chance to work together.

He added: “Although I’m quite sure you have no intention of marginalizing Christians it would weigh heavily upon me if through my own work I was to make pressure worse for fellow Christians.”

Lockwood, who is a trans woman since January, claims she was “gobsmacked” by the refusal to perform services, telling the Times: “I was not expecting a lecture. I disbelieved this could happen in 2017. I have been distraught and cried and my wife consoled me.”

“This kind of behavior cannot be tolerated anywhere, whether it's in entertainment, politics,” Clinton said. “After all, we have someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office.”

Marr responded by pointing out Clinton has dismissed allegations made by women against her husband, former President Bill Clinton, that Trump highlighted during the hard-fought presidential campaign.

“That has all been litigated,” Clinton replied. “That was subject of a huge investigation in the late '90s and there were conclusions drawn. That was clearly in the past.”

CLINTONS NOT SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER AFTER FIGHT, AUTHOR SAYS

Clinton, in her accusation against Trump, was referring to the infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape of Trump in 2005 in which he said he can “do anything” to women as a star, including grabbing “them by the p----.” Trump later apologized for his comments and called it “locker room talk” but has never admitted to sexual assault.

After the video surfaced in October 2016, Trump held a press conference with Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and Juanita Broaddrick, who had all accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct in the past.

In the latest interview, Clinton expressed disappointment the ""Access Hollywood"" tape didn’t sink Trump in the campaign.

“The really sad part of the campaign was how this horrific tape, what he said about women in the past, what he said about women during the campaign, was discounted by a lot of voters,” she said.

Clinton, who is on a tour promoting her memoir about the campaign, also said she was “really shocked and appalled” at the recent revelations about Weinstein.

“He's been a supporter -- he's been a funder for all of us, for Obama, for me, for people who have run for office in the United States,” she said. “So it was just disgusting and the stories that have come out are heartbreaking. And I really commend the women who have been willing to step forward now and tell their stories.”

Weinstein has raised thousands for the Clintons.

A White House spokesman did not return a request for comment.

But earlier this week, White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway called Clinton a ""hypocrite"" on women's issues.

“She needs to not be a hypocrite about women’s empowerment and what it means to be pro-woman,” Conway told Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.” “She is on a book tour talking about herself and a campaign she lost—not talking about women’s empowerment, she’s not trying to help victims of sexual assault.”

Conway also blasted Clinton for taking five days to release a statement condemning Weinstein: ""I felt like a woman who ran to be commander-in-chief and president of the United States, who talks about women’s empowerment, took an awfully long time to give support to these women.""","Hillary Clinton calls Trump 'sexual assaulter' in BBC interview, but says Bill's behavior 'in the past'",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/13/hillary-clinton-calls-trump-sexual-assaulter-in-bbc-interview-but-says-bills-behavior-in-past.html

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote.

Arnold went to investigate the noise and saw someone trying to pull cash out of the register.

“I stepped out and looked and there he was pulling the register out and everything so I just took off, my instinct kicked in and I took off full speed at him,” he said.

Arnold, who was hit in the face with crowbar during the altercation, said the robber was pleading with him during the struggle.

“He tries to start apologizing and, ‘man I’m so sorry. I know I hit you,” he told WFAA. “I know I'm trying to steal your money, but just give it to me. I need it really bad’ and everything like that.”

Though Arnold didn’t let the man get away, he was sympathetic to the robber.

“Two weeks ago, I wasn't working,” Arnold told NBC affiliate KABB. “I was homeless.”

The 22-year-old had just returned to work at IHOP, where he worked four years earlier before getting addicted to drugs and continuing in a downward spiral, NY Daily News reports.

“That was my money in the register,” Arnold said. “It was my manager's money in the register. And it was my IHOP’s money in the register. And I'm not going to let anybody take that.”

During my years of painting people’s homes, I’ve learned that small spaces don’t have to be boring or go unnoticed. All it takes is a little paint. By adding paint in strategic places around the home, you can easily and inexpensively transform a space. Plus, there is a good chance you could accomplish at least one of these eight painting projects during the course of one weekend.

Here are eight spaces to consider painting and my tips and tricks on making even the smallest places have a big impact.

1. Entryway. When a guest arrives, their first impression is based on your home’s exterior and the front door. Realtors call this curb appeal. But the very next thing guests will notice is the area right inside your front door, so you should use it to make a statement.

If your home has a formal entry, choose a paint color that is one to two shades darker than the next room. A darker paint color in the entryway can make the space feel more inviting, like a warm hug.

If your home has an open floor plan without a defined entryway, use paint to create one. Try a bold color on the wall surrounding the front door and an adjacent wall as visual borders for the entry.

2. Hall bath. Small bathrooms might appear to be limited when it comes to design, but they can easily be transformed with a quick paint color update.

How do you pick a color for this small bathroom? Look around your home for spots of color that crop up in your art or drapes. For example, a living room that is mostly beige with blue accent pieces would coordinate well with a bathroom painted in that same shade of blue.

RELATED: What Color Works Best in a Traditional-Style Bathroom?

Dark colors also have been trending with homeowners I’ve worked with lately. To offset the dark nature of the paint, we typically recommend keeping the other design details, such as the floors and sink, light to make sure the room still feels open and bright.

Worried one color will overwhelm the small space? Consider installing a chair rail as a natural divider. Then paint the lower portion of the wall in a statement color while leaving the wall area above a neutral tone.

3. Bookshelf. Whether the bookshelves in your home are built-in or freestanding, you can easily create style with paint. Remove the shelves from the surround and paint the back wall of the case. Don’t be afraid to go bold with your paint color, because once the shelves and objects on the shelves are in place, your color choice will seem more subtle. You will get an instant pop of color without being too in-your-face.

4. Closet. This space is often overlooked when it comes to paint, but a fresh coat of paint on the walls and shelving in your closet can go a long way. With a small- or medium-sized closet, keep your paint color choice bright and light.

With a large walk-in closet, consider using a paint color that complements the attached room.

For shelving, use an oil-based paint for durability against scratches and scuffs.

5. Hallway. Hallways are typically long and narrow and, depending on the lighting, can also be dark. When choosing a paint color for the hallway, consider the paint colors in connecting rooms and then go one to two shades lighter. The colors will complement each other and coordinate the home’s overall design. Plus, a lighter shade will brighten up the passageway.

6. Accent wall. If you have a small amount of paint and want to make the biggest impact on your home’s design, then an accent wall is your best bet. Choose a wall in your living room or master bedroom that you want to highlight, such as the area behind the sofa or bed.

Once it is painted, hang coordinating artwork on the accent wall to finish the design.

7. Kitchen nooks and crannies. Typically, I find there isn’t too much paintable space in the kitchen. But when I do find it, it’s between the cabinets, appliances and backsplash.

When space is limited, I always encourage owners to go bold and use colors that offset the room’s features. For example, in a kitchen with white cabinets and natural stone countertops, pick a hunter green or dark blue. In large quantities, these dark shades might feel overwhelming, but in small quantities, they give the room a strong dimension.

8. Laundry room. You can’t avoid the task of laundry, so at least make it a room that is easy on the eyes and generates positivity. Think of a paint color you would never dream of using in the social areas of your home but would make you happy, such as a playful orange, a bold purple or a sunshine yellow. Who knows, being around your favorite color might even make the chore a little more enjoyable.",Transform a whole house by painting these 8 small spaces,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/22/transform-whole-house-by-painting-these-8-small-spaces.html

This past week, Bob Corker, a sitting U.S. Senator, called the White House a home for an addled geriatric, and accused the president of castrating Rex Tillerson, his Secretary of State. Meanwhile, Steve Bannon, Trump’s campaign guru and former senior White House advisor, bet against Trump finishing out his first term, as the head of Breitbart fixed his gaze on the Twenty Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Over in the realm of policy, Trump declared war on ObamaCare, the Iran Deal, the First Amendment and UNESCO. As long as Trump occupies 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, don’t expect this tumultuous cacophony to disappear. It is America’s new normal.

Enter “One Nation After Trump: A Guide for the Perplexed, the Disillusioned, the Desperate, and the Not-Yet Deported,” a 352-page prayer and how-to book, written by three members of the D.C. establishment, E.J. Dionne of the Washington Post, Norman Ornstein of the Brookings Institute, and Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institute. “One Nation After Trump” offers a sincere and detailed blueprint for a neo-liberal restoration. And that is its problem. The book fails to adequately internalize the rage that in 2016 overturned America’s post-Reagan status quo. Beyond that, the authors seemingly fail to recognize that politics is transactional, and lack a message and offering powerful enough to lure Obama-Trump voters back to the Democratic column. Most of all, there is an empathy shortage for those who find themselves outside of the Democrats’ current upstairs-downstairs coalition.

As Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and former advisor to President Bill Clinton, trenchantly framed things, “If the life expectancy of, say, Somali immigrants in Minnesota suddenly took a dive, Democrats would be falling all over each other trying to ascertain the causes and advocate the cures. We owe white working-class Americans no less.”

The book fails to adequately internalize the rage that in 2016 overturned America’s post-Reagan status quo.

Yet, “One Nation” does not come close, even as it awkwardly tries. The book contains a detailed discussion of America’s changing demographics, its historic high levels of immigration, and the resulting friction and resentment. A significant portion of Trump voters feels like strangers in their house, and “One Nation” does not satisfactorily address that disconnect. Rather, its authors seems intent on pushing ahead with a prescription of open borders and multiculturalism, the same recipe that made Trump a reality. This approach may sound like sweet music to the chattering class, but is unlikely to impress those voters who cast a ballot for Barack Obama in 2008 or 2012 and then for Donald Trump a year ago.

The glaring realities are also that at the end of the day 700,000 white employees lost their jobs as the result of the Great Recession, that white life expectancy outside the reach of high-end America has declined, and that with the exceptions of Maine and Vermont military service is the domain of Red America. As Andrew Sullivan observed in New York Magazine, in recent years the number of deaths attributable to drug overdoses exceeds the annual death rate from AIDS. However, no one is wearing ribbons. The powder that exploded last November was all around.

At the same time, polling from Gallup had reflected a pre-election groundswell in Americans’ self-identification as working class. At the turn of the century, only one-third of Americans identified themselves as such. Yet by 2015, the figure had risen to nearly one-half. Fortunately, the number of Americans who see themselves as working class has since receded to pre-recession levels, with only 36 percent calling themselves working class as of June 2017. As the scholar, Barrington Moore Jr., said, “No bourgeoisie, no democracy.”

“One Nation” is on more solid ground in identifying the threat that the Trump presidency represents to American norms and institutions. Hardly a day goes by without Trump taking aim at both. An independent judiciary, a functioning diplomatic corps, and a free press have all been Trump targets. Yet, Trump’s core supporters are either undisturbed or are actively rooting for their guy. Clearly, “modern” presidential has more than a few followers.

Against this backdrop, it looks like Dionne, Ornstein, and Mann, “One Nation’s” authors, have a lot of persuading to do. Whether they are simply preaching to the choir, or leave a real mark remains to be seen.

They noticed that one of the scouts seated in front of them was coughing throughout the flight, the report said.
The fluid in her joints tested positive for N. meningitidis bacteria, which means she had a blood infection with N. meningitidis that spread to her joints.
Samples taken from the husband's nose and throat also tested positive for N. meningitidis, although he did not develop further symptoms.
Both the woman and her husband were infected with the same strain of N. meningitidis that caused the outbreak in the scouts, the report said.","In a rare case, a woman contracted a potentially deadly bacterial infection while on a 12-hour flight from Japan to Germany, according to a new report.

Called meningococcal disease, this bacterial infection is generally transmitted only through close contact, for example, by kissing or living in close quarters with someone who is sick, according to the World Health Organization. The new report is only the third case ever reported of this disease being transmitted on an airplane, said Yushi Hachisu, of the Chiba Prefectural Institute of Public Health in Chiba, Japan, who helped investigate the case.

Hachisu presented the case on Oct. 5 at IDWeek, an infectious disease conference in San Diego.

Meningococcal disease is caused by the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis. About 10 percent of the population carries this bacteria in their nose and throat without showing any symptoms of disease. But the bacteria can cause serious illness if it gets into the blood or the brain. In the brain, the bacteria can cause meningitis — a swelling of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord; in the blood, it can cause and infection called septicemia.

The woman and her husband, both in their 50s, were traveling from Japan to Germany on Aug. 8, 2015, according to the report. They happened to be on the same flight as a team of Scottish and Swedish scouts who were returning from the World Scout Jamboree, an international gathering of scouts ages 14 to 17. Six of the scouts later developed meningococcal disease in an outbreak that was linked to attendance at the jamboree.

The married couple did not sit directly next to the scouts, but sat in a row behind and across the aisle from the Scottish scouts. They noticed that one of the scouts seated in front of them was coughing throughout the flight, the report said.

Once they arrived in Germany, the couple hopped on another flight to Spain, where they went sightseeing. But a few days later, on Aug. 11, the woman felt tired and developed pain in her throat and a cough. Her husband also developed pain in his throat and a mild fever.

They felt sick for the rest of their trip, but felt somewhat better upon their return to Japan on Aug. 16, the report said. However, on Sept. 19, the woman developed a sudden high fever and chills, as well as pain in her joints. She visited four health care facilities and underwent tests before she was finally hospitalized on Sept. 25.

The fluid in her joints tested positive for N. meningitidis bacteria, which means she had a blood infection with N. meningitidis that spread to her joints. Samples taken from the husband's nose and throat also tested positive for N. meningitidis, although he did not develop further symptoms. Both the woman and her husband were infected with the same strain of N. meningitidis that caused the outbreak in the scouts, the report said. The woman was treated with antibiotics and recovered.

Meningococcal disease is rare in Japan, with only about three cases per 10 million people, the researchers said.

The new report ""strongly suggests that N. meningitidis was transmitted from the Scottish scouts to the Japanese couple during their international flight,"" the researchers wrote in their report.

Still, the overall risk of transmitting meningococcal disease on an airplane is low, Hachisu said. But it can happen — in 2005, officials in Australia reported cases of two people who got sick with N. meningitidis after traveling on a flight from Los Angeles to Sydney. Officials determined it was likely that one of the infected passengers spread the bacteria to the other passenger, or both of the infected individuals got the bacteria from another person on the flight who wasn't showing symptoms.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that passengers who sit next to someone with N. meningitidis on a flight that is more than 8 hours long receive preventive antibiotics. A longer flight increases the chance of transmission, Hachisu said.

With his pugnacious speech Friday, Trump has bought the nuclear deal, and the pragmatists in Iran who negotiated it, some time.","It could have been worse. You could almost hear the collective sigh of relief from America's allied capitals when President Donald Trump announced that he was kicking the Iran nuclear deal over to Congress to fix.

True to his campaign pledge, President Trump refused to certify to Congress that Iran has been complying with what he called the ""worst"" arms control deal the U.S. ever negotiated.

He also asked Congress to impose sanctions on Iran for its continued ballistic missile tests, its aggressive conduct in the region, its support for Syrian president Bashar al Assad, its support for terror and other efforts to destabilize the Middle East, and its human rights abuses.

He also added additional sanctions on members of the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Ayatollah's shock troops.

Trump has bought the nuclear deal, and the pragmatists in Iran who negotiated it, some time.

Finally, he threatened to tear up the Iran nuclear deal if Congress and America's allies don't correct what he considers its unacceptable weaknesses. That's called leverage.

But he didn't shred the deal. He didn't unilaterally withdraw. ""What's done is done,"" Mr. Trump said, after denouncing the deal's many failings.

Many of the nuclear agreement's most ardent supporters -- including America's European allies and even the most rational members of his own cabinet -- feared he might not listen to reason.

They worried that while struggling to contain North Korea, a rogue state that actually has nuclear weapons and has vowed to develop long-range missiles capable of striking San Francisco, Trump would open a second nuclear front by abandoning the nuclear pact his despised predecessor, Barack Obama, so painstakingly negotiated.

But despite his dire threats and bellicose rhetoric, the president listened to the adults in the room, among them, Defense Secretary Mattis, who recently told Congress that the deal was in the nation's security interests.

He accepted political reality -- that there would be no chance of a united front against Iran, as Michael Singh, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, argued, unless Mr. Trump decided to try to strengthen the deal while remaining in it. ""This puts policy towards Iran on a much more solid footing,"" he said in an interview.

After weeks of discussions, Trump came to understand that the case for unilateral withdrawal was weak. While Trump officials have argued that Iran is violating the agreement, eight reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors nuclear programs and this pact, confirmed that Iran was adhering to its terms.

The leaders of France, England and Germany all warned of the consequences of a unilateral withdrawal by asserting their determination to abide by it.

Even many of the ostensible weaknesses the president cited in his speech Friday were misleading. For instance, though he said that the deal limits Iran's nuclear programs for too short a time, Anthony Blinken, a former senior Obama official noted that under another treaty that Iran has signed and ratified, the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, Iran is permanently barred from developing an atomic bomb. And its acceptance of intrusive inspections lasts far longer than the nuclear deal.

With his pugnacious speech Friday, Trump has bought the nuclear deal, and the pragmatists in Iran who negotiated it, some time.

“All the money in the world can’t repay me for what I’ve been through,” he said. “It’s nice to be compensated, but nothing can repay me for the stress and anguish.”

An Education Department spokesman told the newspaper any uptick in payroll includes salary increases from a prior teacher's contract, in addition to other staff contracts.

The spokesman also pointed to increasing test scores and graduation rates as to proof the spending is working.

“We’ve invested in public school students, and we’re seeing results — free, full-day pre-K for every 4-year-old, record numbers of kids taking and passing AP exams and record-high graduation rates,” Will Mantell told the Daily News.","NYC school staff salaries up $555M, 'Occupy' teacher gets over $300G, report says",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/16/nyc-school-staff-salaries-up-555m-occupy-teacher-gets-over-300g-report-says.html

The Associated Press previously reported that he's expected to plead guilty to charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy.
Bergdahl, who's from Hailey, Idaho, previously chose to have his case heard by a judge alone, rather than a jury.
Serious wounds to service members who searched for Bergdahl are expected to play a role in his sentencing.
Bergdahl has been assigned to desk duty at a Texas Army base while his case unfolds.","Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is set to plead guilty Monday to charges he endangered comrades by walking away from his post in Afghanistan in 2009 -- the court case wrapping up just three years after a stunning Rose Garden spectacle in which former President Barack Obama, flanked by Bergdahl's parents, triumphantly announced the soldier's release from captivity.

Bergdahl was released in May 2014 after a highly-criticized deal in which five Taliban terrorists were set free. At the time, Obama administration officials said Bergdahl had ""served with honor and distinction.""

The U.S. Army said Bergdahl asked to enter his plea before the military judge at Fort Bragg. The Associated Press previously reported that he's expected to plead guilty to charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy.

It's not clear if Bergdahl, 31, has a deal with prosecutors to limit his punishment, or if he's simply pleading guilty in hopes of leniency from the judge, Army Col. Jeffery R. Nance. The misbehavior charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, while the desertion charge is punishable by up to five years.

Bergdahl's lawyers are expected to reveal in court Monday whether there's a plea agreement in place to cap his punishment, or if he's pleading guilty without such a deal in what's known colloquially as a ""naked plea."" In either scenario, his punishment won't be known until after the judge holds the sentencing hearing that's expected to start on Oct. 23. Bergdahl, who's from Hailey, Idaho, previously chose to have his case heard by a judge alone, rather than a jury.

BERGDAHL DECLARED JIHAD IN CAPTIVITY, DOCUMENTS SHOW

A naked plea would be a risky move, Eric Carpenter, an assistant law professor at Florida International University and a former Army defense attorney and prosecutor, told Task & Purpose.

“It can backfire,” Carpenter said. “If he doesn’t have a deal, they could go in there and enter this naked plea and come out with a life sentence.”

Guilty pleas would bring the highly politicized saga closer to an end eight years after Bergdahl's disappearance in Afghanistan set off search missions by scores of his fellow service members. President Obama was criticized by Republicans for the 2014 Taliban prisoner swap that brought Bergdahl home, while President Donald Trump harshly criticized Bergdahl on the campaign trail.

Serious wounds to service members who searched for Bergdahl are expected to play a role in his sentencing. While guilty pleas would allow him to avoid a trial, he'd still face a sentencing hearing in late October. Bergdahl's five years of captivity by the Taliban and its allies also will likely play a role in what punishment he receives.

At one point during his captivity, Bergdahl converted to Islam, fraternized openly with his captors and declared himself a ""mujahid,"" or warrior for Islam, Fox News reported in 2014, citing secret documents prepared on the basis of a purported eyewitness account.

The reports indicate that Bergdahl's relations with his Haqqani captors morphed over time, from periods of hostility, where he was treated very much like a hostage, to periods where, as one source told Fox News, ""he became much more of an accepted fellow"" than is popularly understood. He even reportedly was allowed to carry a gun at times.

The documents show that Bergdahl at one point escaped his captors for five days and was kept, upon his re-capture, in a metal cage, like an animal. In addition, the reports detail discussions of prisoner swaps and other attempts at a negotiated resolution to the case that appear to have commenced as early as the fall of 2009.

SEAL, SOLDIER INJURIES IN BERGDAHL HUNT TO BE FOCUS OF HEARING

Legal scholars have said that several pretrial rulings against the defense have given prosecutors leverage to pursue stiff punishment against Bergdahl, The Associated Press reported. Perhaps most significant was the judge's decision in June to allow evidence of serious wounds to service members who searched for Bergdahl at the sentencing phase. The judge ruled that a Navy SEAL and an Army National Guard sergeant wouldn't have wound up in separate firefights that left them wounded if they hadn't been searching for Bergdahl.

The defense also was rebuffed in an effort to prove President Donald Trump had unfairly swayed the case with scathing criticism of Bergdahl, including suggestions of harsh punishment. The judge wrote in a February ruling that Trump's campaign-trail comments were ""disturbing and disappointing"" but did not constitute unlawful command influence by the soon-to-be commander in chief.

“We may as well go back to kangaroo courts and lynch mobs that got what they wanted,” Bergdahl said to a British filmmaker in 2016 when asked about trials, according to an interview obtained by ABC News. “The people who want to hang me, you’re never going to convince those people.”

Defense attorneys have acknowledged that Bergdahl walked off his base without authorization. Bergdahl himself told a general during a preliminary investigation that he left intending to cause alarm and draw attention to what he saw as problems with his unit. He was soon captured.

But the defense team has argued that Bergdahl can't be held responsible for a long chain of events that included many decisions by others on how to conduct the searches.

Bergdahl has been assigned to desk duty at a Texas Army base while his case unfolds.

It is unusual for the Justice Department to involve its lawyers in a local case, signifying the importance of the case to Sessions.

Sessions has been criticized by civil rights advocates for rolling back protections for transgender people.

""This is just one example of the attorney general's commitment to enforcing the laws enacted by Congress and to protecting the civil rights of all individuals,"" said Devin O'Malley, a spokesman for the Justice Department, in a statement to the New York Times.

The Iowa case involves a 16-year-old student in Burlington, Kedarie Johnson, who was shot to death in March 2016. Family and friends told local newspapers that he was gay and identified as both male and female. The New York Times said Sessions assigned Christopher Perras, a Justice Department lawyer, as a county prosecutor in the case.

Sessions since becoming attorney general has said transgender people are not protected under federal law from discrimination in the workplace. He reversed an Obama administration policy encouraging schools to allow transgender students to use a bathroom according to the gender they identify with.

But he has also condemned hate crimes, the Times noted. He publicly supported a case brought in the final weeks of the Obama administration in which a Mississippi man was sentenced to 49 years in prison for killing a transgender woman, the first U.S. federal prosecution of a hate crime based on gender identity.

I had been invited there by my friend, Jwan Zhumbes, the Anglican bishop of Bukuru.
These are Christians whose churches, homes, families and friends have been bombed, burned, and persecuted for their faith in Jesus Christ.
Indeed, just last month, 20 Christians were slaughtered by the Fulani only a short drive from where I was staying.
That said, Nigerian Christians are remarkable.","“Don’t go. I swore I would never go back there,” came the voice of my friend Jay Smith on a trans-Atlantic Skype call. “I’ve been in over sixty countries. I’ve been all over Africa. I lived there, and I’ve never felt unsafe the way I did in that country. There is something especially terrifying about that place.”

“Good to know,” I replied. “Alan said that he goes there all the time. He said he even takes his children.”

Alan was a British politician who had recently attended one of my lectures in London. To hear him tell it, Nigeria was like Club Med.

“Alan?” Jay was incredulous. “Did Alan also tell you that when he goes he’s traveling with the British government and is accompanied by heavily armed guards? You? You’re going to have an entirely different experience.”

This was my introduction to Nigeria. Jay’s opinion was not acquired from Trip Advisor. He had been there more than once. During a 2008 visit, he spent nine hours hiding in the wheel well of a car while a mob went up and down a blocked highway looking for Westerners to victimize. Nigeria was, in his view, unique to the African experience. It wasn’t that terrible things didn’t happen in other countries; it was the sheer magnitude of them in Nigeria. Even other Africans are afraid of Nigeria and its well-earned terrifying reputation.

I had been invited there by my friend, Jwan Zhumbes, the Anglican bishop of Bukuru. Jwan and I had done our doctoral work together. He had asked me some years ago to come and teach the members of the diocese on issues of faith and culture. Jwan is shepherd to a diocese that has been attacked by the Boko Haram and another Islamic group, the Fulani Herdsmen Militia. He was, in my estimation, a great man doing a great work.

Now, months later, the mission was complete and it was time for me to leave the country. My time in Nigeria had been one of great blessing. The experience defies a simple description or even a simple narrative. These are Christians whose churches, homes, families and friends have been bombed, burned, and persecuted for their faith in Jesus Christ. Indeed, just last month, 20 Christians were slaughtered by the Fulani only a short drive from where I was staying. This is not uncommon. And yet, optimism prevails with them where self-pity and a spirit of defeat might rule a lesser people.

Packing-up for the journey ahead, I noticed Jwan at my door. He looked upset.

“What is wrong?” I asked.

“It took the housekeeper a long time to answer the door,” he began. “For a moment, I feared something had happened to my friend during the night.”

“I’m fine,” I reassured him. “I slept well.”

Jwan, ever pastoral, inspected the mosquito bite on my upper arm. “It does not look good. You are taking your malaria medication?”

“Yes.”

This interaction is a neat summary of the dangers of Nigeria—they come from both man and nature. To quote one Nigerian writer, “Unfortunately, much like traveling on our roads, life and living in Nigeria is becoming alarmingly cheap, brutal and unpredictable.”

And, oh, the roads. Jwan and his driver, Moses, were here to take me back to the airport. The journey from Abuja to Jos had been harrowing. Now it was time to do it again, but in reverse. A long, perilous drive, it is not for the faint of heart. Going to Nigeria? Gird your loins.

Moses, our driver for this real-life version of “The Fast and Furious,” is a sturdy, quiet fellow in his mid-twenties. Being a bit prone to car sickness on these brutal Nigerian roads, I had opted to drive or sit in the front passenger seat during much of my visit. But when we were about an hour out of Jos and at the front end of this long, lonely highway, Jwan ordered Moses to pull over.

“We must now move you to the backseat,” he explained to me. “We know not what evil lurks for you in the bush.”

This sentence, spoken as it was in Jwan’s James Earl Jones-like baritone and in an older, more sonorous British English that is extinct in all but former British colonies, had an ominous quality to it. I moved to the back where the windows were tinted. Jwan reclined my seat slightly to conceal me further. He then gave Moses a uniform like that of a traffic cop and told him to put it on.

“He will look official,” Jwan explained. “The checkpoint guards are less likely to give us trouble.”

Sketchy people are not unique to Nigeria. But Nigeria’s sketchy types tend to be heavily armed, and that makes things a bit dicey. Moses, who clearly liked wearing the uniform, pulled the Toyota Sequoia back onto the highway and took aim at the far horizon. The engine roared as he pushed the RPMs into the gauge’s red limits just as the driver had done when we traveled this road a week before. I have never seen a vehicle endure such punishment, and I have punished a lot of vehicles. It wasn’t merely that we were going fast, it was the duration of it, the pounding of the road, the constant hard braking and re-acceleration. Five and a half hours is a long time to push a vehicle, any vehicle, so hard. I feared the engine might blow or …

“What happens if we blow-out a tire?” I asked, already knowing the grim answer.

Jwan’s reply was typical of the man’s penchant for the eloquent understatement: “It would be a very bad day for us all.”

What Nigeria’s Christians accept as normal is, for the typical Westerner—or even the typical African—extraordinary. Some accept it because they don’t know anything different. Others accept it because they have no choice. Intelligent Travel, an independent group providing risk assessment to travelers, rates Nigeria a 97 percent travel risk. Meanwhile, life expectancy in Nigeria is a mere 53 years. Regardless, God’s grace was evident in how these good people managed it. They didn’t worry about those things they could not control. They simply did the best they could and left the rest to God’s sovereign mercy.

Moses, whose named seemed perfectly suited to his task on this day, led us on at high speed through the African desert.

“Get me to the Promised Land, Moses,” I joked. The young man smiled and, having connected his smartphone to the car stereo, he started his playlist that began with something unexpected.

“You like Rascal Flatts, Moses?” I asked. He grinned and nodded enthusiastically in the rearview mirror. I just shook my head, wondering if Rascal had ever imagined a scenario like this when he—or whoever—wrote this piece of music. I cannot now recall the song, but it surely must have been “Bless the Broken Road.”

“Now that you have been with us, my friend,” Jwan began, “how does the reality of our country compare to your expectations?”

“A South African friend of mine had told me that Nigerians were a huge people,” I said. “He has never been to Nigeria, but he told me that Nigerians were like the actor Michael Clarke Duncan, the big guy in “The Green Mile.” Huge. So, I had expected to feel like a grasshopper in their sight.”

At this, Jwan and Moses roared in delight.

“Instead you discovered that it is you who are of the tribe of Anak!” Jwan joked, completing my biblical reference. “We are more like Asians in size. You saw how you were bigger than almost everyone you met in this country! But that myth is part of the reputation of Nigeria in Africa. Nigeria and Nigerians are feared. Even by other Africans. Nigeria is like a scarecrow—you only need see it from afar to be afraid.”

That, I knew, was true. Later, without exception, when other Africans learned that I had been in Nigeria, they practically shivered. “Other Africans don’t go to Nigeria,” one man told me. The reasons, I heard, ranged from drug trafficking to witchcraft, but violence was the most common theme.

That said, Nigerian Christians are remarkable. Tough, charismatic, and possessed of an irrepressible joy, no one could ever conquer a people of such spirit. Not the Boko Haram, not the Fulani Herdsmen, not a corrupt government, and not the liberal policies that the West has tried to force upon them. The unrelenting pressure of violence, corruption, and pestilence have combined to produce a pearl of a people.

But the West has failed them. Abandoned them, really. Deep into the country, away from the operations of oil companies with their heavy security and guarded compounds, Westerners are almost non-existent.

Even so, the anti-Western narrative of colonialism was not reflected among the Nigerians I met. Quite the opposite. I don’t mean to suggest here that Nigerians think British colonialism was all peaches and cream. But these are a sophisticated, educated people who recognize that the British, particularly the Anglican Church, brought many good things to Nigeria—education, hospitals, infrastructure, and, most importantly, Jesus.

Speaking at a conference in London some years ago, Peter Akinola, the Archbishop of the Anglican Church in Nigeria, boldly chastised the West:

“You came to my country and told us there is only one God through whom we could be saved, Jesus Christ, and we believed you, and followed Him. You told us there is only one true book to know him, the Bible, and we believed you, and read it. Now you tell us Allah of Islam is also god, and that we can use the Qur’an to learn about God. You invited the Muslims here as guests, and they have now become your hosts. So now I come to your country to remind you of what you have forgotten.”

Wow. A friend of mine who was present at this occasion said it was one of the most powerful talks he has ever heard. You see, to Nigerian Christians, there are two manifestations of the West:

The good one that brings freedom, education, health care, and the eternal hope of Jesus Christ; and the bad one that uses every coercive power it possesses to bully the Third World into implementing permissive policies on abortion and homosexuality. Regarding the first, they want to know where that West went. Why did the Western church start something and not finish it? Regarding the second, to say that they deeply resent it is a gross understatement.

Prior to President Obama’s 2015 visit to Kenya, his administration attempted, unsuccessfully, to force that country (and other African countries) to change their laws on homosexuality. Many Africans deemed this both arrogant and unwanted, which, of course, it was. For them, this is America at its worst. More than once I was asked if American churches were all gay.

“What’s wrong with the American church?” One man asked me. “On television, we see so many people in church”—they all get TBN and DayStar on satellite—“but then we read they are all liberal [his word], approving of gay marriage. Don’t they believe in the Bible anymore?”

Watching CNN International and BBC as their news sources, it is no wonder that they think this. But they have a point. Western churches, Western Christians, have gone soft. This is because they have confused Christ’s command to love others with being likable, as if that were an attribute of God. (It isn’t.) As such, they endeavor to be, above all else, inoffensive and polite. This doctrinal malpractice has given us a generation of men who are what C.S. Lewis called “men without chests.”

And yet, in spite of ourselves, these Nigerians were a people who felt an affection for America. Jwan’s brother-in-law, a minister of agriculture, said: “Not only do we think that America should be first, we think America should lead the world.”

Given the narrative we hear in the United States, chiefly, that America is bad for the world and is hated by it, that statement surprised me. San Antonio Spurs coach Greg Popovich recently made headlines when he said that “America is an embarrassment to the world.”

That may be, but not for the reason Popovich might suppose. America’s current identity crisis is one that makes people like those that I met in Nigeria (and elsewhere in the Third World) nervous. If America isn’t leading the world, the alternatives look grim. Who now? Russia? China? They hope not.

“What is wrong with America?” is a frequent refrain.

To Popovich’s point, I was embarrassed to have to answer such questions, but for precisely the opposite reason than he meant. Most embarrassing of all was having to answer questions about the West’s position on Islam.

“Why do they think Islam is a religion of peace?” another man asked me. “These people have been killing us for decades and your media just ignores it. Now they are killing you and still your President Obama called it a peaceful religion. We see Western leaders saying that over and over again. Why?”

I could do little more than shrug and hold my palms up in resignation, because the question is all too valid. It isn’t bad enough that these people should be murdered by Muslim militants, but their suffering is compounded by the West’s willful blindness to a religion that bears a striking resemblance to a war strategy.

Yes, I was embarrassed by these manifestations of bad America. That I have written and spoken so forcefully about Islam is an encouragement to these persecuted Christians. Watching a clip from my debate on Al-Jazeera with atheist Daniel Dennett and Muslim cleric Zaid Shakir, Nigerian clergy practically cheered. You’d never get that reaction in the West, and that’s because Westerners prefer the false narrative that comforts them to the truth which frightens them.

Approaching a military checkpoint, Moses slowed the Toyota. The guard, spotting the uniform Moses was now wearing, saluted and waved us on. Moses, loving every second of the respect the uniform garnered for him, smiled to the point of laughter.

“Moses,” I warned, “you’ve got to act like you get saluted every day. To them, this must appear old hat for you. If you look like you’re enjoying it too much, they might get suspicious.”

He tried to suppress his smile, but it was no use. Much to my amusement, the salute thrilled him. Punching the accelerator, we were once again blazing a dusty path across the African plain.

The World Health Organization considers Nigeria the most dangerous country in the world to travel by road and, brother, I can tell you they are right. Each year, there are roughly 615 fatalities in Nigeria for every 100,000 vehicles. Compare that astonishing figure to the United States: 12. That’s before you factor in terrorism and the constant threat of roadside ambushes. Nigeria is leading the world in all the wrong categories.

A few hours later, we reached the international airport in Abuja. I thanked Moses for his driving and I thanked God for Toyota. My heavens, did that Sequoia take a beating, and so did I. My multitude of formerly broken bones ached from the journey.

Jwan walked with me into the terminal until airport security permitted him to go no farther. We embraced as friends and brothers in Christ. Watching him leave, I again thought of what a great man he is and the task before him.

Turning to making my way to the Lufthansa check-in counter, I realized that Phil Collins’s “Take Me Home” was playing over airport speakers. Fitting. I took one more fleeting glimpse at the figure of Nigeria’s great Christian bishop in the distance.

Minutes later, I was through passport control and in line to board the plane. I approached the woman checking tickets and passports.

“Your ticket, please.”

I handed it over. Raising her eyebrows, she said, “Double-o-seven?” She then examined me dramatically from head to toe and added flatly, “Yes, I think so.”

Having no idea what she was talking about, I looked at my ticket for clues:

“Seat Assignment: 007.”

I gave a wan smile and joined the enthusiastic rush that always possesses passengers boarding a plane. Elsewhere, such enthusiasm baffles me, but here it made sense. Since the Nigerian crisis began, not even Lufthansa remained in the country a moment longer than was necessary. The planes land, unload their passengers, refuel, reload, and leave in just over an hour with the same crew.

Seated next to a Nigerian woman from Lagos who now lives in Atlanta, she asked me where I had been.

“Jos.”

“In the north?” she exclaimed. “Did you drive that road?!”

“Yes.”

“From Abuja to Jos and back again?”

“Yes.”

“You had armed escorts, I suppose.”

“No.”

She looked at me wide-eyed over her reading glasses. “No? I would never do it! Lagos is, hmm, okay, but the north? Even I, a Nigerian, would never go there! What company lets you do that? I’ve not heard of it being done!”

“It was for ministry.”

“Ah!” she said with a knowing look. “Then the Lord was your protection!”

After a momentary pause, she added: “Still, I would never do it.”

Her delivery, perfectly timed, and with just the right intonation, was classic. I laughed out loud.

Soon thereafter I received a text from Jwan:

“You are an awesome and a wonderfully daring figure, my friend. You have proved to me that you are a beloved brother and a friend indeed…. May the Lord be with you. Anticipating the news of your safe arrival.”

As the plane lifted-off, I thought about my courageous Nigerian friends and the extraordinary work God is doing through them and all that we, in the West, could learn from them. With a full heart, I reclined my seat and minutes later I was sleeping more deeply than I had in a very long time.",The forgotten Christians of Nigeria -- faithful while enduring incredible persecution,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/15/forgotten-christians-nigeria-faithful-while-enduring-incredible-persecution.html

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.",Your planting guide for beautiful yellow daffodils,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/your-planting-guide-for-beautiful-yellow-daffodils.html

According to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is now investigating the incident, the cabin of flight QZ535 somehow became depressurized at 34,000 feet. The crew was then forced to bring the plane down to a safer altitude of only 10,000 feet — but in the space of only nine minutes, per data from Flight Aware.

""Hostesses started screaming: 'Emergency, emergency.' They just went hysterical,” said passenger named Mark Bailey in a statement to Seven Network. ""There was no real panic before that, then everyone panicked,"" he added.

Footage from inside the aircraft shows passengers utilizing the oxygen masks that fell from over their seats. Passengers can also be seen tearfully embracing as the flight crew shouted instructions over the loudspeaker.

""We were all pretty much saying goodbye to each other,"" said Leah, another passenger, to Nine Network. “It was really upsetting.”

The Indonesian airline has yet to divulge exactly what caused the plane’s depressurization, but blamed a “technical issue” in a statement obtained by the Associated Press.

Meanwhile, an spokesman for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority says his agency has reached out to AirAsia to review how the emergency situation was handled.

""Our job as the regulator is to gather information on these sorts of events and review that to see whether we're satisfied that everything was managed properly and determine whether we should dig any deeper,"" said CASA spokesperson Peter Gibson.

First, let’s understand what the First Amendment actually says and what it actually does.
If NBC published a provably false story with reckless disregard for its truth or falsity, President Trump (like any other public official) can file suit.
And whether or not President Trump would prevail in any such legal action does not support the overreaction to his tweets.
Yet the media continue to claim, since even before the election, that somehow it’s President Trump who is a threat to the First Amendment.","For the second time in as many months, Americans are demonstrating a profound ignorance of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. But this time, it’s not about the NFL and freedom of speech; it’s about our sacrosanct freedom of the press.

Backlash followed swiftly Thursday after President Trump’s tweet against mainstream media (specifically, NBC News). The president tweeted: “Network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked. Not fair to public!”

Commentators claimed this threatened freedom of the press.

In response to an NBC story claiming that the president called for a bigger U.S. nuclear arsenal, President Trump denied the story as flatly false during a White House meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

If one takes the time to actually read the tweets and understand the First Amendment, you’ll find that claiming President Trump is advocating for government regulation of the press is an absolutely baseless assertion and just another inane overreaction.

President Trump’s denial was bolstered by Defense Secretary James Mattis, who said: “Recent reports that the president called for an increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal are absolutely false. This kind of erroneous reporting is irresponsible.”

The president also tweeted: “With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!”

But if one takes the time to actually read the tweets and understand the First Amendment, you’ll find that claiming President Trump is advocating for government regulation of the press is an absolutely baseless assertion and just another inane overreaction.

First, let’s understand what the First Amendment actually says and what it actually does. Contrary to popular belief, our Bill of Rights does not confer rights upon individuals, nor are our rights absolute. The Declaration of Independence acknowledges that our individual, unalienable rights are endowed by our Creator, not our government. The mandate for American government is simply to best preserve and protect our preexisting rights.

Thus, the First Amendment acts as a redundancy safeguard, or a check, against the specific, limited powers given through our U.S. Constitution to government to operate in accordance with that mandate. In other words, just in case our federal government attempts to overreach its specific, limited powers provided in Articles I through III, the Bill of Rights tells Congress precisely what government cannot do.

The First Amendment reads in relevant part: “Congress shall make no law…abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press….” It is important to note here that the operative term is “abridging.” The Supreme Court has rightly acknowledged in Roth v. United States and other similar cases that rights protected by the First Amendment are not absolute.

Freedom of the press generally means that the government cannot interfere with the publication and distribution of information and opinions – not that the government may never impose restrictions.

For example, I cannot publish a story about my neighbor having an affair that I know is false. My neighbor could rightly sue me for damages in that instance. The law provides relief for defamation, including libel and slander.

The Supreme Court has routinely upheld defamation laws and afforded civil liability remedies. In the 1964 case New York Times v. Sullivan, the court held that where individuals and publications disseminated information published with reckless disregard of whether that information was false or not, even public officials could win a lawsuit for libel.

This is still the basic rule for mainstream media outlets like NBC. If NBC published a provably false story with reckless disregard for its truth or falsity, President Trump (like any other public official) can file suit. This legal remedy doesn’t amount to “government regulation” or remotely contravene the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of the press.

Whether or not the Federal Communications Commission would revoke licenses granted to NBC’s local stations based on demonstrably false content may be a lawsuit primed for today’s “fake news” era. And whether or not President Trump would prevail in any such legal action does not support the overreaction to his tweets. The president and Mattis are correct that the media bears responsibility for veracity and truthfulness.

Is it really too much to require that the media are at least accurately reporting facts, even if their constitutionally protected opinions are clearly biased? The law presumes that a reasonable person knows the difference between a reporting of fact versus an opinion. Facts cannot change depending on a reporter’s political agenda.

The president’s tweets and comments are often bombastic and pointed, but thus far he hasn’t actually advocated anything that would amount to an unconstitutional government infringement upon our individual rights that his office (and the entire scope of American government) is mandated to preserve and protect.

If the media are allowed to publish with reckless disregard for the truth in reporting facts, at that point we have lost all credibility and the original purpose for the freedom of press. Journalism is still rightly required in this country to operate with integrity. Yet the media continue to claim, since even before the election, that somehow it’s President Trump who is a threat to the First Amendment.

I now see I was lucky to have been a Boy Scout at that time instead of today.
Rest in Peace Boy Scouts.","Editor's note: The following column originally appeared on The Resurgent.

We all knew this was coming. The Boy Scouts of America stood for over a century on its strong foundation of Judeo-Christian values, growing boys into young men, and young men into leaders. However, in recent years the BSA has allowed cracks to form in that foundation.

From the lifting of the ban on openly gay boys from joining the organization, to the sanctioning of openly gay adult leaders, to the encouragement of so-called “transgendered” boys to join, the BSA’s moral foundation has been rapidly and steadily eroding into dust.

As soon as the BSA changed the definition of the phrase “morally straight” in the generations-old Scout Oath back in 2013, allowing for homosexual membership, we all knew that this first compromise would not be the last. We all knew that it was only a matter of time before the BSA compromised itself into oblivion.

That day has now arrived.

From the BSA’s website:

""Today, the Boy Scouts of America Board of Directors unanimously approved to welcome girls into its iconic Cub Scout program and to deliver a Scouting program for older girls that will enable them to advance and earn the highest rank of Eagle Scout.""

This is incredibly disappointing news, but in light of the BSA’s changes over the last few years, it isn’t at all surprising. It does, however, mark a complete transformation for the organization. The Boy Scouts has always been exclusively for boys. As Ben Shapiro famously noted, it’s in the name.

There are plenty of organizations out there for all different varieties of youth. The Boy Scouts even have several co-ed programs for both boys and girls. The girls already have the Girl Scouts. If the Girl Scouts isn’t working, why not work to fix that organization instead? There is absolutely no need for the Boy Scouts to change who they are to be “inclusive.”

What now separates the Boy Scouts from any other youth organization? The BSA has now effectively rendered obsolete both the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts. If the Boy Scouts is a better youth organization for girls, why would any girl ever want to join the Girl Scouts?

More incredibly, I have to wonder why any parent would want their young teenage girls camping in the woods with young teenage boys? Who exactly is okay with this?

As an Eagle Scout myself, this is an incredibly difficult piece for me to write. My fondest memories from my youth come from my time in Boy Scouts. I learned a great deal about myself, about leadership, and about manhood in those years. The friendships I made with both adult leaders and fellow Scouts can never be replaced. Earning the rank of Eagle Scout in 2002 was the greatest achievement of my life at the time. Another honor was when my beloved Scout troop invited me back to town to participate in its centennial celebration earlier this year. My scouting experiences have guided me throughout my adulthood and will continue to do so.

I now see I was lucky to have been a Boy Scout at that time instead of today. Those experiences would not have been the same had the BSA not been so strict on its membership policies. It is important for boys and young men to grow together free from the distraction of girls.

I suspect the Almighty Dollar now motivates BSA more than the Almighty. Membership (and revenue) has been declining steadily for years. Suddenly membership eligibility is now opened to a whole new demographic. Draw your own conclusions there.

This is what the Left does best: target and destroy everything good in America. They cannot compete with us on ideas, so they have to eliminate everything that makes us who we are. If they were truly motivated to provide girls, homosexuals, and “transgenders,” with the same experiences Boy Scouts provides, then they would form their own youth organization. But it isn’t really about that, is it?

Rodgers likely already knew that his season was in jeopardy after Barr's hit broke his collarbone, and the fiery quarterback's frustration boiled over.

Now the Green Bay Packers have to try to make sure their season as a whole doesn't go down the drain with it.

Rodgers was knocked out of the 23-10 loss to the Vikings in the first quarter on Sunday with an injury that could cause him to miss the remainder of the season .

It's a crushing blow to a team that entered the season with Super Bowl aspirations, optimism based primarily on the right arm of one of the game's best quarterbacks.

""It's devastating,"" receiver Randall Cobb said. ""No question about it. First and foremost, that is one of my closest friends, so to see him go down with that is tough. We still have to play football. We have a long season ahead of us to figure out what we are going to do.""

Brett Hundley, the only other quarterback on the roster outside of practice squad player Joe Callahan, was rushed into duty. He finished 18 of 33 for 157 yards with one touchdown and three interceptions.

""Losing Aaron Rodgers speaks for itself,"" Packers coach Mike McCarthy said. ""In my opinion, he's the best player in football. This is the ultimate team game. We need to be better with the 11 people on the field that we have, regardless of the phase that we're in. Ultimately that's my responsibility.""

Colin Kaepernick, who has had difficulty finding a job since becoming the face of league-wide demonstrations during the national anthem that protest social injustice, and Tony Romo, who joined CBS as an analyst after retiring from the Dallas Cowboys, could be outside options to fill in for Rodgers. But McCarthy said after the game he was not considering anything like that yet.

""Brett Hundley and Joe Callahan, that's what we're going with,"" he said.

Despite several key injuries to the secondary, the Packers entered the game Sunday against their NFC North rivals at 4-1 after Rodgers engineered a game-winning touchdown drive to beat the Dallas Cowboys last week.

Vikings coach Mike Zimmer's defense has always gotten after Rodgers in these tense matchups, and it happened again in the first quarter when Barr drove him into the turf after he got rid of a roll-out pass.

The impact did not appear to be that violent at first glance as Rodgers rolled through the hit. But it became apparent quickly that he was in considerable pain. He writhed on the turf as McCarthy argued for a roughing the passer penalty.

""I know Anthony Barr personally,"" said Hundley, a fellow UCLA alum. ""I wouldn't imagine he's a dirty player. I didn't really get a good look at it.""

Rodgers rode a cart to the locker room for further tests and remained there throughout the first half. He was initially deemed questionable, but the Packers announced after halftime that he would not return to the game.

""He's the best in the game so I hate to see that for him,"" Vikings safety Harrison Smith said.

Since becoming the full-time starter in 2008, Rodgers has been remarkably durable. He missed seven games in 2013 with a fractured collarbone, but he has started 132 of the other 134 games during that time period.

Of course, being able to count on a quarterback to take the snaps is nothing new for Green Bay. Since Brett Favre took over for the injured Don Majkowski in the third game of the 1992 season, the Packers have had Favre and Rodgers for all but nine games.

Matt Flynn, Scott Tolzien and Seneca Wallace were forced to fill in while Rodgers was out in 2013 and the Packers went 2-4-1 in that stretch. Flynn started once in 2010 when Rodgers sat out with a concussion and again in 2011 when he rested during the regular-season finale with the Packers having clinched the top seed in the NFC playoffs.

Favre never sat at all.

Hundley had only thrown 11 passes over the course of his first two-plus seasons in the league before jumping in on Sunday.

The research had a small sample size — only 20 patients — and no control group who got a placebo for comparison's sake. That makes it hard to draw firm conclusions about if or how well the hallucinogenic compound really works at fighting depression. But brain-scan data from the new research suggests that psilocybin does impact brain networks that are associated with depression.

""Larger studies are needed to see if this positive effect can be reproduced in more patients,"" study author David Nutt, a professor of psychopharmacology at Imperial College London, said in a statement. ""But these initial findings are exciting and provide another treatment avenue to explore.""

Stubborn depression

The researchers focused on 20 people who had tried standard depression treatments and found them lacking. Each participant, classified as having treatment-resistant depression, took a 10-milligram dose of psilocybin, followed by another 25 milligrams one week later. Before treatment and the day after the second dose, the participants underwent brain scans to measure changes in blood flow and connections between brain regions. Nineteen out of the 20 patients made it through the whole study.

The immediately striking finding was that taking psilocybin, which occurs naturally in hundreds of mushroom species, decreased depression symptoms significantly. Scores on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, a commonly used depression-screening measure, dropped by an average of about 10 points out of 27 a day after the second dose. All patients showed at least some decline in their symptoms, the researchers reported Oct. 13 in the journal Scientific Reports, and 12 experienced at least a 50 percent decline. Participants also completed the depression survey five weeks after taking the psilocybin.

Some scientists have suggested a honeymoon-like period in the days following a psychedelic experience, the researchers noted in their paper. To see if there were any brain changes linked to the associated mood improvements and stress relief (often called an afterglow), the researchers scanned the participants' brains a day after the doses were given, they wrote.

The brain-scan data showed reduced blood flow to the left amygdala, an almond-size region tucked deep in the brain that handles emotion and fear. The researchers also saw increased chatter in the default-mode network — a network of brain areas most active when people are daydreaming or thinking about things without doing any particular task. In electroconvulsive therapy, in which electric current is run through the brain as a depression treatment, the default-mode network rapidly becomes less functional and then recovers beyond its baseline condition, Nutt and his colleagues wrote. Something similar might be at play with psilocybin, which may initially disrupt and then ""reset"" this network, giving the brain a fresh start that correlates with fewer depression symptoms five weeks after treatment.

New form of treatment?

""Based on what we know from various brain-imaging studies with psychedelics, as well as taking heed of what people say about their experiences, it may be that psychedelics do indeed 'reset' the brain networks associated with depression, effectively enabling them to be lifted from the depressed state,"" study leader Robin Carhart-Harris, the head of psychedelic research at Imperial College, said in a statement.

But the treatment isn't yet ready for prime time. Without a control group, the researchers can't be sure that the patients weren't just experiencing a placebo effect. Instead, they wrote, the study should be seen as a first step toward exploring psychedelic drugs as a treatment for depression. More work is also needed to examine any interactions between psilocybin and other factors in treatment, such as therapeutic support, they wrote.

Nevertheless, this is not the first study to suggest that there are some benefits from psilocybin for people with depression. In 2011, a similarly small study found that a year after taking psilocybin, participants reported higher life satisfaction and well-being, as well as increased spirituality and improved familial relationships. Psilocybin seems to prompt a sense of connectedness and meaning, which could be a mental health boon, those researchers told Live Science at the time.

Also in 2011, researchers reported that a psilocybin experience made people more open to new experiences for at least a year after the fact — a basic personality change that is rare to see in psychology. Psilocybin has also been shown to help people shake off feelings of rejection.

However, the hallucinogen can also have dangerous side effects. A 2017 study conducted by Johns Hopkins University found that of more than 2,000 people who'd had a ""bad trip"" on psilocybin, 10 percent felt they'd been a danger to themselves or others during their episode.

""Considering both the negative effects and the positive outcomes that respondents sometimes reported, the survey results confirm our view that neither users nor researchers can be cavalier about the risks associated with psilocybin,"" Roland Griffiths, a psychopharmacologist at Johns Hopkins University's School of Medicine, said in a statement about that research.

The sponsor, Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener, has argued adamantly that nobody is going to be criminally prosecuted for using the wrong pronoun.

“It’s just more scare tactics by people who oppose all LGBT civil rights and protections,” he said in a statement last month.

But the language seemingly allows for the possibility, however remote.

The bill itself is aimed at protecting transgender and other LGBT individuals in hospitals, retirement homes and assisted living facilities. The bill would ensure those facilities accommodate transgender people and their needs, including letting them decide which gender-specific bathroom they prefer to use.

""It shall be unlawful for a long-term care facility or facility staff to take any of the following actions wholly or partially on the basis of a person’s actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status,"" the bill reads.

Among the unlawful actions are “willfully and repeatedly” failing to use a transgender person’s “preferred name or pronouns” after he or she is “clearly informed of the preferred name or pronouns.”

The law states that if provisions are violated, the violator could be punished by a fine “not to exceed one thousand dollars” or “by imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed one year,” or both.

Wiener's office noted that violations for residential care facilities under existing law rarely resulted in criminal charges, especially for minor violations. Criminal penalties are meant more for violations that expose a patient to risk of death or serious harm, his office said.

Wiener’s office noted that the law “does not create any new criminal provisions,” but rather creates “new rights within an existing structure.”

One opponent of the law, the California Family Council's Greg Burt, slammed the measure when the bill was in its early stages.

As the weather turns cooler, you might be looking for ways to keep outdoor living part of your routine. These 10 ideas can help make the most of enjoying the fresh air on your porch and patio or in your yard this season, whether you’re bookmarking dates for fall outings or looking for ways to keep your garden inviting.

1. Host a backyard party. Invite guests to bundle up and come outside to enjoy the crisp air for all or part of the evening. Make an outdoor lounge spot feel cozy with extra throw blankets and pillows brought out from inside the house. Light candles for an inviting glow or move chairs around an outdoor fire pit to take advantage of the warmth.

2. Move a porch swing outside. Admire the changing leaves from a front-row seat by hanging a porch swing in the garden. Look for a large lateral branch from a mature tree or — even easier — hang from a backyard shade pergola, if you have one. Finishing touches like pumpkin-colored pillows and pots of mums on either side make the swinging lounge even more festive.

3. Pick for a good cause. This year, why not trade a visit to a U-pick farm for a harvesting day out that will leave both you and the greater community a little richer in fall produce? Nonprofit organizations like San Francisco Bay Area-based Village Harvest host weekly picking trips to local backyards and small orchards where volunteers harvest the excess produce for community members in need.

You can also expect to take home fruit that’s not fit for donation (but may be perfect for pie) like those that are extra ripe, fragile or slightly damaged. You can join a trip or list your backyard if you have a couple of fruit trees with more ripe fruit than you can handle.

This time of year, expect to harvest apples, pears, persimmons and pomegranates, among others.

4. Find a sun trap. Gardens this time of year can feel damp and chilly but often have areas that catch the sun’s rays. Seek out these warm places or follow your cat or dog in the afternoon — they always seem to find them — as spots to linger and appreciate the last of the season’s warmth.

5. Embrace indoors-outdoors. Moving outdoor furniture under an overhang can be a great way to extend your ability to enjoy a meal or relax outside in a transitional season. If fall in your region means rain, the covered roof can make the difference of eating outside or indoors.

6. Invest in landscape heaters. Adding heat can make a big difference if you’d like to linger outside in cool weather. Installing small wall-mounted or ceiling-mounted outdoor heaters may be easier than you think. The units run from $120 to $200 in big-box stores and can be plugged in to regular home electricity systems. Most wall- or ceiling-mounted models cast about a nine-foot-square “heat blanket” — one heater would be enough for a cafe set, while two can heat an outdoor dining table.

7. Get cozy with sheepskins. Instantly make cold outdoor furniture feel more inviting by covering the seats or seat backs with a cozy material. Sheepskins (faux and real) provide warmth and a cushy padding, while throw blankets can double as wraps later in the evening.

8. Pick out a portable fire pit. It’s no surprise that adding a fire pit can really make your patio functional in the cooler months, providing warmth, light and a great excuse to go outside — s’mores! While large-scale fire pits and outdoor fireplaces can be pricey investments, smaller, portable gas-burning models come at a more wallet-friendly price. Plus, being portable, they can easily be moved from one area of the garden to another or brought in the garage for the winter.

9. Brighten up your porch. Hanging a few strings of lights can be all it takes to transform a shadowy porch into an alluring spot. Set the lights on your front porch on a timer so they turn on when you’re coming home in the evening, making for a bright and welcoming entry.

What I know is healing, in the face of violence and senseless acts, will always find a way.","The news of Las Vegas came in as fast and as devastating as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria and as violent as the raging fires tearing through California. I could imagine the sudden horror of the thousands of men, women, and children dancing and singing one minute, and then scrambling for their lives before the next downbeat. It must have felt like a roof ripping off and leaving thousands of people traumatized in its wake. My husband and son, Marcus and Levi Hummon, are both in the music industry and have lots of friends who were in Las Vegas, so our communities have felt this mass shooting rip apart our own sense of security.

I have felt both grief and anger on behalf of the victims and their families. I can understand how people might wonder why God would allow such a horrific thing to happen to innocent people but God didn't do this, God is grieving with us. This is a time to question a lot of things, but I believe that this is not a time to question our faith. This is a time to lean into our faith, as our faith is what carries us through. This is a time for remembering all we have lost through violence and injustice and to be a community. Community is the common thread, woven by the fiber of love, that binds us together. And I know something about love: Love heals. It heals people, and it will heal our nation, too.

At Thistle Farms, a community of survivors of prostitution, addiction, and trafficking, where I have worked for the past 20 years, one sentiment remains constant; hearts expand as they heal. For women recovering from childhood trauma and sexual violence, the painful edges of their hearts discover new depths of compassion along the path of healing. America, too, can grow both stronger in the pain and more radically passionate for loving one another. Once we all allow healing to smooth over rough edges in our own hearts, it will push the boundaries of love a little further for all of us.

We can transform brokenness into compassion, anger into advocacy, and fear into courage. On a daily basis, I see the survivors in our community being transformed by love. Healing is beautifully simple and surprisingly accessible.

If you are wondering what you can do to find some peace and healing in your own life, I encourage you to:

Make time for quiet reflection: Find a green pasture, sit on a pew, stretch out on an exercise mat, soak in a bathtub—go anywhere that is your quiet space so that you can get still. Sip tea, light a candle, go silent.

Pray: Everyone defines this differently. You can pray out loud, on paper, or before bed. If we desire healing, we journey inward, reflect, face the pain, and find new spaces in our hearts to love each other.

Give generously: This can be your time, money or talents. We refuel our spirits by helping another person or contributing to the greater good. Volunteer.

Take a break from social media: Social media contains negative stories, unkind words, judgment, comparison, and unrealistic standards in the news feed. Use the time you would have spent on social media to help create good news. Nurture the relationships in your life that don’t rely on a screen.

With every action, we can become more peaceful, more loving, and more compassionate towards ourselves and others. This is what makes healing a journey; In the small steps we make daily, we find, looking back, that we have made a big difference along the way.

While I don’t know why we have faced a relentless amount of tragedy across our country this past year, what I do know is that love will be stronger and will last longer. In grieving, hearts can grow stronger, and in pain, there is comfort. What I know is healing, in the face of violence and senseless acts, will always find a way. Peace and love to you.","Deadly fires, a mass shooting, hurricanes and more -- I still believe love can heal our nation",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/12/deadly-fires-mass-shooting-hurricanes-and-more-still-believe-love-can-heal-our-nation.html

NEW YORK— September 26, 2017 — FOX News Channel (FNC) will unveil a new daytime lineup on Monday, October 2nd, announced Jay Wallace, President of News.

Additionally, Sandra Smith will permanently join Bill Hemmer in co-anchoring America’s Newsroom (9-11AM/ET).

In making the announcement, Wallace said, “Harris, Dana and Sandra are rising stars and their combined background and expertise across news, business and politics will enable us to provide a more in-depth look at the major stories breaking out of Washington, and around the country. We are living in unprecedented times and this new lineup ensures our viewers will get the best news, information and analysis on the news of the hour across the nation and around the globe.”

Outnumbered Overtime originally debuted as a web show led by Faulkner following the TV version every day and her new program will seek to harness the popularity of that effort.

Faulkner added, “Three years ago, we enhanced cable news with a show that combines news and opinion, predominantly from the female point of view, and immediately, Outnumbered became the number one show in its timeslot. I am proud of the work we’re continuing to do there, and blessed to have this added opportunity to create a new program that will help inform our viewers and keep them engaged in a conversation surrounding the day’s headlines.”

Smith commented, “There’s no one better in the business than Bill Hemmer and I am honored to kick off the network’s news hours with him, informing our viewers of the biggest stories and issues driving the day.”

With her understanding of what makes news, how to respond to it and her unique political expertise, Perino will break it all down with insight from key Beltway experts.

Perino remarked, “Our new show will aim to take on the major issues facing Americans and explore them from all angles.

By John Bolton, For the Wall Street Journal



As Abba Eban observed, “Men and nations behave wisely when they have exhausted all other resources.” So it goes with America and the Iran deal. President Trump announced Friday that the U.S. would stay in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, even while he refused to certify under U.S. law that the deal is in the national interest. “Decertification,” a bright, shiny object for many, obscures the real issue—whether the agreement should survive. Mr. Trump has “scotch’d the snake, not kill’d it.”

While Congress considers how to respond—or, more likely, not respond—we should focus on the grave threats inherent in the deal. Peripheral issues have often dominated the debate; forests have been felled arguing over whether Iran has complied with the deal’s terms. Proposed “fixes” now abound, such as a suggestion to eliminate the sunset provisions on the deal’s core provisions.

The core provisions are the central danger. There are no real “fixes” to this intrinsically misconceived agreement. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which Iran is a party, has never included sunset clauses, but the mullahs have been violating it for decades.

If the U.S. left the JCPOA, it would not need to justify the decision by showing that the Iranians have exceeded the deal’s limits on uranium enrichment (though they have). Many argued Russia was not violating the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (though it likely was) when President Bush gave notice of withdrawal in 2001, but that was not the point. The issue was whether the ABM Treaty remained strategically wise for America. So too for the Iran deal. It is neither dishonorable nor unusual for countries to withdraw from international agreements that contravene their vital interests. As Charles de Gaulle put it, treaties “are like girls and roses; they last while they last.”",Bolton: A Slow Death for the Iran Deal,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/16/bolton-slow-death-iran-deal

In the 21st century, our inboxes are flooded. The average adult will receive 92 email messages per day in 2017, according to The Radicati Group, a technology market research company. That doesn’t even count the spam that pours into our accounts. The longer we wait for an answer, the more we wonder whether the message was seen at all.

There is a drawback: privacy. Read receipts are great for you, because you have an idea what is taking place in the recipient’s inbox. But some people find receipt requests intrusive and never send them back. There are ways to turn to “invisible” third-party email trackers, which will send you a receipt without the recipient ever knowing.

Depending on your platform, here are various ways to know if someone has opened and read your email.

Request a return receipt

Read receipts are much more common than most people realize. Most major email platforms will give you the option to request return/read receipts when you send an email. Some will also let you specify these receipts for every email you're composing.

Keep in mind, these requests do only half the job; the recipient can still decline, and you’ll never receive the receipt you’re hoping for.

Some email platforms, including free Gmail and Apple Mail, do not officially support the sending of read receipt requests.

As an alternative, you can use ""invisible"" email tracking and read receipts, but here you'll have to rely on third-party tracking software. (More on that in a minute.)

For the other major email platforms, here's how you set them up:

Outlook

To request a return receipt in Microsoft Outlook, click Options on the top menu bar to bring up its sub-menu.

Now, just check ""Request a Read Receipt"" to receive a notification when your message is opened. Additionally, you can also get notifications when your message is successfully delivered by checking ""Request a Delivery Receipt.""

Mozilla Thunderbird

Here's how to turn on return receipts in Mozilla's email client, Thunderbird:

Click Tools (on the top menu bar), then click Options. Now, on the General tab, click on ""Return Receipts.""

Here you can configure Thunderbird to always include return receipts with your emails. You can also send your own return receipts and the location of your receipts. When done, click OK.

You can also configure Thunderbird return receipts on individual emails. While writing a new email, just click on Options on the top menu bar, then select ""Return Receipts and or Delivery Status Notification"" to configure its return receipt setting.

Again, as usual, the recipient can choose whether to send a return receipt reply or not.

Gmail

You can’t request a read receipt in the free version of Gmail, but the feature is available with Google's paid business cloud software, G Suite.

If you are a G Suite subscriber, you can turn on read receipt requests via the G Suite Admin Console. Go to Apps >> GSuite >> Settings for Gmail, and then click Advanced Settings. Here, you can scroll down to the Email Read Receipts section, where you’ll find this wordy option: ""Allow email read receipts to be sent to all addresses in my organization as well as the following email addresses."" Switch it to “on.”

With this option on, you can click on the lower right down arrow on your Compose window to request a read receipt for the particular email you're writing.

Use email tracking software

Maybe you have a small business. Maybe you’re doing research, and you need to know which emails were opened and which were untouched. In this case, you might turn to third-party email tracking solutions.

Most of these are paid services with monthly subscriptions, but some have free basic plans, too. These third-party trackers offer more features than your regular free email client.

Get Notify

One basic way to track your emails and get read receipts is by using Get Notify, which notifies you of the date and time your messages get read, as well as the recipient’s IP address, geographical location, operating system and web browser.

GetNotify's free version limits your tracked emails to five per day and 150 per month, but you can remove the daily limit and increase your monthly limit for a ""small donation.""

Mailtrack

Mailtrack is a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox and Opera that's designed to work with Gmail. Mailtrack's free version offers unlimited email tracking, but your emails will be tagged with a Mailtrack Signature. This is typical for individual non-business use.

For about $5 a month, you can get the Pro version and remove the Mailtrack signature. The Pro version also provides tech support, notifications, and usage for three different email addresses. Finally, small companies can sign up for the ""Teams"" plan, and large companies can sign up for ""Enterprise.""

Streak

Streak is a customer relationship management (CRM) add-on for Gmail. The free version has basic CRM features and email power tools. You can track 200 emails a month, which should be plenty for personal use.

Streak also has a Corporate Plan ($39/month) and an Enterprise Plan ($89/month) for small to large businesses. Aside from full CRM features, these paid plans also include unlimited email tracking.

Nigel Williams denied his printing services to Joanne Lockwood, a consultant at transgender diversity firm SEE Change Happen, which is aimed at offering advice to businesses on inclusion of LGBTQ staff, The Sunday Times reported.

Lockwood tried to get her company’s promotional materials printed at Williams’ firm, but he refused, saying taking up the contract would “make pressure worse” for other Christians.

“The new model of diversity is used (or misused) to marginalize (or indeed discriminate against) Christians in their workplaces and other parts of society if they do not subscribe to it,” Williams wrote to the transgender diversity expert, explaining his decision to turn down the chance to work together.

He added: “Although I’m quite sure you have no intention of marginalizing Christians it would weigh heavily upon me if through my own work I was to make pressure worse for fellow Christians.”

Lockwood, who is a trans woman since January, claims she was “gobsmacked” by the refusal to perform services, telling the Times: “I was not expecting a lecture. I disbelieved this could happen in 2017. I have been distraught and cried and my wife consoled me.”

“I think a point of principle is at stake. He wanted to make a point to me deliberately for his own motives. I have been the victim of some discrimination,” she added.

The printer received a backing from the Christian Institute, a group that previously supported a Christian family bakery in Northern Ireland who were sued for refusing to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding.

The Institute slammed the incident, saying it was “chilling and unnecessary” and has similarities to the same-sex wedding cake lawsuit.

“It is a fundamental tenet of free speech and freedom of belief that people should not be forced to help promote causes flatly contrary to their own deeply held views,” the group told the Times.","Christian printer refuses services to LGBTQ activist, says he doesn't want to 'make pressure worse'",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/16/christian-printer-refuses-services-to-lgbtq-activist-says-doesnt-want-to-make-pressure-worse.html

Instead, they wrote, the study should be seen as a first step toward exploring psychedelic drugs as a treatment for depression.","Psilocybin, the main ingredient in ""magic mushrooms,"" may soothe symptoms of depression, according to a very preliminary study.

The research had a small sample size — only 20 patients — and no control group who got a placebo for comparison's sake. That makes it hard to draw firm conclusions about if or how well the hallucinogenic compound really works at fighting depression. But brain-scan data from the new research suggests that psilocybin does impact brain networks that are associated with depression.

""Larger studies are needed to see if this positive effect can be reproduced in more patients,"" study author David Nutt, a professor of psychopharmacology at Imperial College London, said in a statement. ""But these initial findings are exciting and provide another treatment avenue to explore.""

Stubborn depression

The researchers focused on 20 people who had tried standard depression treatments and found them lacking. Each participant, classified as having treatment-resistant depression, took a 10-milligram dose of psilocybin, followed by another 25 milligrams one week later. Before treatment and the day after the second dose, the participants underwent brain scans to measure changes in blood flow and connections between brain regions. Nineteen out of the 20 patients made it through the whole study.

The immediately striking finding was that taking psilocybin, which occurs naturally in hundreds of mushroom species, decreased depression symptoms significantly. Scores on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, a commonly used depression-screening measure, dropped by an average of about 10 points out of 27 a day after the second dose. All patients showed at least some decline in their symptoms, the researchers reported Oct. 13 in the journal Scientific Reports, and 12 experienced at least a 50 percent decline. Participants also completed the depression survey five weeks after taking the psilocybin.

Some scientists have suggested a honeymoon-like period in the days following a psychedelic experience, the researchers noted in their paper. To see if there were any brain changes linked to the associated mood improvements and stress relief (often called an afterglow), the researchers scanned the participants' brains a day after the doses were given, they wrote.

The brain-scan data showed reduced blood flow to the left amygdala, an almond-size region tucked deep in the brain that handles emotion and fear. The researchers also saw increased chatter in the default-mode network — a network of brain areas most active when people are daydreaming or thinking about things without doing any particular task. In electroconvulsive therapy, in which electric current is run through the brain as a depression treatment, the default-mode network rapidly becomes less functional and then recovers beyond its baseline condition, Nutt and his colleagues wrote. Something similar might be at play with psilocybin, which may initially disrupt and then ""reset"" this network, giving the brain a fresh start that correlates with fewer depression symptoms five weeks after treatment.

New form of treatment?

""Based on what we know from various brain-imaging studies with psychedelics, as well as taking heed of what people say about their experiences, it may be that psychedelics do indeed 'reset' the brain networks associated with depression, effectively enabling them to be lifted from the depressed state,"" study leader Robin Carhart-Harris, the head of psychedelic research at Imperial College, said in a statement.

But the treatment isn't yet ready for prime time. Without a control group, the researchers can't be sure that the patients weren't just experiencing a placebo effect. Instead, they wrote, the study should be seen as a first step toward exploring psychedelic drugs as a treatment for depression. More work is also needed to examine any interactions between psilocybin and other factors in treatment, such as therapeutic support, they wrote.

Nevertheless, this is not the first study to suggest that there are some benefits from psilocybin for people with depression. In 2011, a similarly small study found that a year after taking psilocybin, participants reported higher life satisfaction and well-being, as well as increased spirituality and improved familial relationships. Psilocybin seems to prompt a sense of connectedness and meaning, which could be a mental health boon, those researchers told Live Science at the time.

Also in 2011, researchers reported that a psilocybin experience made people more open to new experiences for at least a year after the fact — a basic personality change that is rare to see in psychology. Psilocybin has also been shown to help people shake off feelings of rejection.

However, the hallucinogen can also have dangerous side effects. A 2017 study conducted by Johns Hopkins University found that of more than 2,000 people who'd had a ""bad trip"" on psilocybin, 10 percent felt they'd been a danger to themselves or others during their episode.

""Considering both the negative effects and the positive outcomes that respondents sometimes reported, the survey results confirm our view that neither users nor researchers can be cavalier about the risks associated with psilocybin,"" Roland Griffiths, a psychopharmacologist at Johns Hopkins University's School of Medicine, said in a statement about that research.

The 77-year-old Midwesterner plowed that phrase into his bean crops - a massive message spanning the length of two football fields - in response to the controversial protest undertaken by some NFL players who've begun kneeling during the playing of ""The Star-Spangled Banner.""

“I go with [President] Trump on this one,” Hanson told Fox News on Tuesday. “If you want to protest, that’s not the place to do it.”

He added: “A lot of people died over our flag. We’re able to voice our opinion because of it. If you’re going to show respect for anything, do it for the national anthem.”

Hanson has a track record of designing and digging massive messages – many political – using his old Massey tractor on his 850-acre farm.

And Hanson doesn’t use GPS or any technology for the work, which he says “works out pretty good in a harvested bean field.”

Then he flies his two-seater plane, and if his design passes the test, he snaps a pic with a Cannon camera and posts it on Facebook. He said he's only been unsuccessful twice.

Hanson told Fox News he got his “We Stand for the National Anthem” message right on the second try. During the first attempt, he was interrupted by a passerby with only two letters to go. He soon relocated to another section of the field.

Hanson said he initially wanted to add an addendum -- “We kneel at the cross” -- but the plan was foiled by the first frost of the season.

Hanson said, weather permitting, he plans to add that phrase soon.

Hanson and his wife, Darlene, are Lutherans and attend church regularly. He also describes himself as a Republican and Trump supporter, and he had the chance to get a picture of the president when Trump came to North Dakota for a tax reform speech in September.

“I was 20 feet away from him,” Hanson said. “It was a good meeting and the president stayed on script.”

Hanson said he believes Trump is trying to do well, but faces a “continuous battle” in Washington, D.C. And Hanson said he's doing all he can to send his support from his Edgeley farm.

Some of his previous messages include “Drain the Swamp,” “Blue Lives Matter,” “Feel the Bern,” “GOP, get your act together,” and “Vote Trump.”

He said his Prince symbol, plowed after the singer passed away, was one of his most popular for fans all over the world, but he caught a lot of flak for his “Never Hillary” message.

The company has stepped up its efforts to cooperate with investigators after it was criticized for not taking congressional probes seriously enough.



The handover occurred this week, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about it.



What remains unclear is whether posts associated with those accounts have been deleted from Twitter's servers. Politico reported on Friday that the company had deleted the tweets in line with its privacy policy. Twitter had no comment on that report.

The company's policy calls for removing tweets that a user deletes on their own. But that policy also states that some tweets can survive the process. For instance, retweets of deleted tweets will remain live if the retweeter added a comment. Twitter also can't remove tweets that have been temporarily stored, or ""cached,"" by services such as Google or reposted on other sites.



Twitter might be able to recover some information about any deleted tweets, according to another person familiar with the situation who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation. That person added that the company is working with investigators to find information that's useful.



The account handles previously hadn't been submitted in part due to legal privacy issues, the person said.



Twitter is set to appear Nov. 1 before the Senate intelligence committee at a public hearing. Both Facebook and Google have been invited to testify at the same hearing.



Twitter previously uncovered the accounts linked to Russia's Internet Research Agency -- a notorious ""troll farm"" known for pushing out pro-Russian positions via fake accounts -- by using information provided by Facebook, which found 470 Russia-linked pages or accounts.

William Leland III, the great-great nephew of Cadillac founder Henry Leland, ordered the 1979 Trans Am in 1978 after his father agreed to co-sign for the loan. When it arrived at the dealership, Leland wouldn't allow the staff to complete any regular prep jobs and demanded they did not install a front license plate bracket. Interestingly enough, Leland never actually registered the Trans Am, but borrowed dealership plates if he needed to move it.

More people have died of their wounds in the past few hours, said Dr. Abdulkadir Adam of Aamin Ambulance. Funerals have continued and the death toll is expected to rise further.

Saturday's truck bombing targeted a crowded street in Mogadishu, and about 300 others were injured. Somalia's government is blaming the Al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab extremist group, which has not commented.

More than 70 critically injured people were being airlifted to Turkey for treatment on Monday as international aid began to arrive, said officials. Nervous relatives stood on the tarmac at the airport, praying for the recovery of their loved ones.

Overwhelmed hospitals in Mogadishu were struggling to assist other badly wounded victims, many burned beyond recognition.

The attack was one of the worst in the world in recent years. It is one of the deadliest attacks in sub-Saharan Africa, larger than the Garissa University attack in Kenya in 2015, in which 148 died, and the U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, in which about 219 were killed.

In addition to Tukey, Kenya and Ethiopia have offered to send medical aid in response to what Somali's government has called a ""national disaster,"" said Information Minister Abdirahman Osman.

Al-Shabab, Africa's deadliest Islamic extremist group, often targets high-profile areas of Mogadishu. Earlier this year, it vowed to step up attacks after both the Trump administration and Somalia's recently elected president announced new military efforts against the group.

The country's Somali-American leader, President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, has declared three days of mourning and joined thousands of people who responded to a desperate plea by hospitals to donate blood.

""This is really horrendous, unlike any other time in the past,"" said Dr. Mohamed Yusuf, the director of Medina hospital.

Exhausted doctors struggled to keep their eyes open, while screams from victims and newly bereaved families echoed through the halls.

Mogadishu, a city long accustomed to deadly bombings by al-Shabab, was stunned by the force of Saturday's blast. The explosion shattered hopes of recovery in an impoverished country left fragile by decades of conflict, and it again raised doubts over the government's ability to secure the seaside city of more than 2 million people.

The United States has condemned the bombing, saying ""such cowardly attacks reinvigorate the commitment of the United States to assist our Somali and African Union partners to combat the scourge of terrorism."" It tweeted a photo of its charge d'affaires in Somalia donating blood. But the U.S. Africa Command said U.S. forces had not been asked to provide aid.

The U.S. military has stepped up drone strikes and other efforts this year against al-Shabab, which is also fighting the Somali military and over 20,000 African Union forces in the country.

Saturday's blast occurred two days after the head of the U.S. Africa Command was in Mogadishu to meet with Somalia's president, and two days after the country's defense minister and army chief resigned for undisclosed reasons.

Daniel Rushing, 64, sued the city of Orlando after he was arrested in December 2015 on drug charges. Law enforcement had spotted four small flakes of glaze on his floorboard and thought they were pieces of crystal methamphetamine.

Rushing told the officers they were likely bits of the Krispy Kreme doughnut he’d eaten earlier, but he was arrested for possession of methamphetamine after two roadside drug tests tested positive for an illegal substance.

""I couldn’t believe it,” Rushing told the Orlando Sentinel. “I’ve never even smoked a cigarette before, let alone meth.”

Weeks later, a state crime lab cleared Rushing of the drug allegations and charges against him were dropped.

Rushing told the Orlando Sentinel that he has been trying to open up a security business, but can’t because of his arrest record.

“I haven’t been able to work,” Rushing said. “People go online and see that you’ve been arrested.”

Rushing, a retiree from the Orlando Parks Departments, received a check for $37,500 last week and told the Sentinel he’s pleased with the outcome of his case.

Cpl. Shelby Riggs-Hopkins wrote in a Dec. 11 arrest report that she noticed flakes on Rushing’s floorboard. The police department at the time said the arrest was lawful and didn’t explain why the glaze tested positive for amphetamine in both field tests.

Riggs-Hopkins was given a written reprimand for making an improper arrest, and the Orlando Police Department ended up training more than 730 officers on how to properly use field-test kits.

Here's your Fox News First 5 - the first five things you need to know today:

Report: The Clinton Foundation will not return Harvey Weinstein donations

The Weinstein sex scandal continues to grow

President Trump, Senate Majority Leader McConnell to have closely-watched agenda-setting meeting

Amb. Nikki Haley: Trump administration hopes to remain in the Iran nuclear deal

Colin Kaepernick files grievance accusing NFL owners of collusion

Let's take a closer look at these stories ...

THE LEAD STORY: The Clinton Foundation reportedly will not return as much as $250,000 in donations from disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein following multiple accusations of sexual harassment and rape ... The foundation said donations, ranging from $100,000 to $250,000, have already been spent on projects, The Daily Mail reported. The move to keep the money was expected following tweets from the foundation's spokesman Craig Minassian. ""Suggesting @ClintonFdn return funds from our 330,000+ donors ignores the fact that donations have been used to help people across the world,” Minassian tweeted.

The calls to return Weinstein's money were prompted after multiple actresses accused the Hollywood executive of sexual assault and rape, forcing numerous politicians and organization to grapple with the dilemma. When asked about Weinstein's donations last week, Hillary Clinton said ""there's no one to give it back to"" and that she would give any Weinstein contributions to charity. Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton avoided answering questions about Weinstein's donations outside a Clinton Global Initiative University event at Northeastern University over the weekend.

WEINSTEIN SCANDAL ESCALATES: The sex scandal surrounding disgraced Hollywood mogul continues to grow as several more women have come forward with new allegations ... The new accusations made public over the weekend involved the following: British actress Lysette Anthony says Weinstein raped her in the hallway of her London home in the late 1980s while another unnamed accuser says she was raped by the mogul in 1992, according to Britain’s The Sunday Times and The BBC; in addition, British police are investigating three allegations of sexual assault against Weinstein, all made by the same woman, who says she was assaulted in London in 2010, 2011 and 2015; and the NYPD is investigating a woman’s claim that Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him inside his Tribeca office in 2004, The New York Post reported.

TRUCE BETWEEN TRUMP AND MCCONNELL? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is set to sit down with President Donald Trump in a White House meeting that could help patch their relationship, which fractured over the summer when the two leaders took shots at each other over health care reform and the effectiveness of Congress ... Back in August, Trump said he was ""very disappointed in Mitch,"" after McConnell said Trump had ""excessive expectations"" about the legislative process. The meeting comes as conservative groups demand McConnell step down from his leadership role.

THE U.S. HOPES TO STAY IN IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL: U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations on said the Trump administration hopes to remain in the nuclear deal with Iran but strengthen it so the ""American people feel safer"" ... ""I think right now you are going to see us stay in the deal,” Amb. Nikki Haley said on NBC's ""Meet The Press."" ""What we hope is that we can improve the situation,"" she continued. ""And that's the goal. … It’s not that we’re getting out of the deal. We’re just trying to make the situation better so that the American people feel safer."" Haley's comments come days after President Trump announced he will decertify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. She was one of the voices inside the administration pushing Trump not to certify the 2015 deal brokered by former President Obama and other nations – including Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia – so that it could weigh a ""proportionate"" response to Tehran and to send a clear message to North Korea over its nuclear ambitions. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also said the administration will stay put but wants the pact to reflect US goals in the region.

A HAIL MARY PASS FROM KAEPERNICK: Unemployed quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who sparked backlash by starting the trend of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem, has filed a grievance accusing NFL owners of colluding against him under the latest collective bargaining agreement, according to a report ... Bleacher Report’s Mike Freeman said in a series of tweets that the controversial athlete has hired attorney Mark Geragos ""who has represented numerous high profile clients."" Geragos said in a statement that he filed the grievance ""only after pursuing every possible avenue with all NFL teams and their executives."" Kaepernick threw for 2,241 yards, 16 touchdowns and four interceptions for the San Francisco 49ers during the 2016 season. However, since becoming a free agent, Kaepernick has had difficulty finding a job over the league-wide demonstrations during the national anthem that protest social injustice.

Who’da thunk?

Who would possibly have thought Tennessee Republican and Trump-supporting Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn - a candidate to succeed out-going Senator Bob Corker - would have anything in common with Rose McGowan, the hardworking film, television actress and LGBT activist? Two worlds, and worlds apart.

Until it came to Twitter.

McGowan, it was revealed by the New York Times in the ever burgeoning Harvey Weinstein scandal, had:

“…reached a $100,000 settlement with Mr. Weinstein in 1997 after a hotel room incident at the Sundance Film Festival, and in recent days has been vocal in her support of women who have stepped forward to reveal that the producer sexually harassed them or worse.

On Tuesday, after the actor Ben Affleck tweeted that the allegations against Mr. Weinstein “made him sick,” Ms. McGowan called him a liar, saying he had long been aware of what Mr. Weinstein had done. She has also attacked Hollywood players who failed to criticize Mr. Weinstein, writing in a tweet, ‘You all knew.’”

Of a sudden, McGowan found that Twitter had “locked” her account. The Times headline read:

Rose McGowan’s Twitter Account Locked After Posts About Weinstein

The Times story began:

“The actress Rose McGowan said in an Instagram post overnight that her Twitter account had been temporarily locked after a series of posts about Harvey Weinstein’s misconduct, including toward her.

“TWITTER HAS SUSPENDED ME. THERE ARE POWERFUL FORCES AT WORK. BE MY VOICE,” Ms. McGowan wrote on her Instagram page after midnight Eastern time on Thursday. She included a snapshot of a message from Twitter saying she would be able to send only direct messages from her account unless she deleted tweets that violated Twitter rules.

The screenshot announced a temporary freeze that prevented her from tweeting, retweeting or liking for 12 hours. Unlike a full suspension, this measure left her account visible.”

Hold that thought and move on to Marsha Blackburn. The Tennessean headline is here:

Twitter pulls Marsha Blackburn's Senate campaign ad over 'sale of baby body parts' line

This story begins:

“Republican U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn's online video announcing her campaign for U.S. Senate has been blocked in any Twitter advertisements after the social media company objected to a line that refers to the lawmaker stopping the ‘sale of baby body parts.’

Blackburn's campaign announced Twitter's decision on Monday after a representative from Twitter informed her campaign that the line ‘had been deemed an inflammatory statement that is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.’ The language violates Twitter's policy for advertisements, the company said.

‘If this is omitted from the video it will be permitted to serve,’ a Twitter representative said in an email to a political ad agency working for the campaign.”

Eventually, the fans and friends of each woman rallied and Twitter recanted in both cases. McGowan’s tweet, Twitter said, included a private phone number in the screen shot. Once corrected her account was unlocked. In Blackburn’s case, Twitter also recanted the day after it had blocked the Congresswoman’s video. The Twitter statement read:

“Our ads policies strive to balance protecting our users from potentially distressing content while allowing our advertisers to communicate their messages. Nowhere is this more difficult than in the realm of political advertising and the highly charged issues that are often addressed therein. After further review, we have made the decision to allow the content in question from Rep. Blackburn’s campaign ad to be promoted on our ads platform.”

“While we initially determined that a small portion of the video used potentially inflammatory language, after reconsidering the ad in the context of the entire message, we believe that there is room to refine our policies around these issues.”","Rose McGowan, Marsha Blackburn, the Power of Twitter and the Media",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/16/rose-mcgowan-marsha-blackburn-power-twitter-and-media

Throughout October, universities across the nation are warning their students against Halloween costumes some consider offensive.

Gone are the days when college students could dress up without fear of being reported to a bias response team. In recent years, more and more campus leaders have made it their mission to warn students what not to wear.

Fliers, memos, workshops and more impart the admonitions.

“Unacceptable costumes” listed on a University of St. Thomas diversity flier are “wearing Native American headdresses, dressing up as a ‘Mexican’ by wearing a sombrero, dressing as a ‘geisha,’ any form of blackface.”

“Cultural appropriation is defined as ‘the act of taking intellectual and cultural expressions from a culture that is not your own, without showing that you understand or respect the culture,'” explains a University of St. Thomas diversity memo to students.

With a relentless lineup, flawless relief pitching and a collective charisma epitomized by the bat-flipping Yasiel Puig, the Dodgers are still unbeaten in the postseason and off to a strong start in the NL Championship Series.

Chris Taylor hit a tiebreaking homer in the sixth inning, Puig added a homer and an RBI double to his dynamite postseason, and the Dodgers overcame a short start by Kershaw for a 5-2 victory over the Chicago Cubs on Saturday night in the NLCS opener.



""We just tried to set the tone early against the Cubs,"" closer Kenley Jansen said. ""We understand they're the defending champions, so they're a really good team. We understand that we won 104 games, but right now it doesn't matter.""



Charlie Culberson doubled, drove in the tying run and scored another while replacing injured All-Star shortstop Corey Seager for the resourceful Dodgers, who improved to 4-0 in this postseason.""

With another collective offensive effort and four innings of perfect relief for Kershaw, the Dodgers calmly overcame an early two-run deficit and took the first game of this rematch of the 2016 NLCS, won in six games by the Cubs on the way to their first World Series championship in 108 years.



""It's two different ballclubs,"" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.

""There are some similar players, but I think that the season we had versus the season they had last year, I think that you could parallel those two, and the confidence we have in our group, and they had in their group last year. I just know that this year we're a very focused group, very confident group.""

The Dodgers hadn't won the opening game of an NLCS since 1985. Game 2 is Sunday, with Rich Hill starting at home against Chicago's Jon Lester.



Kershaw pitched five innings of four-hit ball, but the Los Angeles ace fell behind 2-0 before getting pulled for a pinch-hitter during the Dodgers' tying rally.



After winning 104 games in the regular season and sweeping Arizona in the Division Series, the Dodgers have a lineup and bullpen equipped to handle almost anything. They made Kershaw's latest laborious postseason start virtually irrelevant, just as they did after he gave up four homers in his 2017 playoff opener against the Diamondbacks last week.



Albert Almora Jr. hit a two-run homer in the fourth, but the final 18 batters failed to reach base for the weary Cubs, still bouncing back from a 10-hour cross-country flight after finishing off Washington in an epic Game 5 late Thursday night.



""Their bullpen is pretty firm, and we have to really get our feet back on the ground,"" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.



Puig added another huge offensive game to his recent surge with his first career postseason homer -- though in a postgame interview on TBS, he was convinced he had hit one before.



The Cuban slugger also included his usual array of creative bat discards and portentous pauses at the plate.



Los Angeles finally got rolling in the fifth when Logan Forsythe and Austin Barnes drew one-out walks before Puig hammered a double to left-center. The ebullient Cuban slugger headed to second only after flipping his bat and spreading his arms wide at the plate.



Puig's sky-high homer off Mike Montgomery in the sixth barely got over the fence in left. Puig is 7 for 15 with six RBIs in the Dodgers' first four playoff games.



""I grew up a little bit,"" Puig said. ""(I'm) going to home plate having fun, because I know (if) I hit nothing, (if) I do nothing in the game, my teammates are going to have my back.""



Kenta Maeda got three outs and the victory in his latest standout relief effort, and Jansen struck out all four batters he faced for his third save this postseason.



Kershaw's inability to match his sublime regular-season performances in the playoffs is a central theme of his career. The three-time NL Cy Young Award winner won the NLDS series opener last week despite giving up four homers at Dodger Stadium, and Almora's shot made him the first Dodgers pitcher to yield five homers in a single postseason.

The two were also expecting their first child together when Austin suffered the severe medical complication that his doctors blamed on energy drinks, wrote Brianna in a post that has since been removed from Facebook.

“Being pregnant is supposed to be one of the most amazing journeys you will ever embark on,” Brianna wrote. “You're creating a new life. You are experiencing unconditional love for someone you have not even met.”

Austin's accident happened when Brianna was nine months pregnant, she wrote. She said she went to bed, then woke up to a life-changing scene.

“I still remember my mother in law waking me up that morning. ‘Austin had an accident,’"" she said. ""All I knew was that my husband was in the hospital. The worst part? I didn't know why.""

Brianna wrote that her husband had suffered a brain hemorrhage, and says doctors blamed it on “excessive energy drink consumption” after running a toxicology screen and ruling out drugs.

Austin was already in surgery by the time Brianna and family arrived at the hospital. It wasn’t until nearly five hours later that she got to see her husband, Brianna wrote.

“The next day was round two of brain surgery. Following this were strokes, seizures, swelling, and more things we weren't prepared for. There was a moment, sitting by his hospital bed, just praying he would be okay, that I knew I would never give up on him. No matter how messy our life would become. I was going to be by his side through all of it.""

Judging by photos shared of Austin and Brianna shared on Endres Photography's Facebook page — which, too, appear to have been removed from the site — doctors had removed part of Austin's skull during his surgeries.

Brianna, meanwhile, was still unsure of her husband's fate. ""After two weeks of living in a hospital, wondering if he would survive or be taken from us, [the family] made our way back home. The time had come for me to deliver our baby.”

Austin was still in the hospital when Brianna delivered their baby, but she said that “a beautiful miracle happened as I delivered our son. Austin woke up.”

“I went about a week without seeing him. I thought about him every day. I cried as I looked at my child who looked just like his daddy. When the baby was only a week old, I left him with my in-laws. I knew I needed to see Austin. I needed to tell him that our baby was here,” she said.

Theoretically, most ""invisibility cloaks"" would work by smoothly guiding light waves around objects so the waves ripple along their original trajectories as if nothing were there to obstruct them. Previous work found that cloaking devices that redirect other kinds of waves, such as sound waves, are possible as well.

But the new study's researchers, from at the Technical University of Vienna, have developed a different strategy to render an object invisible — using a beam of invisibility. [Now You See It: 6 Tales of Invisibility in Pop Culture]

Complex materials such as sugar cubes are opaque because their disorderly structures scatter light around inside them multiple times, said study senior author Stefan Rotter, a theoretical physicist at the Technical University of Vienna.

""A light wave can enter and exit the object, but will never pass through the medium on a straight line,"" Rotter said in a statement. ""Instead, it is scattered into all possible directions.""

With their new technique, Rotter and his colleagues did not want to reroute the light waves.

""Our goal was to guide the original light wave through the object, as if the object was not there at all. This sounds strange, but with certain materials and using our special wave technology, it is indeed possible,"" study co-author Andre Brandstötter, a theoretical physicist at the Technical University of Vienna, said in the statement.

The concept involves shining a beam, such as a laser, onto a material from above to pump it full of energy. This can alter the material's properties, making it transparent to other wavelengths of light coming in from the side.

""To achieve this, a beam with exactly the right pattern has to be projected onto the material from above — like from a standard video projector, except with much higher resolution,"" study lead author Konstantinos Makris, now at the University of Crete in Greece, said in a statement.

The pattern that is projected onto an object to render it invisible must correspond perfectly to the inner irregularities of that item that usually scatters light, the researchers said.

""Every object we want to make transparent has to be irradiated with its own specific pattern, depending on the microscopic details of the scattering process inside,"" Rotter said in a statement. ""The method we developed now allows us to calculate the right pattern for any arbitrary scattering medium.""

Rotter and his colleagues are now carrying out experiments to see whether their idea will actually work. ""We think that an experiment would be easiest to perform in acoustics,"" Rotter told Live Science. For instance, loudspeakers could generate sound waves to make a tube ""transparent"" to other forms of sound.

""For me, personally, the most surprising aspect is that this concept works at all,"" Rotter said. ""There may be many more surprises when digging deeper along these lines.""

Eventually, similar research could also experiment with light, he said. Such work could have applications in telecommunication networks, Rotter said. ""It is clear, however, that considerable work is still required to get this from the stage of fundamental research to practical applications,"" Rotter said.

The scientists detailed their findings online Sept. 8 in the journal Light: Science & Applications.

And it appears the same may be true for Weinstein’s donations to The Clinton Foundation.","Harvey Weinstein is no stranger to sex scandals – back when Bill Clinton was battling allegations he lied about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, Weinstein had the president’s back, and a hefty check in hand.

A recently uncovered 1998 story in The Washington Post lists the powerful producer – now accused of sexual harassment and assault by numerous women – among several Hollywood heavyweights who gave the maximum $10,000 to Clinton’s legal defense fund.

The detail gives a fuller picture of the longstanding financial relationship between the former first family and one of their best West Coast fundraisers. That relationship has been under the microscope after Hillary Clinton came under criticism for waiting five days to condemn Weinstein.

In eventually saying she was “shocked and appalled” by the allegations against the producer, Clinton said in a CNN interview that she would donate Weinstein’s political contributions to charity, as other Democratic beneficiaries have done. Weinstein’s contributions to her various campaigns, as well as a political committee she used to support other Democrats and a joint fund with the DNC in 2016, total more than $46,000.

Hillary Clinton, though, moved to shift the focus during a BBC interview that aired Friday, bringing up allegations against President Trump – a move that inadvertently brought up her husband’s past.

WEINSTEIN TIES TO CLINTON, OBAMA RUN DEEP

“This kind of behavior cannot be tolerated anywhere, whether it's in entertainment, politics,” Clinton said. “After all, we have someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office.”

The BBC's Andrew Marr responded by pointing out that Clinton has dismissed allegations made by women against her husband.

“That has all been litigated,” Clinton replied. “That was subject of a huge investigation in the late '90s and there were conclusions drawn. That was clearly in the past.”

Clinton, in her accusation against Trump, was referring to the infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape of Trump in 2005 in which he said he can “do anything” to women as a star, including grabbing “them by the p----.” Trump later apologized for his comments and called it “locker room talk” but has never admitted to sexual assault.

REPORT: CLINTON FOUNDATION TO KEEP WEINSTEIN DONATION

Meanwhile, the litigation Clinton referenced led to a big out-of-court settlement: $850,000 to Paula Jones, who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment.

The money Weinstein donated to the related legal defense fund is long gone. And it appears the same may be true for Weinstein’s donations to The Clinton Foundation.

The Daily Mail reported the foundation will not return as much as $250,000 in donations from the disgraced movie mogul.

The move to keep the money was expected following tweets from the foundation’s spokesman Craig Minassian.

“Suggesting @ClintonFdn return funds from our 330,000+ donors ignores the fact that donations have been used to help people across the world,” Minassian wrote on Twitter.","Harvey Weinstein helped pay Bill Clinton's legal bills during Monica era, Washington Post archive reveals",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/16/harvey-weinstein-helped-pay-bill-clintons-legal-bills-during-monica-era-washington-post-archive-reveals.html

And real men don't marry feminists.
To improve the state of marriage in this country, what we need are fewer feminists and fewer Uncle Tims.
We need real men who aren't afraid to stand up to feminist gobbledygook.","Editor's note: The following column first appeared on SuzanneVenker.com.

Have you ever made your husband a sandwich? If so, you should be ashamed of yourself. Don't you realize such behavior sets women back decades?

That's the message of a new article in The Daily Telegraph, entitled ""When making a sandwich is a crime against feminism,"" about an Australian woman named Maddie who asked a Facebook group of 26,186 mothers whether anyone had some yummy alternatives for her husband's lunches, which she said she makes for him every day.

Now that's what anyone I know would call a nice wife.

But that's not what Maddie was called on Facebook. Instead, she was told she was nothing but a “slave” and a “1950s housewife."" She was also “weird,” as no woman in her right mind would do something so demeaning as to make her husband lunch.

The feminist worldview is antithetical to love because its focus is solely on women: their needs, their wants, their desires, and their rights. Love can’t possibly be sustained with an attitude like that.

Here's just a sampling of some of the responses Maddie got:

“Your husband is a grown up, and you’re not his mother!”

“My husband can make his own damn lunch.”

""I make my husband the same thing he makes me. Nothing!!”

“Stuff that, hubby is a grown man. I already do his laundry and keep his children alive.”

“Our advice is to stop making his lunches.”

“My role is childcare during working hours and that’s it.”

“He’s lucky if I decide to make dinner some nights.""

That, my friends, is what feminists brought to America in the 1970s.

And it stuck.

The idea that a wife would—or God forbid, should—do anything for her husband with no expectation for anything in return—just to be nice, because, as Maddie put it, she ""loves her man"" and they ""can't afford to eat out""— makes her weak.

Honestly, is it really any wonder why the relationship between the sexes is such a mess today? Or why, as Bloomberg published just last week, married Americans are unhappier than ever? In my opinion, it is largely because there are so many women in America today who, either knowingly or unknowingly, have a feminist mind.

Feminists teach women, above all else, to stand up for themselves against the evil men of the world. Even harmless husbands fall into the category of 'evil men' since they supposedly long to lord over their wives. Thus, the knee-jerk reaction to the suggestion that a wife might serve her husband in some way—make him a drink or a meal—is to become defensive. Yet, if we turn the scenario around, if a husband were to serve his wife in any way, well, that's acceptable.

The feminist worldview is antithetical to love because its focus is solely on women: their needs, their wants, their desires, and their rights. Love can’t possibly be sustained with an attitude like that.

Of course, there are men who support feminists. My friend Helen Smith, Ph.D., refers to these type of men as ""Uncle Tims"" in her book ""Men on Strike."" An Uncle Tim is a male sellout who kowtows to feminists because he's (a) just as left-wing as they are and thus agrees with the feminist worldview, or (b) too weak to stand up for himself and knows that if he says anything he's not suppose to, he won't get sex.

Most Uncle Tims who fall under category A live on the East and West coasts. Those who fall under category B can live anywhere, but the one area of the country they're scarce is in the South and the Midwest. Because that's where the real men live.

And real men don't marry feminists.

The men who do have been feminized and are proud of not being ""the man of the house."" They see that as backwards and take pride in their progressive, non manly ways. Of course, don't expect an Uncle Tim to kill the intruder in the house on his wife's behalf—he's given up the role of provider and protector. He and his wife are equals!

Unfortunately, the Uncle Tims are often the ones who lose in the end because all too often feminist wives regret their choice to make their marriages androgynous—and the men who give up their manhood, because they thought that's what women and society wanted—are left in the dust.

To improve the state of marriage in this country, what we need are fewer feminists and fewer Uncle Tims. We need real men who aren't afraid to stand up to feminist gobbledygook. A fantastic example is Chad Prather, aka Political Cowboy—who, not coincidentally, is from Texas. Check out his very funny (and very true) video on gender INequality!

Now there's a real man.

But after a few moments of silence, it was announced the PA system failed – and there would be no playing of the Anthem.

Trinity senior fullback Ethan Suraci told Fox News the silence “felt like forever, honestly. You could hear the crowd and the opposing team” expressing disappointment over the announcement.

Suraci said he immediately started belting out the words to what he calls “America’s song,” which also happens to be his favorite song, and it seemed everyone joined in.

""There were almost three different waves of the Star-Spangled Banner going,” Coach Devanney said. Trinity’s team, Hamilton’s team, and the crowd each had started singing “almost like an echo,” but he added, “It all seemed to end on the same note.”

“That was awesome!” said sportscaster Jake Donnelly, who captured the video and posted it on YouTube. “Not many tenors on either end of the field here this afternoon, but a bunch of players that absolutely love America and love the National Anthem. That was one of the coolest things I have ever seen,” Donnelly added.

“It was a fantastic display of unity and patriotism and gave everyone in the crowd, the teams, and hopefully those who watch the video; chills of hope for a better United States of America and happiness to see us as a society beginning to heal - despite the polarization we see among the citizens and our politicians,” Suraci said.

The incident came a day before Vice President Mike Pence’s decision to leave Sunday’s NFL game between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers, when several 49er players kneeled during the Anthem.

Coach Devanney said he discussed the NFL protests with his team, calling it a “complicated issue.”

President Trump tweeted Wednesday it’s “about time” NFL’s Goodell called on players to stand for the national anthem.

The senior political science major, who identifies as a Republican and voted for Trump, agrees.

“I am in total agreement with one's constitutional right to protest. However, these players are protesting in an incorrect forum,” he said. “Why insult an entire country and all those who fell for her?”

The 5-foot-10-inch, 225-pound fullback always stands and proudly holds his hand over his heart, just as he did on Saturday.

No one really knows who first started singing the anthem in at the Jessee/Miller Field, but Coach Devanney told Fox News, “I wouldn’t be shocked if Ethan was the first one, given his love of the song.”

Trump started the Twitter battle by suggesting Democrats want to increase taxes and block the Republican reform plan.

“The Democrats only want to increase taxes and obstruct. That’s all they are good at!” Trump tweeted.

Schumer, D-N.Y., fired back, tweeting that the president’s tax plan was based on “fake math.”

“POTUS complains about fake news – this tax plan’s fake math is as bad as any of the so-called fake news he has complained about,” Schumer tweeted. “This deliberate manipulation of #s & facts could lead to messing up the good economy inherited from @POTUS44 & hurting the middle class.”

Schumer continued, “History shows tax cuts like these benefit the wealthy and the powerful to the exclusion of the middle class.”

Minutes later, Trump took a pointed shot at Schumer -- this time, over the Democratic leader’s stance on the Iran nuclear deal.

“Dem Senator Schumer hated the Iran Deal made by President Obama, but now that I am involved, he is OK with it. Tell that to Israel, Chuck!” Trump wrote. He was referring to criticism of the administration's move last Friday to decertify the Iran nuclear agreement, leaving to Congress whether to re-impose sanctions, change the law or do nothing.

Trump on Monday went on to tout the economy and the “record business enthusiasm” since the election, including a stock market ""up more than 25%"" and a drop in unemployment.

But Schumer wasn’t finished and blasted out a final Twitter rebuttal for the morning.

“As @POTUS points out, the stock market is at record highs & cos are raking in unprecedented profits, yet wages remain relatively flat. That’s proof that companies already have a cash windfall, but they’re not using it to boost wages,” Schumer tweeted. “Rather than helping biggest corps avoid paying their fair share, #taxreform should reward those cos that create jobs & raise US wages.”

The social media clash between Trump and Schumer follows weeks of discussions between the two. Earlier this month, the president and the Democratic leader spoke over the phone about a possible bipartisan plan on health care. Last month, Trump hosted Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., at the White House to discuss potential bipartisan strategies on immigration, hurricane relief funding and the overall budget.

But the outreach seems to have taken a turn, with Schumer and Pelosi frequently clashing with the president -- including over the president's recent move to cut off subsidies to insurers under ObamaCare.","Trump and Schumer clash on Twitter over Iran deal, taxes: 'Tell that to Israel, Chuck'",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/16/trump-and-schumer-clash-on-twitter-over-iran-deal-taxes-tell-that-to-israel-chuck.html

The comedian took the stage at Friday night’s amfAR gala in Los Angeles where he attempted to address the elephant in the room, the numerous sexual harassment and assault allegations against disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, by making some jokes about the man himself.

“Right here in L.A., it’s so beautiful Harvey Weinstein has already asked tonight up to his hotel to give him a massage,” he quipped, according to The Hollywood Reporter. However, the crowd didn’t seem into it.

“Shame on this pig and everyone who grunted with him,” Argento wrote, along with a video of the event.

McGowan, who has been outspoken about the scandal on social media since it broke, released a series of tweets in which she chastised Cordon and people who laughed at his set.

“Hearing the audience’s vile roars & laughs show EXACTLY what kind of HOLLYWOOD you really are,” she wrote, before saying that the late-night host is close friends with Weinstein and called him a “vile little worm,” among other, more crass insults.

The negative backlash forced the star to come forward and issue an apology.

We need to be prepared to defend against new North Korean missile launches – and there is a way to do this short of full-scale war.

One U.S. military option would be to deploy a special team of two or three guided-missile destroyers – ships especially equipped to target, track and shoot down ballistic missiles – to strategic locations off the North Korean coastline. The ships would be positioned outside the 12-mile internationally recognized maritime territorial limit, or at other locations that intelligence indicates would be effective.

Sources intimately familiar with the operations and deployments of those destroyers – and the vast capabilities of their top-secret ballistic missile defense systems – tell me such a plan could work. They say a similar strategy is one of the military options being considered at the Pentagon and at U.S. Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii. At the very least, this action would increase the costs to North Korea of continuing its missile program.

Erecting what amounts to a destroyer “fence” to contain North Korean missiles and knock them out of the sky might seem like a farfetched scheme. Can a handful of small warships really perform such a huge task?

America’s ballistic missile defense warships are outfitted with systems and weapons that have been proven in rigorous testing, including SM-3 missile interceptors. Since 2002, the Aegis combat system – a powerful weapons system used by the U.S. Navy that utilizes computer and radar technology to find, track and destroy enemy targets – has recorded 35 successful ballistic-missile intercepts in 42 test attempts. And in the last dozen tests, the SM-3s have only missed once.

While U.S. tests of our missile defense system are admittedly choreographed, the characteristics of a targeted ballistic missile in a test situation closely match those of a missile that has been deployed with bad intentions.

Nearly all of the tests pit a single U.S. missile interceptor against a single ballistic missile. Against an actual launch, the Navy could send up numerous interceptors, dramatically increasing its chances for a hit.

Up to now, North Korea has failed to prove it has the capability to launch and control a sufficiently large salvo of missiles to overwhelm a single Aegis ballistic missile defense ship, let alone two or three. Some experts speculate that North Korea, slowed as it is by international economic sanctions, might not develop that capacity until near the end of the decade or beyond.

The U.S. missile destroyers that could be formed into a team and used to knock down North Korean missiles overhead would be those outfitted with the latest version of the four-decades-old Aegis combat system. The newest series of upgrades was certified in January 2015.

All U. S. Navy destroyers and cruisers possess Aegis combat systems, which were first developed to protect ships – especially aircraft carriers – against air threats such as cruise missiles and aircraft.

However, ballistic missile defense requires different sensor settings, algorithms and missiles. Only 40 percent of the U.S. Navy’s Aegis-equipped destroyers and cruisers are designed for ballistic missile defense.

The ballistic missile defense ships depend on SM-3 missile interceptors to blow apart enemy ballistic missiles relatively soon after they enter what’s called flight midcourse, at their most vulnerable point where the atmosphere ends. This starts about 400 miles above the Earth’s surface and extends out to a few thousand miles.

SM-3s have no explosive warhead. Instead they work through sheer force, colliding with the targeted missile with the power of a 10-ton truck traveling 600 miles per hour. For very short-range missiles, SM-2 interceptors can potentially be used. New interceptors, called SM-6s, are being tested that are designed to hit longer-range ballistic missiles later in flight as they descend and re-enter the atmosphere.

Every ballistic missile defense destroyer has the capacity to launch up to 96 missiles. Each ship would have to retain some Aegis capacity for self-defense and that missile number would depend on the mission.

For argument’s sake, assume a destroyer making up part of the “fence” could aim 80 interceptors at a launched North Korean missile. That would mean two ships could unleash a fusillade of 160 missiles and three ships could fire 240. If North Korea were to triple its single-day launch rate, which with sanctions seems extremely difficult, it could possibly send a dozen missiles aloft. In that case, the odds still favor the Aegis interceptors.

Recently North Korea has focused mainly on short- and medium-range missile tests. The North has yet to prove it can launch an intercontinental ballistic missile armed with a payload that can reach the United States, despite its boasts.

If Pyongyang does deploy such missiles and they break though the fence created by U.S. ships and head toward America, the U.S. Air Force could meet them with a total of 36 ground-based interceptors launched from Fort Greely in Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Those interceptors have hit targets in 10 of 18 tests, including the last two in June 2014 and May this year.

To execute such an aggressive plan for an Aegis-ship ballistic missile defense, some parts of which appear to be already in the works, the U.S. would have to place even greater focus on ballistic missile defense missions. American fleet commanders will need to make sure destroyer captains improve their skill in basic seamanship – a proficiency called into question after the Navy recently lost two of its valuable ballistic missile defense destroyers in collisions with commercial ships.

An important step in making the fence operational would be for the U.S. to adopt rules of engagement that allow the Navy destroyers to shoot down North Korean missiles as soon as leave the country’s airspace. Current rules only allow for tracking and monitoring.

If an SM-3 misses, there’s little concern of collateral damage. The interceptor would burn up harmlessly as it reentered the Earth’s atmosphere. Even if an interceptor collided with a nuclear warhead there would likely be no nuclear explosion, experts say.

While North Korea could be counted on to rail at the “recklessness” of an Aegis interceptor taking out one of its missiles, the hornet’s nest would be stirred up far less than in the case of a U.S. invasion of North Korea’s territory or attack on a land target. In the latter two cases, the North Korean reprisal might be catastrophic, inflicting heavy casualties in South Korea.

If the moment for the destroyer fence to show its capability ever arrives, the U.S. Navy will have to make absolutely certain its missile-killing missiles don’t miss. North Korea would only feel emboldened if its greatest adversary seemed not up to the task of backing up its rhetoric with effective action.



Of course, a destroyer fence is only a short-term fix. North Korea will build more missiles and it’s only a matter of time before more countries acquire such weapons.

In the longer term, the Navy should consider upgrading more ships for ballistic missile defense. The Navy should also push forward an idea broached by shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries to develop a missile-defense variant of the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship that can be fitted out with a massive strategic antimissile battery of more than 400 interceptors or other missiles.

Similarly, more thought should be given to accelerating testing and deployment of systems that support and enable Aegis. These include the SBX-1 – a huge golf ball-shaped radar dome mounted on an oil platform that can track ballistic missiles – and additional satellites that can be used to track intercontinental ballistic missiles as they travel through space.

With bold use of proven, off-the-shelf missile-defense technology, the U.S. can turn the tables on Pyongyang, neutralizing its strategic missile threat without launching a war. The goal would be to buy enough time for cooler heads to prevail.",It’s time to deploy US ships off North Korea to knock out missiles when they’re launched,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/14/it-s-time-to-deploy-us-ships-off-north-korea-to-knock-out-missiles-when-re-launched.html

Potential jurors had already received a questionnaire including questions about their commander in chief, but defense attorneys weren't allowed to ask jurors if they voted for Trump.

Rachel VanLandingham, a former Air Force lawyer not involved in the case, said defense attorneys likely felt limited in how they could probe juror opinions.

""They lost their ability to ask all the questions they wanted to ask, one of those being: 'Did you vote for President Trump?'"" said VanLandingham, who teaches at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles. ""They felt that was very important ... for fleshing out whether a panel member could be fair.""

Beyond concerns about jurors, she said Nance has so far demonstrated his objectivity.

""His pretrial rulings have shown that he's fair,"" she said.

Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban shortly after he left his remote post in 2009. The soldier from Idaho has said he intended to cause alarm and draw attention to what he saw as problems with his unit.

He was freed from captivity in 2014 in exchange for five Taliban prisoners. Former President Barack Obama was criticized by Republicans who claimed the trade jeopardized the nation's security.

Flight QZ535 returned safely on Sunday to the airport at Perth city where many of the 145 passengers spoke to media about the fear and confusion on board.

""The panic was escalated because of the behavior of staff who were screaming, looked tearful and shocked,"" passenger Clare Askew told reporters.

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau, an accident investigator, said it was investigating the airliner's depressurization at 34,000 feet (10,363 meters).

The plane rapidly descended to around 10,000 feet (3,048 meters), an altitude to which cabins are pressurized and at which oxygen masks are no longer needed.

Data from FlightRadar, a website which tracks flights globally using GPS, shows the plane descended 23,800 feet (7,250 meters) in the space of nine minutes.

Yet Cooke Scholars have graduated with distinction from some of the top colleges and universities in the world.
Our Cooke Scholars prove every day that this is nonsense.","In many parts of the world, if you are born poor you will almost certainly stay poor for your entire life. You don’t get the chance to get a good education or go on to a well-paid career. You struggle – picking crops, mopping floors, mowing lawns, waiting on tables, or in other low-paying jobs, barely making ends meet.

But in America – known the world over as the Land of Opportunity – upward mobility is the national ideal. It doesn’t always happen, of course. But just the possibility draws immigrants from the world over to our shores – my own parents included. For most, education is the key that enables them or their children to break out of poverty and enter the middle class or go higher, as I and millions of others have been able to do.

For this reason, providing equal educational opportunity for all is vitally important – not just for students who can get college degrees that transform their lives, but for America. We need an educated workforce to keep our economy and our nation strong. We need to keep the American Dream alive.

A stereotype persists that – to put it crudely – poor kids are dumb. Cooke Scholars prove every day that this is nonsense. They are some of the smartest and most capable people on our planet. All they needed was a helping hand and financial aid to succeed.

One immigrant who achieved the American Dream and helped thousands more young people do so as well was Jack Kent Cooke. Born in Canada in 1912, he never had the chance to go to college, leaving high school during the Great Depression to help support his struggling family. He went from selling encyclopedias door to door, to leading a band, to being a runner on the floor of the Toronto Stock Exchange, to working as a salesman, to managing radio stations.

Cooke kept working his way up, becoming a part-owner of radio stations, newspapers and a magazine, and then buying a minor league baseball team in Toronto and other businesses. He immigrated to the United States in 1960 and became an even more successful businessman and owner of sports teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers, the Los Angeles Kings and the Washington Redskins.

The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which I now head as executive director, has awarded $175 million in scholarships to more than 2,300 high-achieving, low-income students from 8th grade through graduate school, along with comprehensive counseling and other support services. The foundation has also provided over $97 million in grants to organizations that serve such students.

Every year, the Cooke Foundation finds absolutely brilliant students who have overcome incredible obstacles and gives them scholarships. Some of our Cooke Scholars have been homeless, have gone hungry, have been undocumented, have suffered from serious illnesses, have been kicked out of their homes after announcing they were LGBT, have been teenage parents, and have faced other big challenges.

Yet Cooke Scholars have graduated with distinction from some of the top colleges and universities in the world. Some have become physicians, created nonprofit organizations to help others in need, become medical researchers working to prevent and cure diseases, launched successful businesses, become professors, started charter schools, written books, and taken on many other important rules. How sad it would have been if they never had the chance to get a college education and instead spent their lives in dead-end jobs.

Yet a stereotype persists that – to put it crudely – poor kids are dumb. Our Cooke Scholars prove every day that this is nonsense. They are some of the smartest and most capable people on our planet. All they needed was a helping hand and financial aid to succeed.

What’s lacking isn’t brainpower among those with low incomes. What’s lacking is the opportunity to get a higher education and the money to pay for it.

But we should be embarrassed that millions of low-income young people who do these things and are enormously talented hit a cash ceiling when they try to better themselves with a college degree. They should not be denied equal educational opportunity simply because they were born into families of modest means. If given the chance, they can make our nation proud.","America is the land of opportunity, and should be proud of it",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/08/america-is-land-opportunity-and-should-be-proud-it.html

There’s a real dearth of shows or, frankly, any entertainment that depicts marriage as fun.
Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.”And that’s exactly what the Gaineses have done on ""Fixer Upper.""","Editor's note: The following column originally appeared on Acculturated.com.

In their years on HGTV’s show, ""Fixer Upper,"" hosts Chip and Joanna Gaines achieved far more than merely getting Americans to embrace open floor plans and shiplap; they made marriage look fun again.

The Texas couple’s decision to end the show after soon-to-be-aired Season Five ensures it won’t devolve into them simply playing certain roles, trying to recapture the magic of earlier seasons.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

“This is just us recognizing that we need to catch our breath for a moment,” the Gaineses wrote on their blog. “Our plan is to take this time to shore up and strengthen the spots that are weak, rest the places that are tired and give lots of love and attention to both our family and our businesses.” In a video accompanying their blog post, Joanna spoke specifically about how quickly the couple’s four children were growing, noting that their eldest was almost a teenager and expressing how they were ready to “hunker down with our kiddos” for a time.

This is exactly what made the Gaineses so appealing. They do care about time with their family—and they’re not the kind of reality TV professionals who want to turn their family into a permanent fixture on the screen by being “on” all the time. Part of the couple’s appeal has always been their family-friendliness, their down-to-earth qualities, and the clear priority they give to living in accordance with their values.

But their decision to end the show is also appealing because the Gaineses themselves have changed: in the years since ""Fixer Upper"" began, they’ve become involved in multiple home goods lines, launched a magazine, written a book, and even opened a bakery in their hometown of Waco, Texas. While I’m happy for the Gaines’ success, the fact is they’re not the same couple facing regular problems that they were when the show launched—and frankly, yes, a reality show true to their own current reality (exploring questions like what mega chain is worth trusting for a home goods line partnership, for example) would simply not be as relatable or enjoyable to watch.

But I’m grateful for the years they gave us on ""Fixer Upper.""

There’s a real dearth of shows or, frankly, any entertainment that depicts marriage as fun. And while no doubt the Gaineses amped it up a little for the camera, the dynamics under-girding the show—the push and pull between the goofy Chip and the more serious Joanna—certainly seemed authentic, as did the joy they had in just hanging out with each other, occasionally trying to get a rise out of one another.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

In her 2011 book, ""Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?"" TV writer and actress Mindy Kaling included a section, “C’mon, Married People,” in which she wrote:

""I don’t want to hear about the endless struggles to keep sex exciting, or the work it takes to plan a date night. I want to hear that you guys watch every episode of The Bachelorettetogether in secret shame, or that one got the other hooked on Breaking Bad and if either watches it without the other, they’re dead meat. I want to see you guys high-five each other like teammates on a recreational softball team you both do for fun. I’m not saying that marriage should always be easy. But we seem to get so gloomily worked up about it these days.""

Kaling, whose own show ""The Mindy Project"" unfortunately devolved into a gloomy look at the hardships of relationships these days, concluded with the following plea:

“Married people, it’s up to you. It’s entirely on your shoulders to keep this sinking institution afloat. It’s a stately old ship, and a lot of people, like me, want to get on board. Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.”

And that’s exactly what the Gaineses have done on ""Fixer Upper."" In an era when marriage rates are down, people flirt with notions of open marriages and polygamy, and singles scour Tinder for one-night-stands, a show about home renovation unexpectedly became a celebration of how a husband and wife could be friends and partners, could complement each other and have a genuinely good time just hanging out with each other. In their interactions with each other and their four children, the Gaineses proved happiness isn’t impossible for an old-fashioned family in our modern era.",What Chip and Joanna Gaines teach us about marriage,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/05/what-chip-and-joanna-gaines-teach-us-about-marriage.html

Bleacher Report’s Mike Freeman said in a series of tweets that the controversial athlete has hired attorney Mark Geragos “who has represented numerous high profile clients.”

Geragos said in a statement posted on Twitter on Sunday that he filed the grievance “only after pursuing every possible avenue with all NFL teams and their executives.”

“If the NFL (as well as all professional sports leagues) is to remain a meritocracy, then principled and peaceful political protest — which the owners themselves made great theater imitating weeks ago — should not be punished,” Geragos said in the statement, “and athletes should not be denied employment based on partisan political provocation by the executive branch of our government. Such a precedent threatens all patriotic Americans and harkens back to our darkest days as a nation.”

Kaepernick threw for 2,241 yards, 16 touchdowns and four interceptions during the 2016 season. However, since becoming a free agent, Kaepernick has had difficulty finding a job over the league-wide demonstrations during the national anthem that protest social injustice.

Commissioner Roger Goodell, according to Bleacher Report, has denied any blackballing of Kaepernick.

“I believe that if a football team feels that Colin Kaepernick, or any other player, is going to improve that team, they’re going to do it,” he said in June to ESPN.com.

The NFL players’ union said it would support the grievance, which was filed through the arbitration system that’s part of the league’s collective bargaining agreement.

According to Fox 13 Memphis, Kaepernick may have a good case as there have been owners, such as John Mara of the New York Giants, who have publicly said that they would not hire him and the Denver Broncos reportedly would not pursue him under any circumstances.

President Donald Trump began feuding with the NFL in September after asking at a political rally in Alabama: “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a b---- off the field right now, out. He’s fired. He’s fired!’”

Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity Wednesday that the NFL should have suspended Kaepernick for kneeling during the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”

“The NFL should have suspended him for one game and he would have never done it again,” Trump told host Sean Hannity in Harrisburg, Pa. “They could have then suspended him for two games and they could have suspended him again if he did it a third time, for the season, and you would never have had a problem.”

“I will tell you,” Trump told Hannity, “you cannot disrespect our country, our flag, our anthem, you cannot do that.”

They noticed that one of the scouts seated in front of them was coughing throughout the flight, the report said.
The fluid in her joints tested positive for N. meningitidis bacteria, which means she had a blood infection with N. meningitidis that spread to her joints.
Samples taken from the husband's nose and throat also tested positive for N. meningitidis, although he did not develop further symptoms.
Both the woman and her husband were infected with the same strain of N. meningitidis that caused the outbreak in the scouts, the report said.","In a rare case, a woman contracted a potentially deadly bacterial infection while on a 12-hour flight from Japan to Germany, according to a new report.

Called meningococcal disease, this bacterial infection is generally transmitted only through close contact, for example, by kissing or living in close quarters with someone who is sick, according to the World Health Organization. The new report is only the third case ever reported of this disease being transmitted on an airplane, said Yushi Hachisu, of the Chiba Prefectural Institute of Public Health in Chiba, Japan, who helped investigate the case.

Hachisu presented the case on Oct. 5 at IDWeek, an infectious disease conference in San Diego.

Meningococcal disease is caused by the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis. About 10 percent of the population carries this bacteria in their nose and throat without showing any symptoms of disease. But the bacteria can cause serious illness if it gets into the blood or the brain. In the brain, the bacteria can cause meningitis — a swelling of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord; in the blood, it can cause and infection called septicemia.

The woman and her husband, both in their 50s, were traveling from Japan to Germany on Aug. 8, 2015, according to the report. They happened to be on the same flight as a team of Scottish and Swedish scouts who were returning from the World Scout Jamboree, an international gathering of scouts ages 14 to 17. Six of the scouts later developed meningococcal disease in an outbreak that was linked to attendance at the jamboree.

The married couple did not sit directly next to the scouts, but sat in a row behind and across the aisle from the Scottish scouts. They noticed that one of the scouts seated in front of them was coughing throughout the flight, the report said.

Once they arrived in Germany, the couple hopped on another flight to Spain, where they went sightseeing. But a few days later, on Aug. 11, the woman felt tired and developed pain in her throat and a cough. Her husband also developed pain in his throat and a mild fever.

They felt sick for the rest of their trip, but felt somewhat better upon their return to Japan on Aug. 16, the report said. However, on Sept. 19, the woman developed a sudden high fever and chills, as well as pain in her joints. She visited four health care facilities and underwent tests before she was finally hospitalized on Sept. 25.

The fluid in her joints tested positive for N. meningitidis bacteria, which means she had a blood infection with N. meningitidis that spread to her joints. Samples taken from the husband's nose and throat also tested positive for N. meningitidis, although he did not develop further symptoms. Both the woman and her husband were infected with the same strain of N. meningitidis that caused the outbreak in the scouts, the report said. The woman was treated with antibiotics and recovered.

Meningococcal disease is rare in Japan, with only about three cases per 10 million people, the researchers said.

The new report ""strongly suggests that N. meningitidis was transmitted from the Scottish scouts to the Japanese couple during their international flight,"" the researchers wrote in their report.

Still, the overall risk of transmitting meningococcal disease on an airplane is low, Hachisu said. But it can happen — in 2005, officials in Australia reported cases of two people who got sick with N. meningitidis after traveling on a flight from Los Angeles to Sydney. Officials determined it was likely that one of the infected passengers spread the bacteria to the other passenger, or both of the infected individuals got the bacteria from another person on the flight who wasn't showing symptoms.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that passengers who sit next to someone with N. meningitidis on a flight that is more than 8 hours long receive preventive antibiotics. A longer flight increases the chance of transmission, Hachisu said.

The former “Duck Dynasty” star is joining the growing team at Conservative Review TV (CRTV), a $99 per year digital streaming network for a show titled “In the Woods with Phil.” Robertson became a particularly controversial figure on the now-defunct A&E series after some comments he made in a GQ article, prompting the network to temporarily suspend him.

“What does a man do when they try to run him out of town for quoting a Bible verse?

""I saw with my own eyes that the flame went out on 21 November,"" he said. ""We re-lit the fire and kept it going for about two weeks but I thought that was not good.""

This was only a few months after Japan had won the right to host the 2020 Games, and the flame's fame was at its peak.

Nearly 70 percent of cases in Madagascar have been pneumonic plague, a form spread human-to-human that is more dangerous than bubonic plague and can trigger epidemics.

By John Bolton, For the Wall Street Journal



As Abba Eban observed, “Men and nations behave wisely when they have exhausted all other resources.” So it goes with America and the Iran deal. President Trump announced Friday that the U.S. would stay in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, even while he refused to certify under U.S. law that the deal is in the national interest. “Decertification,” a bright, shiny object for many, obscures the real issue—whether the agreement should survive. Mr. Trump has “scotch’d the snake, not kill’d it.”

While Congress considers how to respond—or, more likely, not respond—we should focus on the grave threats inherent in the deal. Peripheral issues have often dominated the debate; forests have been felled arguing over whether Iran has complied with the deal’s terms. Proposed “fixes” now abound, such as a suggestion to eliminate the sunset provisions on the deal’s core provisions.

The core provisions are the central danger. There are no real “fixes” to this intrinsically misconceived agreement. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which Iran is a party, has never included sunset clauses, but the mullahs have been violating it for decades.

If the U.S. left the JCPOA, it would not need to justify the decision by showing that the Iranians have exceeded the deal’s limits on uranium enrichment (though they have). Many argued Russia was not violating the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (though it likely was) when President Bush gave notice of withdrawal in 2001, but that was not the point. The issue was whether the ABM Treaty remained strategically wise for America. So too for the Iran deal. It is neither dishonorable nor unusual for countries to withdraw from international agreements that contravene their vital interests. As Charles de Gaulle put it, treaties “are like girls and roses; they last while they last.”",Bolton: A Slow Death for the Iran Deal,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/16/bolton-slow-death-iran-deal#commenting

Snuggling in bed under a layer of cozy covers makes for a deliciously warm feeling, especially in the face of unrelenting winter chill. If you’re in the market for a new blanket or quilt, be sure to read this guide for advice on how to choose the best bedding for your needs.

Blankets

Shopping for a blanket can feel fairly straightforward. And maybe it is. But with a little information, you’ll be more likely to bring home a product that you’ll cherish and love using.

Start with size. Typically, you’re looking for a blanket that will cover the top and sides of the mattress with a few extra inches to tuck securely underneath. Be sure to measure your mattress before you shop.

Compare fabrics. You can choose from a wide range of materials, and narrowing them down should depend on your preferences. You may suffer from allergies or prefer a smoother texture over a fuzzier one, for example.

○ Blankets made of wool are warm and provide excellent insulation on cold winter nights. Being a natural fiber, wool is breathable. Another useful quality is its ability to wick sweat and moisture away from the body, promoting a dry and warm experience. Woolen blankets are naturally fire-resistant, which makes them relatively safe to use around heat sources.

○ Usually composed of a polyester blend, synthetic fleece blankets are popular because they feel plush, velvety soft and warm. They also can wick moisture from your body, keeping you warm, dry and snug through a cold night. Synthetic fleece blankets are lighter than their woolen counterparts. It pays to ask for ones that don’t pill (produce tiny balls of fibers from abrasion). On the downside, synthetic fleece can conduct static electricity and can attract hair and dust.

○ Ideal for warm weather, a 100 percent cotton blanket is also great during spring and autumn or with air conditioning in the room. Since cotton is a natural fiber, it’s breathable. It’s also hypoallergenic and soft, making it a smart choice for babies, allergy sufferers or those with sensitive skin. When buying a cotton blanket, consider yarn size, fiber quality, thread count and construction. Typically, a good cotton blanket will have a higher thread count.

○ Blankets made of acrylic are a great alternative to their woolen or cashmere counterparts since they’re light, hypoallergenic and warm. What’s more, they are machine-washable and retain their colors.

Do a quality check. “You can really feel a good-quality textile in your hands,” says Kate Pascoe Squires, director of Australian textile company Kate & Kate. “If it feels beautiful, it usually will be. If it’s flimsy, thin or shiny, you know it’s not going to last. Be prepared for balling and pills after the first wash. Good-quality natural fibers will wash beautifully and offer you a gorgeous product for years to come.”

Compare prices. You can pick up a twin blanket for under $20, but it won’t last very long, Pascoe Squires says. “You can also purchase stunning midrange blankets that are great quality but won’t break the bank. In terms of price, you should look at between [$60 and $120] for these items. Then there are super-premium blankets, which can run up to thousands of dollars. The price reflects the beautiful materials used to knit these items, usually stunning wools, creating real heirloom pieces.”

Electric Blankets

If you’d rather invest in an electric blanket, here’s what you need to know:

○ Electric blankets use an integrated heating device to spread warmth through your bed.

○ Electric blankets for children are normally available and labeled as waterproof electric blankets.

○ Thanks to the overheat protection feature, your blanket should sense any abnormal temperature changes and switch off if it gets too hot. However, you should never leave your blanket on all night.

○ Fitted blankets remain flat and taut through the night and feel the same as the mattress underneath it. Unfitted blankets won’t fit around the corners or provide the same level of comfort as fitted ones.

○ Before making a purchase, lie on the blanket to feel its thickness, and check that the wiring is undamaged.

○ Some blankets are available with dual controls, so each partner can control the temperature on one side of the bed.

○ If your blanket has removable controls, you can safely wash it as well.

○ If your feet feel cold easily, look for a blanket with warm foot zones, which focus more heat at the bottom of the blanket.

Quilts



Quilts offer luxurious comfort and add visual warmth to your bedroom. A quilt usually consists of three layers: a fabric backing, a layer of soft batting and a fabric top. Quilting is essentially the art of stitching or tying these layers together, often in sync with the pattern of the top.

Consider the user and the climate. Typically, adults prefer heavier quilts, whereas children are comfortable with lightweight ones. When you’re buying a quilt for your child, remember that you’ll be dealing with spills and other messes.

It pays to factor in climate. Are you looking for a quilt for very cold nights or just cool weather? Do you need something that is season-specific or something that works for all kinds of weather?

Know the types of filling. Quilts filled with natural materials such as cotton, wool, feathers and down are more breathable, softer, lighter and more comfortable. They also will last longer than synthetic or microfiber fillings. Cotton makes an excellent choice for lightweight quilts.

Although down and feather fillings provide the most warmth, they are more expensive and may not be ideal for those with allergies. In these instances, options like microfiber work well since they imitate the look and feel of down without attracting dust. Cotton and wool are naturally hypoallergenic options.

RELATED: Duvet vs. Coverlet - What’s the Difference?

If you’re tired of alternating between a lightweight quilt for summer and a heavier one for winter, consider an all-season quilt.

Care for your quilt. Air your quilt every couple of weeks to keep it in great shape and enhance its longevity. Certain quilts, such as down, are best dry-cleaned, while some can be machine-washed as well. A duvet cover can protect your quilt and add to your room’s decor. Remember to read the manufacturer’s care guide that comes with your purchase.",How to choose the best bedding for cold winter nights,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/how-to-choose-best-bedding-for-cold-winter-nights.html

“Really @PartyCity? A “Build The Wall” costume?” wrote on Twitter user. “This isn’t about being politically correct, it’s about being decent [sic] human beings!!!!!”

Another furious user tweeted, “If I see anyone wearing a “The Wall” costume, fair warning, you’re getting punched. Like hard.”

Others, however, suggested that the costume was referencing Pink Floyd.

“This is not a racist costume,” argued a Twitter user. “It’s just a reference to Pink Floyd’s ‘The Wall’ album cover.”

Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is set to plead guilty Monday to charges he endangered comrades by walking away from his post in Afghanistan in 2009 -- the court case wrapping up just three years after a stunning Rose Garden spectacle in which former President Barack Obama, flanked by Bergdahl's parents, triumphantly announced the soldier's release from captivity.

Wildfires have ravaged communities across California. The mass murder of 58 people and the wounding of nearly 500 in Las Vegas was a reminder of our vulnerability and the fragility of life. And terrible damage caused by Hurricanes Harvey in Texas, Irma in Florida and Maria in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands will take years to recover from.

Too many lives were lost. Too many lives will never be the same.

Despite all this – or, rather, because of it – it’s an encouraging time to be an American. In times of great crisis, we put aside our political disagreements and come together to help those in need.

People from around the world have contributed more than $15 million to help Las Vegas victims and their families. People have stood in long lines to donate blood.

Volunteers have been streaming southward from all over the country to help those impacted by the hurricanes. Donations of food and supplies continue to come in.

As Americans, our political beliefs are part of our identity – but they’re not the sum of who we are and what we value. Every American wants a better life for the next generation. We’re also compassionate, hopeful citizens who want to help our neighbors.

I’m proud to say the consumer technology industry, which I represent, has been leading the way in helping these regions get back on their feet, through drones, donations and innovative apps.

We can’t allow this moment of unity to escape us. Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, we are all Americans – and we all are human beings moved to action by the suffering we see.

The tragic events of recent weeks prove we can still come together as a nation. We can’t afford to wait for another tragedy to force us to reach consensus on other crises we face, from the debt ceiling to the changing American workforce.

Here are three ways we can come together on critical issues:

Resist the polarizing pundits and politicians. Our news media and political system emphasize conflict. But conflict has reached such a fever pitch that the system has actually stopped working. Every day, it seems the media and politicians are trying to persuade us the people on the other side are our worst enemy and their ascension to power must be stopped at all costs.

But it’s just not true. Republicans and Democrats are people, not stereotypes. And the narrative of polarization just doesn’t stack up with the numbers: According to data from Gallup, far more Americans identify as independent than as Republican or Democrat.

So don’t add to the noise. Don’t feed the negativity with personal attacks, in person or on social media. Our nation’s future relies on our ability to put differing personalities and parties aside and focus on finding common ground on important policy decisions.

Listen to people on the other side. To reach consensus, we must learn to listen to those who have different opinions. That means varying the sources we seek out on social media and on TV.

We should go out of our way to spend time with people who differ from us – not just in terms of political perspective, but also race or gender identity, and social and educational background. By asking thoughtful questions and carefully considering our responses – both in person and online – we can create a healthier, more nuanced way of carrying out our national conversation.

Take a break from politics and focus on other things that unite us. I’ve worked in consumer tech for most of my career – a field that, at least explicitly, has little to do with politics. But the reality is that consumer tech – like everything else, from entertainment to education to energy – has a political dimension and is affected by political decisions. I spend much of my time advocating for the tech industry and reacting to policies that impact it.

But that’s not all I am. I’m also a husband, a father and a fitness geek. And the same is true of each and every one of us – we might be a Trump voter, but we’re also an “Outlanders” junkie, a wine snob, a sister. We might be a Bernie supporter, but we’re also a coffee lover, a son and a sports fan. For every one thing that divides us, hundreds of other things can bring us together.

As Americans, our political beliefs are part of our identity – but they’re not the sum of who we are and what we value. Every American wants a better life for the next generation. We’re also compassionate, hopeful citizens who want to help our neighbors.

It may have taken a series of natural and man-made disasters to remind us of that. And there certainly will be some hard conversations about national policy in the coming weeks. But if we can continue to remember that we are all Americans and that we all can come together, we will have done our country a great good.","Unity in the face of tragedy is good practice for unity, period.

Throughout October, universities across the nation are warning their students against Halloween costumes some consider offensive.

Gone are the days when college students could dress up without fear of being reported to a bias response team. In recent years, more and more campus leaders have made it their mission to warn students what not to wear.

Fliers, memos, workshops and more impart the admonitions.

“Unacceptable costumes” listed on a University of St. Thomas diversity flier are “wearing Native American headdresses, dressing up as a ‘Mexican’ by wearing a sombrero, dressing as a ‘geisha,’ any form of blackface.”

“Cultural appropriation is defined as ‘the act of taking intellectual and cultural expressions from a culture that is not your own, without showing that you understand or respect the culture,'” explains a University of St. Thomas diversity memo to students.

Meet the world’s hottest nurse — Instagram star Lauren Drain.

The gorgeous 31-year-old started her career in healthcare at age 16 and has been a cardiac registered nurse for more than eight years.

She has worked in various different roles during her accomplished career, including intensive care units as well acting as a charge nurse in operating theatres.

A post shared by Lauren Drain Kagan (@laurendrainfit) on Aug 22, 2017 at 7:22pm PDT

After years of helping patients in hospitals, Lauren realized it was having a detrimental effect on her on well-being.

She felt overworked, overstressed, overweight, fatigued and extremely unhappy, so she decided to take control of her life and get her priorities straight.

She said: ""I wanted to be a healthy, fit, strong, confident woman, actively preventing disease instead of treating everything with pills and medication.

""I wanted to change my life for the better and I wanted to help others before they lost control of their health too.""

The ultra-fit beauty never set out to become a ""fitness model.""

""I let the winter and holiday seasons get the best of me. I was unhappy with what I saw in the mirror and I felt even worse, so I decided to make a change for the better.""

FITNESS TRAINER RESPONDS TO FAT-SHAMING AFTER USA TODAY SEGMENT

She embarked on a paleo challenge, which involves eating a caveman-style diet and produced motivating results leading her to research entering competition shows.

After YouTubing to find out about the scene, she bit the bullet and signed up for her first bikini show where she placed 9th out of 30 competitors.

This spiked her interest and gave her the thirst to go for her professional card.

She hired a coach, entered more and more shows, and finally got the top spot in an amateur show, giving the opportunity to compete for money in professional body building, fitness and aesthetic shows.

She has since opened up her private Instagram account and now has over 3.6 million followers to whom she shares inspirational images of her stunning figure and workout routines, as well as the odd sexy picture of her self in tiny lingerie and bikinis.

The offending post on Icing’s social media channels featured sultry model Lacey Claire Rogers, 20, wearing heart-shaped pasties over her nipples in a see-through top.

The raunchy ad had been making the rounds on Twitter and Facebook all week.

“Loving @thelaceyclaire’s fearless look,” said the Twitter post next to the image, which shows Rogers wearing a beanie with the slogan: “Fearless.”

“Help @savethetatas with our fearless collection,” the quote continued. This was followed by the hashtag #IcingF**KCancer.

The Facebook post read: “Help us Save the ta-tas during Breast Cancer Awareness month by shopping our Fearless Collection in store and online.”

Besides the beanie, the range of products includes a lanyard, choker, pink ribbon pin and keychain.

People taking offense at the tone-deaf advertisement included 33-year-old Stage Three breast cancer sufferer Courtney Stateler, who posted a Facebook photo of herself in a surgical mask lying on a hospital bed. “Does this look fearless to you?” she asked in her comment, which has since been taken down by Icing.

Others put up pictures of women with mastectomy scars.

“This is insulting. We’ve seen women among us poisoned, radiated, permanently scarred, and suffer the long term biological fallout of breast cancer,” posted Facebook user Jaime Clark.

“Has lacy [sic] gone through breast cancer?” wonders Sun Angela. “Did she have to tell her parents and watch the anguish on their faces when she told them she had bc.”

Twitter user @Esugey originally wrote: “This is so cruel to all breast cancer patients and survivors. how could anyone sexualize breast cancer for profit, DISGUSTING.”

Icing apologized for offending its customers in a pinned Facebook post on its site.

“We apologize if our ‘Fearless’ product images have caused offence, this was not our intent, our intent is to help support valuable research in the battle against this terrible disease,” says the post.

But breast cancer survivors were not impressed.

“That’s a bulls**t apology,” wrote Facebook user and cancer survivor Ashleigh Jones. The fact that photo was ever taken shows you know nothing about breast cancer and it shows that you don’t give a damn about the fighters or survivors.”

TV host Chris Parente posted on Twitter, “big controversy: host of HUGE charity #CarouselBall, @georgelopez, makes political comments about Trump, drops f-bomb and is escorted out.” But a source close to the comedian insisted to Page Six that Lopez’s segment was “only supposed to be four minutes,” even though he was listed as the night’s emcee.

Lenny Kravitz performed at the gala, which raised $1.65 million.

Reps had no comment.

And real men don't marry feminists.
To improve the state of marriage in this country, what we need are fewer feminists and fewer Uncle Tims.
We need real men who aren't afraid to stand up to feminist gobbledygook.","Editor's note: The following column first appeared on SuzanneVenker.com.

Have you ever made your husband a sandwich? If so, you should be ashamed of yourself. Don't you realize such behavior sets women back decades?

That's the message of a new article in The Daily Telegraph, entitled ""When making a sandwich is a crime against feminism,"" about an Australian woman named Maddie who asked a Facebook group of 26,186 mothers whether anyone had some yummy alternatives for her husband's lunches, which she said she makes for him every day.

Now that's what anyone I know would call a nice wife.

But that's not what Maddie was called on Facebook. Instead, she was told she was nothing but a “slave” and a “1950s housewife."" She was also “weird,” as no woman in her right mind would do something so demeaning as to make her husband lunch.

The feminist worldview is antithetical to love because its focus is solely on women: their needs, their wants, their desires, and their rights. Love can’t possibly be sustained with an attitude like that.

Here's just a sampling of some of the responses Maddie got:

“Your husband is a grown up, and you’re not his mother!”

“My husband can make his own damn lunch.”

""I make my husband the same thing he makes me. Nothing!!”

“Stuff that, hubby is a grown man. I already do his laundry and keep his children alive.”

“Our advice is to stop making his lunches.”

“My role is childcare during working hours and that’s it.”

“He’s lucky if I decide to make dinner some nights.""

That, my friends, is what feminists brought to America in the 1970s.

And it stuck.

The idea that a wife would—or God forbid, should—do anything for her husband with no expectation for anything in return—just to be nice, because, as Maddie put it, she ""loves her man"" and they ""can't afford to eat out""— makes her weak.

Honestly, is it really any wonder why the relationship between the sexes is such a mess today? Or why, as Bloomberg published just last week, married Americans are unhappier than ever? In my opinion, it is largely because there are so many women in America today who, either knowingly or unknowingly, have a feminist mind.

Feminists teach women, above all else, to stand up for themselves against the evil men of the world. Even harmless husbands fall into the category of 'evil men' since they supposedly long to lord over their wives. Thus, the knee-jerk reaction to the suggestion that a wife might serve her husband in some way—make him a drink or a meal—is to become defensive. Yet, if we turn the scenario around, if a husband were to serve his wife in any way, well, that's acceptable.

The feminist worldview is antithetical to love because its focus is solely on women: their needs, their wants, their desires, and their rights. Love can’t possibly be sustained with an attitude like that.

Of course, there are men who support feminists. My friend Helen Smith, Ph.D., refers to these type of men as ""Uncle Tims"" in her book ""Men on Strike."" An Uncle Tim is a male sellout who kowtows to feminists because he's (a) just as left-wing as they are and thus agrees with the feminist worldview, or (b) too weak to stand up for himself and knows that if he says anything he's not suppose to, he won't get sex.

Most Uncle Tims who fall under category A live on the East and West coasts. Those who fall under category B can live anywhere, but the one area of the country they're scarce is in the South and the Midwest. Because that's where the real men live.

And real men don't marry feminists.

The men who do have been feminized and are proud of not being ""the man of the house."" They see that as backwards and take pride in their progressive, non manly ways. Of course, don't expect an Uncle Tim to kill the intruder in the house on his wife's behalf—he's given up the role of provider and protector. He and his wife are equals!

Unfortunately, the Uncle Tims are often the ones who lose in the end because all too often feminist wives regret their choice to make their marriages androgynous—and the men who give up their manhood, because they thought that's what women and society wanted—are left in the dust.

To improve the state of marriage in this country, what we need are fewer feminists and fewer Uncle Tims. We need real men who aren't afraid to stand up to feminist gobbledygook. A fantastic example is Chad Prather, aka Political Cowboy—who, not coincidentally, is from Texas. Check out his very funny (and very true) video on gender INequality!

Now there's a real man.

And I'd bet my life savings his wife isn't a feminist.",Are you weak if you make your man a sandwich? This is why real men don’t marry feminists,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/14/are-weak-if-make-your-man-sandwich-this-is-why-real-men-don-t-marry-feminists.html

“F--k Donald Trump!” was a song Macklemore led the crowd in singing at the Marquee Theatre in Phoenix, a venue able to seat 2,500 people.

Macklemore, the “Thrift Shop” rapper who has been an outspoken critic of the president and his policies, “gave a great and moving speech about inclusiveness and kindness and acceptance which led into his song ‘Same Love,’” concertgoer Vanessa Richards told Fox News.

Macklemore “then gave another speech about immigration and acceptance,” and told the crowd “that everyone should be welcome here no matter which side of the ‘line’ you stood on,” Richards told Fox News.

The concertgoer added that almost the entire crowd, packed with twentysomethings and college students, “was holding up their [middle] fingers with Macklemore unanimously.”

The song Macklemore performed Saturday — “FDT (F--k Donald Trump Part 2)” — was released in summer 2016 by YG and features G-Eazy and Macklemore.

October is an exciting month for the family. Even if you or your kids aren’t into the haunted part of Halloween, you can still embrace the festivities of fall, warmth and togetherness. Encourage your kids to exercise their imagination and creativity with these Halloween-themed crafts that everyone can participate in.

1. Family Portrait Pumpkins

Skip the mess of carving pumpkins this year by investing in some good old fashioned chalk. Simply paint a circle on each pumpkin with chalkboard paint. You’ll probably have to apply at least three coats of paint. Then, draw a self-portrait using a piece of chalk. Voila!

2. Colorful Garland

Before kids jump in the pile of leaves this weekend, encourage them to collect a few especially vibrant ones. Press the leaves in a book for a couple of hours while the kids continue to play outside. Once they’ve been flattened, show your children how to clip the leaves to a string with miniature clothespins and find spots to hang them throughout the house together.

3. Harvest Vignettes

Look to nature’s bounty for easy decor ideas. Arrange apples, pears, pumpkins, squash and gourds in baskets throughout your kitchen and dining areas. Having easy access to fruits will also promote healthy eating for your family this season.

4. Candy Laboratory

First, gather vases, jars and dishes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Then fill each container with colorful treats, like candy corn, marshmallows and of course candy eyeballs. Challenge your family members to come up with a creative new name for each candy. Crows bones, zombie zingers and pumpkin teeth are excellent examples. Arrange the jars neatly on a tray or turn a bar cart into a wonderful candy buffet.

5. Candy Corn Checkerboards

A checkerboard made from a placemat can be quickly rolled up and easily tucked away. Cut a 1½-inch square from cardstock paper to make a stencil. Start at one edge of the square and paint every other square. Precise placement and straight lines aren’t necessary in this project, which makes it great for kids. Small imperfections can even give the game a rustic or quirky look. You can use candy corn or small plastic spiders as game pieces.

6. Gothic Deskscape

Fall break is the perfect time to take a break from work and transform your home office into a spooky showcase. Open a dictionary and lay a magnifying glass on the definition of “Halloween”. Stack a pile of literature to display your favorite fall titles, like The Tell-Tale Heart or Harry Potter. Swap out a desk lamp’s lightbulb for one with an orange glow or purple hue, and don’t forget an inkwell and quill pen!

7. Mantel Accessories

Fireplace mantels are the go-to spot for any holiday decor. Find wooden display letters at your local craft store to spell out “boo” or another ghastly term above the hearth. Place a mini pumpkin or two and add some candles. A stack of books and a vase of bare branches are also great ideas.

8. Stylish Spider Webs

Tulle is great for wrapping accessories, draping over doorways and even dressing up the bushes. Don’t overlook the nooks and crannies though. This fabric is even more effective in small corners of a room since that’s where spiders hang out most anyway. You might even have to dust off a few real webs before making your own.

9. Window Decals

Shadows and silhouettes can be extra spooky this time of year. Use your interior lighting and the long dark nights to your advantage by decorating windows with DIY decals. Sketch large outlines of your favorite Halloween characters on fade-resistant paper. Then cut out your witches, skeletons, bats, cats or ghosts and tape them to the inside of your home’s windows.

10. Dip-Dyed Baskets

Prepare for trick-or-treaters this year by sprucing up a traditional candy basket. Fill a plastic container (larger than your basket) with semigloss paint. Place the basket in the paint and push down until all sides are covered to your desired height. Let the basket sit overnight on an elevated rack you don’t mind getting dirty, like an old cookie sheet. Reuse this basket all year long as stylish storage!",10 DIY Halloween decorations for all ages,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/10-diy-halloween-decorations-for-all-ages.html

So Smiley hired a pilot to fly his banner, which read ""BE AMERICAN. BOYCOTT THE JAGS AND THE NFL,"" over EverBank Field on Sunday before the Jaguars faced off against the Los Angeles Rams.

“I have the right to protest and I’m going to protest it with bumper stickers, airplanes – whatever I got to do. I will continue to protest,” Smiley told WFOX-WJAX-TV.

While Smiley may feel the players' actions are disrespectful, other Jaguars fans said the players are kneeling to garner awareness for a greater cause.

“They are taking it in a peaceful manner,"" Jaguars fan Jaumari Day told WFOX-WJAX-TV. ""They are trying to use their words and use their actions instead of taking it to violence.""

Another fan, Jay Crossman, said people need to realize the ""true message"" of the protests.

Jackson Vincent snapped these astounding photographs of the huge roo tensing its rippling muscles in Boodjidup Creek in Margaret River, Western Australia.

The 27-year-old couldn’t believe his eyes when he clocked the mammoth two meter mammal standing in the water – and feared it could be preparing to attack beloved pet dog Dharma.

Jackson, from Freemantle, Perth, had been visiting his grandmother in Margaret River and saw the gargantuan animal on her property at about 11.30am.

He said: “I have been going to that creek since I was a little boy and there have always been kangaroos on the property.

“I was walking my dog and we saw this huge roo standing in the water. I have never seen a kangaroo standing in the water like that, we could just see his head at first.

“As I ran around him to take a picture he came closer and that was when I realised he was coming right at me and he was really big – one of the biggest I have ever seen.

“I am pretty confident around animals but the moment when he started to come out of the water my heart definitely jumped and I decided to take a few steps back.

“He looked to be at least two meters tall or taller and must have weighed at least 100 [kilograms].

“He had a really big body and was taller than me. There are a lot of roos at my grandma’s place but I have never seen one that muscular before – he was a big macho male.

“I decided to get Dharma out of there as we thought the kangaroo was going to lure her into the water to drown her.”

Jackson’s Facebook post with his images of the kangaroo’s muscular physique instantly went viral, racking up thousands of likes and shares.

Online commenters were quick to point out the animal’s impressive bodybuilder-like muscular shoulders, biceps and chest and threatening posture.

After dropping Kelpie Dharma back at his grandmother’s house Jackson returned to the creek to see the kangaroo was still there.

Jackson added: “His claws were really big – they were as long as my hand. That for me was even scarier than his muscles, they looked nasty.

“I have never seen a kangaroo be so defensive – it definitely looked like he was puffing his chest muscles up.

Wildfires have ravaged communities across California. The mass murder of 58 people and the wounding of nearly 500 in Las Vegas was a reminder of our vulnerability and the fragility of life. And terrible damage caused by Hurricanes Harvey in Texas, Irma in Florida and Maria in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands will take years to recover from.

Too many lives were lost. Too many lives will never be the same.

Despite all this – or, rather, because of it – it’s an encouraging time to be an American. In times of great crisis, we put aside our political disagreements and come together to help those in need.

People from around the world have contributed more than $15 million to help Las Vegas victims and their families. People have stood in long lines to donate blood.

Volunteers have been streaming southward from all over the country to help those impacted by the hurricanes. Donations of food and supplies continue to come in.

As Americans, our political beliefs are part of our identity – but they’re not the sum of who we are and what we value. Every American wants a better life for the next generation. We’re also compassionate, hopeful citizens who want to help our neighbors.

I’m proud to say the consumer technology industry, which I represent, has been leading the way in helping these regions get back on their feet, through drones, donations and innovative apps.

We can’t allow this moment of unity to escape us. Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, we are all Americans – and we all are human beings moved to action by the suffering we see.

The tragic events of recent weeks prove we can still come together as a nation. We can’t afford to wait for another tragedy to force us to reach consensus on other crises we face, from the debt ceiling to the changing American workforce.

Here are three ways we can come together on critical issues:

Resist the polarizing pundits and politicians. Our news media and political system emphasize conflict. But conflict has reached such a fever pitch that the system has actually stopped working. Every day, it seems the media and politicians are trying to persuade us the people on the other side are our worst enemy and their ascension to power must be stopped at all costs.

But it’s just not true. Republicans and Democrats are people, not stereotypes. And the narrative of polarization just doesn’t stack up with the numbers: According to data from Gallup, far more Americans identify as independent than as Republican or Democrat.

So don’t add to the noise. Don’t feed the negativity with personal attacks, in person or on social media. Our nation’s future relies on our ability to put differing personalities and parties aside and focus on finding common ground on important policy decisions.

Listen to people on the other side. To reach consensus, we must learn to listen to those who have different opinions. That means varying the sources we seek out on social media and on TV.

We should go out of our way to spend time with people who differ from us – not just in terms of political perspective, but also race or gender identity, and social and educational background. By asking thoughtful questions and carefully considering our responses – both in person and online – we can create a healthier, more nuanced way of carrying out our national conversation.

Take a break from politics and focus on other things that unite us. I’ve worked in consumer tech for most of my career – a field that, at least explicitly, has little to do with politics. But the reality is that consumer tech – like everything else, from entertainment to education to energy – has a political dimension and is affected by political decisions. I spend much of my time advocating for the tech industry and reacting to policies that impact it.

But that’s not all I am. I’m also a husband, a father and a fitness geek. And the same is true of each and every one of us – we might be a Trump voter, but we’re also an “Outlanders” junkie, a wine snob, a sister. We might be a Bernie supporter, but we’re also a coffee lover, a son and a sports fan. For every one thing that divides us, hundreds of other things can bring us together.

As Americans, our political beliefs are part of our identity – but they’re not the sum of who we are and what we value. Every American wants a better life for the next generation. We’re also compassionate, hopeful citizens who want to help our neighbors.

It may have taken a series of natural and man-made disasters to remind us of that. And there certainly will be some hard conversations about national policy in the coming weeks. But if we can continue to remember that we are all Americans and that we all can come together, we will have done our country a great good.","Unity in the face of tragedy is good practice for unity, period.

An abandoned funeral home in Rogersville, Mo., will be transformed into a haunted house for a high school fundraiser. But some of the town’s residents are crying foul – saying it’s an inappropriate and insensitive place to hold the Halloween-themed event.

The Preston-Marsh Funeral Home has been abandoned for some time and was slated to be demolished. But the owner of the building granted permission to students from Logan-Rogersville High School to use it for a haunted house fundraiser, WYMT reported.

The Logan-Rogersville High School said proceeds from the “Rogersville Horror Story” event would go to an event for the school’s seniors on graduation night. The organizers said they were going to utilize the leftover equipment left inside the funeral home as a way to enhance the spooky experience.

""I understand why people are upset. But, it is just a building,"" Christie Davis, a resident, told WYMT. ""But, the [deceased] people are no longer there. Everybody in Rogersville has had friends or family go through this funeral home. I know I have.""

""Some of us have friends that have lost their children on graduation nights in years past, and this is just a great way to prevent that from happening to somebody else,"" Davis said.

Residents took to Facebook to express their anger at the funeral home being used as a haunted house. WYMT reported some users said it was “distasteful” and “insensitive” to use “a place for grief and mourning to make a mockery of death.”

“…As for the owners of the building, I'll never purchase anything from them ever again. They have disrespected family that said their final goodbyes in that building, where families grieved and now you're having a haunted house and in a building that we all spent time in may not been the best time but it was to say goodbye to loved ones,” another user wrote.

But others said it was an appropriate use of the building.

: “So much sadness occurred in this building. Now, for its last service to the community it gets to bring happiness and laughter, as well as some good scares to everyone...and for a good cause. What better way to end things?”

Despite the uproar, the event was slated to go on as planned, event organizers told WYMT.

Some said they were glad the event was happening because it’s for a good cause.

“This is awesome thing to donate the money and help out, everyone needs to calm down, if you don't agree don't go to it, I don't see a problem, the people who had their funerals held there probably wouldn't mind it, either. I know my family wouldn't because we're helping our community and tearing it down,” a social media user wrote.","Missouri funeral home will be converted to haunted house, prompting uproar",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/13/missouri-funeral-home-will-be-converted-to-haunted-house-prompting-uproar.html

A Texas girl’s priceless reaction to a birthday gift sent by her deployed father went viral this week in a heartwarming video.

David Villegas of San Antonio, Texas, sent his daughter, Ellianna, a teddy bear dressed as a soldier for her birthday to remember him while he was away in Fort Jackson, SC, for training, KSAT reported.

The sister of Villegas’ wife, Vanessa, captured the moment Elianna opened up her present, which she described, “looked like daddy,” but the real surprise was the message.

Vanessa told Elianna to press on the bear’s paw for a special message.

The bear, with her father's voice, told Elianna: “Hey baby, daddy loves you and misses you so, so much and I can’t wait for you to be in my arms again. I love you very much.”

The little girl’s eyes went wide before squealing in delight, “Oh my God that’s daddy!”

Elianna gave her new soldier teddy bear a big hug.

The touching moment was posted on Twitter by Vanessa’s sister and immediately went viral Wednesday. As of Saturday, the video was retweeted more than 49,000 times and liked by more than 100,000 Twitter users.

“Everyone has been basically saying ‘Oh my gosh I’m crying’ (and) another girl was even like ‘I just put on my makeup and now it’s all over my face,'” Vanessa told KSAT.

“There’s also a lot of people on Twitter saying that they wish they had that from their dad or their mom and if they can hear their loved ones voice one more time, it would have made their entire world,” Vanessa said.

She said David was ordered to travel to South Carolina for basic training in August, leaving the family of three a few weeks to spend together before he left.

“We only had three weeks to spend with him before he had to leave and, of course, we have no contact with him. Basically he’s gone for nine weeks and a couple of days,” Vanessa said. “And after that, he has to go again for longer and so he won’t be back until April (2018).”

Vanessa said the deployment as hard on her daughter who has never been away from her father for this long.

“It really meant a lot to give that to her so she can play it every time she misses him and it helps her a lot,” she said. “It’s tough but in the end, I know it’ll be worth it.”

Vanessa and Elianna plan to travel to South Carolina and visit David in November when he graduates.",Texas soldier sends daughter custom teddy bear and her reaction is priceless,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/14/texas-soldier-sends-daughter-custom-teddy-bear-and-her-reaction-is-priceless.html
