Waymo, hatched from a Google project started eight years ago, showed off its progress Monday during a rare peek at a closely guarded testing facility located 120 miles (193 kilometers) southeast of San Francisco. That's where its robots complete their equivalent of driver's education.

The tour included giving more than three dozen reporters rides in Chrysler Pacifica minivans traveling through faux neighborhoods and expressways that Waymo has built on a former Air Force base located in the Californian Central Valley city of Atwater.

The minivans smoothly cruised the roads — driver's seat empty and passengers in the back — at speeds of up to 35 mph (56 kph). By contrast, the Waymo-powered minivans that have been driving volunteer riders in the Phoenix area still use safety drivers to take over control if something goes wrong.

Since Google began working on self-driving cars in 2009, dozens of established automakers such as General Motors and Ford Motors have entered the race, along with other big technology companies, including Apple and ride-hailing service Uber. The competition is so fierce and the stakes so high that Waymo is currently suing Uber , alleging that one of its former managers stole its trade secrets and took them with him when he joined Uber in 2016 as part of an elaborate scheme.

Rose, now 69, served as a medic in the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group, an elite division of the Special Forces. It was so secret that, for more than four decades, he never spoke about it to anyone – not even the people he served with.

Those that served with him, however, never forgot the bravery he showed during a four-day mission, called “Operation Tailwind,” in the landlocked country in September 1970.

Rose, then a sergeant, ran through a hail of gunfire to treat more than 50 soldiers who were fighting the North Vietnamese Army – using one hand to hoist wounded men onto his back while he fired on the enemy with his other hand.

In spite of his own injuries, he didn’t sleep for days to make sure all 16 American soldiers deployed with him made it home.

They did.

Forty-seven years later, Rose was commemorated for his ""extraordinary selfless service"" on Monday when he received the Medal of Honor during a ceremony with President Trump at the White House.

""For many years the story of Mike's heroism has gone untold. But today we gather to tell the world of his valor and proudly present him with out nation's highest military honor,"" Trump said.

The president recounted the details of Rose's time in battle before awarding him the medal, recognizing ""the true American hero that he is.""

Following the ceremony, Rose told reporters that he considered the award to be ""a collective medal"" for all of the servicemen who fought in the battle and was ""convinced that they have been recognized for the great service that did to this country.""

""This is our medal, it's not mine. We all earned it,"" Rose said.

Rose enlisted in April 1967 at the urging of his father – to avoid getting drafted by the Navy or the Marine Corps. In 1968, he graduated as a Special Forces medic and was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group before being reassigned to the 46th Special Forces Company headquartered in Thailand a year later.

It was there, in April 1970, that Rose was assigned to the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group. The unit’s real purpose was to join forces with local fighters to attack North Vietnamese forces in Laos – officially off limits for combat, USA Today reported.

On Sept. 11, 1970, the unit – comprised of Americans, Vietnamese and indigenous paramilitary Montagnard personnel – were sent deep into enemy territory. As soon as they made contact, two Americans and two Montagnards were wounded, and Rose jumped into action.

The Army said the gunfire got so intense Rose had to crawl from position to position to treat the wounded.

“The actions that Mike performed during that operation, you can’t imagine it, you can’t put it into words,” said retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley, who was in charge of the unit, on Friday. “We were going into an area that U.S. forces had not been in….Had we not come out the day we were extracted, we probably would not have left.”

During the extraction of the troops, one of the helicopters crashed to the ground, injuring many on board and killing one.

Ignoring his own injuries – sustained earlier in the mission – Rose re-entered the destroyed helicopter to pull a solider to safety. McCarley said the soldier shouldn’t have survived, but did, thanks to Rose.

“I had the opportunity to meet with him [years later]…it had not affected him in any way,” he added. “Mike did a miraculous job.”

Despite the many who were wounded, only three men died during the four days of almost constant gunfire deep in enemy territory.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more. I’m proud of him, [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.” - Retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley

“My job was to focus on the individuals that were hurt,” he said on Friday. “When you focus, you don’t concern yourself on getting hurt or killed. You just have to do your job and keep going down the road.”

For his bravery, Rose earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation’s second-highest award for valor.

But what happened during those four days in Laos were never mentioned.

“When we left MAG SOC, the unit did not exist. If anyone asked me, I was going to be a mail clerk during the Vietnam War,” Rose said.

That is until 1998, when a report by CNN and Time magazine revealed Rose and the soldiers in Operation Tailwind were sent to Laos to capture American defectors and had used deadly Sarin nerve gas during the attack.

A Pentagon investigation dismissed the report, saying the mission focused on collecting intelligence on the logistics of the North Vietnamese army and destroying their supplies.

While the story of Rose’s valor has now led to a Medal of Honor, however, the covert operations by the U.S. in Laos are still obscured as somewhere “deep in enemy-controlled territory.”

McCarley said he was disappointed Rose had previously only received the Distinguished Service Cross, saying he deserved the top honor.

For more than 40 years, McCarley and others in the military and government fought to get the award upgraded.

Last year, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Medal of Honor for Rose, waiving the five-year time limit for the events that happened 47 years ago.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more,” McCarley said. “I’m proud of him [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.”

Rose, who was joined by his wife, Margaret Rose, and their children and grandchildren -- as well as 10 of the men who served with him in Laos -- said he considers it a privilege to be part of the small group of service members who have received the Medal of Honor.

“We cannot forget these men and women who served this country valiantly,” he said.","Army Capt.

The network has announced the premiere date of “Gunpowder,” starring Kit Harington.

In partnership with BBC One, HBO will debut the three-part thriller based on the events in the 17th century that led to Guy Fawkes Day. In addition to starring, Harington will co-executive produce the show. The reason the star is taking such a commanding role in this project is simple, it’s a family thing.

The star is a descendant of Robert Catesby, the central figure of the series and mastermind behind the infamously-foiled gunpowder plot. He’s also who the Jon Snow actor will be playing.

“We are delighted to offer a platform for a project that is so close to Kit harington’s heart,” Kary Antholis, president of HBO Miniseries and CINEMAX programming said in a statement. “Kit’s passion for and believe in ‘Gunpowder’ are evident in every frame of the miniseries.”

Catesby was a driving force behind the 1605 plot in London to kill James I. The series will depict a time when Catholics were persecuted by Protestant England. Catesby’s refusal to abandon his religion brings him “to the edge of financial, social and psychological ruin” as he navigates a shadow game involving spies and a government dedicated to hunting him, his family and priests down to torture and kill.

Court papers filed Friday say about $1.65 million would go upfront to the widow and daughter of Jason Simcakoski, of Stevens Point, Wis., who was 35 when he died in 2014 at the Tomah VA facility. Another $659,000 would go into annuities for Simcakoski's widow, Heather, and their daughter, Anaya. The rest would go to attorney fees and expenses.

Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said on Twitter that Trump was unfairly blaming Schumer for the diversity visa program.","Vowing to ""stop this craziness,"" President Donald Trump on Wednesday urged tougher immigration measures based on ""merit"" after the deadly truck attack in New York City.

Trump said on Twitter that the driver in Tuesday's attack ""came into our country through what is called the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program,' a Chuck Schumer beauty"" — a reference to the Senate's Democratic leader.

Schumer fired back from the Senate floor, accusing Trump of ""politicizing"" the tragedy.

Officials said the attacker is an immigrant from Uzbekistan who came to the United States legally in 2010. They haven't said whether he was admitted through the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, which covers immigrants from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S.

Trump also tweeted: ""We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems. We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter)."" Trump has backed legislation that would curb legal immigration and shift the nation toward a system that would place an emphasis on merit and skills over family ties.

The tweets followed Trump's Tuesday night statement that he ordered the Department of Homeland Security ""to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program."" Trump's policy entails more stringent investigative measures intended to identify would-be immigrants who may sympathize with extremists or pose a national security risk to the United States.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump proposed a total ban on Muslim immigration to the U.S., before embracing ""extreme vetting."" Trump's efforts to block immigrants from several Muslim-majority countries have been tied up in litigation in federal courts.

The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the source of Trump's tweet. Trump cited ""Fox and Friends"" on Twitter as he attacked Schumer and the program. Trump added: ""We will stop this craziness.""

The diversity visa program provides up to 50,000 visas annually by lottery. Applicants must have a high school diploma or meet work experience requirements. It was created as part of a bipartisan immigration bill introduced by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and signed into law by Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1990.

Schumer, a New York Democrat who was a member of the House of Representatives at the time, proposed a program for ""diversity immigrants"" in a bill he offered earlier that year.

Speaking on the Senate floor Wednesday, Schumer said he has ""always believed that immigration is good for America."" He also criticized Trump for ""politicizing"" the deadly attack, comparing his response to President George. W. Bush's after 9/11.

""President Trump, where is your leadership,"" Schumer said. ""The contrast between President Bush's actions after 9/11 and President Trump's actions this morning could not be starker.""

He said Trump had proposed cutting anti-terrorism funding in his most recent budget.

""I'm calling on President Trump to rescind his proposed cuts to this vital anti-terrorism funding immediately,"" Schumer said.

Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said on Twitter that Trump was unfairly blaming Schumer for the diversity visa program. Flake, one of Trump's chief Republican foes in Congress, said Schumer was among a group of eight Republican and Democratic senators who proposed eliminating the program three years ago as part of a broader bipartisan bill to overhaul U.S. immigration laws.

Flake, who served on that ""Gang of Eight"" with Schumer, said: ""I know. I was there.""

The immigration bill ultimately failed in the GOP-led House after passing the Senate in June 2013, 68-32, with 14 Republicans joining Democrats.

Flake recently announced he's not running for re-election but says he won't be silent about Trump's politics and behavior.","Trump wants tougher immigration after attack, faults Schumer",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/01/trump-wants-tougher-immigration-after-attack-faults-schumer.html

Copyright © Eric Metaxas, 2017.","Editor's note: The following is an excerpt from Eric Metaxas' new book, ""MARTIN LUTHER: The Man Who Rediscovered God and Changed the World.""

One of the greatest challenges in telling the story of Martin Luther is distancing him from the endless fables, myths, and tall tales told about him in the last five centuries.

During his lifetime, Luther’s celebrity grew at such a pace that the momentum of it could not be slowed even by his death. In fact, the magma of his celebrity soon cooled into hagiographic stone, such that much of what the world has come to “know” about him is fiction. The most well-known ”facts“ of his life illustrate the point.

First, he was born into a family of peasants, the poor son of a miner who was raised in a home humble and cramped; second, his hardscrabble upbringing was a brutal one in which his dour working-class father buffeted him so viciously that it warped his psyche, causing him to see God the Father as a similarly glowering and sadistic figure to be placated and assuaged in endlessly humiliating religious contortions—or to be avoided entirely.

Third, it was a literal bolt of fire from the heavens that caused the jumpy twenty-one-year-old suddenly to blurt out a binding vow—one he had never previously considered but that in his abject fear he indeed spoke—and then felt duty bound to honor the rest of his born days, thus leading him to become a monk.

Fourth, it was on a trip to Rome that he was so shocked at the blasphemous devilry of that vile city that he decided he must destroy the soft and decadent Italian church and remake it in his own uncompromising and upright German image.

Fifth, he began this lifelong project by angrily and defiantly hammering his damning accusations against Rome onto the very door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, thus putting the quivering pope on notice that his deeds had been weighed in the balance and found wanting.

Sixth, after his great stand at the Diet of Worms—where he said, “Here I stand. I can do no other!”—he fled to the Wartburg, where in his overflowing umbrage he took on the devil personally and at least once punctuated his fury by hurling a pot of ink at the fiend who dared to trespass his quarters. Indeed, anyone who doubts this need only go to the Wartburg to see the swart blots themselves, still staining the wall of his cell these five centuries later.

Seventh, the nun he married escaped from her nunnery by hiding inside a large barrel that had only just been emptied of herring. In fact, all of the twelve nuns hid in filthy herring barrels secured to the wagon that hurtled them away to freedom.

These important details have been recounted innumerable times and are being confidently recounted this minute, told in tours of Luther sites around Germany in many languages, being written and read in otherwise excellent books about Luther, and posted in online articles and blogs. But not a single one of these seven things is true. They are each sloppy glosses on the actual facts and have over time congealed and finally ossified into the marmoreal narrative that has existed for half a millennium.

Parson Weems’s pious legends of Washington chopping down cherry trees and casting silver dollars across the wide Potomac persisted for about 150 years, but these false details about Luther have persisted for more than three times as long.

Their cultural roots are therefore that much deeper. It is my hope that ""Martin Luther"" will do its humble part in uprooting them.

Halloween has lived up to its reputation in New York.

Now, there may be a legitimate debate about whether President Trump is unfairly singling out Muslims in his efforts to make America safe. But when a terrorist kills Americans – this time, with a rental truck – and then shouts “God is great” in Arabic, the president’s zeal is understandable.

There is no way to protect every block in our cities, every field on our farms, every school in our suburbs. We have become accustomed to our freedom to move around as we wish, and to gather with whom we choose.

No one could have foreseen Tuesday’s sinister mission to turn a vehicle into a deadly weapon. We stroll our streets without paying attention to what’s around us, intent on reading or sending text messages, or watching videos on our phones. If we’re on a bike lane, we assume no four-wheel vehicles will intrude.

The problem is that terrorists – those whose perverted view equates God’s greatness with acts of bloodshed – know how clueless we are, and exploit our assumption that nothing bad can happen to us. And it is that careless confidence that makes us easy prey, soft victims for determined evildoers.

Even before the names of the perpetrator and the dead and injured are known, there will be warnings not to stereotype, not to sully the reputation of any faith or ideology. Don’t link radical Islam with terror.

Yet, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio came right out and said it: “This was an act of terror.” That was already apparent to the New York City police, whom de Blasio has repeatedly insulted as racists, and demeaned for quickly confronting the dangers of criminal behavior.",New York Terror Attack -- We've Seen the Face of Evil But Our Politicians Want Us to Look Away,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/01/new-york-terror-attack-weve-seen-face-evil-our-politicians-want-us-look-away

The antiquated models simply assumed all gas that was ejected made it into the atmosphere, which doesn't appear to have been the case.","The massive asteroid that is thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs was one of the most significant events in Earth's history, and without it there's a really good chance humans might never have existed at all. With that in mind, it's hard to imagine how the space rock's impact could have been even more devastating than scientists have assumed, but new research suggests exactly that, and paints an even more dire picture of what life was like on Earth in the years that followed.

Results of the study, which focused largely on the impact of the asteroid itself and the amount of various gasses that were ejected during the event, was published in Geophysical Research Letters.

To get an idea of just how dramatic the climate shift would have been in the days, months, and years following the impact, scientists have relied on computer models of the collision. The data comes from knowledge of the impact site, which is now the Chicxulub crater located near the tip of the Yucatan Peninsula in present day Mexico.

Previous computer models of the asteroid strike were not as refined as the new version, which takes into account the speed of the gasses that were released. The velocity at which the various material was sent skyward has a huge impact on whether or not it was able to enter the atmosphere and affect the climate on a longer scale. The antiquated models simply assumed all gas that was ejected made it into the atmosphere, which doesn't appear to have been the case.

According to this newest round of data, the impact would have released significantly more sulfur gas than previously though, by a factor of three, which would have had a devastating effect on Earth's temperatures. Previous estimates suggested the planet's temperature plummeted by as much as 47 degrees Fahrenheit, which would have spelled doom for many, many species, but this new study hints that it might have been even colder than that.

It's terrifying to consider what would happen to humanity if such an event were to take place today, and we've been incredibly fortunate to not have a repeat thus far, but we can never be certain what the future holds.",The massive asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was even more devastating than anyone imagined,http://www.foxnews.com/science/2017/11/01/massive-asteroid-that-killed-dinosaurs-was-even-more-devastating-than-anyone-imagined.html

Tara Batista, of Tampa, blamed a pedicure for the serious infection that sent her to the hospital for a week and will impact her wedding.

“It’s been a total nightmare,” Batista told news station WFTS.

She claims she noticed signs that her pedicure had gone awry while at Nail Image salon in Tampa.

“It was painful,” Batista said. “I told her at one point that she was inflicting pain.”

Hours after leaving, she said she started to feel pain shooting up her legs.

Batista decided to go to the emergency room the next day when she could no longer could stand on her left foot.

“Next thing I know, they tell me I’m going into surgery,” she told WFTS. “The infection had spread to my bone.”

Doctors said she had developed a deep abscess from an infection on her left big toe, according to WFTS.

“For the infection to come on in less than 24 hours to that severity — something’s not right,” she told the station.

Batista was discharged from the hospital, but said she is now under the care of a home health nurse.

She was instructed to use an IV line for medication for the next six weeks, including during her wedding.

“This is not what I envisioned for my wedding,” Batista said.

In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.

Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.",4 clever decluttering solutions for wires and cables,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/4-clever-decluttering-solutions-for-wires-and-cables.html

McElwain’s downfall was more about relationships than records (3-4, 3-3 Southeastern Conference).

His already strained rapport with administrators reached a new low last Monday when he said Florida players and families had received death threats. The bombshell shocked Athletic Director Scott Stricklin, who had not been previously notified about a potentially harmful situation.

Stricklin met with McElwain later that day, and the coach rebuffed a request to provide more information about the threats. The athletic department responded with a statement that essentially criticized McElwain for being uncooperative.

McElwain said two days later that he would provide more details about the death threats “when it becomes unmanageable,” but gave no other details.

Stricklin named defensive coordinator Randy Shannon the team’s interim coach for the final four games.

“We want to thank Coach McElwain for his efforts in leading the Gator football program,” Stricklin said in a statement. “We are confident Coach Shannon will provide the proper guidance to the players and rest of staff during this time, and we will begin a national search for the next head coach.”

The parties are negotiating McElwain’s $12.5 million buyout.

Florida, which is still paying former coach Will Muschamp, would like to significantly reduce McElwain’s sum and could use his actions over the last week as leverage.

Regardless of the outcome, McElwain’s tenure will be remembered for failing to fix a floundering offense.

Three years ago, McElwain proclaimed he could win with his dog at quarterback.

The Gators currently rank 113th in total offense, in triple digits nationally for the third time in McElwain’s three seasons.

McElwain went 22-12 with the Gators, including 4-9 against ranked teams, and became the first coach in league history to take a team to the SEC championship game in his first two years.

Florida was eliminated from contention in the Eastern Division with a 42-7 loss to rival Georgia on Saturday. It was Florida’s most lopsided loss in the series since 1982.

“I know what I was brought here to do. Look, we haven’t been good on offense, I get it,” McElwain said on Saturday night. “We’ve won a few games, but we haven’t won enough. We haven’t won a championship. That’s real. That’s life. That is this business, and I take full responsibility for all of it.”

McElwain’s problems started long before last week.

The former Alabama assistant and Colorado State head coach complained publicly about Florida’s facilities shortly after taking the job and openly questioned the school’s commitment to the football program two years later. His initial comments came while the Gators were planning to build an indoor practice facility and his most recent ones came after they had announced plans to build a $60 million, stand-alone football facility.

Fox Sports analyst Joel Klatt‏ called him out for his history of unsportsmanlike conduct, tweeting: “McElwain treated his staff at Colorado State terrible once he got the Florida job that they helped him get...Sorry I don’t feel sorry.”

Her grandmother had to take the teen to the emergency room to treat the serious injury she sustained from the dessert.

“The ER doctor had to cut [the thumb] open, cut away the dead skin and get the infection out,” Tina McArthur told WEARTV. “They said had we not come in and got her finger treated she could have possibly lost her thumb.”

Liquid nitrogen has an extremely low temperature, between negative 196 and negative 320 degrees Fahrenheit that can cause severe burns and destruction to skin tissue. If consumed, the liquid nitrogen can cause serious internal complications or fatal asphyxiation caused by the substance displacing oxygen inside the body.

Research published Friday by Stanford University in the Journal of Sexual Medicine shows that those who smoke marijuana every day have 20 percent more sex than those who don’t inhale.

“Frequent marijuana use doesn’t seem to impair sexual motivation or performance. If anything, it’s associated with increased coital frequency,” the study’s senior author, Michael Eisenberg, an assistant professor of urology at Stanford, said in a statement.

In the 1980’s, New York City launched the The Clean Train Movement.
The new policy was that no subway car left the depot if it was covered in graffiti.","Last week, yet another incidence of racist defacement turned out to be a hoax. It seems that in many of the more high-profile racist graffiti incidents either the perpetrator has not been found or has turned out to be someone wanting to draw attention to racism through the use of graphic and shocking vandalism.

The latest hoax incident, which had occurred at Eastern Michigan University over 13 months ago, was anti-black graffiti done by a black man. Following the discovery of the vandalism back then, protesters had marched through the streets of Ypsilanti, arms joined, chanting ""No justice, no peace.""

The hoaxer got exactly what he wanted, a lot of attention and a spike of fear in people.

In the 1980’s, New York City launched the The Clean Train Movement. The new policy was that no subway car left the depot if it was covered in graffiti.

It’s because the graffiti--both the hoax and the non-hoax kind-- garners such a reaction that it keeps happening. What if we took a different path upon discovery of this kind of racist graffiti? What if we painted over it swiftly and went on about our day?

In the 1980’s, New York City launched the The Clean Train Movement. The new policy was that no subway car left the depot if it was covered in graffiti. At the time, “taggers,” as graffiti artists call themselves, would spend entire nights covering whole subway cars in their colorful work. The payoff was seeing the car in action, running through their city. When the city cracked down on that, the graffiti ended. The incentive was gone. No one would see their graffiti except for the transit workers quickly painting over it.

We need to apply the same principle to random racist or anti-Semitic graffiti. If we mostly ignore it, and paint over it, the racist or hoaxer doesn’t get the satisfaction of our reaction. They don’t see us march through the streets or write hand-wringing Op-Eds about what is going wrong with our society. We take away the satisfaction of the crime.

As a Jew, of course it disturbs me when swastikas are painted on synagogues, as happened at a synagogue in Manhattan just last week, or other similar racist incidents. But I don’t draw the larger conclusion that New Yorkers are Nazis, or ok with Nazism. Similarly when graffiti mocking 9/11 turned up all over New York City a few years ago, it was clear it wasn’t representative of the city’s residents.

It’s important to not ratchet up the tension. If we could dial back the immediate reaction to words on a wall, we might find that it happens much less often. Let’s not give racists, or hoaxers, what they want.",Ignoring hate graffiti means we don't give racists - or hoaxers - the satisfaction they crave,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/31/ignoring-hate-graffiti-means-dont-give-racists-or-hoaxers-satisfaction-crave.html

And yet my goal, aside from supporting the work mothers at home do, is no different from Komisar’s: “We don’t want the 50s to come back.
The only reason women don’t do this today is because we place so little value on motherhood.
We don’t understand the significance of what goes on the early years and how indispensable mothers are to their babies.","This past weekend the Wall Street Journal published what I consider to be the most important op-ed of the 21st century. Due to its sensitive nature, Americans rarely hear about this subject. But they should.

The article, by James Taranto, is entitled “The Politicization of Motherhood,” and it centers on an interview with psychoanalyst Erica Komisar, whose new book “Being There: Why Prioritizing Motherhood in the First Three Years Matters,” makes the oh-so-obvious yet controversial argument that babies need their mothers.

As Komisar says in a video about her book, “Mothers are critically important to children in the first three years of life. [It] impacts their emotional well-being.”

For daring to write such a book, Komisar has received the inevitable backlash. After all, it’s taboo enough to suggest parents should stay home. It’s even more taboo to suggest that parent be Mom. Why? Because popular orthodoxy insists the sexes are interchangeable. That’s what the gender equality crowd believes, and it’s what they want everyone else to believe.

If you don’t agree with it (and you shouldn’t, because it isn’t true), you’ll be treated as a pariah. “I couldn’t get on NPR,” Komisar told Taranto. And, she adds, she was “rejected wholesale—particularly in New York—by the liberal press.”

Addressing the effects of maternal absence is difficult enough on its own, but it’s impossible when, as Taranto points out, liberals—who, as we all know, dominate mainstream media—“won’t even acknowledge the problem.”

Komisar did manage to get a spot on “Good Morning America;” but prior to the interview, host Lara Spencer made it clear to Komisar that she didn’t like her book and didn’t “believe in its premise.”

Well, of course she didn’t. Morning television is dominated by female producers and journalists, many of whom are married with kids. And as Bernard Goldberg wrote in “Bias,” “…those gals got a dog in this fight.” He adds, “America’s newsrooms are filled with women who drop their kids off someplace before they go to work or leave them at home with a nanny. These journalists are not just defending working mothers—they’re defending themselves!”

How rich I’d be if I had a dollar for every time I’ve run into this media bias. My first book, which was published 15 years ago (and was coincidentally re-released this year), is similar to Komisar’s in that I make a case for why a mother’s physical and emotional presence are vital to children, to families and to society as a whole. And I too was vilified in the media.

And yet my goal, aside from supporting the work mothers at home do, is no different from Komisar’s: “We don’t want the 50s to come back. What we do want is to be a child-centric society.”

Not the kind of child-centric society we have now, where children are coddled by well-meaning but overprotective parents.

The kind that puts the needs of children above the needs of adults.

Unfortunately, Komisar and I part ways on how to create such a society. As a political liberal, Komisar believes the answer is other people’s money. “All mothers and babies should have the right to be together in the first year,” she says. To do that, America needs maternity leave at full pay “and then flexibility to be together as much as possible for the next two years—meaning mothers should have the ability to work flexibly and part time.”

It is true that flexibility and part-time work become indispensable once children are older and in school all day, but it’s pointless in the first three years. The needs and demands of a baby, let alone a baby and a toddler, are simply too great to be able devote one’s attention to something else without everything falling apart.

Still, there is much Komisar gets right. Her case is particularly compelling because her work has been developed from “three decades’ experience treating families,” writes Taranto. And her conclusions are right on the mark—though admittedly, for some, are hard to hear.

“What I was seeing,” notes Komisar, “was an increase in children being diagnosed with ADHD and an increase in aggression in children, especially in boys, and an increase in depression in little girls.” She saw that the absence of mothers in children’s daily lives was “one of the triggers for these mental disorders.”

Addressing the effects of maternal absence is difficult enough on its own, but it’s impossible when, as Taranto points out, liberals—who, as we all know, dominate mainstream media—“won’t even acknowledge the problem.”

They won’t acknowledge it because they refuse to allow themselves, or anyone else, to feel guilty about the choices they’ve made—as if experiencing this emotion is tantamount to being tortured.

But it isn’t the end of the world to feel guilt. “My best patient is a patient who comes to me feeling guilty,” says Komisar. “Women who feel guilty—it’s a ‘signal’ feeling, that something’s wrong, that they’re in conflict. If they go talk to a therapist or deal with the conflict head-on, they often make different choices and better choices.”

And one of those choices, to prioritize baby care well in advance of its arrival, is a smart one. The only reason women don’t do this today is because we place so little value on motherhood. We don’t understand the significance of what goes on the early years and how indispensable mothers are to their babies. We don’t understand it because we refuse to look.

But the information is there for all who choose to see.",It's time we acknowledge how indispensable mothers are to their babies,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/31/its-time-acknowledge-how-indispensable-mothers-are-to-their-babies.html

Country superstar Luke Bryan has teamed up with Chevrolet to design a custom Silverado inspired by his “Huntin’, Fishin’ and Lovin’ Every Day” motto.

The full-size SUV was built for the Specialty Equipment Market Association show in Las Vegas with input from Bryan as a showcase for the Chevrolet Accessories division, and is equipped with plenty of products from the catalog along with custom parts.

The truck is painted a unique Hunter Bronze color with camouflage accents that’s offset by safety orange trim pieces, including Hunting, Fishing and Everyday logos on the doors featuring antlers, fish and a sun. (Apparently, lovin’ isn’t actually encouraged in the truck.)

On the functional off-roading front, the Silverado features a lifted suspension, 35-inch tires on 22-inch wheels, a larger front skid plate and a set of front tow hooks in case it still gets stuck. If it does, a cold air intake for the 5.3-liter V8 adds some oomph to get loose, while Brembo front brakes will help get it stopped before you dive into the next mud pit.

The long list of accessories includes a Thule basket roof rack with fishing rod holder, Baja Designs light bar and tubular side steps.

Chevrolet also modified the truck by removing the rear windows, converting the tailgate from a hatch to a swing-out door and adding a rear-facing third row concept bench listed as a concept, so it could go on sale someday.

Investigators from the House Intelligence Committee are seeking to learn how much, if at all, federal law enforcement officers have relied on the dossier since it was compiled by the research firm Fusion GPS, with funding from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, in mid-2016.

The documents reviewed Tuesday were presented for inspection pursuant to a subpoena issued by the committee's chairman, U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif.

Two Republican committee staffers and two Democratic committee staffers also attended.

Monday was not a good day for President Trump, but it was an even worse day for Hillary Clinton.

Indictments handed down by Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged Trump’s former campaign chair Paul Manafort and close associate Rick Gates with a slew of white collar crimes, including failure to register as a foreign agent, tax evasion and money laundering, an embarrassment to the president. But, some have described the indictments as weak, since they focus on Manafort making false FARA filings, or not registering as a foreign agent, a charge brought by the government only six times since 1966, and which resulted in only one conviction. Enforcement of the FARA law is generally not rigorous.

More important, there was no mention of Russia, or of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Hillary needs Mueller to connect those dots.

Two Hawaii women’s tale of survival in the Pacific Ocean appeared to be sinking Wednesday as more Coast Guard officials, sailing experts and scientists emerged to poke holes in the sensational story.

Among the claims that have been cast into doubt are a tiger shark attack that allegedly lasted more than six hours and a call one of the women’s mothers made to the Coast Guard, in addition to doubts about the condition of their ship before setting off on the voyage.

""I'm shocked they were going to Tahiti,"" Desiree Hattori, who has known one of the women, Jennifer Appel, for years, told Hawaii News Now. ""Her boat wasn't in the best shape.""

They were picked up by the U.S. Navy near Japan last week after being spotted and towed by a Taiwanese fishing vessel.

Appel and Tasha Fuiava’s description of 20- to 30-foot tiger sharks ramming their boat in a coordinated attack for more than six hours also appeared to draw scrutiny, as scientists who study sharks told The Associated Press that sort of behavior has never been recorded and that tiger sharks grow to only about 17 feet in length.

University of Hawaii professor and veteran shark researcher Kim Holland has never heard of any kind of shark repeatedly attacking a boat hull throughout a night. He also said tiger sharks never jump out of the water and do not make coordinated attacks.

Sometimes sharks will congregate around a food source like a whale carcass, but Holland said that was unlikely in this case ""if there's nothing there to attract the animals. I mean this is just an inert boat hull.""

At some point, Appel joined the Hawai'i Actors Network, noting on the group's website that she has ""been known to do almost any skydiving or motorcycle stunt — camera optional."" Through the group, she found work as an extra in the former TV series ""Off the Map"" and the former sitcom ""Cougar Town,"" appearing in that show in a pink bikini in the background of a season finale. A call to the actors' network by The Associated Press was not returned.

Appel's mother, Joyce, also told The Associated Press she called the Coast Guard to report her daughter missing a week and a half after they departed for what they believed would be an 18-day trip to Tahiti.

However, the Coast Guard never got a call from the elder Appel. They received a call from a ""family friend"" they identified as a male on May 19, still several days before the women expected to arrive.

The women said they filed a float plan listing their course and other details with some friends and relatives. However, in an interview with the Coast Guard, the women said they had filed no float plan.

Hawaii sailing experts say the trip itself was a bad idea.

HOLES EMERGE IN HAWAII WOMEN'S TALE OF SURVIVAL IN THE PACIFIC

Mike Michelwait, owner of the Honolulu Sailing Company, a sailing school and charter company, has sailed the route from Hawaii to Tahiti several times. He said the trip would normally take about 17 days with sailors who could stay on course.

But, Michelwait said, he would not take such a trip with any less than three experienced sailors.

""There's only two of them on board, and it's a 50-foot boat,"" he said. ""That's a lot of boat to handle.""

Coast Guard officials told The Associated Press on Monday that the two women had an emergency beacon (EPIRB), but never turned it on because they did not fear for their lives. If they had, rescue would have been headed their way in a matter of minutes.

HAWAII WOMEN SAY THEY ARE PLANNING THEIR NEXT BOATING VACATION

The women said Tuesday that they did not use the beacon because they never felt they were in immediate danger, yet they have been quoted as saying they did not think they would survive another day. Furthermore, the pair said they had been flagging vessels and sending distress signals for at least 98 days.

""We knew we weren't going to make it,"" Appel said. ""So that's when we started making distress calls.""

A Fox News reader with a connection to Appel's family provided email correspondence with Coast Guard officials based in Hawaii, who said that on May 5, Appel reported she lost her satellite phone.

“Since Jennifer is well equipped with emergency equipment we are confident that if she ran into a distress situation she would activate her EPIRB and we would get the notification quickly,” the Joint Rescue Coordination Center Honolulu wrote to the reader in a May 19 email.

The two women also insisted they got caught in a storm that was whipping up 30-foot waves and near hurricane-force winds on the night they set sail, despite records that show no severe weather in the area at the time.

NASA satellite images for the days around their departure show no organized storms in the region where they planned to travel.

There was a tropical cyclone, but it was near Fiji, thousands of miles west of Hawaii. Localized squalls are known to pop up, but a storm lasting three days would have been visible on satellite and would have elicited mass warnings to the public to brace for the weather.

""We got into a Force 11 storm, and it lasted for two nights and three days,"" Appel said Tuesday.

Rolled out in time for Halloween, Gruesome Gotham transports users to the grisly crime scenes of six salacious slayings committed on the streets of Victorian-era New York City.

Getting in on the gorefest is easy. After you download the free app, a map with murder-weapon icons appears.

When you get close to the crime scene, the bloody fun begins.

“You see the actual murder scene, with a spooky voiceover narrator, explaining the act of the crime,” said Emily Hom, spokeswoman for Tribeca-based Firstborn, which developed the augmented-reality app. “We chose real crimes that pop visually.”

The company selected crimes that took place near the Firstborn office and “around” the route of Tuesday’s annual Village Halloween Parade, Hom said, adding, “We figured if people are cheering the parade, they can download the app.”

The dirty deeds include:

The 1895 demise of Domenico Cataldo, who had his throat slit by scorned lover Maria Barbella at the Little Italy Saloon on Mulberry and Broome. The doomed Cataldo, unable to scream for help, staggered down the street, choking on his own blood.

Greenwich Village chap Michael Healy perished by parasol on Nov. 9, 1895 after a sicko stranger stabbed him in the eye with an umbrella. The sharp end pushed through the socket and punctured his brain. Healy bled to death at the corner of Bleecker and Grove streets. The canopied killer was never caught.

In 1856, Bartholomew Burke was found dead inside 378 Broadway. His throat had been slashed, his body stabbed and his forehead smashed. The unknown killer used sheers, a hammer and a sword.

Hom said the app is a nod to the “sensationalistic, pulp noir tabloid headlines” of yesteryear.

“The New York Post was an inspiration,” she said.

The app, which uses your camera phone to “see the experience,” was created with the help of Apple’s ARKit and is free to download for iPhones 6S or above, Hom said.

Quipped Hom: “If there’s a thirst for more blood, we may add more murders to the app.”

And for the first time, they are recording 360-degree video of the entire six-week expedition to create a virtual-reality experience of the mysterious polar environment above and below the ice.

""The aim of the outreach is to raise awareness about the unique and fragile Antarctic coastal under-ice ecosystems and the broader effect climate change might have on the ecosystems and the whole planet,"" Alf Norkko, a marine biologist at Helsinki University, said in a statement.

Norkko is one of three Finnish members of the expedition, along with University of Helsinki marine biologist Joanna Norkko, who is also married to Alf Norkko, and the explorer and photographer Patrick Degerman, which set out Thursday (Oct. 26) from Scott Base in Antarctica. [In Photos: Diving Beneath Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf]

In addition to their scientific studies and diving duties beneath the ice shelf, the Finnish team members are responsible for shooting the 360-degree video and keeping the world informed through a series of regular updates, photographs and videos on their Facebook page.

Science under the ice

Last week, the team from Finland joined six researchers from New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research and the University of Auckland at Scott Base, on Ross Island in McMurdo Sound in the New Zealand Antarctic territory, a short distance from the large U.S. Antarctic base, McMurdo Station.

The digital equipment for the social media component of the expedition includes 32 cameras, three drones, a remote-controlled drone submarine and ""countless"" batteries, the team said.

Their updates, photographs and digital recordings will be sent from the field through scheduled communications over satellite telephone to a back-up team at the University of Helsinki.

They also have five 360-degree video cameras to shoot the virtual-reality record of their work, which will become available in early 2018, after it can be processed and edited back in Finland.

Bad weather and low visibility delayed their departure for several days, but yesterday, the expedition members made the journey to their first camp on the Ross Ice Shelf, near New Harbour in the Ross Sea, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from Scott Base. [Antarctica: 100 Years of Exploration (Infographic)]

Joanna Norkko told Live Science in an email that the expedition team would spend about 20 days diving and taking samples from the sea floor at New Harbour before moving on to a second site on the ice at Cape Evans on Ross Island, about 18 miles (30 km) from Scott Base.

Depending on the weather and ice conditions, the team would reach the new site either by helicopter, or by traversing the sea ice, with the expedition equipment being pulled by Hägglund and PistenBully snow vehicles, she said.

The gear for the entire nine-member expedition was considerable, Joanna Norkko added: ""scientific gear, camera equipment, computers, dive gear, dive compressors, hole-melters, generators, heaters, two skidoos for transport around the camp … tents, sleeping bags, personal clothing, kitchen gear, cookers, a few hundred kilos of food, first aid supplies, radios, satellite phones, [a] toilet tent, pee canisters and poo buckets, and lots of fuel.""

Southernmost ecosystem

Both sites on the Ross Ice Shelf were chosen because they will allow comparison studies to be made with the results of previous expeditions, Joanna Norkko explained. [Life on the Edge: Photos from Drilling the Ross Ice Shelf]

""The objective of this diving expedition is to examine the sensitivity of Antarctic seafloor communities to climate change,"" Norkko said. ""This area is special, because it is the most southerly marine ecosystem on the planet.""

The team made their first visit to the sites in 2001 and several times since then. ""Each time the seafloor communities have been sampled in a standardized way, so these sites are so-called monitoring sites [where] we can start assessing whether there have been any changes,"" she said.

Seven of the nine-member team would be diving beneath the ice, and they hoped to complete four dives each day by two-person diving teams, for a total of 60 dives during their six weeks of fieldwork on the ice shelf, Joanna Norkko said.

Safety while diving under the ice will be a top priority, she said: Whenever two divers enter the water, one safety diver will be suited up on the surface and ready to jump in immediately if there is a problem. The divers will also be attached to ropes and can communicate with team members at the surface through rope pulls, she said.

The water temperatures will be around 28.6 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 1.9 degrees Celsius), which is below the normal freezing point because of the high salinity — so the divers could get very cold in a 45-minutes dive despite their thick diving suits, she said. There is also a danger of their metal regulators freezing up, which means they have to carry extra tanks and regulators.

In addition, for each dive the expedition members will need to melt two access holes into 10-foot-thick (3 meters) ice, so that one could be used as a safety hole if the divers could not return through the main hole, she said.

""The greatest risk is posed by seals, who in general are harmless, but who might take a fancy to our nice dive holes and just decide to occupy them,"" Joanna Norkko said. ""A 300-kilogram [660 lb.] seal that does not want to move away from your dive hole is a bit of a problem.""

The Palestinian leadership's denial of the Balfour Declaration reflects its persistent refusal to recognize Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people. Attempts to undermine the Balfour declaration are tantamount to rejecting Israel's right to exist.

On November 2, Israel, Britain and many others will mark the centennial of the Balfour Declaration, a short letter from the British Foreign Secretary in which Britain officially recognized the Jewish people's historical rights in the Land of Israel.

The Declaration was closely coordinated by Britain with the other great powers, and indeed well represents the will of the international community at the time. As David Lloyd George, Prime Minister in 1917 later testified: ""It [the Balfour Declaration] was prepared after much consideration, not merely of its policy but of its actual wording, by the representatives of the Allied and Associated countries, including America."" The specific text of the Declaration was approved by U.S. President Wilson before its publication, while the French and Italian Governments publicly endorsed it on February 14 and May 9, 1918 respectively.

This broad international endorsement of Jewish national self-determination was formally ratified on July 24, 1922, when the League of Nations (the precursor to the United Nations) recognized the “historic connection of the Jewish people” to the Land of Israel and appointed Great Britain as Mandatory power responsible for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.” (At the time, the name ""Palestine"" referred to the geographical area in question, without any national, political or ethnic connotation. All people living in that area were called ""Palestinian"" - Jew and Arab alike).

For Israel's opponents, it is proving to be yet another opportunity to repeat the mistakes of the past and sacrifice the benefits of co-existence and cooperation on the altar of a false historical narrative, which brings no benefit to anyone, least of all the Palestinians themselves.

For the first time in the modern era, the international community formally recognized, in writing, a simple - but as time has worn on, oft challenged - truth: that the Land of Israel is the historical homeland of the Jewish people.

This sentiment is well expressed in a Joint Resolution of the U.S. Congress from June 30, 1922, signed on September 22, 1922 by President Harding acknowledging that: ""The Jewish people have for many centuries believed in and yearned for the rebuilding of their ancient homeland."" […] ""The Jewish people are to be enabled to recreate and reorganize a national home in the land of their fathers which will give to the House of Israel its long-denied opportunity to reestablish a fruitful Jewish life and culture in the ancient Jewish land.""

The Balfour Declaration and the international ratification that followed validated Zionism as the legitimate expression of the inalienable rights of the Jewish people in their historical homeland. It proclaimed loudly that the Jewish people's right to a homeland was historically valid and morally sound. But the Declaration also recognized the rights of the non-Jewish population of the area. Balfour wrote explicitly that “nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.”

Indeed, the Zionist leadership at the time, as today, was looking to cooperate with their Arab neighbors. Chaim Weizmann, who represented the World Zionist Organization, and Emir Feisal (one of the most prominent Arab leaders, whose father Emir Hussein of Mecca led the Arab tribes that rose up against the Ottoman Empire), acting on behalf of the Arab Kingdom of Hedjaz, signed an agreement on January 3, 1919. The Agreement stated that ""the surest means of working out the consummation of their [the Arabs and Jewish people] national aspirations is through the closest possible collaboration."" Feisal explicitly acknowledged that there was room for both Jewish and Arab national movements in the Middle East and that ""neither can be a real success without the other.""

Nevertheless, denunciations of the Balfour Declaration from those opposed to the Jewish national movement appeared soon after and have continued to this day. Indeed, the Balfour Declaration is often seen and presented by these critics as the “original sin” that led to the creation of Israel in 1948. Most recently, at the July 2016 Arab League Summit, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced his intention to sue Britain for issuing the Balfour Declaration.

At the heart of this rejection of the international community's endorsement of Jewish national rights is a fundamental denial of the Jewish connection to the land. During 800 years of Muslim rule, Arabs in Ottoman-controlled Palestine had become accustomed to seeing Jews only as marginal and despicable followers of an inferior religion. The vehement Palestinian Arab opposition to the Balfour Declaration was and has remained rooted in the anti-historical view that Jews were aliens, with no connection to the land and no right of any kind to live there as a people. This spawned an Arab exclusivism and sense of supremacy, which continues to drive the Arab-Israel conflict to this day.

Here then lies the explanation as to why the Balfour Declaration is of such historic import. Not only is it the first internationally endorsed recognition of the Jewish people’s inalienable right to return to their ancient homeland. It is also a simple statement of truth, which lays bare the heart of the conflict, that too many in the Arab world have been waging against Israel for too long: the refusal to accept the truth of the Jewish people's connection to the land, and the national rights, which accrue as a result.

All agree that the Balfour Declaration was a milestone on the modern journey towards the establishment of the State of Israel. For Israel and its friends, its centennial is a cause for celebration and profound gratitude to the international community. For Israel's opponents, it is proving to be yet another opportunity to repeat the mistakes of the past and sacrifice the benefits of co-existence and cooperation on the altar of a false historical narrative, which brings no benefit to anyone, least of all the Palestinians themselves.

Israel in 2017 has to live with the violent consequences of this Arab rejectionism: from the Palestinian Authority that unapologetically rewards the murderers of Jews as well as Christian tourists, Druze and Arab policemen, and anyone else deemed to be ""collaborators"" with Israel; to the unremitting wars of annihilation waged by Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, and a panoply of Islamist terror groups.

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote. Change the bag often.",8 overlooked germy places in your kitchen to clean now,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/8-overlooked-germy-places-in-your-kitchen-to-clean-now.html

Reuer made headlines earlier this week after revealing she dropped nearly 80 pounds during the last two years and successfully completed a Tough Mudder race in June.

The 67-year-old now weighs 120 pounds but was once 198. She told Fox News on Friday that she started her wellness journey by cutting out carbs, sugar and rice. But her initial goal wasn’t necessarily to lose weight, she said. Rather, the Farmington Hills, Mich. resident just wanted to live a healthier lifestyle.

14 LAST-MINUTE HALLOWEEN COSTUMES YOU CAN PULL OFF WITH ONLY MAKEUP

“I’m one of six siblings, and the other five have significant health issues like diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. While I hadn’t developed any of those things, I knew I would if I didn’t change how I was eating,” she said.

She also said her job encouraged her to better her lifestyle. Reuer is the CEO of Dryer Vent Wizard, a dryer vent cleaning service. She described her job as “high-stress.”

“To keep doing it as I get older, I knew I needed to be in a better condition than I was two years ago,” she said.

Just by changing her eating habits, Reuer quickly dropped 50 pounds. “When I started to lose weight, it was fun,” she said.

Even though she was thinner, Reuer said she still felt self-conscious about going to the gym at first -- wary of other gym-goers who might watch or judge her.

When she did start going, “I couldn't do push up or pull ups, and I was sore and tired,” she said.

But Reuer was determined to get stronger-- eventually hiring a personal trainer to help her on her fitness journey. As she slowly built up her strength and stamina, people started to take note.

A month after she started working out, Reuer said that Jason Kapica, the executive vice president of Dryer Vent Wizard, asked her to take part in a Tough Mudder race-- a 10 to 12 mile endurance race where participants run, scale walls, climb ropes, and more. Kapica wanted to raise money for the Children’s Burn Foundation, he told her.

At first, Reuer was hesitant to enter the competition.

“I told him I’ve never done anything like that,” she said. “I thought it was funny he even asked.”

Reuer told Kapica that she would support him and the company would sponsor him-- but she wasn’t going to take part.

But her outlook changed when she thought about the children she would be helping by participating in the race. While working with her trainer one day, Reuer made it official.

“My trainer looked at me and said, ‘OK-- we have some work to do.’”

For the next nine months, Reuer went to the gym six days a week. As the race got closer, she went two times a day, six days a week.

“I just kept thinking about trying to help these kids,” Reuer said.

Before she knew it, it was race day.

“I remember thinking: ‘What am I doing here?’” Reuer said. But all her pre-race jitters vanished after she starting running-- successfully taking on many of the obstacles even after a fellow racer told her she looked “too frail” to climb one of the walls.

“I may have white hair, but that’s an assumption I would never make about someone,” she said.

The race may be over, but that’s not stopping Reuer from maintaining her fitness journey. Reuer is still working with a trainer and continues to go to the gym six days a week.

“I’m proud of myself. But I’m happier to see what’s been happening around me,” she said.

Reuer said her weight loss has inspired others around her—her husband and many of her employees have embraced their own wellness journeys and lost weight as a result.

In addition, her company now offers free personal trainer sessions to employees. Employees can also use an hour of their work day to go to the gym, she said.

“That has been the most fun thing and has made the proudest,” she said.

As for her next goal? Reuer wants to tackle some of the Tough Mudder obstacles she wasn’t quite strong enough to conquer the first time round, so she plans on participating in the race again this summer. Other than that, she wants to make sure she doesn’t become part of the 65 percent of dieters who eventually return to their pre-diet weight.

Charleston Hartfield, 34, was buried Friday following private graveside services. His burial came after a funeral that drew more than 2,000 family members, friends and police and military officers, with honors that included a motorcade down the Las Vegas Strip.

The married father of two was off-duty and attending the Oct. 1 concert where a gunman opened fire from a hotel room.

LAS VEGAS SHOOTING DETAILS STILL MURKY AS MANDALAY BAY ORDERED TO KEEP EVIDENCE

However, a year before his death, Hartfield began a computer file detailing the instructions for his funeral.

“If you’re reading this, then I’ve been called home,” Hartfield’s note read. The file was found by his wife, Veronica, following his death.

“Nothing I type will make this any easier, so I will get to the facts. My largest request: Please do not allow anyone to wear black. Black is totally depressing and I don’t want anyone expressing their sorrow over my passing,” Hartfield’s instructions read.

Hartfield asked that Nina Simone and Johnny Cash songs also be played during his funeral.

“I would like for everyone to enjoy themselves. And remember me for who I was. The truth only. None of that stuff about how great I was. Only real stories,” the officer wrote.

Everyone broke that rule over the next hour.

Friends, his cousin, brother and sister, and police and military officials including Brig. Gen. Zachary Doser, the head of the Nevada Army National Guard, characterized the man most called ""Chucky"" as an inspiration, a mentor and a quick wit.

Doser praised Hartfield, who at age 34 had accumulated 17 years of military service in Iraq and with a quartermaster unit in the Nevada Guard, as the epitome of ""everything good about being an American.""

Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo called Hartfield, an 11-year police veteran, a “remarkable officer” killed by “an unremarkable person.”

COUNTRY STARS HONOR LAS VEGAS SHOOTING VICTIMS AT CMT ARTISTS

Investigators have not determined what motivated the shooter, Stephen Paddock, 64, a retired accountant, real estate investor and high-stakes gambler, to plan and execute his attack.

Lombardo said Hartfield 's death was considered on-duty because he tried to shield, protect and shepherd people in a concert crowd from danger.

""That night, in a hail of gunfire, Charlie's last actions spoke for him,"" Lombardo said. ""He took actions to save lives.""

Hartfield asked to be buried in a veteran’s area so he could continue to “protect” the U.S. with the other buried veterans.

“The only way I would like to be placed in the ground is if it’s in a veteran’s area. That way myself and the crusty old vets can hold formations and continue to protect and serve our great country once more,” Hartfield wrote.

“The terrorist came into our country through what is called the ‘Diversity Visa Lottery Program,’ a Chuck Schumer beauty.
“No more Democratic lottery,” Trump said in a follow-up tweet.
Schumer indeed voted in support of the 1990 Immigration Act, which included the diversity visa program.
Like Saipov, Hadayet entered the U.S. under the diversity visa program.","The terror attack Tuesday in Lower Manhattan has brought renewed calls from President Trump and other top Washington Republicans to end the ""diversity visa"" program under which the central Asian suspect entered the United States.

“I’ve always been against it because it’s a random system to bring people into the United States,” Texas GOP Rep. Mike McCaul, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said Wednesday on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends.”

McCaul said he’s trying to abolish the roughly 25-year-old program and replace it with a merit-based one.

“I think this case just demonstrates why that is absolutely necessary,” he also said.

The suspect in Tuesday’s terror attack, Sayfullo Saipov, came into the U.S. in 2010 from Uzbekistan.

He was among the maximium 50,000 people allowed into the U.S. every year under the State Department program, which tilts toward “countries with historically low rates of immigration.”

The 29-year-old Saipov on Tuesday afternoon drove a rented pickup truck down a walk-bike path along Manhattan’s West Side Highway, killing eight and injuring at least 11 others, according to police.

McCaul spoke Wednesday just minutes after President Trump called for a merit-based only immigration system and in part blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other congressional Democrats for the program.

“The terrorist came into our country through what is called the ‘Diversity Visa Lottery Program,’ a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based,” Trump tweeted.

“No more Democratic lottery,” Trump said in a follow-up tweet.

Schumer indeed voted in support of the 1990 Immigration Act, which included the diversity visa program.

The New York Democrat was then a House member and among those who helped pass the measure 264-118, with support from 93 Republicans in the chamber. The bill was signed into law by President George W. Bush and took effect in 1995.

Slightly more than 1 million people have entered the U.S. under the program, based on an analysis of State Department records.

At least 24,000 people have entered the country from Uzbekistan since 2005, according to the records.

The program, which has its origins in a 1986 special-preference program, requires applicants to have no criminal record and come from a county not on the list for statesponsored terrorism.

However, critics have for years argued that potential terrorists can easily move from their birth county to a country not on the list such as Congo, Niger and Turkey.

They also argue that immigrants can come into the U.S. without paying a cent.

“Let’s focus on economic rather that literally handing out tens of thousands of visas like lottery tickets, for free,” Fox contributor and former Utah GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz said Wednesday.

Congress tried unsuccessfully several times since 2005 to end the program, including a 2007 attempt to cut off its funding.

Such efforts, led in part by Virginia GOP Rep. Bob Goodlatte, now the House Judiciary Committee chairman, followed a 2002 terror attack at the Los Angeles International Airport in which Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, an Egyptian nationalist, fatally shot two people.

No one can deny that using a phone’s front camera to snap a few pics is far easier than having to turn the phone around, make sure you have your finger on the right button and hope you are in the frame.

And with the quality of smartphone cameras getting better all the time we are able to take clearer, more profile picture worthy photos with ease.

But it turns out, and this may come as a shock, that the front camera was not created so we could take selfies.

The first phone with a front facing camera was introduced to the world by Sony in 2003 in the form of the Ericsson Z1010.

According to Quartz, the chunky flip phone and it’s 0.3 pixel camera that could be turned towards the user, was originally intended to be used in business calls.

Little did Sony know that little camera would spark what can only be described as a selfie epidemic.

People loved the idea of being able to see what they look like while taking a photo of themselves so much that platforms were created to easily allow them to share their selfies with the world.

Social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat encourage people to share their selfies to their heart’s content and even give them options to add filters and edits if they want to spice up their picture.

Selfies have become such a phenomenon that studies have been conducted to find out just how much of our lives we spend trying to capture our perfect angle.

Rawhide, a non-profit organisation helping at-risk youth, conducted research to give insight into our selfie habits, their findings included:

There are 93 million selfies taken each day

74 per cent of images shared on Snapchat are selfies

There are 1000 selfies posted to Instagram every 10 seconds

In 2015 more people died from taking selfies than from shark attacks

Every year teens spend almost seven full work days taking selfies

The designers at Sony that were responsible for creating the front facing camera could never have predicted the effect their innovation would have on how we use our phones.

No doubt there are people out there that do use the camera for its original purpose of video conference meetings but, for now, it looks like taking selfies will continue to come out on top.

Let’s focus on the latter, better known as the last ""deal zone"" of the year.

When is this year's final deal zone?

The last deal zone of the year is always centered around the first two weeks of December, starting just after Thanksgiving travelers return home and continuing up until about Dec. 15. It’s a slow period, so airlines are forced to discount fares to fill their planes.

In other words, buy tickets now for a cheap flight shortly after now and start flying shortly after Turkey Day.

RELATED: 5 EXPERT TIPS FOR GETTING THROUGHT THE AIRPORT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

How cheap is this deal zone?

See for yourself in the examples below; all are round-trip fares for travel in early to mid-December, and all were found on FareCompare earlier this week. (But remember, fares can and do change without notice).

Boston to Tampa $86; to Paris $336

Chicago to London, $353

Dallas to Los Angeles $83

Los Angeles to Denver $79; to Rome $442

New York to Ft. Lauderdale $89; to Amsterdam $360

Why is travel slow during this deal zone?

Logistics, for one thing. The deal zone is sandwiched between two very popular times to fly (Thanksgiving and Christmas/New Year’s), and most people are saving their precious vacation time for the holidays. If you can spare the time, you can celebrate with a fantastic trip for very little money.

HERE'S EXACTLY WHAT TO DO IF YOUR FLIGHT IS CANCELED OR DELAYED

And I can find these deals easily?

Look for a deal-finding tool that locates the best fares from your hometown in a specific month or season; FareCompare is one, but there are others. A word of warning, though: You will have to be flexible on travel dates, because many of the very cheapest deals are for flights on weekdays.

What if you’re not a flexible flyer?

Try flying one weekday and one weekend day (for U.S. flights, Saturdays are generally the cheaper of the two). Even if you don’t get the very cheapest prices, you’ll still save over most of the fares taking effect just a couple of weeks later.

TWITTER ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE AD TRANSPARENCY AFTER RUSSIAN-BACKED SCANDAL

Twitter has come under attack for abuse on its platform, with the company actively trying to curtail it, to mixed results. In 2016, companies such as Salesforce.com and Disney looked at acquiring the Jack Dorsey-led company, only to call off the attempts, due in part to the abuse on the platform.

The abuse has been cited by experts as one of the reasons it was not purchased. Former New York Times editor Quentin Hardy said he spoke to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff about the trolling issue, and he confirmed that trolls were part of the reason Salesforce dropped its bid.

In November 2016, the company wrote a blog post, detailing some of the progress it has made in curtailing online abuse.

In the post, Twitter explained that it was expanding its mute function, which lets users mute accounts they don’t want to see tweets from, to muting keywords, phrases, and even entire conversations.

It also put a spotlight on its hateful conduct policy, which ""prohibits specific conduct that targets people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease.""

Lastly, the company said it had retrained its support teams on its policies, ""including special sessions on cultural and historical contextualization of hateful conduct, and implemented an ongoing refresher program,"" while improving internal tools to deal with abuse in a more effective manner.

Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple.

Tax reform is not about numbers.","Mothers have enough to worry about without being thrown into the ever-present Mommy Wars – those endless debates about whether being a stay-at-home mother is harder than being a mom who works outside of the home. Let us all agree that parenting is both rewarding and incredibly difficult.

While moms may spend more time discussing potty training or social media and phone privileges, the family tax bill is an ever-present issue due to its direct impact on the family budget. Why? Because kids are so darn expensive.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that it will cost about $234,000 in 2015 dollars to raise a child until he or she is 17 years old. That is not even including college. Child care costs are big-ticket items on this list.

Care.com, with New America, found the national average for the annual cost of child care is 31 percent of the median household income. The average cost of day care in the country is just under $200 per week per child. Hiring an after-school sitter for about 15 hours a week averages $214 per week. Employing a nanny is about $556 per week. This is the average – if you live in New York, California or Washington, D.C., you’ll likely pay more.

These are the kinds of costs that make families think twice about having more children – or any children at all. Mothers (and fathers) stay up at night worrying about the quality of care their children receive while they work to keep food on the table. And low-income and middle-class families are hit the hardest.

About three-quarters of all Americans believe it is better for families to have one parent home with children and just over 40 percent of American families strive to make that happen, either with a parent or close relative taking care of their young children. The word “strive” paints an accurate picture of the 10.4 million stay-at-home moms, because despite pervasive stereotypes, the majority of them are not wealthy women.

This is not about government coming to the rescue, but rather families keeping more of their hard-earned dollars. Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple. Abraham Lincoln stated: “The strength of a nation lies in the homes of its people.”

A pro-family tax structure encourages families to grow and allows parents the choice of staying at home to care for their children or getting a paying job. This freedom helps families build safe and secure homes, which in turn benefits the country as a whole.

On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.

Child care subsidies can help with the expensive costs of day care and the like. But their benefits are limited to a small subset of the families that use those facilities, and not families that have a parent who stays home or families that are able to rely on other family members for full- or part-time child care.

Both political parties should be commended for wanting to meaningfully work on the federal level to help enable families choose the best option for quality care for their children, while working towards prosperity and a better life. But the solution cannot be more money thrown at problems that instead need thoughtful and creative ideas to benefit as many Americans as possible.

By increasing the child tax credit – now up to $1,000 annually for each child 16 and under – to a maximum of $2,500 a year per child, hardworking lower-income and middle-class parents will get the relief they need, putting more of their own money directly into their pockets.

This money will not just be available for child care but also for food, shelter and educational options like supplemental tutoring or sports programs. This ultimately has a multiplied impact – helping more families and allowing parents more choices, while encouraging economic equality.

President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Both would like to ensure that this reform is pro-family, because they understand that tax relief for families is an investment in America’s future.

As a mother who has both stayed at home and worked part-time or full-time, it is obvious that the more choices we have to provide for our families the better. Sadly, some moms do not have the opportunity to choose.

Congress should seize this historic opportunity to truly reform the tax system and make it pro-family. As part of that effort, forgotten families with children should be allowed to keep more of their own paychecks. This is an opportunity to make a life-changing difference in the lives of American families that are working hard every day to make ends meet.

Families are the crucial social institution tasked with safety and security and the inculcation of skills and values that create healthy, productive citizens necessary for the future of a thriving nation.

Jennifer Appel and Tasha Fuiava were standing with the USS Ashland's commanding officer and others high on the bridgeway when the ship arrived at White Beach Naval Facility in Okinawa, five days after it picked up the women and their two dogs from their boat, 900 miles southeast of Japan.

Appel and Fuiava had left Honolulu on May 3 aboard Appel's 50-foot vessel the Sea Nymph for what was supposed to be an 18-day trip to Tahiti.

Storms flooded the engine and damaged the mast and sails so badly, they couldn't generate enough wind power to stay on course. They drifted aimlessly and sent unanswered distress calls for 98 consecutive days.

They were thousands of miles in the wrong direction when a Taiwanese fishing vessel found them. Towing the sailboat damaged it further, but Appel swam to the Taiwanese vessel to make a mayday call.

They'd run out of food for the dogs, and the woman began sharing their own, leaving their food supply 90 percent depleted by the time they were rescued.

The USS Ashland on Wednesday picked up the women, plus the dogs Zeus and Valentine, all four looking remarkably fit for having been lost at sea for nearly six months.

Appel told reporters on Friday that they were beginning to believe they were completely out of luck when they saw the U.S. Navy ship chugging toward them.

""When I saw the gray ship on the horizon, I was just shaking,"" she said then. ""I was ready to cry, I was so happy. I knew we were going to live.""

Although Appel has been sailing the Hawaiian islands for 10 years and spent two years preparing for this voyage, she acknowledged she and Fuiava, a novice sailor, may not have prepared as well as they could have.

Mueller’s close relationship with James Comey was always a problem, but the new role of the Russian dossier, which was paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party, expands Mueller’s conflicts beyond the pale. Any examination of Russian meddling in the election must include that Democratic money paid for the dossier and compensated sources, but Mueller and Clinton were colleagues under President Obama.

The archive, which reportedly consisted of more than 100 boxes of the founders’ writings, correspondence, speeches and other items, was housed in one of the two buildings destroyed on the Keysight campus.

More than 120 Keysight employees lost their homes in the devastating fire and hundreds were displaced, according to the company.

Keysight, which has received criticism over the destroyed archive, told Fox News that the documents were victims of an unusually destructive wildfire. “Keysight met and exceeded the strictest standards for archival protection, including guidelines set by the United Nations and the Library of Congress,” it said. “Adhering to the strictest archival standards could not protect these artifacts from the most damaging fire in state history. “

Other parts of the Keysight corporate archive survived the fire. “Many items in the Keysight archives were not affected by the fire because they were situated in other parts of the Santa Rosa facility that sustained only minor damage, housed in other sites around the world, or are digitally preserved,” it said.

HP told Fox News that its own archive of historic items is intact. “HP’s sites were not impacted and archives remain intact in both physical and digital formats,” it said, in a statement. “HP’s archives contain hundreds of items related to HP’s founders including many examples of speeches, personal correspondence, writings and other materials.”

The company uses a facility in Atlanta, Georgia for its corporate archives. “In addition, many other materials from the founders are part of public collections, such as the William Hewlett papers (1907-2010) held by Stanford University,” it said.

HP was founded in 1939 by Hewlett and Packard in a car garage in Palo Alto, now regarded as the birthplace of Silicon Valley. The garage is now a private museum and historical landmark.

Snuggling in bed under a layer of cozy covers makes for a deliciously warm feeling, especially in the face of unrelenting winter chill. If you’re in the market for a new blanket or quilt, be sure to read this guide for advice on how to choose the best bedding for your needs.

Blankets

Shopping for a blanket can feel fairly straightforward. And maybe it is. But with a little information, you’ll be more likely to bring home a product that you’ll cherish and love using.

Start with size. Typically, you’re looking for a blanket that will cover the top and sides of the mattress with a few extra inches to tuck securely underneath. Be sure to measure your mattress before you shop.

Compare fabrics. You can choose from a wide range of materials, and narrowing them down should depend on your preferences. You may suffer from allergies or prefer a smoother texture over a fuzzier one, for example.

○ Blankets made of wool are warm and provide excellent insulation on cold winter nights. Being a natural fiber, wool is breathable. Another useful quality is its ability to wick sweat and moisture away from the body, promoting a dry and warm experience. Woolen blankets are naturally fire-resistant, which makes them relatively safe to use around heat sources.

○ Usually composed of a polyester blend, synthetic fleece blankets are popular because they feel plush, velvety soft and warm. They also can wick moisture from your body, keeping you warm, dry and snug through a cold night. Synthetic fleece blankets are lighter than their woolen counterparts. It pays to ask for ones that don’t pill (produce tiny balls of fibers from abrasion). On the downside, synthetic fleece can conduct static electricity and can attract hair and dust.

○ Ideal for warm weather, a 100 percent cotton blanket is also great during spring and autumn or with air conditioning in the room. Since cotton is a natural fiber, it’s breathable. It’s also hypoallergenic and soft, making it a smart choice for babies, allergy sufferers or those with sensitive skin. When buying a cotton blanket, consider yarn size, fiber quality, thread count and construction. Typically, a good cotton blanket will have a higher thread count.

○ Blankets made of acrylic are a great alternative to their woolen or cashmere counterparts since they’re light, hypoallergenic and warm. What’s more, they are machine-washable and retain their colors.

Do a quality check. “You can really feel a good-quality textile in your hands,” says Kate Pascoe Squires, director of Australian textile company Kate & Kate. “If it feels beautiful, it usually will be. If it’s flimsy, thin or shiny, you know it’s not going to last. Be prepared for balling and pills after the first wash. Good-quality natural fibers will wash beautifully and offer you a gorgeous product for years to come.”

Compare prices. You can pick up a twin blanket for under $20, but it won’t last very long, Pascoe Squires says. “You can also purchase stunning midrange blankets that are great quality but won’t break the bank. In terms of price, you should look at between [$60 and $120] for these items. Then there are super-premium blankets, which can run up to thousands of dollars. The price reflects the beautiful materials used to knit these items, usually stunning wools, creating real heirloom pieces.”

Electric Blankets

If you’d rather invest in an electric blanket, here’s what you need to know:

○ Electric blankets use an integrated heating device to spread warmth through your bed.

○ Electric blankets for children are normally available and labeled as waterproof electric blankets.

○ Thanks to the overheat protection feature, your blanket should sense any abnormal temperature changes and switch off if it gets too hot. However, you should never leave your blanket on all night.

○ Fitted blankets remain flat and taut through the night and feel the same as the mattress underneath it. Unfitted blankets won’t fit around the corners or provide the same level of comfort as fitted ones.

○ Before making a purchase, lie on the blanket to feel its thickness, and check that the wiring is undamaged.

○ Some blankets are available with dual controls, so each partner can control the temperature on one side of the bed.

○ If your blanket has removable controls, you can safely wash it as well.

○ If your feet feel cold easily, look for a blanket with warm foot zones, which focus more heat at the bottom of the blanket.

Quilts



Quilts offer luxurious comfort and add visual warmth to your bedroom. A quilt usually consists of three layers: a fabric backing, a layer of soft batting and a fabric top. Quilting is essentially the art of stitching or tying these layers together, often in sync with the pattern of the top.

Consider the user and the climate. Typically, adults prefer heavier quilts, whereas children are comfortable with lightweight ones. When you’re buying a quilt for your child, remember that you’ll be dealing with spills and other messes.

It pays to factor in climate. Are you looking for a quilt for very cold nights or just cool weather? Do you need something that is season-specific or something that works for all kinds of weather?

Know the types of filling. Quilts filled with natural materials such as cotton, wool, feathers and down are more breathable, softer, lighter and more comfortable. They also will last longer than synthetic or microfiber fillings. Cotton makes an excellent choice for lightweight quilts.

Although down and feather fillings provide the most warmth, they are more expensive and may not be ideal for those with allergies. In these instances, options like microfiber work well since they imitate the look and feel of down without attracting dust. Cotton and wool are naturally hypoallergenic options.

RELATED: Duvet vs. Coverlet - What’s the Difference?

If you’re tired of alternating between a lightweight quilt for summer and a heavier one for winter, consider an all-season quilt.

Care for your quilt. Air your quilt every couple of weeks to keep it in great shape and enhance its longevity. Certain quilts, such as down, are best dry-cleaned, while some can be machine-washed as well. A duvet cover can protect your quilt and add to your room’s decor.

NEW YORK — September 18, 2017 – FOX News Channel (FNC) has named Laura Ingraham as the host of The Ingraham Angle, a new live primetime program to debut on October 30th, announced Suzanne Scott, president of programming for the network. Ahead of Ingraham’s debut, Hannity, hosted by Sean Hannity, will move to the 9PM/ET hour, the ensemble program The Five will return to the 5PM/ET timeslot, while the 10PM/ET hour will be helmed by rotating hosts during the interim period. Each of these changes will take effect on September 25th.

In making the announcement, Scott said, “We are delighted to unveil this new primetime schedule for both our current and future generation of loyal FNC fans. Over the last decade, Laura’s extraordinary insight, expertise and strong voice have connected with our viewers across the network’s programming. We look forward to her providing the audience with her exceptional commentary, engaging insight and spirited debate.”

Ingraham added, “After a decade working at FOX News with a team of television pros, I am thrilled to be joining the primetime line-up as a host of the 10 o’clock hour. Martha, Tucker and Sean have proven that they understand the pulse of America across the political and the cultural spectrum. I look forward to informing and entertaining the audience and introducing new voices to the conversation.”

The Ingraham Angle will aim to cut through the Washington chatter to speak directly with unexpected voices and the actual people who are impacted by the news of the day. Ingraham will challenge the decision makers to focus on everyday, hard-working Americans who serve as the backbone of the nation. The program will also highlight the importance of faith in our nation and reveal stories that showcase the American spirit.

Ingraham joined FNC in 2007 and most recently served as a contributor, providing political analysis and commentary to FNC’s daytime and primetime programming. She will continue hosting her radio program, The Laura Ingraham Show, where she is the most-listened-to woman in political talk radio on hundreds of stations nationwide. Two years ago, Ingraham also founded LifeZette, a political and cultural website, and will continue to serve as editor, although without a day-to-day operational role.

A graduate of Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia School of Law, Ingraham previously served as a litigator and Supreme Court law clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas. She is also the author of the New York Times bestsellers “The Hillary Trap,” “Shut Up & Sing,” “Power to the People,” and “The Obama Diaries,” among others.

Like the attacks in these cities, the Halloween attack in Lower Manhattan was aimed at inflicting maximum carnage.
NYPD officers showed up in force minutes after the attack began, shooting Saipov before he could kill even more New Yorkers.
They were unable to prevent the Halloween attack.","Editor's note: The following column first appeared in City Journal, a publication of the Manhattan Institute.

The Halloween assault in Lower Manhattan was straight out of the ISIS playbook. Ever since October 2010, when Al Qaeda published the second issue of its online magazine Inspire, jihadi leaders have been urging the faithful to turn ordinary cars and trucks into killing machines to “mow down the enemies of Allah.”

On Tuesday in New York, Sayfullo Saipov, 29, a green-card holder from Uzbekistan in Central Asia and resident of Florida, responded to the call.

He drove his rented Home Depot truck from West Houston Street onto a Hudson River Park bike path, one of New York’s most beloved amenities. Within ten minutes, eight people were killed and 15 were injured. A note found in the truck, law enforcement officials said, indicated that Saipov committed the attack out of devotion to ISIS.

Saipov might have killed even more people had the NYPD not been the nation’s premier counterterrorism force. NYPD officers showed up in force minutes after the attack began, shooting Saipov before he could kill even more New Yorkers.

At a news conference at 1 Police Plaza less than two hours after the deadly attack, John Miller, the New York Police Department’s chief of counterterrorism, cited the Islamic State’s updated guidance to jihadi aspirants contained in the third November 2016 issue of its own online journal, Rumiya (Rome), as the attacker’s probable inspiration. The article encouraged followers to attack “large outdoor conventions and celebrations, pedestrian-congested streets, outdoor markets, festivals, festivals, parades, [and] political rallies.” It even specified the ideal type, weight, and speed of a car needed for terror purposes, according to a translation provided by the Counter-Extremism Project.

It seems likely that the killer’s original target may have been the famous Greenwich Village Halloween parade, another beloved New York tradition that close to 1 million people typically attend. But the NYPD’s overwhelming security presence, and the numerous street closures adjacent to the parade, may have dashed his dreams of an even more memorable massacre.

While the attack investigation is ongoing and details of Saipov’s motives and plans are still being gathered, the vehicle assault bore the hallmarks of the attacks that ISIS and other militant jihadi groups have long been promoting. NYPD commissioner James O’Neill said that the terrorist emerged from his rental vehicle after crashing into a school bus screaming a statement that indicated terrorist intent. While the politically attuned O’Neill declined to identify what the attacker shouted, the language in which he was shouting, or his suspected nationality, numerous eye witnesses said that the man, dressed in dark clothing and carrying a pellet gun and a paint-ball gun, was screaming “Allahu Akhbar”—“God is Great” in Arabic.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo pointed out another hallmark of a vehicle assault. The perp, he said, was one of those “lone wolves” who “meant to cause pain and harm and probably death and the resulting terror.”

But it takes a pack to raise a lone wolf. Even if Saipov acted alone, he was part of a growing ideological fraternity numbering in the tens of thousands who now inhabit every region of the globe.

Those seeking eternal glory have staged similar attacks in at least a dozen other cities—from Nice to Paris to Barcelona to London to Jerusalem.

Like the attacks in these cities, the Halloween attack in Lower Manhattan was aimed at inflicting maximum carnage. Schools in the area were letting out students shortly after three o’clock when Saipov drove his rented truck off West Houston Street onto the bike path.

There was no shortage of targets. The streets between West Houston and Chambers were crowded with parents picking up their costumed children prepared for an evening of trick-or-treating. Pedestrians and bikers on the Hudson River bike path were stunned and helpless as Saipov careened his weapon through the crowd.

With the collapse of its self-declared “caliphate” in Syria and Iraq, ISIS is on the run. So are its adherents. But as the extremists disperse, the terrorist threat, paradoxically, increases. American and other intelligence agencies have long warned of a likely rise in vehicle and other attacks as the frustrated, furious faithful are forced to reorient their campaign. In May 2017, the U.S. Transportation and Security Agency (TSA) warned truck and bus companies to be on guard for suspicious individuals seeking to rent vehicles.

According to TSA data, Islamist terrorists have carried out more than a dozen vehicular assaults since 2014 that have killed more than 170 people. Such attacks are ever more likely, the TSA memo warned, since “unsophisticated tactics such as vehicle-ramming” are hard to prevent and capable of inflicting “mass casualties if successful.”

Saipov might have killed even more people had the NYPD not been the nation’s premier counterterrorism force. NYPD officers showed up in force minutes after the attack began, shooting Saipov before he could kill even more New Yorkers.

The NYPD, in fact, was already responding to the vehicular threat long before this type of terror became the focus of federal concern.

At Tuesday’s press conference, Miller discussed the department’s SHIELD program, which has sent officers to brief some 20,000 businesses in the private sector about the growing terrorist threat post–9/11.

Miller noted that after Rumiya reissued its call for vehicular attacks and suggested an assault on the Thanksgiving Day parade, the NYPD visited over 148 truck rental offices in the metropolitan area asking employees to watch for “suspicious indicators.” The police department conducted repeated visits in person and by phone, he said.

Even more essential has been the NYPD’s intelligence division, which has long collected information about suspicious individuals. After being heavily, and in many instances unfairly, criticized for allegedly violating civil liberties, Miller’s former boss, William Bratton, shut down a particularly controversial program that the intelligence unit had run early in its existence—a so-called “demographic unit” that collected information on the location and activities of Muslims suspected of terrorist intentions.

Another critic was New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who lambasted the NYPD for surveilling New Jersey-based Muslims and asked whether the spying was “borne out of arrogance, or out of paranoia, or out of both.” Unconfirmed news reports Tuesday night indicated that Saipov had lived for some time in Paterson, New Jersey.

But the NYPD has not scaled back most of its vital surveillance activities. In fact, New York’s Finest, working in tandem with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies that comprise the Joint Terrorism Task Force, have continued collecting information on suspected terrorists living in and visiting the city.

They were unable to prevent the Halloween attack. The so-called “flash-to-bang” trajectory of lone-wolf radicalization is accelerating. An individual intent on mayhem against “soft” targets is the toughest law enforcement terrorist challenge.

Eight people were killed Tuesday. But the toll could have been much higher had the police not responded so quickly and New Yorkers not been so stubbornly resilient.

Concluding his remarks Tuesday, Governor Cuomo issued his own call to arms. “We’re not going to let them win,” he said. “And if we change our lives, we contort ourselves to them, then they win and we lose.”

Three and a half hours after Saipov’s wicked rampage, hundreds of thousands of costumed New Yorkers poured into the streets to celebrate Halloween, as planned. Paradoxically, Saipov’s perverse mission failed: New Yorkers were not cowed, and he was denied the martyrdom that he was clearly seeking.

Shot in the stomach, Saipov will probably live to be brought to justice, not far from the scene of his heinous crime.

Just last week, we had students from Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Japan, Liberia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, and Mali around our table. We’ve made our goal to fill our home as often as possible with people who are different from us—to learn, to laugh, and to grow—but you might not get that impression if you Google our business or check out my personal Facebook profile.

That’s because 10 months ago, my husband and I filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota law that would require our small business to celebrate same-sex marriages if we enter into the marriage industry at all.

As Christians, we’d love to use our talents as filmmakers to celebrate the goodness of marriage as taught in the Bible though our work, but the state has made it clear that if we don’t promote all messages about marriage, we’ll face enormous fines, and even up to 90 days in jail, simply for living according to our convictions.

Since then, we’ve received a staggering amount of messages wishing death, disease, and poverty on us, our family, and even some of our closest associates all because we challenged the idea that the government shouldn’t have the power to silence or threaten anyone for not promoting all messages.

So when a federal judge ruled in our case, and equated our request to protect our conscience to posting a “White Applicants Only” sign in our window, we were both hurt and deeply offended. Like most people in the expressive professions, we work with all people; we just can’t promote all messages.

A person’s protected status is irrelevant to these types of message-based decisions. For example, an atheist print-shop owner is no more guilty of religious discrimination for declining to design a T-shirt for a Christian that proclaims “God exists” than we are guilty of sexual orientation discrimination for declining to create films promoting messages about marriage with which we disagree.

Not just our business practices, but our whole lives, run counter to the “whites only” analogy. Two of our sons are adopted from Ethiopia. Our youngest child is half Cameroonian and half Native American. And having eight children means we can’t afford to travel the world, so we bring the world to us. We do this precisely because we believe beauty exists in the diversity of God’s creation.

In fact, several years ago we intentionally began to stay home on holidays so that we could celebrate with people who would otherwise have no place to go. This has included spending Christmas with an alcoholic Vietnam veteran, a bisexual international student, and yes, even Trump supporters, among many, many others. We love all people. We work with all people. We simply don’t promote all messages.

But the irony of it all is that every single person operates this way. Nobody wants to be forced to promote messages—via custom artistic expression in our case—or have to repress their own speech just because their opinion is unpopular in the eyes of the government.

If the First Amendment only protects speech that is popular in its cultural day, then it really doesn’t protect any speech.

This is why we’re appealing the court’s ruling. This case is about preserving the freedom of all people to live according to their sincerely held beliefs—a principle we all should be able to support.

We are all on a journey with our convictions. I wish I could invite you into our home and discuss it over one of my daughter’s amazing homemade lemon tarts. But until that can happen, no matter where you are on that path or what you believe about marriage, we should all be able to agree that living peacefully according to our deepest convictions without the fear of government punishment is best for everyone.",Christian videographer: Let's live together in peace instead of silencing those with whom we disagree,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/20/christian-videographer-lets-live-together-in-peace-instead-silencing-those-with-whom-disagree.html

KENDALL JENNER CALLED OUT FOR NOT TIPPING AT NEW YORK BAR

The law Obama’s administration created ruled that employees own their tips, not the restaurant, and that restaurants are not allowed to pool tips or give them to non-tipped employees. The rules applied to all levels of wage-earning servers.

Activists are concerned that the removal of the ban will lead to owners taking the tips for themselves, which could be possible under the proposed law change.

The co-founder of ROC United, one of the groups fighting for a $15 wage, said, “It says it’s possible for employers to walk away with the tips and not give them to anybody.”

The National Restaurant Association lobby told CBS that removing the restrictions on tip pooling alleviates the “disparity between the ‘front of the house’ and the ‘back of the house,’” since the back of the house employees are not tipped.

My slipping sense of control produces so much anxiety in my life so I end up grasping for even more control. I don’t know what else to do but I’m afraid to surrender. Really afraid.”

That was a very real and honest fear shared with me recently by another mom who is watching her eldest child navigate his teen years and is worried sick about his choices and the outcomes.

As I wrote about my own struggle with “controlling my kids” in my book “Mom Set Free,” I often wondered if surrender came easier to other moms. I wondered if I was mostly alone in my struggle to unclench my fists that were trying to control outcomes and parent more open-handed to God’s plans.

But based on an Instagram comment feed I scrolled through just last week, I know I am not alone. In fact, control seems to be something most moms struggle with.

Here are just six out of 132 comments shared by brave women and their struggle to surrender:

“I don’t even know what motherhood looks like without being worried, anxious and a total control freak!”

“My biggest fear is MY anxiety becoming THEIR anxiety.”

“I thought I’d moved past control issues once my kids got to school, but now they’re teens and it’s a real struggle to step back and give them their wings.”

“I’m such a control freak and it’s been a challenge not being able to control a single thing with my 5-week-old. Being on her schedule at all times has been the biggest struggle for me.”

“Mom guilt is real and life is crazy! Extra hard when you're a control freak.”

“I am anxious and worried way too often and want everything to be in perfect order. I need to be set free from those unhealthy mindsets!”

I can’t help but wonder if you can relate to any of these comments, because even if you wouldn’t describe yourself as a “control freak” you still might struggle with surrendering your kids to their sovereign Father.

I think part of our struggle is rooted in a misunderstanding of what surrender actually is.

One way we might think of surrender is this: “I give up. There is nothing I can do or say that is going to make a difference here. I’ve tried everything and nothing helps. My influence in my kid’s lives is useless and exhausted. I’m done trying. I surrender.”

But if we look to Jesus we find an entirely different lens through which to view surrender.

In the Gospel of Mark, chapter 14, we find that Jesus is “overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death” (v. 34 NIV). Jesus knew that the fulfillment of his mission was imminent. He would soon take on the sin of the world and bear the wrath and shame for the entire human race. Jesus was “deeply distressed and troubled” when he prayed: “Abba Father, everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will” (v. 36 NIV).

This simple but profound prayer shows us what surrender really is. Surrender is acknowledging God’s power, submitting to his will, and trusting in his goodness.

When we find ourselves grasping for control over our kid’s lives, or our own circumstances, we can pray like Jesus prayed to his Father: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

The above prayer, which my pastor Drew Williams shared at church many years ago, has expanded my heart and opened my hands to God’s perfect will in times when I have come to him very fearful and close-fisted.

This can be our prayer of surrender when:

Our hearts are aching and our fears are raging over the choices our kids are making.

We crash into the reality that our kids unique needs will seriously mess with our perfect plans.

We have so much anxiety over our role as moms that we witness our anxiety spilling over into our homes and onto our kids, who then take on our anxiety.

We feel helpless and hopeless.

This is a prayer that we probably need to pray over and over and over again, each and every day: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

Prayer is not only the antidote to finding peace amidst all of the anxiety-inducing pressure, but it is our most powerful weapon against the enemy who, like it or not, is working against us. He “prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:8 NIV).

I don’t say this to scare us. I say this to encourage us to get on our knees in surrender and fight for our kids in prayer.

Our prayers for our children (and with our children) are unimaginably significant. Through prayer, we get to partner with God in the work he is doing in the lives of our kids, all the while remembering that: “It won’t be long before this generous God who has great plans for us in Christ – eternal and glorious plans they are! – will have you put together and on your feet for good. He gets the last word; yes, He does!” (1 Peter 5:11 MSG).

In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ. And not just temporal plans, but eternal plans. And he gets the last word.

We can rest in his sovereignty and surrender to his will, just as we saw Jesus surrendering to his Father’s will in his prayer at Gethsemane. Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.

Surrender isn’t giving up. It’s giving over every one of our fears and worries and problems and weaknesses to God. And in turn, receiving his peace as we partner with him, rather than trying to be him in our kid’s lives.

We have a profound role to play in our kid’s lives, by establishing healthy boundaries and enforcing consistent consequences, wrapped in unconditional love. But as we do that, we have to remember that we are not the originator and orchestrator of our kid’s lives.

Our role is to seek and surrender to “The Great Originator and Orchestrator” and trust him to be – and to do – everything we can’t. He’s good at that, you know. He’s good at being God. So let’s let him. And in doing so, we are enabled to release the anxiety and reclaim the adventure that we’ve lost in the quest to play his role.

Saipov was an Uber driver who had passed a background check, the company told Fox News. It added that Saipov has now been banned from the app, and Uber has offered assistance to the FBI.

Saipov's notes, written in Arabic and pledging loyalty to ISIS, turned up in and near the vehicle, Fox News was told. In addition, the New York Post reported that investigators found ""an image of the ISIS flag inside his vehicle.""

Four of the injured were teachers and students who were riding on a short yellow school bus near Stuyvesant High School when they were hit by the suspect's Home Depot rental truck.

Two months later, an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus occurred in Atlanta on the same day a video began circulating on social media of an unarmed black woman being shot to death by police in the Georgia city.

What all these shocking and disparate stories have in common are two things: they are not true and they all originated from a group of Russian cyber trolls working out of a non-descript office building in St. Petersburg.

In addition, throughout last year’s presidential election season, dozens of stories circulated on Twitter, Facebook and other social media attacking Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton about everything from supposedly having poor mental health to allegedly fostering secret ties with Islamic extremists.

With top executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google testifying Tuesday before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Russia’s attempts to influence U.S. elections and sow discord across the country via social media, many questions remain about how these Russian trolls operate, the veracity of the so-called news they are spreading and what tech giants in Silicon Valley are doing to combat this scourge.

“We’re pretty sure Russia is behind this given that we’ve seen the building they use, know that they’ve put hundreds of millions of dollars into this effort and that they have about 200 employees working on this,” Philip Howard, a professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford and research director of the Oxford Internet Institute, told Fox News. “The problem combatting them is different with each social media platform.”

On the world’s most popular social media site, Facebook, Russian trolls use fake names and backgrounds paired with stolen photos to pose as American citizens and spread either false news stories or hacked information.

In one instance, an account under the name of Melvin Reddick of Harrisburg, Pa. last June posted a link to a website called DCLeaks, which displayed material stolen from a number of prominent American political figures. While the information posted on the site appeared to be true, Reddick was an apparition – with no records in Pennsylvania appearing under his name and his photos taken from an unsuspecting Brazilian.

While trolls in Russia have also used individual accounts on Twitter to disseminate false or incendiary news, the more common practice implemented on that platform is so-called bot farming, where a series of up to hundreds and –at times – thousands of automated accounts will send out identical messages seconds apart and in the exact alphabetical order of their made-up names.

On Election Day last year, a group of bots on Twitter blasted out the hashtag #WarAgainstDemocrats more than 1,700 times.

Experts say that while these trolls may use various methods to try and disguise their Russian identities, such as changing their IP addresses, they are easily tracked by their frequent screw-ups (some accidently put their location setting on in Twitter, use credit cards linked to the Russian government or write their posts in Cyrillic).

Preventing them from operating, however, is a different story.

Groups like Hoffman’s Oxford Internet Institute say that they can monitor questionable accounts and alert tech companies, but to really make progress – and to openly prove that Russia is behind these attacks – Facebook and Twitter need to be more transparent.

“The only way to see if these accounts are actually Russian is for Facebook and Twitter to be more open and tell us,” Hoffman said. “That is why these testimonies are so important.”

The testimony from Facebook, obtained before the company went before the Senate, revealed that posts generated by Russia's Internet Research Agency potentially reached as many as 126 million users between January 2015 and August 2017.

Twitter was expected to tell the same subcommittee that it has uncovered and shut down 2,752 accounts linked to the same group, Russia's Internet Research Agency, which is known for promoting pro-Russian government positions.

“Twitter believes that any activity of that kind—regardless of magnitude—is unacceptable, and we agree that we must do better to prevent it,” a source familiar with Twitter’s testimony, said in an email to Fox News. “State-sanctioned manipulation of elections by sophisticated foreign actors is a new challenge for us—and one that we are determined to meet.”

Despite the more than 2,700 accounts linked to Russia being nearly 14 times larger than the number of accounts Twitter handed over to congressional committees three weeks ago, the company the number of accounts linked to Russia and that were Tweeting election-related content was “small in comparison to the total number of accounts,” on the social media site, the person familiar with the testimony said, adding they did not rig the election in favor of President Trump.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee holding the hearing, said in a statement that manipulation of social media by terrorist organizations and foreign governments is ""one of the greatest challenges to American democracy"" and he wants to make sure the companies are doing everything possible to combat it.

""Clearly, to date, their efforts have been unsuccessful,"" Graham said.

The letters at the end stand for “Retractable Fastback.”

That doesn’t exactly describe it, either.

The car is not a fastback. It may look like one in profile, but it has flying buttresses, a recessed rear window and a targa top, just like Magnum P.I.’s Ferrari. The roof is power-retractable, however, through a mesmerizing 10-second dance.

Flick a toggle switch and the rear section — comprised of the buttresses connected by a basket handle — rises up to expose the bin where the Miata soft top’s roof normally goes. The roof panel and rear window flip and fold away into it, and the rest falls back into place. What you’re left with is a very different-looking Miata, which was the point.

The last-generation Miata was also available with a retractable hardtop, but it was shaped like a solid version of the standard fabric roof. It looked bulky and awkward when it was closed. The model was a big seller, however, so Mazda North America design manager Ken Saward says he and his team really wanted to do it justice this time around. They did. The RF has the flair of a classic sports car, roof up or down.

While taking photos of it in a parking lot, I was approached by an ancient man wearing a U.S. Navy ship baseball cap and driving an SUV with U.S. Marine stickers all over it. He asked if I was married. Not sure where he was going with the line of inquiry, I was honest and answered yes, to which he responded, “Too bad, you’ll be chasing the single girls away in that thing. It’s hot!”

He wasn’t wrong about the attention the car gets. Compared to the regular Miata, it turns a lot more heads. It’s amazing what a little plumage can do.

But its primary purpose is to give the car a more coupe-like feel, and at this it’s less successful.

To keep its weight down, the Miata does without much sound insulation throughout. The RF may prove to be a little warmer in cold weather, but it doesn’t seem significantly quieter than other Miatas I’ve driven, especially on the highway.

That’s also true when the roof is down. While the open rear window means you’re not scooping in too much air, the corner of the basket handle catches enough of the breeze right next to your ear to stir up a racket. Rolling up the window helps, but then what’s the point?

Dynamically speaking, though, the RF is essentially the same as any Miata. Which means it’s very good. The transformation only adds 113 pounds, and it’s been well-accommodated through adjustments made to the suspension and steering to maintain the Miata’s legendary handling. There’s no change to its 155 hp four-cylinder engine, so, head to head, the RF would lose at an autocross. But without a stopwatch handy, you’d never know the difference.

You will notice the difference in price: about two-and-a-half grand above the soft top, depending on the trim level. The RF starts at $32,430 for a performance-focused Club and $33,795 for a Grand Touring with leather upholstery, lane-departure warning and a few other luxury niceties. Sorry, bargain shoppers, the RF is not available in the Miata’s entry-level Sport trim.

High fashion does not come cheap.

""With respect to the victims, their families, and our city agency partners, we will be postponing our ceremonial Blue Line Painting and Faces of the Marathon media events originally scheduled for Wednesday,'' the New York Road Runners, the group that hosts the event, said in a statement.

The New York Road Runners said in an earlier statement that it would consider enhancing security for the event, but was confident it had enough security measures in place for participants to run safely.

“I got so sick over the course of time, not knowing what was wrong with me,” recalled McDonough.
And I was in so much pain… I decided I would have my implants removed.”At age 35, McDonough was diagnosed with lupus, an inflammatory disease.","Mary McDonough receives emails almost every day from people, and it’s not just because she once starred as the pretty, wholesome Erin Walton in one of TV’s most beloved families — these strangers are asking for help.

The reason? They want her advice on plastic surgery.

The former child star, who wanted to give her career a boost after appearing on “The Waltons” from 1971 until 1981, went under the knife at age 24. It was a decision she would later regret.

The 56-year-old star previously chronicled her personal journey in the 2012 memoir “Lessons from the Mountain.”

“I had breast implants trying to fit in and be part of the ‘Dallas’ era,” McDonough told Fox News. “I made that choice because I was told they were safe and would last a lifetime. They weren’t and I got very, very sick… My implants ruptured and disintegrated in my chest. I was sick for 10 years and no one knew what was wrong with me.”

After the surgery, McDonough’s health began to deteriorate. Not only was she faced with chronic muscle pain, but her famous red mane was falling out. McDonough felt like she was constantly succumbing to the flu and was unable to hold her only daughter Sydnee.

By 1994, McDonough decided to remove the implants that she felt were contributing to her physical decline.

“I got so sick over the course of time, not knowing what was wrong with me,” recalled McDonough. “It was a very difficult decision for me to have [breast implants] in the first place because I felt like I needed to do it for my career. And so, I didn’t want to have another surgery to have them removed… But I was so sick, I could not risk my baby daughter. I could not feed her. And I was in so much pain… I decided I would have my implants removed.”

At age 35, McDonough was diagnosed with lupus, an inflammatory disease. She believes the implants were to blame for her unbearable health woes over the years.

“Once I had my implants removed, I started to get better,” said McDonough. “My lupus is in remission. I still deal with fibromyalgia and arthritis… But, I’m... healthier. I’m way healthier than I was in my 30s… The further I get from those implants, the better I get.”

McDonough has since found a new purpose as an activist for women’s body image issues. Her goal isn’t to discourage others from getting plastic surgery but to empower them with knowledge about the potential risks and how to cope.

“I’ve never been anti-implants,” said McDonough. “What I’ve lobbied for is to have it be safe… I also want to educate people on the dangers and what women should look out for… Some things have changed. You are supposed to have them replaced every six to seven years. But how many people can afford to do that?

""And some people lose their health insurance because they have breast implants. So there’s a lot of issues and I always work to get the information out to people. To try to get people to make an educated choice. If they want to do it, know what you’re getting into.”

Many fans can identify with McDonough, who once faced pressure in Hollywood to look a certain way while growing up in front of cameras.

“There was pressure from the wardrobe department [on ‘The Waltons’] about [whether] I can fit into my clothes from last year or had I gained more weight,” she claimed. “And I was just a kid! I was a growing girl and you had these old clothes that we wore for years. We never had a fancy wardrobe, and so when you’re becoming a teenager, your body has to change.”

McDonough, who was growing up in front of America, struggled to accept the discouraging words.

“I didn’t deal with it well at all,” she admitted. “I took it personally and I had always strived to be so perfect. I was always trying to be the perfect girl. The perfect weight. I was literally trying to fit into all of it.

""And I took it personally and it hurt my feelings and I reacted by doing starvation diets… And not being very good to myself. And my focus became about the external parts of me instead of the inside of who I was and what I had to offer, which is what I had to learn later in life.”

McDonough never shared her personal struggles with her cast-mates.

“It’s funny, Richard Thomas told me after he read my book, ‘I had no idea you were going through this. Why didn’t you say something?’” she said. “But I think I was so set on trying to be the perfect girl that to me, it was just a part of what I was supposed to do. And look, it wasn’t like I was the only one in the show. There was a focus on what the others should look like as well. I just took it more personally and internalized it.”

But these days, McDonough, who currently resides in Colorado, is feeling good about herself.

And she still stays in touch with her TV family.

“We’re all very loyal and true to each other,” she explained. “I see other shows where a cast member dies and the other cast mates completely throw them under the bus. We would never do that. We love each other too much… We’ve lost cast members and we miss them. We would never dishonor their memory.”",'Waltons' actress Mary McDonough struggled after getting breast implants,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/01/waltons-actress-mary-mcdonough-struggled-after-getting-breast-implants.html

Experts in human origins said the paper could help scientists pin down the various factors that led to the Neanderthals' demise.","What killed off the Neanderthals? It's a big debate, and now a study says that no matter what the answer, they were doomed anyway.

Our close evolutionary cousins enjoyed a long run in Europe and Asia, but they disappeared about 40,000 years ago after modern humans showed up from Africa.

The search for an explanation has produced many theories including climate change, epidemics, or inability to compete with the modern humans, who may have had some mental or cultural edge.

The new study isn't intended to argue against those factors, but just to show that they're not needed to explain the extinction, says Oren Kolodny of Stanford University.

He and colleague Marcus Feldman present their approach in a paper released Tuesday by the journal Nature Communications.

They based their conclusion on a computer simulation that represented small bands of Neanderthals and modern humans in Europe and Asia. These local populations were randomly chosen to go extinct, and then be replaced by another randomly chosen population, with no regard for whether it represented the same species.

Neither species was assumed to have any inherent advantage, but there was one crucial difference: Unlike the Neanderthals, the modern humans were supplemented by reinforcements coming in from Africa. It wasn't a huge wave, but rather ""a tiny, tiny trickle of small bands,"" Kolodny said.

Still, that was enough to tip the balance against the Neanderthals. They generally went extinct when the simulation was run more than a million times under a variety of assumptions.

If survival was a game of chance, ""it was rigged by the fact that there's recurring migration,"" Kolodny said. ""The game was doomed to end with the Neanderthals losing.""

Kolodny said the evidence that such migrations actually occurred is suggestive rather than conclusive. Such migrations would not be expected to leave much of an archaeological trace, he said.

Experts in human origins said the paper could help scientists pin down the various factors that led to the Neanderthals' demise. It fits in with other recent attempts to explain the extinction without assuming behavioral differences between Neanderthals and our ancestors, said Wil Roebroeks of the University of Leiden in the Netherlands.

Michelle Black wants the nation to know her husband was more than a Special Forces soldier. He was also a master chess player and avid sportsman, she said, who spoke three languages, including Arabic and the local dialect in Niger, which made him something of a celebrity among his unit. She says most of all, he was an amazing husband and father.

Michelle Black said when it comes to the ongoing investigation into her husband’s death, the military is giving her guidance, but she’s not watching the news or following the day-to-day details. Someday, she said, she’ll need answers. But it won’t bring Bryan back.

According to court documents unsealed Tuesday, prosecutors say they believe Manafort -- a former chairman of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign -- and his business associate Richard Gates were at risk of fleeing.

“The defendants pose a risk of flight based on the serious nature of the charges, their history of deceptive and misleading conduct, the potentially significant sentences the defendants face, the strong evidence of guilt, their significant financial resources, and their foreign connections,” the court documents read.

Manafort is known to have a significant amount of wealth. Between 2012 and 2016, he listed his assets to be between $19 million and $136 million, the New York Daily News reported.

“His financial holdings are substantial, if difficult to quantify precisely,” Tuesday’s documents revealed.

The 68-year-old was also being considered a flight risk because of his foreign connections. The Washington Post reported that Manafort keeps three U.S. passports and has submitted 10 passport applications in recent years.

Prosecutors note in the documents that Manafort also has wealthy ties to Moscow and to Kiev, Ukraine, through his previous business dealings. His travel schedule in the last year reveals the many connections Manafort has overseas, increasing the possibility of flight, prosecutors said.

The court documents even brought up Manafort’s age, stating he might be more inclined to flee with a guilty verdict carrying a sentence of around 12 to 15 years.

Manafort pleaded not guilty Monday after being indicted on 12 counts by a federal grand jury as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign officials in the 2016 presidential election.

The special counsel’s office told Fox News that the counts include conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading Foreign Agent Registration (FARA) statements, false statements and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign banks and financial accounts.

Manafort’s bail was set at $10 million. He will return to court Thursday to hear the terms of his bail.","Paul Manafort considered flight risk because of wealth, foreign connections: special counsel",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/01/paul-manafort-considered-flight-risk-because-wealth-foreign-connections-special-counsel.html

Lt. James Tracy, a police supervisor who ordered the arrest of the nurse, was demoted to officer and also is appealing.","A Utah nurse who was arrested for refusing to let a police officer draw blood from an unconscious patient settled Tuesday with Salt Lake City and the university that runs the hospital for $500,000.

Nurse Alex Wubbels and her lawyer, Karra Porter, announced the move nearly two months after they released police body-camera video showing Detective Jeff Payne handcuffing Wubbels. The footage drew widespread attention online amid the national debate about police use of force.

The settlement covers all possible defendants in a lawsuit, including individual police officers, university police and hospital security guards. The payout will be divided among the city and the University of Utah.

Wubbels plans to use part of the money to fund legal help for others trying to get similar body-camera video. She said that in cases like hers, video is essential to being heard and believed.

""We all deserve to know the truth, and the truth comes when you see the actual raw footage, and that's what happened in my case,"" she said. ""No matter how truthful I was in telling my story, it was nothing compared to what people saw and the visceral reaction people experienced when watching the footage of the experience I went through.""

She said she also plans to give a portion of the $500,000 to a nurse's union and help lead a campaign to stop physical and verbal abuse of nurses on the job.

University of Utah hospital officials said in a statement they support Wubbels and have changed their procedures and training on how police and health care workers interact to ensure nothing similar happens again.

A spokesman for Salt Lake City didn't immediately return messages seeking comment.

Wubbel was following hospital policy when she told Payne he needed a warrant or the consent of the patient to draw blood after a July 26 car crash. The patient was not under arrest or suspected of wrongdoing.

Payne had neither. He eventually dragged Wubbels outside and handcuffed her as she screamed that she had done nothing wrong.

She was released without being charged but has said the incident left her feeling terrified and bullied. In a call for changes, Wubbel and her lawyer released the video they had obtained through a public records request.

Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown has since apologized and fired Payne after an internal investigation found he violated department policies.

Brown said in a disciplinary letter that he was ""deeply troubled"" by Payne's conduct, which he said brought ""significant disrepute"" on the department.

Payne is appealing that decision, saying the firing was an unfair reaction to the negative publicity.

The patient was an off-duty Idaho reserve police officer driving a semitrailer when he was hit by a man fleeing police in a pickup truck. He later died of his injuries.

Lt. James Tracy, a police supervisor who ordered the arrest of the nurse, was demoted to officer and also is appealing. He said he suggested Payne consider handcuffing the nurse and that his superiors had never informed him of the hospital's blood-draw policy, according to appeal documents.

Wubbels said she was relieved at the discipline and would be disappointed if it's overturned, though she stressed that decision is out of her control.

""The police have to police themselves,"" she said.

On Tuesday, the officers presented the 3-year-old with an electric toy police car, complete with flashing red and blue lights and a personalized “Deputy Cohen” sticker on the front. They also gave the family a framed photo of Cohen saluting at the procession.

Cohen excitedly drove his new toy and recited the pledge of allegiance, rousing applause and “good jobs!” from the officers.

“We wanted to bless Cohen for his selfless act of support and love,” The Floyd County Sherriff’s office wrote in a Facebook post. “But, once again, we were blessed by him beyond measure. God bless you abundantly and keep you safe Cohen!”

""I think this is a really promising alternative to what's out there and will be attractive to a lot of patients,"" said Laurel Habel, a panelist and researcher at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, California.

The recommendation comes less than a week after FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb announced the agency's plans to encourage widespread use among opioid addicts of less harmful opioids such as methadone and buprenorphine, the active ingredient in RBP-6000.

The United States is battling an opioid abuse epidemic that in 2015 claimed 33,000 people. President Donald Trump recently declared the problem a national public health emergency.

Indivior studied two dosing regimens. In one, 300 milligrams were given once a month for six months. In the other, two doses of 300 milligrams were followed by four doses of 100 milligrams. There was little difference in effectiveness between the two doses and the higher dose caused more side effects.

Panelists said they would like to see more data about which patients should be given the higher dose, though some said they would like to have it available despite the lack of data supporting any additional benefit.

If approved the product would be the first monthly injectable buprenorphine treatment. Indivior already sells Suboxone Film, a product which combines buprenorphine and nalexone and is placed under the tongue or inside the cheek.

The health regulator is due to make its decision on RBP-6000 by Nov. 30.

The drug could capture about 30 percent of the broader buprenorphine market, Stifel's analyst Max Herrmann said. The analyst expects the drug to generate peak sales of $707 million by the end of 2021.

""I was just sitting there, counting cigarettes. It was about 4 am. And then out of nowhere, just BOOM! A van comes through and smashes the glass,"" Kingman told FOX8. ""It only took a minute-and-a-half at most. They knew what they were doing. They all had hoodies, gloves, bandannas, they were ready, they were professional.”

News 5 reported the vans used were stolen before the dramatic theft.

“They stole it right out my driveway,” an unidentified Cleveland man told the station, adding that his van was left badly damaged at the 7-Eleven. “I have to deal with fixing my car. Now I’m stuck with a broken steering column. Hopefully, that’s all that’s wrong with it.”

The ATM had an undisclosed amount of money inside, police said.

Investigators from the House Intelligence Committee are seeking to learn how much, if at all, federal law enforcement officers have relied on the dossier since it was compiled by the research firm Fusion GPS, with funding from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, in mid-2016.

The documents reviewed Tuesday were presented for inspection pursuant to a subpoena issued by the committee's chairman, U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif.

Republican staffers say they were not allowed to make copies of the documents they saw, but were only permitted to review them on-site and take notes. Other officials told Fox that Nunes rebuffed the Justice Department's offer to bring the documents to the Capitol, saying he only wanted his staffers to view the documents and not take copies away.

Capitol Hill sources told Fox News that U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the committee's ranking member, attended the session at the Justice Department -- as did two staffers for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Two Republican committee staffers and two Democratic committee staffers also attended.

Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee consider the attendance of Schiff and Pelosi's staffers to be a notable change of tune for the Democrats, who have long insisted there was no need to investigate the dossier.

Contacted by Fox News, Schiff’s and Pelosi’s offices confirmed the personnel lineup for the document-review session.

The sources also said the session grew contentious after the Democrats slowed down the process with numerous questions. However, other officials said the meeting grew contentious only after Schiff became upset that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., had been notified about the session before Schiff.

The new homeowners, who wished to remain nameless, are now suing the Lennar construction company for fraud and breach of warranty. They’re also seeking punitive and compensatory damages, as well as any court costs they incur, per the Post.

In addition to bottles of urine, court documents say the couple found “containers containing remnants of partially eaten food, construction debris and other garbage” within the walls of their new residence at the luxury 1200 Avenue at Port Imperial building, including partially eaten Chinese food orders and cupcake wrappers. The insulation in the master bedroom was also found to be soaked in urine.

“To my knowledge that’s all very bad for your health,” said Derrick S. “There were a lot of things I saw that [weren’t] up to code.”

According to the lawsuit, Lennar was “embarrassed” by the couple’s findings, though they had not planned to open up all of the unit’s ceilings and walls for inspection. (Lennar is only opening up the lower parts of certain walls, the Post reports.) The couple also tried to sell the home back to Lennar, but their offer was rejected.

Now, there may be a legitimate debate about whether President Trump is unfairly singling out Muslims in his efforts to make America safe. But when a terrorist kills Americans – this time, with a rental truck – and then shouts “God is great” in Arabic, the president’s zeal is understandable.

There is no way to protect every block in our cities, every field on our farms, every school in our suburbs. We have become accustomed to our freedom to move around as we wish, and to gather with whom we choose.

No one could have foreseen Tuesday’s sinister mission to turn a vehicle into a deadly weapon. We stroll our streets without paying attention to what’s around us, intent on reading or sending text messages, or watching videos on our phones. If we’re on a bike lane, we assume no four-wheel vehicles will intrude.

The problem is that terrorists – those whose perverted view equates God’s greatness with acts of bloodshed – know how clueless we are, and exploit our assumption that nothing bad can happen to us. And it is that careless confidence that makes us easy prey, soft victims for determined evildoers.

Even before the names of the perpetrator and the dead and injured are known, there will be warnings not to stereotype, not to sully the reputation of any faith or ideology. Don’t link radical Islam with terror.

Yet, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio came right out and said it: “This was an act of terror.” That was already apparent to the New York City police, whom de Blasio has repeatedly insulted as racists, and demeaned for quickly confronting the dangers of criminal behavior.

That’s the same de Blasio who pompously defied Trump’s call to dismantle so-called sanctuary cities, making it tougher for authorities to find and corral criminals. “Don’t let the terrorists change our life in any shape, manner or form,” said Gov. Andrew Cuomo, just two hours after the attack took place.

That’s right, New Yorkers. Listen to your governor. Don’t take any extra precautions in how you live your lives. Don’t admit that there are evil people in the world who want to kill you, then exhort God’s greatness. Don’t use that ugly word -- war – to describe our conflict with radical Islam. Don’t offend.

Colder weather brings us closer, but we often feel bored and irritable when the whole family is cooped up indoors. Instead of retreating to our own rooms or busying ourselves with more housework, consider starting a regular tradition for the family to enjoy together. There’s nothing quite as universally fun as a good game. Friendly competition and a lot of laughter is a recipe for a weekly family tradition that everyone will look forward to.

Dedicate a space to games and play. Now is an especially great time to get the game room ready before winter weather hits and you get snowed in for days on end. Despite the size of your space, you can always make room for fun. You could convert an attic, basement or den into a game room with some comfortable furniture, funky wall treatments and storage for toys, games and media.

Not all of us have enough space to dedicate an entire room to just games though. If not, make the most out of underused nooks by pulling up a couple of armchairs around a small table. You could also take advantage of double-duty furniture in your living room. Find a coffee table with built-in storage that makes board game setup and clean-up quick and easy. Don’t overlook decorative details either! Hang a scoreboard or stencil throw pillows with Scrabble-esque letters to instantly fun up any room.

Make it fun for everyone. The only way this will work is if everyone is having a good time. First, provide enough comfortable seating so every person feels included. Test each seat to make sure it’s positioned with a good view of the table, TV or everyone else in the room depending on what game you’re playing. A flexible seating arrangement with movable chairs and lightweight ottomans might be best.

Next, avoid making several trips up and down the stairs by keeping a variety of snacks closeby. If you have the luxury of adding a kitchenette to your room design, then go for it! Otherwise, loading up a tray or two will work just fine. Outfitting a cart with party supplies and packaged snacks can also work as a snack station for your game room. Pop some popcorn and pour drinks before you sit down to play. Preparing a snack might actually become part of your tradition. Every week you and your family can decide on a new snack to make and taste-test together, like fruit kabobs, homemade cookies or pigs in a blanket.

Lastly, allowing your kids to invite their friends to the first few game nights might be worth it. Even if you’re really looking forward to a night with the family, your kids - especially teens - might not be as keen on a night in with mom and dad. A lively group of friends for your very first game night could prove to your kids that this is a “cool” tradition to keep going.

Find the type of game you enjoy most. If game night feels forced, then it won’t be fun and it certainly won’t last long. Experiment with board games, card games, video games and even televised games to find something for everyone. If it’s a new game that you haven’t tried before make sure to spend some time reading and understanding the rules before game night begins. You’ll lose kids’ attention pretty quickly if you spend too long explaining the rules. It’s OK to have a couple of options too. Maybe two family members want to watch Monday night football while the other three play a game of Monopoly. It doesn’t matter what game night looks like at your house as long as everyone is together and having fun.",How to make family game night a weekly tradition,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/26/how-to-make-family-game-night-weekly-tradition.html

An Ohio truck driver says the man accused of killing eight people with a truck in New York City was argumentative, seemed to harbor radical views and saw his work life spiraling down.

Mirrakhmat Muminov says Sayfullo Saipov lived in Stow, Ohio, for a few years. He says he knew Saipov because they were both Uzbek truck drivers.

Muminov says Saipov lost his insurance on his truck because of a few traffic tickets. He says companies stopped hiring Saipov, so he left for New Jersey.

Muminov said he heard from Saipov's friends that Saipov's truck engine blew up a few months ago in New Jersey. He says that ""probably hurt him more than anything.""

Muminov also says Saipov was ""not happy with his life"" and would get into arguments with his friends and family.

Officials say Saipov left a handwritten note referring to the Islamic State group. Muminov says Saipov never spoke about the group, but he could tell Saipov held more radical views.

The driver, Sayfullo Saipov, has been identified by officials as an immigrant from Uzbekistan and he allegedly left behind handwritten notes pledging his loyalty to ISIS. The 29-year-old came to the U.S. legally in 2010 under the Diversity Visa Program, and according to law enforcement officials is believed to have lived first in Ohio after his arrival.

Uzbekistan is the most populous country in Central Asia, with 88 percent of the population identifying as Muslim, mostly Sunni, according to the CIA World Factbook.

The country has a history with jihadist groups. The previous most-notable group was the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which later splintered before aligning itself with ISIS, according to a report by the International Crisis Group.

A 2015 report by the organization said growing numbers of Central Asian citizens, male and female, went to the Middle East to fight or otherwise support ISIS.

""Prompted in part by political marginalization and bleak economic prospects that characterize their post-Soviet region, 2,000-4,000 have in the past three years turned their back on their secular states to seek a radical alternative,"" the report said.

The total number of Uzbeks who have joined ISIS varies depending on the source. The Muslim Board of Uzbekistan put the number at around 200 citizens, while The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence pegged the number at more than 500 Uzbeks, according to a 2015 USAID report.

""Ethnic Uzbeks, including citizens of Uzbekistan, are most numerous among the Central Asians with the Islamic State, but Kyrgyz, Kazakhs, Turkmen and Tajiks are also well represented,"" the International Crisis Group said in its report.

A 39-year-old Uzbeck citizen who was known to security services was behind the deadly truck attack in Stockholm in April that killed four people.

Two of the ISIS suicide bombers in the June 2016 attack at Istanbul’s main airport were Uzbek and Kyrgyz nationals, a Turkish government official told Reuters at the time.

In the U.S. three New York City residents -- two with Uzbekistan citizenship, and one a citizen of Kazakhstan -- were arrested in 2015 after the Department of Justice said they plotted to travel to Syria to join ISIS militants and ""wage jihad.""

One of the men arrested in that case, Abdurasul Hasanovich Juraboev, was sentenced to 15 years in prison on Oct. 27 for conspiring to provide material support to ISIS, according to the DOJ.

Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev sent his condolences to President Trump and the families of the victims on Wednesday, and offered his country's assistance in investigating the attack.

The country has been a longtime partner in the counterterror fight, and the U.S. has worked with Uzbek security services in matters relating to ""counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics policies,"" according to the ICG.

Trump proposed revisions to his “extreme vetting” program in the wake of the attack, but no countries in Central Asia are among the countries targeted by the Trump administration's controversial immigration policy.

You may have heard of, or even created, a home inventory before. This record, often used to document belongings for insurance purposes, can also be a really helpful tool if you are trying to declutter, prepare for emergencies, clear space for a remodel or just get organized. Check out these tips to create a thorough home inventory and streamline your belongings at the same time.

Make Your Inventory

Choose your checklist. The first step in making a home inventory is getting your hands on a comprehensive checklist — one from your own insurance company is best. Review the checklist before getting started.

Work through your home, room by room. Following your checklist, work your way slowly through the entire house — you may want to divvy up the task over several weekends. Record a brief description of each item, how many you have, how much it cost and the year you purchased it.

Don't leave out any nooks or crannies. Craft rooms, sheds, attics, workshops, porches and garages should all be carefully examined and documented.

Supplement with photos or video. Using digital photos is one option, but you may find it easier to create a video tour of your home to document your belongings. Whether you are taking photos or video, start at the front and work your way through each room — try to go in the same order used on your checklist.

Add a storage map. Noting down where exactly in the house everything is stored can be incredibly useful when you need to find something, whether it's an emergency or just time to hang the Christmas lights.

Use an actual floor plan if you have one; if not, you can create your own simple sketch of each floor of your house. Being as specific as possible, note where in each room boxes or other items are stored.

Keep paperwork in one place. Gather receipts, credit card statements, appraisal documents and the like, and keep them bundled with your other home inventory materials.

Even better, take the time to scan everything and store the digital archive in at least two places.

Use Your Home Inventory to Declutter

Get rid of unnecessary multiples. Cutting back on excess multiples can free up a lot of space in your home, but actually getting rid of unneeded things is easier said than done. Your home inventory checklist can make things easier by providing emotional distance.

Read over your list and mark any items you have a lot of. Do you really need all of those extra dishes? Start a list of things you want to sell or donate.

Highlight valuable items. Especially note valuable pieces you've been holding onto for a long time but are not necessarily using. Do online research and estimate what you could sell the pieces for. Would you rather have the extra space and money? If so, let those pieces go!

Mark your calendar for a big junk toss. You know that stuff you've been meaning to toss but haven't found the motivation to? We all have it. Now that you know exactly what and where yours is, set a date to (finally) take care of it.

Get prepared by researching where you can take it — things in good condition may be candidates for donation, while others may need to be dropped at a special recycling center. Involving a reward at the end of your day of errands is always a good plan!

Box everything. Now that you've cleared out space in your storage areas, think about ways to make your storage really work for you. One simple but effective strategy is to tuck every single item in storage — whether in closets, cupboards or in deep storage — into a box or bin.

Containers instantly make things look neater, and it's also easier to shift items around or grab a box you need rather than trying to unload armfuls of loose stuff from a shelf.

Use storage for rotating items too. Free up space in cupboards, closets, shelves and counters for the items you actually use daily, and pack away the rest. This is one of the best ways to make your life easier, without getting rid of a drastic amount of stuff. Simply rotate in fresh dishes, linens and decorative items seasonally.

RELATED: Storage Cabinets That Fit Your Every Need

Consider digital backups. Creating digital backups (photos or scans) of important paper records, photos, kids’ art and other memorabilia can offer peace of mind. For less sentimental items, you may choose to actually toss the originals and keep only the digital record.

Update your inventory. Anytime you buy something new or get rid of something on your list, pull out that inventory and note the change. If it’s something new you are adding, use this as a cue to look for a similar item on your inventory to get rid of. It’s much easier to keep clutter at bay than deal with it after things have gotten out of hand.

Keep a copy of your inventory offsite.

Just one day after pleading not guilty to a 12-count indictment, Paul Manafort was described as a major flight risk by prosecutors because of his wealth and international connections.

According to court documents unsealed Tuesday, prosecutors say they believe Manafort -- a former chairman of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign -- and his business associate Richard Gates were at risk of fleeing.

“The defendants pose a risk of flight based on the serious nature of the charges, their history of deceptive and misleading conduct, the potentially significant sentences the defendants face, the strong evidence of guilt, their significant financial resources, and their foreign connections,” the court documents read.

Manafort is known to have a significant amount of wealth. Between 2012 and 2016, he listed his assets to be between $19 million and $136 million, the New York Daily News reported.

“His financial holdings are substantial, if difficult to quantify precisely,” Tuesday’s documents revealed.

The 68-year-old was also being considered a flight risk because of his foreign connections. The Washington Post reported that Manafort keeps three U.S. passports and has submitted 10 passport applications in recent years.

Prosecutors note in the documents that Manafort also has wealthy ties to Moscow and to Kiev, Ukraine, through his previous business dealings. His travel schedule in the last year reveals the many connections Manafort has overseas, increasing the possibility of flight, prosecutors said.

The court documents even brought up Manafort’s age, stating he might be more inclined to flee with a guilty verdict carrying a sentence of around 12 to 15 years.","Paul Manafort Considered Flight Risk Because of Wealth, Foreign Connections: Special Counsel",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/01/paul-manafort-considered-flight-risk-because-wealth-foreign-connections-special-counsel

South African model and award-winning dancer, Simone Botha Welgemoed, was picked to model in an advertisement for Virgin Active, part of the Virgin Group brand. When the ad finally ran, the twenty-seven year old was not pleased.

""I was shockingly surprised and it felt like somebody just dropped a bucket of water on me,” Welgemoed said to The Sun. “I couldn't believe what I saw when my sister tagged me in the Virgin advertisement on Instagram, I couldn't believe what I saw.”

PLUS-SIZE MODELS USE INSTAGRAM TO POINT OUT 'ALTERED IMAGES'

Virgin’s advertising campaign had digitally removed the cochlear implant that Welgemoed has worn since birth.

“I was born profoundly deaf and received my CI (Cochlear implant) at the age of 22 months,” she said.

""At that stage I was the youngest child in Africa to receive it, without my CI I hear absolutely nothing at all,” she added.

Welgemoed, who was crowned Miss Deaf South Africa in 2012, has her implant fitted behind her right ear and her speech processor above her left ear.

She said she immediately contacted Virgin once she saw the ad on social media without her implant.

Welgemoed was upset by the direction the Sir Richard Branson-owner company went because she said she had previously modeled for them, and they left her implant in the pictures.

MODEL BARES ALL IN PHOTOSHOP-FREE CAMPAIGN TO PROMOTE BODY CONFIDENCE

""I was put in a difficult situation. If I claim to be an ambassador for the deaf, then am I not proud to boldly showcase who I am?” she said.

The company issued an apology and pulled the ad once she brought it to their attention and replaced them with unedited versions featuring Welgemoed’s implant.

""Virgin Active immediately responded to my post on Facebook and made contact with me to meet with them,” she said. ""We had a discussion about what happened and they were extremely apologetic about everything. Somebody on the creative team, probably uneducated about hearing disability if I can say so, told them to remove it.”

""Unfortunately nobody thought the better of it and that the impact of the bigger picture would be an unwelcome one,” she continued.

A spokesperson for Virgin admitted they made an error with removing the implant.

""We 100% accept that the action of photo-shopping the image is not in line with our values as a business, nor in keeping with the welcome we extend to everyone,” the spokesperson said. ""We got it wrong and we realize that.""

The chief executive of the Royal Association for Deal People, Dr. Jan Sheldon agrees that they got it wrong.

“Although we acknowledge that Virgin have apologized for their actions it is clear that they have a very urgent need to significantly develop their knowledge and understanding of Deafness,” Sheldon said.

Welgemoed feels there is still work for her to do “as an ambassador and former Miss Deaf [South Africa]” to educate people about being deaf.

""I was born deaf and my disability as shaped me in who I am today,” she said. “Not for one moment would I hope to try and change myself, because I was meant to find my purpose in life with it and so I do it with hard work, many obstacles and and yet with joy, grace and beauty.”

If you have allergies or asthma, or are sensitive to pollution, you may have considered purchasing an air purifier to clean the air inside your home. Now, with smoke from destructive wildfires still burning in Northern California affecting people as far as 100 miles away, even those without specific health concerns are thinking about ways to improve indoor air quality. But with so many types of filtration systems on the market (and prices ranging from $100 to nearly $1,000), it can be hard to know where to begin. Check out this quick guide to home air purifiers to figure out which are worth the cost.

Why use an air purifier? Indoor air pollution comes from a combination of particulate matter (dust, mold, pet dander and particles from smoke and cooking stoves) and gaseous pollutants (vehicle exhaust, smoke and chemical fumes) and can be far worse than the pollution outside, simply because it has no way to dissipate.

Those who suffer from asthma or allergies can be especially sensitive to air quality, and using an air purifier could be helpful, together with other methods of keeping out pollution and allergens.

Purify your home, not just the air. Air purifiers can do wonders for removing particulate matter from the air; the problem is that dust, pet dander and the like don’t stay in the air for long. Allergens drift to the ground and become embedded in rugs and soft furnishings — places an air purifier cannot reach. A combination approach will reduce indoor air pollution and allergens more than any one method alone. Here are a few strategies to try:

○ Remove wall-to-wall carpeting; go for easy-to-clean hard flooring and washable area rugs.

○ Vacuum and dust with a microfiber cloth regularly.

○ Ban smoking in and around the house.

○ Do not use a fireplace.

○ Do use the exhaust fans over the stove and in the bathroom.

○ Establish a no-shoes policy.

RELATED: Get an Exhaust Fan for the Bathroom

What to do if you are affected by wildfire smoke. Depending on wind direction and other atmospheric conditions, smoke from wildfires can drift 100 miles or farther from the source of the flames. If you are affected by wildfire smoke (but not in an evacuation area), the Centers for Disease Control recommends staying indoors when possible, with windows, doors, and fireplace dampers closed. Here are a few more things you can do:

○ Use your central air-conditioning system if you have one, but keep the fresh air intake closed to prevent smoke from getting inside.

○ Clean or replace the HVAC filter more frequently as long as you are experiencing smoky conditions.

○ Cut down on activities that contribute to indoor air pollution, including burning candles and using a fireplace, wood stove or gas stove.

○ Avoid vacuuming, as this can stir up large particles that have settled.

○ If you do not have an in-duct air filtration system, it can be helpful to use a portable air purifier with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to remove some of the particulate matter from the air.

○ If you have a medical emergency from smoke, you should call 911 or go to a hospital emergency room immediately.

How air purifiers work. There are a few different types of air purifiers on the market, and not all of them are especially effective or safe. It is important to know what you are buying, so read the fine print on your air purifier before purchasing. The main thing to check is how the purifier cleans the air. It will likely use one or more of these methods:

○ High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter: This is the most common and one of the most effective methods available.

○ Activated carbon: Usually used with a HEPA filter or another filter, activated carbon can help reduce pollution by attracting some chemicals, which bond to the surface of the carbon.

○ Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) cleaners: These use a UV light to kill viruses, bacteria, allergens and some molds. UVGI cleaners may not reduce allergy or asthma symptoms, because typical home cleaners have limited effectiveness.

○ Electrostatic precipitators: Particles entering the purifier are given a charge and then trapped on oppositely charged plates. These machines create a small amount of ozone, which is a lung irritant and pollutant itself, so this type of purifier is probably best avoided.

Not effective as an air purifier at all, ozone generators are being marketed as air cleaners, but they actually add lung-irritating ozone to your home, which can be hazardous. The Environmental Protection Agency does not recommend buying ozone generators.

When to choose a whole-house air cleaner: If you have a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in your home, you have the option of having a whole-house air cleaner installed right in the ductwork. The benefits of a whole-house system are that all of the air is cleaned and there are no bulky appliances to deal with. In-duct systems are expensive, and they must be professionally installed and maintained.

When to choose a portable room purifier: Room purifiers are a good choice for smaller spaces, and multiple units can be used to clean the air even in a larger home. They are portable, so they are a good solution for renters, and cost anywhere from $100 to $1,000 per unit.

Get to know the rating systems. For in-duct air filters, look for the minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) to tell how efficiently they pull particles from the air. MERV values range from 1 to 20; a system rated 7 or higher is about as effective as a HEPA filter. True HEPA filters, which have MERV values of 17 to 20, are not typically installed in HVAC systems. However, some newer homes may be specially designed with in-duct HEPA filtration.

When shopping for a portable air purifier, look for a clean air delivery rate (CADR) of at least 250, but the higher the better. This is a voluntary system developed by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), so not all appliances have a CADR.

An Energy Star label on any air purifier indicates better energy efficiency but does not necessarily mean it is more effective — so also be sure to check the MERV or CADR rating.

Want to be really sure your air purifier is doing its job? Look for the AHAM Verifide mark on your portable air cleaner, which indicates that the manufacturer’s claims have been independently tested and certified.",What to look for when buying air purifiers for your home,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/26/what-to-look-for-when-buying-air-purifiers-for-your-home.html

A family in India is mourning the loss of conjoined twins who were born crying on Sunday, but died just 24 hours later. The boys, who were born with two heads and shared a torso, two arms and two legs, had been given a zero percent chance of survival past birth.

Doctors who delivered the boys via caesarean section at Swami Ramanand Tirth hospital in Maharashtra, western India, reportedly said it would have been impossible to separate the pair had they survived. Their condition was not detected until 32 weeks gestation, The Independent reported.

“The babies were a case of dicephalic parapagus or two-headed twins, which are often stillborn,” Dr. Sanjay Bansode, head of the hospital’s gynecology unit, told the news outlet. “It is extremely rare and happens just one in a lakh (100,000) and chances of dicephalic parapagus twins are of around 10 percent of such births.”

SORORITY SISTER DIES 3 WEEKS AFTER GETTING HIT IN HEAD BY SOCCER BALL

The boys, who were born to a 32-year-old mother who has asked to remain anonymous to prevent potential backlash, weighed 8 pounds and were placed on a ventilator immediately after birth. The family has three daughters and one son, and were said to be devastated upon learning of the twins’ diagnosis.

“The mother did not know she was carrying conjoined twins until the 32nd week of pregnancy,” Bansode said, according to The Independent. “They asked us to do anything to save the babies but such kids do not survive. There is no possibility of surgery either as they share most of their body parts and in this case had just one pair of limbs.”

Bansode said the hospital dealt with a similar case in 2014 involving a woman who was seven months pregnant with conjoined twins. In that case, the babies died immediately after birth, SWNS reported.",Tears as conjoined twins die day after birth,https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/11/01/tears-as-conjoined-twins-die-day-after-birth.html

Annie Concannon of Turpin High School in Cincinnati posted a photo of herself in the offending outfit on Twitter. She’s wearing a cropped t-shirt with fraternity letters on it, high-waisted jeans, and sneakers. In her tweet she wrote, “I got dress coded for this outfit. Turpin high school. Twitter do your thing.”

The 17-year-old senior also told Yahoo Lifestyle that her outfit didn’t break the dress code, which she describes as: “Don’t show the three Bs: Boobs, Butt, Belly Button.”

13 CELEBRITIES WHOSE COSTUMES CAUSED CONTROVERSY

She said that her outfit went unnoticed early in the day, but her homeroom teacher later called her out for the “inappropriate” attire. Concannon claims she’s worn the same clothes before without issue, but this time the teacher pulled her aside and told her she should know better because she’s a senior.

She said the teacher also referred to the shirt as “provocative,” Yahoo reports.

Concannon claims the teacher instructed her to go to the principal’s office, and to find a new shirt to put on, but the student decided to disregard the teacher because she felt her outfit was appropriate. “I disregarded her comment and went to my second-period class without changing. I was really frustrated because my outfit wasn’t breaking our dress code.”

Other teachers took note after being warned of Concannon’s shirt, informing them she should be wearing something over her t-shirt. “As I went to third period, my teacher approached me and told me that I needed a jacket put on immediately,” she told Yahoo. “At this point I started crying because I was so frustrated by the situation. I have never been dress-coded before, and I felt the staff of my school put a target on my back.”

The teen said people aren’t dress-coded often at her school, and she feels the rules are one-sided against the female gender.

Reactions on Twitter were mixed. While some defended the student’s outfit as perfectly acceptable, many bashed Concannon for breaking the rules and using social media to “harass” the school.

Jamie Naughright, who was an athletic trainer at Manning’s alma mater, the University of Tennessee, spoke to Inside Edition in her first television interview since the allegations began in 1996.

Naughright told the media outlet she was speaking out following the bombshell sexual misconduct allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.

""The reason why I'm here today is due to the courage and bravery that the women have come forward with the Harvey Weinstein, the survivors and the victims,"" Naughright told Inside Edition. ""And that is really what has brought me here today to discuss that issue.""

JEREMY PIVEN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT BY REALITY STAR ARIANE BELLAMAR

[Manning] “pulled his shorts down and put his anus and testicles on my face,” Naughright said on Feb. 29, 1996. The athletic trainer was examining the quarterback’s foot at the time when the alleged incident occurred.

Manning denied the allegations and insisted he was “mooning” a friend in the locker room.

The interview had an exclusive clip of Manning’s deposition, showing the then-19-year-old college quarterback telling his side of the story.

""I briefly pulled down my pants to so-called 'moon' him,"" Manning said in the deposition. ""One second, one and a half seconds. Pulled my pants back up and continued with Jamie's examination of the bottom of my foot.""

Naughright called Manning’s defense “a lie” and said she was “scared” at the time of the incident.

""I was repulsed. I was scared. I was intimidated,"" she said. ""It was definitely a predator -- intimidating, anger, violent eyes that he had.""

The trainer said she filed a report with a crisis center that handled sexual assault allegations and told the counselor she ""feared for her job, worried and feared for her life.""

“My boss, when I called him that night, really realized that this was a serious situation,"" Naughright said. ""This was a sexual assault and he informed me not to call the police or press.""

The former athletic trainer filed an “employment complaint” against the University of Tennessee and was awarded $300,000 in a settlement before she resigned, Indy Star reported.

COREY FELDMAN DID NOT NAME HOLLYWOOD PEDOPHILES, SANTA BARBARA POLICE SAY

The incident came up again in 2001 when Manning wrote about it in his autobiography he penned with his father, Archie. Naughright sued Manning for defamation which was settled for an undisclosed amount.

Manning’s lawyer, Matthew D. McGill, released a statement to Inside Edition regarding the alleged incident.

“Peyton Manning has been absolutely clear: Jamie Naughright’s accusations are false. When her claims were first investigated 21 years ago, she told a very different story. Her current account was invented several years later in connection with her first of several groundless litigations against Peyton. Most recently, she left Peyton’s mother a vulgar and extremely disturbing voicemail. Ms. Naughright should stop this abusive behavior.”

Naughright said in response that she has not changed her story but did not deny that she called Manning’s mother.

Even this Mets fan, originally torn about whom to root for in the 2017 Fall Classic, sat on the edge of my seat in disbelief as Houston clawed its way to a win against Los Angeles.

Game two – a game ESPN described as “so completely insane and ridiculous that you wouldn't believe what happened if you didn't watch it” – was a cocktail of suspense and excitement that reminded fans why they follow baseball … biting our nails as the 11-inning back-and-forth unfolded – with the Astros tying it up in the ninth, two Dodgers homeruns answered to tie it up again in the tenth, and the Astros finally managing to squeeze out a 7-6 win in the eleventh.

Game five was another mindblower, with the Astros winning 13-12 after an exhausting 10-inning home run bonanza that winning pitcher Joe Musgrove called “the craziest game of my life.”

The sweetness of these wins, however, was missed by many young people who have written off learning the rules of such a “boring” game.

One could say a good baseball game is like a good song. Punctuating the rhythm of the game are crescendos of excitement, which are only sweetened by the quieter parts.

Many young Americans were raised on football, soccer, or basketball, noble sports no doubt, but somewhere along the line they found themselves incapable of sitting through America’s pastime.

In the age of shorter and shorter attention spans, those in their teens and 20s who cannot sit through a Marx Brothers movie, much less a baseball game, are missing out.

Baseball is poetry.

The suspenseful quiet that takes up a large part of the game leaves room for the players’ human quirks to steal the spotlight, fascinating fans as every movement tugs on the fate of the game.

Detroit Tigers pitcher Mark Fidrych, for instance, talked to himself on the mound in the 1970s, sparking the lore that he was really talking to the ball. Another pitching legend, Gaylord Perry, twitched before pitches on purpose, driving batters up the wall.

The New York Mets were home to some of baseball’s greatest characters, leading Manager Casey Stengel to say that his beloved (but losing) “Amazins” “are a much improved ball club; now we lose in extra innings!”

The rules of baseball also set the groundwork for artful suspense. In game seven of the World Series, the ninth inning, with two out, bases loaded, two strikes on the batter, the batting team losing by no less than three runs, the losing team can still win the entire championship on a single pitch.

No other game has anything like that.

It was that sort of scenario that made famed Mets coach Yogi Berra warn, “It ain’t over till it’s over.”

True, some modern changes threaten the game. Even during the span of this writer’s childhood, games at Shea Stadium, Citifield, and the old Yankee Stadium got louder with more distractions and sideshows in case fans were getting bored. Some of the extras, like team mascots (Mr. Met!) and the kiss-cam are a blast, but the game itself was always the most exciting part.

Diehard fans of other sports like football, basketball, hockey or soccer, may object to baseball being exciting. There is none of the standing around, looking at the grass and kicking the dirt that goes on in baseball in those other pasttimes.

However, one could say a good baseball game is like a good song. Punctuating the rhythm of the game are crescendos of excitement, which are only sweetened by the quieter parts.

I remember around 2002 my dad took my little sister and me to a Mets game at Shea. My sister, around seven at the time, announced on the way there that she would catch a foul ball in her cap, showing us from the car back seat how she would hold her cap up.

“That would be nice, pet lamb,” my dad said.

“No, I know I am!” she told him.

She caught a ball - in her cap - that day.

A little kid can sit for hours holding a cap up in hopes of taking a piece of the game home. Surely the rest of us bored grown-ups can take some time to appreciate a game that has it all, from grit to art.

Two Hawaii women who claimed they were lost at sea for five months and “would have been dead within 24 hours” had the U.S. Navy not picked them up last week never activated their emergency beacon, the Coast Guard said Tuesday, adding to a growing list of inconsistencies and questions that cast doubt on their harrowing tale of survival in the Pacific Ocean.

""If the thing was operational and it was turned on, a signal should have been received very, very quickly that this vessel was in distress,"" Phillip R. Johnson, a retired Coast Guard officer, said Monday in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.

The women previously said they had radios, satellite phones, GPS and other emergency gear, but they didn't mention the Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon, or EPIRB.

A Coast Guard review of the incident and subsequent interviews with the women revealed they had an EPIRB aboard their boat but never turned it on.

More than five months after they departed from Hawaii for a planned trip to Tahiti and the South Pacific, they were picked up in the western Pacific about 900 miles southeast of Japan. The two women and their dogs were all in good health when recovered by the U.S. Navy Wednesday, a day after being spotted by a Taiwanese fishing vessel.

Jennifer Appel confirmed in an interview with The Associated Press Tuesday they had the beacon and did not use it. She said that in her experience, it should be used only when you are in imminent physical danger and going to die in the next 24 hours.

""Our hull was solid, we were floating, we had food, we had water, and we had limited maneuverable capacity,"" Appel said in Japan, where the U.S. Navy took them. ""All those things did not say we are going to die. All that said, it's going to take us a whole lot longer to get where we're going.""

However, just hours earlier, Appel appeared to contradict herself by claiming her scenario was a life or death situation.

“Had [the USS Ashland] not been able to locate us, we would have been dead within 24 hours,” she told reporters in Okinawa on Monday, adding that they were both extremely grateful for the men and women of the USS Ashland.

HAWAII WOMEN SAY THEY ARE ALREADY PLANNING THEIR NEXT BOATING VACATION

“They saved our lives,” Appel also said last week, according to a Navy press release. “The pride and smiles we had when we saw [the Navy] on the horizon was pure relief.”

The two say they were able to last on the open waters because they packed a water purifier and enough dried food to last a year.

The EPIRB communicates with satellites and sends locations to authorities. It's activated when it's submerged in water or turned on manually. The alert signal sends a location to rescuers within minutes.

Johnson described the device as sturdy and reliable, but added that old and weak batteries could cause a unit not to function.

But Appel and Tasha Fuiava also said they had six forms of communication that all failed to work.

""There's something wrong there,"" Johnson said. ""I've never heard of all that stuff going out at the same time.""

In retrospect, though, Appel said there were two times that she would have used it — once when she and Fuiava were off Hawaii around late June to early July, and a second time off Wake Island on Oct. 1.

""That's a lesson learned for me, because that was the best chance we had in the ocean to get help,"" Appel said of the Wake Island missed opportunity.

Previously, Appel and Fuiava had said they were close to giving up when the Navy rescued them last week, thousands of miles off course.

The two women met in late 2016, and within a week of knowing each other decided to take the trip together. Fuiava had never sailed a day in her life. They planned to take 18 days to get to Tahiti, then travel the South Pacific and return to Hawaii in October. They set off May 3.

Their accounts of the weather conditions during the trip also are not consistent with weather reports or basic geography of the Pacific Ocean, according to The Associated Press.

On their first day at sea, the two women described running into a fierce storm that tossed their vessel with 60 mph winds and 30-foot seas for three days, but meteorologists say there was no severe weather anywhere along their route during that time.

After leaving ""we got into a Force 11 storm, and it lasted for two nights and three days,"" Appel has said of the storm they encountered off Oahu. In one of the first signs of trouble, she said she lost her cellphone overboard.

""We were empowered to know that we could withstand the forces of nature,"" Appel said. ""The boat could withstand the forces of nature.""

But the National Weather Service in Honolulu said no organized storm systems were in or near Hawaii on May 3 or in the days afterward. Archived NASA satellite images confirm there were no tropical storms around Hawaii that day. Appel expressed surprise that there was no record of the storm. She said they received a Coast Guard storm warning while sailing after sunset on May 3.

The pair said they thought about turning back, but the islands of Maui and Lanai didn't have harbors deep enough to accommodate their sailboat. At 50 feet long, however, the vessel is relatively small, and both islands have harbors that accommodate boats of that size. Plus, the Big Island — the southernmost island in Hawaii — has several places to dock.

Appel, though, said she modified her sailboat, called the Sea Nymph, by adding six tons of fiberglass to the hull to make it thicker and heavier and extend the keel to a depth of 8.5 feet to give the boat greater stability.

""Given the constraints of our vessel, we chose the appropriate action,"" she said.

So they pressed on.

Then, they say, another storm killed their engine at the end of May.

The Coast Guard made radio contact with a vessel that identified itself as the Sea Nymph in June near Tahiti, and the captain said they were not in distress and expected to make land the next morning.

Appearing on CBS’ “Face the Nation” to publicize his memoir entitled, “An American Family: A Memoir of Hope and Sacrifice,” Khan said Kelly “indulged in defending behavior of the president and made the situation even worse.”

He criticized Kelly for standing by President Donald Trump, who engaged in a very public feud on TV and Twitter last week over Gold Star families.

Khan, the father of U.S. soldier Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq, added that “restraint and dignity” should be “the call of the moment” when dealing with Gold Star families, instead of turning them into a “political football.”

His comments came more than a year after the Democrats gave him a major platform: the party's 2016 convention. Khan said on stage that Trump had “sacrificed nothing and no one” for America — unlike Humayun, who posthumously received a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart after a suicide bomber killed him in 2004.

Trump later challenged Khizr Khan’s claims. “I’ve made a lot of sacrifices,” Trump said. “I work very, very hard. I’ve created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures.”

Trump has been engaged in an ongoing feud with Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., who said she listened in to a condolence call he made last week to an Army widow. Wilson said Trump told the widow that her deceased husband, Army Sgt. La David Johnson, “knew what he signed up for.” Trump denied it.

Kelly on Thursday publicly criticized Wilson’s involvement in the call and also suggested she was trying to politicize the matter.

Wilson also suggested that Kelly, whose son was killed in Afghanistan, was forced to make public statements on the call to save his job, amid speculation that Trump is unhappy with his performance.

Khan, a Charlottesville resident, also expressed shock on “Face the Nation” about seeing Kelly “standing next to the President when the President could not have the proper words to condemn the attack on the blessed city of Charlottesville, Virginia by Neo-Nazis.”

Trump was criticized for saying “both sides” were to blame after white nationalists and alt-right groups gathered in the southern town to protest the removal of a Confederate statue on August 12, sparking violence. Police said a Nazi sympathizer plowed his car through a group of counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer, a paralegal.

A Series surprise, Forsythe lined a two-out, two-run single in the first, and doubled and scored in the fourth for a 4-0 lead.","Blast off!

Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa and the Houston Astros kept hammering away in a wild slugfest that no one saw coming, rallying against Clayton Kershaw and rocking the Los Angeles Dodgers 13-12 in 10 thrilling innings Sunday night for a 3-2 lead in the World Series.

In a tension-filled game of monster momentum swings at pulsating Minute Maid Park, the last one belonged to Alex Bregman. With the packed crowd still standing well past midnight, Bregman hit an RBI single with two outs off Kenley Jansen to win it after 5 hours, 17 minutes.

Wacky and whacky with seven home runs, this perhaps topped Toronto's 15-14 win over the Phillies in 1993 as the craziest World Series game ever.

Altuve, Correa, Yuli Gurriel, George Springer and Brian McCann homered for Houston. Cody Bellinger and Yasiel Puig went deep for the Dodgers, who scored three times in the ninth to make it 12-all.

Silent when ace Dallas Keuchel got crushed, the orange-clad fans erupted over and over as the Astros sent balls careening all around -- and out of -- the park.

Yet on another night of Home Run Derby in the Year of the Home Run, no lead was safe.

Puig lined a two-run shot in the ninth, the record 22nd homer in a single Series, and Chris Taylor's two-out single off Chris Devenski tied it.

Now, with both bullpens worn down, the teams get a day to recover. It'll be Game 6 on Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium, where Justin Verlander will try to clinch the Astros' first championship and Rich Hill hopes to save Los Angeles' season.

Out of nowhere, the Astros climbed out of a four-run hole against Kershaw and then erased two more deficits later in the game, tying it each time on a homer.

Correa leaped and twirled after launching a two-run drive made it 11-8 in the seventh. McCann's shot in the eighth added a much-needed insurance run.

Bellinger homered for Los Angeles, a three-run drive in the fifth that made it 7-4 and seemed to swing things back in the Dodgers' favor. By the end of the mayhem on the mound, it was a mere afterthought.

The Astros (13) and Dodgers (9) topped the Series mark for homers, set when Barry Bonds and the Giants lost to the Angels in seven games in 2002.

But really, who imagined this?

No wonder there's a bright sign high above the center field wall for a popular taco place in town -- it says Torchy and fit perfectly for a game where pitchers got lit up.

A day earlier, Kershaw stood alone on the mound after the Dodgers' dramatic win in Game 4, trying to get a visual for the biggest start of his career.

This was definitely not how he pictured it.

The three-time NL Cy Young Award winner cruised into the fourth with a 4-0 lead before things suddenly fell apart. After Correa hit an RBI double, Gurriel hit a tying, three-run drive.

Kershaw whipped his head around to watch Gurriel's drive sail, his face immediately showing shock, utter disbelief and frustration, all wrapped up in one expression before he bent over, hands on his knees.

Yanked in the fifth, Kershaw trudged off with a dubious distinction -- he has allowed a postseason-record eight home runs this year.

Hardly a repeat performance from the opener, when Kershaw dominated while outpitching Keuchel for a 3-1 win.

Gurriel's second homer of the Series also kept open this possibility: Imagine the scene if Major League Baseball presents Gurriel with the MVP trophy, so soon after Commissioner Rob Manfred suspended him for the first five games next year for making a racist gesture toward Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish.

Keuchel never got into a rhythm during the shortest home start of his All-Star career. His breaking pitches spun without much movement, and he was pulled in the fourth.

Logan Forsythe did the early damage against his former University of Arkansas teammate. A Series surprise, Forsythe lined a two-out, two-run single in the first, and doubled and scored in the fourth for a 4-0 lead.

The Dodgers hadn't lost a game this year when they led by four runs. But Kershaw's bedeviling postseason past came back to haunt him at the worst time.

Kershaw was pulled after a pair of two-out walks in the bottom of the fifth. And with crowd sensing something big, the 5-foot-6 Altuve connected off Kenta Maeda for a home run that made it 7-all.","Astros take wild Game 5, take 3-2 lead to Los Angeles",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/30/astros-take-wild-game-5-take-3-2-lead-to-los-angeles.html

Actress Valerie Bertinelli, who America watched grow up on the hit show One Day at a Time, is now a fixture in the food world. The Golden Globe award-winning actress with her own Food Network show, sits down with Fox News's Lilian Huang Woo to talk about recipes from her new book Valerie's Home Cooking.

Take a LISTEN:

Back when we had a house in Park City, Utah, we frequented an Italian restaurant so often they put a sign above our regular table that said, ""Wolfie's Booth."" The reason we were at the restaurant so often? Their bacon-wrapped jalapeño shrimp. (Hold on a moment while I savor the memory of them. Seriously, my mouth is watering.) Sadly, the restaurant closed before I was able to get their recipe, so I developed this particular one on my own and have tinkered with it over the years to the point where I look for excuses to make it. A party, Sunday night football, a birthday, Tuesday night . . . I'm in, and so is my entire family, along with a few of my neighbors. The sauce is sweet with a hint of Cherry Coke, and once it connects with the jalapeño, it sits on the tongue with an exciting contrast of hot and sweet and savory. It goes well with a cold cocktail or even a light beer. These will disappear quickly.

Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeño Shrimp with Cherry Cola BBQ Sauce

Serves 16 Hands-on 35 minutes Total 45 minutes

CHERRY COLA BBQ SAUCE

1½ tablespoons bacon drippings

1/2 large red onion, chopped (about 1 cup)

2 garlic cloves, chopped

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon garlic powder

¼ teaspoon dry mustard

2 cups cherry cola soft drink

½ cup red wine vinegar

1 cup ketchup

SHRIMP

16 extra-large shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tails removed (about 12 ounces)

1 jalapeño chile, stem removed, seeded, and cut lengthwise into 16 thin strips

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1 teaspoon black pepper

8 bacon slices, halved crosswise

Make the BBQ Sauce: Heat the bacon drippings in a small saucepan over medium-high. Add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped garlic, and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute. Stir in the salt, garlic powder, and dry mustard, and cook, stirring often, until the spices are toasted and fragrant and the onions are a deep maroon color, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cherry cola and vinegar, and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Stir in the ketchup. Bring the sauce to a boil, and cook until reduced to about 2 cups and the mixture coats the back of a spoon, 12 to 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Shrimp: Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan over medium. Cut a long 1/4-inch-deep slit in the inner curve of each shrimp; insert 1 jalapeño strip. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Wrap each shrimp tightly with 1 bacon piece. Set on a plate, seam sides down.

Place the bacon-wrapped shrimp, seam sides down, in the hot skillet, and cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon is crisp and the shrimp are just cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Serve the shrimp with the BBQ sauce.

Make Ahead: The BBQ sauce will hold up to 2 weeks in the fridge. If you're prepping for a party, the shrimp can be wrapped ahead of time and cooked later.

Trick Technique: If you're someone who loves their bacon in the morning, start saving the drippings in a jar for uses like this one!

Hamburger Helpa

Don't laugh. This dish might give you more insight into my culinary history than almost anything else. It's a throwback to my childhood and it speaks directly to my more-than-occasional desire for quickness and efficiency, in that I love a good casserole or one-skillet dish. No fuss, no muss, easy cleanup, and get-right-to-it dinner. I made this for Wolfie and his friends when they came home after soccer or Little League practice. I can still picture everyone at the kitchen table, doing homework, while I simmered the beef in the mélange of spices and added macaroni, cheese, and breadcrumbs, and then announced to a sea of smiling faces, ""Dinner's ready."" Years later, I whipped out this dish when Tom's kids entered the picture and everyone came home from college during breaks. We all know the store-bought mix; this homemade version is even better than the classic, I promise.

Serves 4 Hands-on 10 minutes Total 35 minutes

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 pound ground 90% lean beef

¼ teaspoon black pepper

1 teaspoon kosher salt

8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni

2 cups whole milk

1¼ cups warm water

1/4 teaspoon dry mustard

1/4 teaspoon paprika

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

11/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

½ cup chopped American cheese

2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh chives

1/4 cup panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)

1 scallion, green part sliced

Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add the beef, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt; cook, stirring to crumble, until browned, about 5 minutes. Preheat the broiler with the oven rack 3 to 4 inches from the heat. Reduce the stovetop heat to medium, and stir in the macaroni. Add the milk, warm water, mustard, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. 3. Bring to a low simmer; cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the macaroni is tender, about 12 minutes. Add the cheeses, and cook, stirring constantly, until the cheeses melt. Stir in the chives. Sprinkle the panko over the macaroni mixture. Broil until the panko is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with the scallion, and serve immediately.

Variation: Add some slices of jalapeño for extra kick.

Overseas, Weinstein was also being investigated in the United Kingdom. Sky News reported that London’s Metropolitan Police was now investigating allegations against Weinstein by seven women over incidents that reportedly took place from the 1980s to 2015.

In a statement, police said they received the first allegation on Oct. 11, claiming “a man sexually assaulted a woman in the late 1980s in west London.”

Since then, police have received more claims about the same man alleging sexual assault in London.

Following the bombshell accusations, Weinstein has been fired from his own company he co-founded with his brother Bob and was booted from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences.

When going mano a mano — or tentacle to tentacle — one octopus might whip out its suckered arm to flail at another.
""We definitely don't think they have any intention of creating the site,"" Chancellor said.
""We really don't know what's going on exactly, but it's most likely because they're den-limited, so they don't really have any other choices than to live together.""
""That's one of the difficulties we're having: If an octopus leaves a site, are we able to tell if it's the same octopus returning?""","In the briny waters of Jervis Bay on Australia's east coast, where three rocky outcrops jut out from piles of broken scallop shells, beer bottles and lead fishing lures, a clutch of octopuses gambol among a warren of nearly two dozen dens. Welcome to Octlantis.

The bustling community belies conventionally held notions of the cephalopods, once thought to be solitary and asocial.

Indeed, Octopus tetricus, known colloquially as the gloomy octopus, has always been framed as a bit of a loner, with males and females meeting only once a year to mate. [See Photos of the Gloomy Octopuses Interacting at Octlantis]

Even then, there's barely any touching. To avoid being throttled and eaten by a hungry female, the male octopus uses a specialized arm to jettison packets of sperm called spermatophores into the giant bulb behind the female's head, also known as the mantle.

In the site they have christened ""Octlantis,"" however, an international team of marine biologists, led by Alaska Pacific University's David Scheel, observed ""complex social interactions"" among 10 to 15 octopuses on eight different days, as they foraged, mated and fought in close quarters.

Their research, published online Sept. 1 in the journal Marine and Freshwater Behaviour and Physiology, reveals an animal that is far from reclusive. In hours of footage recorded using four GoPro cameras, the octopuses are seen exhibiting threat displays and other signs of aggression, including violently ejecting one another from their dens.

Faced with a would-be adversary, an octopus might darken its mantle to express its disgruntlement or splay itself lengthwise to appear larger. When going mano a mano — or tentacle to tentacle — one octopus might whip out its suckered arm to flail at another.

It's a behavior that Stephanie Chancellor, a graduate student in biological sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago and an author on the paper, said she found surprising.

""I know these animals are intelligent, but this behavior — the communication, the grappling, all of them together — is very sophisticated,"" she told Live Science. ""And it's pretty much unheard of with invertebrates.""

As a community, Octlantis isn't unprecedented. In 2009, citizen scientist Matthew Lawrence and the University of Sydney's Peter Godfrey-Smith, both co-authors of the current paper, discovered a similar settlement a few hundred yards away. Dubbed ""Octopolis,"" it housed several dens and featured one key difference: an unidentified metal object about 12 inches (30 centimeters) long, likely ""garbage from a boat,"" Chancellor said.

At the time, scientists thought that the settlement had formed as a result of the artificial object. But then Octlantis came along, with no similar item in place.

""We were thinking this congregation of octopuses could only happen with human influence,"" Chancellor said. ""Since nothing human seeded Octlantis, it turns out that it can happen naturally under the right conditions."" [8 Crazy Facts About Octopuses]

Premeditated? Not exactly

As tempting as it is to read human motivation into animal behaviors, Octlantis isn't the premeditated community we might perceive it to be. To put it bluntly, urban planners these octopuses are not.

""We definitely don't think they have any intention of creating the site,"" Chancellor said. ""I think it's just an outcome of their denning behavior.""

Octopuses are ""mostly opportunists,"" she said. ""If they do find a spot that looks good, they will excavate it a little bit, or they will dig it out a little bit, but they won't find a spot and plan to den there. It already has to be a relatively good spot for them to live.""

They're pretty savvy engineers, too. When they're not squabbling, the cephalopods amass discarded shells, along with scavenged trash like beer bottles and lead fishing lures, in order to better stabilize the sediment for excavating dens.

Still, Chancellor could only speculate why the octopuses have decided to stick together, considering that they appear to be reluctant neighbors at best.

""I think there's something about Jervis Bay that is beneficial enough for them to live together and have to put up with one another,"" she said. ""We really don't know what's going on exactly, but it's most likely because they're den-limited, so they don't really have any other choices than to live together.""

Or perhaps the female octopuses established dens in the area first, and then the males followed suit to improve their mating options.

""That's something I'm trying to figure out as one of my goals,"" Chancellor said.

More questions than answers

Ultimately, Octlantis raises more questions than it answers. Have the octopuses there laid down permanent roots, or are they transient residents? Is there a social hierarchy? Are the octopuses being territorial, or are they hoarding mates? [From Blobfish to 'Adorable' Octopus: 9 Animals with Perfect Names]

""That's something we don't know, since it's really hard to tell octopuses apart from one another; they don't really have any distinguishing marks on them, and their size can differ greatly based on their posture,"" Chancellor said. ""That's one of the difficulties we're having: If an octopus leaves a site, are we able to tell if it's the same octopus returning?""

The obvious solution would be to tag the animals — a task that would require a great deal more effort, not to mention additional funding, to pull off.

""It would be amazing to look at how they move around Jervis Bay, if they move between sites, or if they just stay within the same home range,"" she said.

Chancellor said she also wants to know whether a teeming population of octopuses attracts more predators, such as sharks, dolphins or seals, or if there's greater safety in numbers.

""They're so bizarre compared with other animals that we know of,"" she said. ""For me, they're like the closest I can get to working with an alien.""

She tweeted to Mr. Spacey on Monday, “u don’t remember the incident — 30 years ago?","Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Washington Times.

The Hollywood/Media volcano is still spewing out its garbage. First, movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, then newsman wunderkind Mark Halperin, and now the thespian’s thespian Kevin Spacey face a spotlight even they don’t like. Three men from industries that control our culture, bullies and lecturers all, allegedly grabbing and groping whatever vulnerable woman, man or child might have the bad luck of catching their eye. Depending on their predilection, of course.

So we get another week and another Hollywood chorus of “everyone knew.” This time, actor Kevin Spacey was caught when the light turned on. Another actor, now in his 40s, alleges how 30 years ago, the actor and star of Netflix’s “House of Cards,” physically restrained the then-14-year-old and attempted to pressure him into sex. Mr. Spacey was 26 at the time, and both were starring in Broadway plays.

Mr. Spacey claims he has no memory of the incident, but issued an apology and claimed if it did happen it was because he was drunk.

That didn’t impress comedian Rosie O’Donnell. She tweeted to Mr. Spacey on Monday, “u don’t remember the incident — 30 years ago? — [expletive] u kevin — like Harvey we all knew about u — I hope more men come forward.”

Like Harvey, she says, they “all knew.” And?

Mr. Spacey shares something else with Mr. Weinstein and the Hollywood where “everyone knows” about predators in their midst but accepts it: He’s a liberal and loathes Donald Trump.

In a perfect example of the liberal problem of projection, in May 2016, Mr. Spacey was entertaining at an AIDS benefit in Cannes when he declared then-candidate Donald Trump as something less than human.

The Guardian reported, “Kevin Spacey has laid into Donald Trump during a standup routine at the Cannes Film Festival, calling the Republican presidential hopeful a ‘disease.’ Performing at an event to raise money for AIDS charities, Spacey opened his routine dressed as the late talk show host Johnny Carson. He told the audience that regular host, Sharon Stone, was unable to make it because she was fighting a disease, adding: ‘The name of the disease is Donald Trump.’""

Says the man who, it is alleged, has assaulted numerous young people, including the “loved one” of a news reporter, and as the Daily Mail also reports, “Another friend of a victim, Nadine West, came forward on Monday to claim that a young man close to her was ‘groped’ by Spacey while working alongside the actor at the Old Vic in London.”

Alas, filmmakers, actors and journalists, it turns out we hardly knew ye. We were told you were our moral betters; the arbiters of right and wrong. Only you had the insight to instruct us, the savage and dumb, in the more civilized ways of the world. Only you, with your red carpets, fame, millions of dollars, and cameras pointed at your faces, could be trusted to know what was best for all us rubes.

Poor Roman Polanski, he was unique for a while. For so long the film industry made it seem as though he was an outlier, the only one in Hollywood who would victimize someone, let alone do a horrible thing to a child. Yet we must assume he, and everyone else, knew full well he was part of a club. His crime was that he was caught. So, out damned spot, out, they said.

But victims of Hollywood predators kept piling up, children grew up, and the internet gave those who were previously marginalized a way to speak up. Twitter has been a key communication vehicle for many.

In what was considered the first major Hollywood scandal, silent movie comedian Fatty Arbuckle was accused of rape and murder of actress Virginia Rappe. In September 1921, hotel guests heard a screaming Ms. Rappe, and rushed to her rescue.

The BBC reports, “Among the guests was Virginia Rappe, a 30-year-old struggling actress. … At some point, Arbuckle and Rappe ended up together in a bedroom from where, a few minutes later, her screams were heard.

“Guests rushed in to find Rappe, fully dressed, writhing in pain on the bed. Arbuckle told them — it was a story he always stuck to — that he had gone to use the bathroom where he found Rappe in a drunken faint on the floor. He had merely carried her to the bed and she had fallen off, insisted Arbuckle.

“But then Rappe uttered the words that would damn the star: ‘He did this to me.’""

Rappe died a day later of a ruptured bladder. Many believed the morbidly obese Arbuckle had injured her while attempting to rape her. He was ultimately acquitted, but shunned by the industry.

These stories about the powerful in Hollywood aren’t new, and it’s not about being straight or gay. After all, sexual harassment, assault and rape have nothing to do with sexual attraction or desire, and everything to do with humiliation and control, whether it be of adults or children. Up until now, the entertainment industries where the powerful control not just someone’s job, but their dreams and future, protected itself with enforced silence.

Men like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Mark Halperin are low-hanging fruit, the ones, we’re told, “everyone knows.” It’s time the “entertainment” industry finally stops projecting its issues and displacing its rage onto political opponents and focus on its own rancid house.",Tammy Bruce: Kevin Spacey scandal just another Hollywood case of ‘everyone knows’,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/01/tammy-bruce-kevin-spacey-scandal-just-another-hollywood-case-everyone-knows.html

Communist regimes went on to kill about 100 million people. Most died in famines after socialist tyrants forced people to practice inefficient collective farming. Millions of others were executed in political purges.

Yet when the Russian Revolution happened, people both inside and outside Russia were excited. Crowds cheered Lenin. No longer would nobles rule; no longer would capitalists exploit workers. Now the people would prosper together.

British journalist Theodore Rothstein wrote, ""The undivided sway of the Imperialist nightmare is at an end ...(there will be) rule of the labouring classes.""

But you can't have government plan every aspect of people's lives and expect things to go well. Instead, you get bureaucratic planning commissions and secret police.

That won't stop some Americans from celebrating Communism's anniversary.

A day of anti-Trump protests is scheduled for Nov. 4, and I'm sure some protestors will wave hammer-and-sickle flags. Some will wear Che Guevara shirts.

A few commentators will call the protesters ""idealistic"" but impractical. They shouldn't. We should call them supporters of mass murder.

Lenin ordered the hanging of 100 property owners at the very start of the Revolution, saying people needed to see the deaths of ""landlords, rich men, bloodsuckers.""

Mass murder and starvation rapidly increased the death toll after that.

It wasn't exactly what philosopher Karl Marx had in mind -- but it shouldn't have surprised anyone. Marx's writing is filled with comparisons of capitalists to werewolves and other predators who must be destroyed.

Marx admitted that capitalism is productive but said that ""capital obtains this ability only by constantly sucking in living labor as its soul, vampire-like.""

Even as the Russian regime killed millions, some journalists and intellectuals covered up the crimes.

Stalin kept most media out, so few Americans knew that millions were starving, but New York Times writer Walter Duranty saw it first-hand.

Yet he ""covered up Stalin's crimes,"" says Tom Palmer of the Atlas Network, a group that promotes free market ideas around the world.

Because Duranty wanted to support ""the cause,"" he wrote that ""report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda.""

Duranty ""saw the truckloads of bodies,"" says Palmer, yet ""he wrote on the front page of The New York Times how wonderful everything was."" He even got a Pulitzer Prize for it.

In some ways, times haven't changed that much. This year, the Times ran a series of essays commemorating the anniversary of Russian Communism, including one piece arguing that sex was better in the Soviet Union because the Revolution destroyed macho capitalist culture.

At least The New York Times eventually admitted that Duranty's work was ""some of the worst reporting in this newspaper,"" but the Pulitzer committee never withdrew its prize.

Communism kills wherever it's practiced. But people still people believe. Making a video on Communism's hundredth anniversary, I interviewed Lily Tang Williams, who grew up under the regime in China.

""Mao was like a god to me,"" she recounts. ""In the morning, we were encouraged to chant and to confess to dear Chairman Mao.""

Under Mao, Williams nearly starved. ""I was so hungry. My uncle taught me how to trap rats. But the problem is, everybody is trying to catch rats. Rats run out, too.""

Still, she says she was so brainwashed by Communist propaganda that she ""cried my eyes out when Mao died.""

But then, ""when I was college student, I met a U.S. exchange student ... He showed me a pocket Constitution and Declaration of Independence. A light bulb came on!""

For the first time, she realized, ""I have rights ... natural rights that cannot be taken away. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""

She escaped to the United States. Now she says her mission in life is to teach Americans the importance of liberty.

I think her message is wiser than that of Karl Marx, Lenin and Stalin.

""Big, powerful government, it's very scary,"" she warns. ""It will keep growing like cancer, will never stop. If you empower government, not the individuals, we're going to lose this free country!""",John Stossel: Communism turns 100 this year - why are people celebrating?,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/01/john-stossel-communism-turns-100-this-year-why-are-people-celebrating.html

A family in India is mourning the loss of conjoined twins who were born crying on Sunday, but died just 24 hours later. The boys, who were born with two heads and shared a torso, two arms and two legs, had been given a zero percent chance of survival past birth.

Doctors who delivered the boys via caesarean section at Swami Ramanand Tirth hospital in Maharashtra, western India, reportedly said it would have been impossible to separate the pair had they survived. Their condition was not detected until 32 weeks gestation, The Independent reported.

“The babies were a case of dicephalic parapagus or two-headed twins, which are often stillborn,” Dr. Sanjay Bansode, head of the hospital’s gynecology unit, told the news outlet. “It is extremely rare and happens just one in a lakh (100,000) and chances of dicephalic parapagus twins are of around 10 percent of such births.”

The boys, who were born to a 32-year-old mother who has asked to remain anonymous to prevent potential backlash, weighed 8 pounds and were placed on a ventilator immediately after birth. The family has three daughters and one son, and were said to be devastated upon learning of the twins’ diagnosis.

“The mother did not know she was carrying conjoined twins until the 32nd week of pregnancy,” Bansode said, according to The Independent. “They asked us to do anything to save the babies but such kids do not survive. There is no possibility of surgery either as they share most of their body parts and in this case had just one pair of limbs.”

Bansode said the hospital dealt with a similar case in 2014 involving a woman who was seven months pregnant with conjoined twins.

No one can deny that using a phone’s front camera to snap a few pics is far easier than having to turn the phone around, make sure you have your finger on the right button and hope you are in the frame.

And with the quality of smartphone cameras getting better all the time we are able to take clearer, more profile picture worthy photos with ease.

But it turns out, and this may come as a shock, that the front camera was not created so we could take selfies.

The first phone with a front facing camera was introduced to the world by Sony in 2003 in the form of the Ericsson Z1010.

According to Quartz, the chunky flip phone and it’s 0.3 pixel camera that could be turned towards the user, was originally intended to be used in business calls.

Little did Sony know that little camera would spark what can only be described as a selfie epidemic.

People loved the idea of being able to see what they look like while taking a photo of themselves so much that platforms were created to easily allow them to share their selfies with the world.

Social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat encourage people to share their selfies to their heart’s content and even give them options to add filters and edits if they want to spice up their picture.

Selfies have become such a phenomenon that studies have been conducted to find out just how much of our lives we spend trying to capture our perfect angle.

Rawhide, a non-profit organisation helping at-risk youth, conducted research to give insight into our selfie habits, their findings included:

There are 93 million selfies taken each day

74 per cent of images shared on Snapchat are selfies

There are 1000 selfies posted to Instagram every 10 seconds

In 2015 more people died from taking selfies than from shark attacks

Every year teens spend almost seven full work days taking selfies

The designers at Sony that were responsible for creating the front facing camera could never have predicted the effect their innovation would have on how we use our phones.

No doubt there are people out there that do use the camera for its original purpose of video conference meetings but, for now, it looks like taking selfies will continue to come out on top.

The SUV is the first all-new Wrangler in over a decade, but stays true to a design that has its roots in WWII. It still has a boxy shape and upright grille with round headlights, but Jeep says it is more aerodynamic than ever before.

Photos of a two-door Rubicon model with the roof removed reveal a new roll cage design that includes a fold-down windshield that leaves the A-pillars in place, which makes it easier to open and close than the current version. The doors still come off, too.

Technical details have not yet been revealed, but there will be a variety of roof options on both two-door and four-door models, and three engines: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder turbo, 3.6-liter gasoline V6 and likely a 3.0-liter six-cylinder turbodiesel.

The Wrangler remains a body-on-frame truck with front and rear solid axles. A manual transmission and manually-operated 4x4 system will be offered, and can be seen in the Rubicon photos, but an electronic full time all-wheel-drive system is expected to be on the options list for the less hardcore off road models.

Production is expected to begin before the end of this year, with a pickup version of the Wrangler to follow for the 2019 model year.

Jeep also anounced that over 200 acessories will be available for the Wrangler from MOPAR, and a few of them reveal one first time feature the truck will have. The tailgate-mounted spare tire covers have holes in them to accomodate a backup camera that's mounted in the center of them.

“We knew our ad would ruffle feathers. We held a mirror up to the Republican Party, and they don’t like what they see. We have decided to pull our ad at this time,” said Cristobal J. Alex, president of the LVF, in a statement on Twitter Tuesday evening.

“Given recent events, we will be placing other powerful ads into rotation that highlight the reasons we need to elect progressive leaders in Virginia.”

The statement was released just hours after investigators said the suspected driver, identified as 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, plowed a rented pickup truck into a crowd in Lower Manhattan. The incident, being treated as a terror attack, left at least eight dead and at least 11 others injured.

The ad was released on Monday and was expected to run through Election Day.

Gillespie denounced the ad Tuesday morning in an interview with “Fox & Friends.”

The suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, 29, allegedly barreled a Home Depot truck down a popular bike path in Manhattan, killing at least eight people and injuring 11 others. Officials say he then crashed the vehicle into a school bus, before jumping out and screaming “Allahu akbar” — “God is great” in Arabic — with pellet and paintball guns in his hands. Authorities also found Saipov’s handwritten notes pledging loyalty to ISIS.

But there may have been warning signs prior to Tuesday's assault.

Saipov ""popped"" up in connection with a handful of individuals who were known to law enforcement when investigators ran his name through their databases after Tuesday's attack, two sources told Fox News. It is not clear whether these investigations were limited to the New York City area or included Florida, where Saipov had lived. One source said Saipov had “close ties...[to] the group he rolled with [who] was known to law enforcement.”

ISIS had been encouraging its followers to carry out Halloween attacks with propaganda from the terror group showing a graphic with a blood-splattered machete and Tuesday's date. The artwork was believed to have been done by a French ISIS supporter and included an image of the Eiffel Tower with the words “Enjoy their gathering” and “Terrorize October 31” written in French.

SITE intelligence group, which monitors terror activity online, also highlighted a recent photo taken by an ISIS supporter near the scene of Tuesday's attack; but it remained unclear if there was a connection between that photo and the rampage.

The terror group’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, recently emerged after multiple rumors of his death, urging followers to ""intensify the successive attacks,"" despite the terror group's losses on the ground in Syria and Iraq.

There has been no official claim of responsibility by the terror group, but known ISIS accounts — what counterterrorism analysts call “leadership” accounts — are applauding the attack and using the hashtag ""#the slap of terrorism.""

Even if authorities determine the attack to be ISIS-inspired or directed, the terror group is unlikely to publicly claim the rampage. ISIS typically doesn't claim terror attacks in which the attacker lives. Police shot Saipov, however, he was rushed to the hospital with injuries that were not considered life-threatening.

ISIS has recruited many Uzbek citizens to its cause, with several of the supporters who travel to Syria conducting suicide missions. The estimated number of Uzbek citizens fighting in the ranks of ISIS is estimated to be about 200 people in Uzbekistan, according to the Muslim Board of Uzbekistan. However, the number of Uzbek jihadists exceeds more than 1,500, when other terror groups such as Imam Bukhari Jamaat, Tawhid wal-Jihad and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) are added.

Uzbekistan is the most populous country in Central Asia and shares a border with Afghanistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.

Saipov is the second Uzbek national in New York connected to terror in just the last four days. Abdurasul Hasanovich Juraboev, a 27-year-old Uzbek citizen, was sentenced to 15 years for conspiring to provide material support to ISIS. Juraboev, who lived in Brooklyn, posted a threat on an Uzbek-language website saying he wanted to kill then-President Barack Obama in an act of martyrdom on behalf of ISIS in 2014. He then told investigators that he believed in ISIS’ agenda and wanted to travel to Syria to join ISIS fighters, the Justice Department said in a news release. He also told officials he planned to plant a bomb on Coney Island if he couldn’t travel to Syria or was ordered by the terror group to carry out an attack on American soil.

Vehicle attacks by ISIS supporters have grown in popularity due to the relative ease of acquiring a vehicle as opposed to building a bomb or purchasing a weapon. An Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen first called for vehicle attacks in an online Al Qaeda magazine, calling trucks the “ultimate mowing machine” to take “down the enemies of Allah.” ISIS has claimed responsibility for at least five truck attacks since the deadly incident in Nice, France in July 2016, with two more assaults carried out by self-proclaimed ISIS supporters.

The Hollywood/Media volcano is still spewing out its garbage. First, movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, then newsman wunderkind Mark Halperin, and now the thespian’s thespian Kevin Spacey face a spotlight even they don’t like. Three men from industries that control our culture, bullies and lecturers all, allegedly grabbing and groping whatever vulnerable woman, man or child might have the bad luck of catching their eye. Depending on their predilection, of course.

So we get another week and another Hollywood chorus of “everyone knew.” This time, actor Kevin Spacey was caught when the light turned on. Another actor, now in his 40s, alleges how 30 years ago, the actor and star of Netflix’s “House of Cards,” physically restrained the then-14-year-old and attempted to pressure him into sex. Mr. Spacey was 26 at the time, and both were starring in Broadway plays.

Mr. Spacey claims he has no memory of the incident, but issued an apology and claimed if it did happen it was because he was drunk.

Like Harvey, she says, they “all knew.” And?

Mr. Spacey shares something else with Mr. Weinstein and the Hollywood where “everyone knows” about predators in their midst but accepts it: He’s a liberal and loathes Donald Trump.

In a perfect example of the liberal problem of projection, in May 2016, Mr. Spacey was entertaining at an AIDS benefit in Cannes when he declared then-candidate Donald Trump as something less than human.

The Guardian reported, “Kevin Spacey has laid into Donald Trump during a standup routine at the Cannes Film Festival, calling the Republican presidential hopeful a ‘disease.’ Performing at an event to raise money for AIDS charities, Spacey opened his routine dressed as the late talk show host Johnny Carson. He told the audience that regular host, Sharon Stone, was unable to make it because she was fighting a disease, adding: ‘The name of the disease is Donald Trump.’""

Says the man who, it is alleged, has assaulted numerous young people, including the “loved one” of a news reporter, and as the Daily Mail also reports, “Another friend of a victim, Nadine West, came forward on Monday to claim that a young man close to her was ‘groped’ by Spacey while working alongside the actor at the Old Vic in London.”

Alas, filmmakers, actors and journalists, it turns out we hardly knew ye. We were told you were our moral betters; the arbiters of right and wrong. Only you had the insight to instruct us, the savage and dumb, in the more civilized ways of the world. Only you, with your red carpets, fame, millions of dollars, and cameras pointed at your faces, could be trusted to know what was best for all us rubes.

Poor Roman Polanski, he was unique for a while. For so long the film industry made it seem as though he was an outlier, the only one in Hollywood who would victimize someone, let alone do a horrible thing to a child. Yet we must assume he, and everyone else, knew full well he was part of a club. His crime was that he was caught. So, out damned spot, out, they said.

But victims of Hollywood predators kept piling up, children grew up, and the internet gave those who were previously marginalized a way to speak up. Twitter has been a key communication vehicle for many.

In what was considered the first major Hollywood scandal, silent movie comedian Fatty Arbuckle was accused of rape and murder of actress Virginia Rappe. In September 1921, hotel guests heard a screaming Ms. Rappe, and rushed to her rescue.

The BBC reports, “Among the guests was Virginia Rappe, a 30-year-old struggling actress. … At some point, Arbuckle and Rappe ended up together in a bedroom from where, a few minutes later, her screams were heard.

“Guests rushed in to find Rappe, fully dressed, writhing in pain on the bed. Arbuckle told them — it was a story he always stuck to — that he had gone to use the bathroom where he found Rappe in a drunken faint on the floor. He had merely carried her to the bed and she had fallen off, insisted Arbuckle.

“But then Rappe uttered the words that would damn the star: ‘He did this to me.’""

Rappe died a day later of a ruptured bladder. Many believed the morbidly obese Arbuckle had injured her while attempting to rape her. He was ultimately acquitted, but shunned by the industry.

These stories about the powerful in Hollywood aren’t new, and it’s not about being straight or gay. After all, sexual harassment, assault and rape have nothing to do with sexual attraction or desire, and everything to do with humiliation and control, whether it be of adults or children. Up until now, the entertainment industries where the powerful control not just someone’s job, but their dreams and future, protected itself with enforced silence.

Men like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Mark Halperin are low-hanging fruit, the ones, we’re told, “everyone knows.” It’s time the “entertainment” industry finally stops projecting its issues and displacing its rage onto political opponents and focus on its own rancid house.",Tammy Bruce: Kevin Spacey scandal just another Hollywood case of ‘everyone knows’,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/01/tammy-bruce-kevin-spacey-scandal-just-another-hollywood-case-everyone-knows.html

Folks can deal with flesh-eating zombies and demon-possessed children. But accusations of cultural appropriation? Well, that’s a whole different story.

Let’s be honest – nobody wants to tangle with a bunch of perpetually-offended liberals who were triggered by a white guy wearing a sombrero. Most folks would rather climb into a storm drain and take their chances with a deranged circus clown.

Two Disney costumes are causing quite a bit of “cultural appropriation and white privilege” controversy this year – Moana, the Polynesian character, and Elsa, from “Frozen.”

“I had some reservations regarding both costume choices…about cultural appropriation and the power/privilege carried by Whiteness, and about Whiteness and standards of beauty,” wrote Sachi Feris on the Raising Race Conscious Children blog.

In their estimation dressing up like a Polynesian is akin to wearing black face – or calling a white Southerner a “Cracker.”

The blog also posted a guide urging white parents to use Halloween as an opportunity to “dismantle white supremacy.”

“White parents who want to dismantle White supremacy have a special burden to check their entitlement on Halloween – and make sure that their children’s costume choices are not reinforcing a culture of racism,” the bloggers warned.

In other words, no Colin Kaepernick costumes, kids.

“White people have been dressing up in costumes ‘in good fun’ with little regard to whom they might be offending,” the bloggers wrote.

I think they might be talking about you folks who dressed up as President Trump’s border wall.

The Raising Race Conscious Children bloggers also want moms and dads to use Halloween as an educational opportunity. It’s not just about candy corn and orange marshmallow circus peanuts.

“Halloween is an opportunity to have a conversation with your child about race, power and privilege,” they wrote.

I must confess - it is indeed a burden for us pale faces -- celebrating Halloween without culturally appropriating.

But this year- I may have stumbled upon the foolproof costume. I've decided to dress up in a button down Oxford shirt, with khakis and penny loafers. If anybody asks -- I'm a Cracker.

Like Saipov, Hadayet entered the U.S. under the diversity visa program.","The terror attack Tuesday in Lower Manhattan has brought renewed calls from President Trump and other top Washington Republicans to end the ""diversity visa"" program under which the central Asian suspect entered the United States.

“I’ve always been against it because it’s a random system to bring people into the United States,” Texas GOP Rep. Mike McCaul, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said Wednesday on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends.”

McCaul said he’s trying to abolish the roughly 25-year-old program and replace it with a merit-based one.

“I think this case just demonstrates why that is absolutely necessary,” he also said.

The suspect in Tuesday’s terror attack, Sayfullo Saipov, came into the U.S. in 2010 from Uzbekistan.

He was among the maximium 50,000 people allowed into the U.S. every year under the State Department program, which tilts toward “countries with historically low rates of immigration.”

The 29-year-old Saipov on Tuesday afternoon drove a rented pickup truck down a walk-bike path along Manhattan’s West Side Highway, killing eight and injuring at least 11 others, according to police.

McCaul spoke Wednesday just minutes after President Trump called for a merit-based only immigration system and in part blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other congressional Democrats for the program.

“The terrorist came into our country through what is called the ‘Diversity Visa Lottery Program,’ a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based,” Trump tweeted.

“No more Democratic lottery,” Trump said in a follow-up tweet.

Schumer indeed voted in support of the 1990 Immigration Act, which included the diversity visa program.

The New York Democrat was then a House member and among those who helped pass the measure 264-118, with support from 93 Republicans in the chamber. The bill was signed into law by President George W. Bush and took effect in 1995.

Slightly more than 1 million people have entered the U.S. under the program, based on an analysis of State Department records.

At least 24,000 people have entered the country from Uzbekistan since 2005, according to the records.

The program, which has its origins in a 1986 special-preference program, requires applicants to have no criminal record and come from a county not on the list for statesponsored terrorism.

However, critics have for years argued that potential terrorists can easily move from their birth county to a country not on the list such as Congo, Niger and Turkey.

They also argue that immigrants can come into the U.S. without paying a cent.

“Let’s focus on economic rather that literally handing out tens of thousands of visas like lottery tickets, for free,” Fox contributor and former Utah GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz said Wednesday.

Congress tried unsuccessfully several times since 2005 to end the program, including a 2007 attempt to cut off its funding.

Such efforts, led in part by Virginia GOP Rep. Bob Goodlatte, now the House Judiciary Committee chairman, followed a 2002 terror attack at the Los Angeles International Airport in which Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, an Egyptian nationalist, fatally shot two people.

A Reddit user who said he used to work at McDonald’s three years ago said: “I can promise you that filet of fish is not fresh by any stretch of the imagination.”

“At McDonald’s just say you want a fish filet cooked to order,” another user advised.

He then explained that you would have to wait five minutes longer for your order but it will be “worth it compared to the filet that has been in the heated cabinet for hours.”

Despite the criticism, one loyal McDonald’s customer defended the chain by saying the fish burger is his favorite dish on the menu.

He said: “If you’re going to serve me a square piece of fish that tastes the exact same whether I order it in Denver or the south of France, I am under no assumption that it is by any means fresh.

Country superstar Luke Bryan has teamed up with Chevrolet to design a custom Silverado inspired by his “Huntin’, Fishin’ and Lovin’ Every Day” motto.

The full-size SUV was built for the Specialty Equipment Market Association show in Las Vegas with input from Bryan as a showcase for the Chevrolet Accessories division, and is equipped with plenty of products from the catalog along with custom parts.

The truck is painted a unique Hunter Bronze color with camouflage accents that’s offset by safety orange trim pieces, including Hunting, Fishing and Everyday logos on the doors featuring antlers, fish and a sun. (Apparently, lovin’ isn’t actually encouraged in the truck.)

On the functional off-roading front, the Silverado features a lifted suspension, 35-inch tires on 22-inch wheels, a larger front skid plate and a set of front tow hooks in case it still gets stuck. If it does, a cold air intake for the 5.3-liter V8 adds some oomph to get loose, while Brembo front brakes will help get it stopped before you dive into the next mud pit.

The long list of accessories includes a Thule basket roof rack with fishing rod holder, Baja Designs light bar and tubular side steps.

Chevrolet also modified the truck by removing the rear windows, converting the tailgate from a hatch to a swing-out door and adding a rear-facing third row concept bench listed as a concept, so it could go on sale someday.

A Missouri college that has long embraced teaching its students about military history is beginning a new, required course on patriotism.

FOX's Gurnal Scott with the story:

The College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri is a private, Christian, liberal arts school that embraces it's uniqueness in how it values getting ""the job"" done:

(Dr. Davis) ""This is a work college. Kids work here. They don't pay tuition. They don't have to do that. We don't make loans and they graduate debt free. We to turn out citizens that will take a leadership role.""

That is why the college's president Dr. Jerry Davis says part of the school's mission has been teaching students about the military and it's importance historically in America. The College of the Ozarks is making that a new course, mandatory for incoming freshmen, called 'Patriotic Education and Fitness':

(Dr. Davis) ""We think that we need to be a little bit more intentional in teaching students about our country and about the military and what they do and why they do it.""

The course will serve to educate students on armed forces customs and protocols and touch on some political principles as well as teaching marksmanship and other survival techniques. It can serve, should a first-year student choose, as a start for reserve officers training or ROTC. Davis who has led the College of the Ozarks for nearly 30 years says Midwestern reverence for the military makes this a great fit within their curriculum:

(Dr. Davis) ""It's a part of our carrying out our patriotic goal and we think, we hope, that other schools will notice that.""

Davis says this concept couldn't come at a better time as controversy continues in stadiums across the nation over patriotism:

(Dr. Davis) ""I regret very much what's going on in the culture with regard to respect for the national anthem. Those are military students that present those colors and by extension. The country is being provided or defended by the military, so you can't say it doesn't involve the military. It does.""

In fact, the school has said its teams won't compete against other athletes that won't stand for the anthem. That's why Davis wants his school to lead the way in teaching respect for the uniform:

(Dr. Davis) ""Patriotism is not inherited by bloodstream. It must be modeled. It must be modeled, it must be taught.""

So what began as a pilot program, is growing at the College of the Ozarks as a nod to those who serve and to America itself.

In the first of a series of hearings on Capitol Hill this week related to how Russian actors meddled in the 2016 campaigns on social media, representatives of tech giants Facebook, Twitter and Google testified before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism that they still have much to do in their efforts to stop the abuse of their platforms by improper or fake users.

“How did Facebook, which prides itself in connecting data points, somehow not make the connection that electoral ads, paid for in [Russian] rubles were coming from Russia?” Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., pressed Facebook’s legal counsel.

“In hindsight, we should’ve had a broader lens,” Facebook’s General Counsel Colin Stretch said. “It’s a signal we should have been alert to.”

Franken pressed Stretch over whether Facebook would commit to not taking political ad payments in currencies other than dollars.

“Just answer yes or no,” Franken said in a heated exchange. “You’re the chief legal counsel.”

Stretch said that Facebook was “not going to permit political advertising by foreign actors.”

“My goal for you is to think through this stuff a little bit better,” Franken fired back.

Last week, Facebook said it would verify political ad buyers in federal elections and would build transparency tools to link ads to the Facebook pages of their sponsors.

But in the 2016 election, Facebook estimated that “roughly 29 million people” were served content in their Facebook News Feeds directly from Russia’s Internet Research Agency’s 80,000 posts. The IRA is known for promoting pro-Russian government positions.

Facebook estimated that approximately “126 million people” may have been served content from a page associated with the IRA, noting that that is “approximately 1 out of 23,000 pieces of content.”

“Much of the content we’ve seen is essentially imitative of social causes, many meaningful ones to the Facebook community, and it’s what makes this so vile and cynical,” Stretch told lawmakers. “It’s an attempt to exploit divisions in our society.”

Committee Chairman Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., asked the tech giants whether nations like Iran or North Korea could interfere in a U.S. election as Russia did.

“Certainly potentially,” Stretch said. “The Internet is borderless.”

A Twitter representative testified that it uncovered and shut down 2,752 accounts linked to Russia’s IRA, and said that 5 percent of 330 million active user accounts are “false, spam or automated.” The Russia-linked accounts put out 1.4 million election-related tweets from September through November 15 of last year, nearly half of which were automated.

Twitter also found nine Russian accounts that purchased advertisements coming from the state-backed news service RT. Twitter said last week it would no longer accept ads from RT and Sputnik, another state-sponsored news outlet, and would donate the $1.9 million it earned from RT since 2011 to support external research into political uses of Twitter.

Google said this week that it would verify the identify of the election-related ad buys. It will provide a public database of election ads detailing who purchased each one, and will publish a transparency report on election ads as well.

A bipartisan group of senators introduced earlier this month legislation that would regulate advertisements purchased for online platforms. The legislation is aimed at hitting “archaic laws” that allow content and purchasers of advertisements to be hidden from the public, according to a Senate aide who helped draft the Honest Ads Act backed by Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn; Mark Warner, D-Va.; and John McCain, R-Ariz.

Both collisions were “avoidable” according to the report released Wednesday morning, the official said.

""Both of these accidents were preventable and the respective investigations found multiple failures by watch standers that contributed to the incidents,"" Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson said. ""We must do better.""

The guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with a large container ship on June 17 off the coast of Japan killing seven sailors. Already the captain, the second-in-command and the top senior enlisted sailor have been relieved of their duties.

According to the International Rules of the Road for vessels on the high seas, USS Fitzgerald was in a crossing situation with the cargo ship, Crystal off to Fitzgerald’s starboard or right side. Fitzgerald was required to maneuver, but did not until it was too late.

“In the 30 minutes leading up to the collision, neither Fitzgerald nor Crystal took such action to reduce the risk of collision until approximately one minute prior to the collision,” the report said.

Fitzgerald’s Officer of the Deck “intended to take no action” in the minutes leading up to the collision until realizing it was “too late,” the report said.

“The Officer of the Deck, the person responsible for safe navigation of the ship, exhibited poor seamanship by failing to maneuver as required, failing to sound the danger signal and failing to attempt to contact CRYSTAL on Bridge to Bridge radio. In addition, the Officer of the Deck did not call the Commanding Officer as appropriate and prescribed by Navy procedures to allow him to exercise more senior oversight and judgment of the situation,” the report said.

REPORT: TWO NAVY SEALS EYED IN STRANGULATION OF GREEN BERET IN MALI

In late August, another guided-missile destroyer, USS John S. McCain, collided with a merchant vessel, this time an oil tanker near Singapore. Ten American sailors drowned when their berthing spaces flooded.

Before the deadly collision, the bridge team aboard McCain became distracted by a false alarm signaling the warship had lost steering, according to an official briefed on the report.

“It made a bad situation worse,” the official said, adding the destroyer was in a busy shipping lane at the time of the collision.

""We are a Navy that learns from mistakes and the Navy is firmly committed to doing everything possible to prevent an accident like this from happening again,"" Richardson said. ""We must never allow an accident like this to take the lives of such magnificent young sailors and inflict such painful grief on their families and the nation.""

Both McCain’s commanding officer and the executive officer, the second in command, were relieved of command earlier this month.

The USS John S. McCain is named after Sen. John McCain’s father and grandfather, both admirals in the Navy.

In September, the top two officers of the Navy’s Japan-based 7th Fleet – where both warships were based -- were fired.

Even if authorities determine the attack to be ISIS-inspired or directed, the terror group is unlikely to publicly claim the rampage.

ISIS has recruited many Uzbek citizens to its cause, with several of the supporters who travel to Syria conducting suicide missions.","An Uzbekistan man who left notes pledging allegiance to ISIS on Tuesday carried out a deadly truck attack in New York City — just days after ISIS released propaganda emboldening its followers to carry out Halloween attacks.

The suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, 29, allegedly barreled a Home Depot truck down a popular bike path in Manhattan, killing at least eight people and injuring 11 others. Officials say he then crashed the vehicle into a school bus, before jumping out and screaming “Allahu akbar” — “God is great” in Arabic — with pellet and paintball guns in his hands. Authorities also found Saipov’s handwritten notes pledging loyalty to ISIS.

But there may have been warning signs prior to Tuesday's assault.

Saipov ""popped"" up in connection with a handful of individuals who were known to law enforcement when investigators ran his name through their databases after Tuesday's attack, two sources told Fox News. It is not clear whether these investigations were limited to the New York City area or included Florida, where Saipov had lived. One source said Saipov had “close ties...[to] the group he rolled with [who] was known to law enforcement.”

ISIS had been encouraging its followers to carry out Halloween attacks with propaganda from the terror group showing a graphic with a blood-splattered machete and Tuesday's date. The artwork was believed to have been done by a French ISIS supporter and included an image of the Eiffel Tower with the words “Enjoy their gathering” and “Terrorize October 31” written in French.

SITE intelligence group, which monitors terror activity online, also highlighted a recent photo taken by an ISIS supporter near the scene of Tuesday's attack; but it remained unclear if there was a connection between that photo and the rampage.

The terror group’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, recently emerged after multiple rumors of his death, urging followers to ""intensify the successive attacks,"" despite the terror group's losses on the ground in Syria and Iraq.

There has been no official claim of responsibility by the terror group, but known ISIS accounts — what counterterrorism analysts call “leadership” accounts — are applauding the attack and using the hashtag ""#the slap of terrorism.""

Even if authorities determine the attack to be ISIS-inspired or directed, the terror group is unlikely to publicly claim the rampage. ISIS typically doesn't claim terror attacks in which the attacker lives. Police shot Saipov, however, he was rushed to the hospital with injuries that were not considered life-threatening.

ISIS has recruited many Uzbek citizens to its cause, with several of the supporters who travel to Syria conducting suicide missions. The estimated number of Uzbek citizens fighting in the ranks of ISIS is estimated to be about 200 people in Uzbekistan, according to the Muslim Board of Uzbekistan. However, the number of Uzbek jihadists exceeds more than 1,500, when other terror groups such as Imam Bukhari Jamaat, Tawhid wal-Jihad and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) are added.

Uzbekistan is the most populous country in Central Asia and shares a border with Afghanistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.

Saipov is the second Uzbek national in New York connected to terror in just the last four days. Abdurasul Hasanovich Juraboev, a 27-year-old Uzbek citizen, was sentenced to 15 years for conspiring to provide material support to ISIS. Juraboev, who lived in Brooklyn, posted a threat on an Uzbek-language website saying he wanted to kill then-President Barack Obama in an act of martyrdom on behalf of ISIS in 2014. He then told investigators that he believed in ISIS’ agenda and wanted to travel to Syria to join ISIS fighters, the Justice Department said in a news release. He also told officials he planned to plant a bomb on Coney Island if he couldn’t travel to Syria or was ordered by the terror group to carry out an attack on American soil.

Vehicle attacks by ISIS supporters have grown in popularity due to the relative ease of acquiring a vehicle as opposed to building a bomb or purchasing a weapon. An Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen first called for vehicle attacks in an online Al Qaeda magazine, calling trucks the “ultimate mowing machine” to take “down the enemies of Allah.” ISIS has claimed responsibility for at least five truck attacks since the deadly incident in Nice, France in July 2016, with two more assaults carried out by self-proclaimed ISIS supporters.

You want to go as something fun and original, but also something recognizable. However, the one thing you want to avoid is wearing a costume that is deemed offensive or insensitive.

Sometimes celebrities aren't too concerned about that last part.

Whether they were misinformed, misguided or just blissfully unaware, the following stars failed to steer clear of costume controversies:

Hilary Duff and Jason Walsh

Duff and then-boyfriend Jason Walsh went as a pilgrim and a Native American chief in 2016. She and Walsh later apologized following Internet backlash, with Duff saying the costume ""was not properly thought through and I am truly, from the bottom of my [heart] sorry.""

Ashley Benson

Though it wasn't during Halloween, ""Pretty Little Liars"" star Ashley Benson cased a stir after donning a ""Cecil the Lion costume"" for Instagram only a few months after outrage erupted over the real-life death of Cecil the Lion in 2015. She later changed the caption and apologized, saying her management was responsible for the insensitive post.

Prince Harry

Prince Harry made news in 2005 for arriving at a January costume party dressed as a Nazi. A spokesman quickly apologized on Harry's behalf, saying: ""Prince Harry has apologized for any offence or embarrassment he has caused. He realizes it was a poor choice of costume.""

Julianne Hough

In 2013 Hough dressed as an African-American character from Netflix’s “Orange Is the New Black"" — complete with blackface makeup. She apologized the next day, writing that it was not her intention ""to be disrespectful or demeaning to anyone in any way.""

Lily Allen

In 2014, Allen went to Kate Hudson's Halloween party as a gynecologist named ""Dr. Luke,"" a reference to real-life music producer Dr. Luke, who was accused of sexual abuse by fellow pop-singer Kesha just a week before. ""Too far?"" the Mirror asked upon seeing the costume. Others, however, felt Allen's costume was a display of support for Kesha.

Heidi Klum

Well known for her elaborate Halloween costumes and parties, Klum took a misstep in 2008 when she dressed as the Hindu goddess Kali. Hindu leaders demanded an apology, with one blasting Klum for using Kali's likeness as part of a ""publicity stunt.""

Just a month after the Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin’s 2006 death, Maher dressed in Irwin-inspired garb with a bloody stingray barb stuck in his chest. The costume didn't go over well, but Maher refused to apologize.

Chris Brown

On Halloween in 2012, Brown posted a photo of himself and his ""clique"" wearing beards, turbans and assault weapons, or as Huffington Post wrote, ""his interpretation of an Arab terrorist."" His mother later came to his defense on Twitter, writing that ""HALLOWEEN IS FOR FUN."" Brown eventually removed the post from his Instagram account.

Back in 2014, Disick shared a photo of himself dressed as a sheik. ""Happy Halloween. We getting Arab money tonight,"" he wrote in the caption. Many took umbrage with Disick's costume and caption, calling him ""idiotic"" or asking ""who does he think he is?""

Jeff Ross

Though it wasn't on Halloween, comedian Jeff Ross showed up for the 2012 Comedy Central Roast of Roseanne dressed as late Penn State football coach Joe Paterno, alongside two half-naked boys in football helmets and towels. The outfit was met with mixed reactions, but Ross claimed to be standing up for comedy, reported the Huffington Post. “If they’re offended by what they see, they can do what Joe Paterno did – look the other way,"" he told reporters.

Harry Hamlin

Hamlin and his wife, Lisa Rinna, dressed as Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen, for a 2015 Halloween party thrown by Casamigos tequila — but Hamlin apparently took inspiration from a 1978 photo of Vicious in which he was wearing a swastika on his shirt. Rinna later apologized for the insensitive logo on behalf of both of them.

Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

RELATED: Get a New Dish Rack to Hold and Hide Dirty Dishes

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

RELATED: Budget-Friendly Bathroom Sets for Guests

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.

Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.

Turn the lights down. If you’ve got absolutely no time to get ready for guests, you can try this last-ditch technique: Turn the lights down low, or close the blinds.

The darkness will hide many of your sins.",8 tricks to speed-clean your house before unexpected guests arrive,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/8-tricks-to-speed-clean-your-house-before-unexpected-guests-arrive.html

Lake claimed when Manson didn’t get his way, he pulled a knife out.
I think they tried to mold him into being a rock star and Charlie wasn’t going for it.
Lake didn’t participate in the horrific slayings.","The youngest member of America’s most infamous cult has broken her silence about the relationship she had with convicted mass murderer Charles Manson when she was just 14 years old.

Dianne Lake, now 64, has published a memoir titled “Member of the Family,” which chronicles her years with the charismatic ringleader and how her life forever changed after the brutal Tate murders in 1969.

Back before the Minneapolis native met the former convict, she was raised by hippie parents.

“I had a fairly normal upbringing until we moved to California,” Lake told Fox News. “My parents got turned on, tuned in, met up with a commune and dropped out. I didn’t fit in… five people in a bread truck was a little confining.”

In 1967, Lake met Manson all thanks to her mother, who had befriended him when he visited the house farm commune.

“She gave him a picture to look for me… But this was all unbeknownst to me,” Lake described.

His female followers, known as “the girls,” instantly recognized Lake and welcomed her with open arms.

“When I walked into this party, the girls, they all knew me,” she explained. “They went, ‘Charlie! Charlie! Dianne’s here!’ I was just totally blown away. Because I didn’t know these people. But they made me feel very welcomed.”

When Lake locked eyes with the 34-year-old who played guitar and sang songs, she was instantly smitten.

“He was cute, funny and very playful,” said Lake. “He was very loving, very charismatic.”

Within hours of meeting, the two had sex. Lake’s parents granted her permission to live on her own and she instantly joined “the family” that same year.

In an attempt to conceal her age, Manson gave Lake a fake ID.

“We took care of the babies,” said Lake. “We cooked. Went shopping in the dumpsters. Put meals together… I felt like were any other commune. We weren’t coupled off, though. There was Charlie and a few other men and we shared them.

""There were preferences, but it’s not like it was couples that came together and doing a communal living… He made each of us feel very special and there really wasn’t much jealousy because that was part of the philosophy, that there was plenty of love to go around.”

However, the free love turned violent when the man she worshipped beat and raped her in 1968, Lake said. That same year, Manson befriended Dennis Wilson of The Beach Boys. Lake believed Manson viewed the rock singer as someone who could help him spread his influence to the masses.

“Dennis really took Charlie under his wing,” said Lake. “Charlie was teaching Dennis how to play the guitar and I think he admired Charlie. He was proud to show him off to his friends. They had a good time together.”

In July 1968, Wilson scheduled a recording session for his friend. Mike Love, who was in attendance, supposedly wasn’t thrilled with the arrangement. Lake claimed when Manson didn’t get his way, he pulled a knife out. Consequently, the relationship between Manson and Wilson soured.

“They stole one of Charlie’s songs and changed the name,” she claimed. “So he wasn’t happy about that… It just wasn’t the same. I think they tried to mold him into being a rock star and Charlie wasn’t going for it. Because I think Charlie’s message was more important to him than being a rock star. He didn’t want the words to his music changed. He didn’t want to dress differently. He wasn’t happy.”

That same year, The Beatles released “The White Album.” Manson became so obsessed with the recording that he made ""the family"" hear it daily. He believed it was an apocalyptic sign of a race war to come, Lake said.

“It was very influential and he really felt that ‘The White Album’ was a message that confirmed what he believed, which was that there was going to be this race war that they named ‘Helter Skelter’ and he listened to it backwards,” said Lake. “And from that point on, there definitely seemed to be a stronger agenda to prepare for this.”

Manson faced another setback in spreading his destructive gospel. In spring 1969, screen star Doris Day’s son Terry Melcher, a record producer who was also friends with Wilson, was curious to hear him sing. Although Melcher arranged Manson to perform at a studio, no record deal came through, Lake revealed.

Several months later, Manson ordered some of his followers to go on a two-day murder spree, which resulted in the deaths of seven people. One of the victims was actress Sharon Tate, who was eight months pregnant with her first child with director Roman Polanski. Her home was previously occupied by Melcher.

Lake didn’t participate in the horrific slayings.

“I disappeared for a couple of days,” she explained. “I got arrested for going through the trash and being underage. I didn’t have any ID with me at the time. And when I got back, (member) Tex [Watson] had the newspaper with the headline about the Tate murders. And he was upset, like where was I? He slapped the paper and said, ‘I did this. Charlie told me to.’”

Lake insisted she was shocked by the confession.

“I couldn’t believe it, really,” she said. “And then I was afraid to leave... Now that I know this truth, I can’t leave because he’ll come after me. And obviously he’s capable of murder. So I was very much afraid… And disappointed… [And] the girls confided in me what they had done. We had taken LSD, we were out in the middle of the desert and they just started sharing.”

Looking back, Lake doesn’t believe Tate was specifically targeted.

“The only connection I know of was that Terry Melcher had lived in that house and both Charlie and Tex had been there because Terry was going to help us record an album,” she explained. “…I don’t know if it was revenge or just because of the whole race war thing… or they were trying to create mayhem on a bigger scale… I can’t answer that. I only know the correlation. I only know what was going on at that time, at least from what I can remember at this time.”

In 1970, Lake found herself facing Manson once again in an L.A. courtroom where she testified against him and some of his followers. He was found guilty of first-degree murder and is currently serving a life sentence.

Lake’s life would change once again when she was taken in as a foster child by arresting officer Jack Gardiner and his wife Carol.

“They really made me feel like there was something worth saving,” she recalled. “I came out of the darkness and into the light.”

Lake has been a member of a local church for 30 years where she sings in the choir. She later married, raised three children and is currently a retired special education teacher.

“It’s been a very rewarding life,” she said. “But I had this secret… I’ve unburdened my soul and released myself from the shame of just by association.”","Manson's youngest follower tells all, claims Dennis Wilson tried to 'mold' cult leader into a rock star",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/31/mansons-youngest-follower-tells-all-claims-dennis-wilson-tried-to-mold-cult-leader-into-rock-star.html

The sign, written in all capital letters, quickly drew the attention, and ire, of many in the community. Soon after the new policy took place, a Tampa Bay Mom’s Group Facebook page exploded with comments about the situation.

Many felt “this is an outrage,” while others thought “it’s [the business’] prerogative.”

Troy Taylor, who opened the Hampton Station pizza shop in 2015, had started his business as a family and hipster-friendly eatery with patio courtyard and a variety of action figures positioned on the tables. But after “a lot of people who couldn’t keep their kids under control,” Taylor tells the Tampa Bay Times, he was forced to take action, referencing a particular incident as the catalyst for his decision.

NEW YORK RESTAURANT HAS ONE-DRINK LIMIT POLICY FOR CUSTOMERS WITH KIDS

""A kid was in danger and could have seriously been hurt,"" he said. ""It’s a liability and safety issue. After the incident, I thought, this can’t happen again.""

The restaurant is located on a busy street in the Seminole Heights neighborhood and has an unprotected patio with access to the road.

Troy defends his decision citing the mixture of alcohol, which the restaurant serves, and kids could have dangerous results.

Social media has been split on the Troy’s choice, with some on Facebook asking “how does this not fall into some type of discrimination?”

Another wrote, “This is a place that neighborhood families rallied around. I mean, this place literally uses action figures as their order markers.”

But many supported the no kids allowed policy, writing that there are plenty of places families can go to instead.

One Facebook user bluntly wrote, “Get over it. Go somewhere else it’s not that big of a deal lol.”

Another said, “Fine by me! I don’t have to take my kids everywhere with me and there's also plenty of other pizza places I can take them with me if I chose to.”

Some even tried to find a middle ground suggesting that maybe the pizza shop and bar “should just ban kids after a certain time” like other pubs do.

Troy said, ""It’s one of the toughest things I’ve ever done. It’s been gut-wrenching. I’m not a big social media person, but I’ve stayed away from Facebook.""

Troy acknowledge in a Facebook comment the Tampa Bay Mom's Group cites, that he might lose some long time customers, but he ""couldn't live with the fact that a child might get hurt at Hampton.""

""We had a lot of great kids come in to Hampton and we are going to miss them, but this had to be done for everyone's well being,"" the post says.

Courtney Mattina, a mother of two also felt the business move was a positive one.

""I’m happy to see restaurants are taking a stand and saying, ‘We don’t want kids in here being noisy or messy, we’re going to create an environment for adults only,’"" she said to the Tampa Bay Times. ""I was a waitress for six years and kids running around a restaurant is one of the most dangerous things in the world.""

Other Seminole Heights restaurants have encountered the same problem when it comes to allowing children at their businesses. One restaurant in the same neighborhood caught flack for going child free, citing the dangers he witnessed when parents would allow children to frolic on the patio unsupervised.

While Southern Brewing and Winemaking in the same area decided not to ban children entirely, they do understand the importance of child safety. To combat bad behaviors, the brewery decided to set up a sign of rules discouraging running, screaming and other disruptive antics.

""Southern wanted to make absolutely clear that we are family-friendly and don’t want to do any blanket banning, but we need to set some ground rules,” retail associate Charlie McElman said. “We as staff said we needed signs that we can point to. I think there’s been a big shift in how people are comfortable disciplining their children, especially in public.""

""It’s two camps, there’s not a lot of middle ground on [banning children]. And people go from zero to nasty when they have access to social media,” McElman added.","Florida pizza restaurant banned children, and many are not happy",https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2017/10/31/florida-pizza-restaurant-banned-children-and-many-are-not-happy.html

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on.
I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly.
After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears.
My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""","The day my oldest daughter was born, I held her in my arms in the hospital and made two promises: ""First, I promise I will never leave your mother; and second, I'll show up. I'll do everything I can to be at your recitals and ball games and dinner around the table.""

My baby laid there in my arms blinking, breathing, oblivious to the magnitude of the words I was saying.

My promises seemed so valiant when I made them at the hospital. But when I got home, I realized my daughter was going to need my wife and me to do a lot more than just stay married and love each other. She needed to see a regular demonstration of our love. That was not our strong suit.

While we loved each other deeply, we were in a constant battle for control and both of us were losing as we bickered and bickered. Having a baby in the house made us more self-conscious about what we sounded like – especially to the ears of a little one. We made an unspoken agreement to change.

I'd like to say we immediately abandoned our old habits and learned how to disagree without being disagreeable. That, however, would not be true. We still struggled, but at least we were finally making an effort to resist our dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

Over the years we made a lot of progress, which was largely due to confessing our struggles with Christian friends and praying things like ""Father, please show me how I need to change.""

God responded, showing us unflattering things about our character that we didn't want to see. It was humbling and made us less likely to assume we were always right when there was a conflict. It also had an unexpected benefit: We became more affectionate to each other.

I don't mean to say we weren't affectionate before – we never lost the spark of infatuation that attracted us to each other in the first place. But as we grew in humility towards each other, we were more likely to gently touch each other in the car or say encouraging things to each other in the everyday ho-hum. We had no idea the impact it was having on the other members of our household.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on. I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly. I could tell it caught her off-guard and embarrassed her a little – it came out of nowhere. Thank goodness she stayed in my arms and danced with me anyway.

As the song approached the final chorus, I looked in my peripheral vision and suddenly realized we weren't alone. Our daughters, who were five and seven, were standing there watching us in silence.

The song approached the end, and as the strings played the last notes, I decided to give the girls a Hollywood ending. I took my wife's face in my hands and kissed her. After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears. Then she came over, buried her face in my wife's legs, and cried.

""Why are you crying?"" my wife asked.

""I can't explain it.""

""Can you at least give me one word to describe how you're feeling?"" I asked.

My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""

That one word – ""loved""— took my breath away. Like so many others, I work hard to be a good parent and spouse, but I typically see those roles as having separate tasks and separate functions. My daughter helped me see that there's far more overlap for children than we realize.

Parents are the first two people who get the opportunity to teach children what love looks like, and our kids are counting on us to prove that love is real.

Children want to see their imperfect, dysfunctional parents dance in the kitchen, say ""I love you"" when they get off the phone, pray together, kiss as they say goodbye and speak highly of each other. Those moments of affection provide assurance to our kids – the world isn't all bad. Things are going to be OK at home.

Demonstrating marital love to our children is a privilege, a unique opportunity to be both a good parent and a good spouse. To love each other well is to love our children well.",What happened when my daughter saw me kiss my wife,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/what-happened-when-my-daughter-saw-me-kiss-my-wife.html

The Diversity Visa Program, a State Department program which offers a lottery for people from countries with few immigrants in America, drew the ire of Trump early Wednesday morning.

""The terrorist came into our country through what is called the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program,' a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based,"" Trump tweeted. ""We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems. We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter).""

The DV program makes up to 50,000 immigrant visas available annually, ""drawn from random selection among all entries to individuals who are from countries with low rates of immigration"" to the U.S., according to the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services website. Applicants must prove they have a clean criminal record, have a high school diploma or its equivalent, or have at least two years of work experience within the past five years in order to qualify.

The program originated as part of a bill introduced in 1990 by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., then a member of the House. Schumer’s measure to make a set number of visas available to “diversity immigrants” from certain countries was absorbed into a larger House immigration bill, which was sponsored by Schumer and 31 others, including several Republicans.

The House legislation passed in a bipartisan – but contested – vote, 231-192, while the Senate version containing the “diversity immigrants” part passed more easily, 89-8, and went on to be signed by then-President George H.W. Bush in 1990.

The program has been in the crosshairs of Congress several times, most recently when the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act, sponsored by Senator Tom Cotton, R-Ark., called for its elimination. The Trump White House came out in support of the bill, calling the DV program “outdated,” adding that it “serves questionable economic and humanitarian interests.”

Schumer responded to Trump's comments early Wednesday, calling on the president to rescind proposed cuts to ""vital anti-terrorism funding"" in his budget.

“I have always believed and continue to believe that immigration is good for America,"" the senator said in a statement. ""President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be focusing on the real solution - anti-terrorism funding - which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget.""

On Tuesday after the attack, Schumer kept his post-attack comments to praise of the NYPD.

""Thanks NYPD for rapidly responding to tragic situation downtown. Worried & saddened to hear about injuries & loss of life,"" he said on Twitter.

Saipov is accused of killing eight people and injuring 11 others when he drove a rented Home Depot truck down a New York City bike lane, plowing into pedestrians, before slamming into a school bus.

“He wanted for there to be fireworks in my career, but first there had to be fireworks between he and I,” Rick told Fox News of his former publicist.

The 30-year-old told us Webster demanded he strip naked in order to prepare for a photo shoot with Playgirl magazine. Rick said Webster performed oral sex on him.

He added, “[If] I stopped going with the flow, he would make sure no one would ever hear my name.”

Webster’s PR firm told Fox News he had a relationship with Rick but it was consensual.

“As a single adult, Mr. Webster has had multiple relationships over the course of his professional life, all of which have been consensual. This includes a brief relationship with Mr. Rick. It saddens Mr. Webster that nine years later, after Mr. Rick’s music career has been stagnant, Mr. Rick has taken the opportunistic approach of mischaracterizing that relationship and posting untrue allegations.”

Rick told us he “knew it was time to escape” when he woke up the night after an Easter party in Webster’s bed and had no recollection of the night before.

“I knew that whatever was left of my dignity, I had to get out of there. I felt like I might not survive,” he recalled. He said Webster continued to contact him via social media up until this past June.

Rick insisted on sharing his story amid others coming forward with their own stories of sexual abuse and harassment. In recent weeks, more than 90 women have accused movie mogul Harvey Weinstein of misconduct.

Webster moved to Nashville at age 20 and opened his PR firm without a college degree or previous experience in the industry.

The meetings earlier this month did not result in a policy change that would require players to stand for the anthem. Owners and players are expected to meet again next week to discuss initiatives.

Webster is denying the allegations, saying he had a consensual relationship with the singer.

Austin C. Rick, who performed under the name Austin Cody, said he suffered months of “terrible, terrible” abuse at the hands of Webster.

“He wanted for there to be fireworks in my career, but first there had to be fireworks between he and I,” Rick told Fox News of his former publicist.

“He sexually assaulted me repeatedly, he drugged and sexually violated me, he offered me publicity opportunities and magazine columns in exchange for sexual acts. He paid me to keep my mouth shut,” Rick wrote on his GoFundMe page and on Facebook. He is crowdfunding $15,000 for his legal fees.

Harvey Weinstein scandal: What you need to know

The 30-year-old told us Webster demanded he strip naked in order to prepare for a photo shoot with Playgirl magazine. Rick said Webster performed oral sex on him.

He added, “[If] I stopped going with the flow, he would make sure no one would ever hear my name.”

Webster’s PR firm told Fox News he had a relationship with Rick but it was consensual.

“As a single adult, Mr. Webster has had multiple relationships over the course of his professional life, all of which have been consensual. This includes a brief relationship with Mr. Rick. It saddens Mr. Webster that nine years later, after Mr. Rick’s music career has been stagnant, Mr. Rick has taken the opportunistic approach of mischaracterizing that relationship and posting untrue allegations.”

Rick told us he “knew it was time to escape” when he woke up the night after an Easter party in Webster’s bed and had no recollection of the night before.

“I knew that whatever was left of my dignity, I had to get out of there. I felt like I might not survive,” he recalled. He said Webster continued to contact him via social media up until this past June.

Rick insisted on sharing his story amid others coming forward with their own stories of sexual abuse and harassment. In recent weeks, more than 90 women have accused movie mogul Harvey Weinstein of misconduct.

Webster moved to Nashville at age 20 and opened his PR firm without a college degree or previous experience in the industry. He said in a 2014 interview that he operates by “not taking 'no' as an answer,” which he believes has made him a “power publicist.”",Country music’s top publicist accused of sexual abuse by singer denies allegations,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/01/country-music-s-top-publicist-accused-sexual-abuse-by-singer-denies-allegations.html

Nurse Alex Wubbels and her lawyer, Karra Porter, announced the move nearly two months after they released police body-camera video showing Detective Jeff Payne handcuffing Wubbels. The footage drew widespread attention online amid the national debate about police use of force.

The settlement covers all possible defendants in a lawsuit, including individual police officers, university police and hospital security guards. The payout will be divided among the city and the University of Utah.

Wubbels plans to use part of the money to fund legal help for others trying to get similar body-camera video. She said that in cases like hers, video is essential to being heard and believed.

""We all deserve to know the truth, and the truth comes when you see the actual raw footage, and that's what happened in my case,"" she said. ""No matter how truthful I was in telling my story, it was nothing compared to what people saw and the visceral reaction people experienced when watching the footage of the experience I went through.""

She said she also plans to give a portion of the $500,000 to a nurse's union and help lead a campaign to stop physical and verbal abuse of nurses on the job.

University of Utah hospital officials said in a statement they support Wubbels and have changed their procedures and training on how police and health care workers interact to ensure nothing similar happens again.

A spokesman for Salt Lake City didn't immediately return messages seeking comment.

Wubbel was following hospital policy when she told Payne he needed a warrant or the consent of the patient to draw blood after a July 26 car crash. The patient was not under arrest or suspected of wrongdoing.

Payne had neither. He eventually dragged Wubbels outside and handcuffed her as she screamed that she had done nothing wrong.

She was released without being charged but has said the incident left her feeling terrified and bullied. In a call for changes, Wubbel and her lawyer released the video they had obtained through a public records request.

Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown has since apologized and fired Payne after an internal investigation found he violated department policies.

Brown said in a disciplinary letter that he was ""deeply troubled"" by Payne's conduct, which he said brought ""significant disrepute"" on the department.

Payne is appealing that decision, saying the firing was an unfair reaction to the negative publicity.

The patient was an off-duty Idaho reserve police officer driving a semitrailer when he was hit by a man fleeing police in a pickup truck. He later died of his injuries.

Lt. James Tracy, a police supervisor who ordered the arrest of the nurse, was demoted to officer and also is appealing. He said he suggested Payne consider handcuffing the nurse and that his superiors had never informed him of the hospital's blood-draw policy, according to appeal documents.

Wubbels said she was relieved at the discipline and would be disappointed if it's overturned, though she stressed that decision is out of her control.

""The police have to police themselves,"" she said.

At least The New York Times eventually admitted that Duranty's work was ""some of the worst reporting in this newspaper,"" but the Pulitzer committee never withdrew its prize.","This year marks the hundredth anniversary of one of the worst mistakes ever made: the Communist revolution in Russia.

Communist regimes went on to kill about 100 million people. Most died in famines after socialist tyrants forced people to practice inefficient collective farming. Millions of others were executed in political purges.

Yet when the Russian Revolution happened, people both inside and outside Russia were excited. Crowds cheered Lenin. No longer would nobles rule; no longer would capitalists exploit workers. Now the people would prosper together.

British journalist Theodore Rothstein wrote, ""The undivided sway of the Imperialist nightmare is at an end ...(there will be) rule of the labouring classes.""

But you can't have government plan every aspect of people's lives and expect things to go well. Instead, you get bureaucratic planning commissions and secret police.

That won't stop some Americans from celebrating Communism's anniversary.

A day of anti-Trump protests is scheduled for Nov. 4, and I'm sure some protestors will wave hammer-and-sickle flags. Some will wear Che Guevara shirts.

A few commentators will call the protesters ""idealistic"" but impractical. They shouldn't. We should call them supporters of mass murder.

Lenin ordered the hanging of 100 property owners at the very start of the Revolution, saying people needed to see the deaths of ""landlords, rich men, bloodsuckers.""

Mass murder and starvation rapidly increased the death toll after that.

It wasn't exactly what philosopher Karl Marx had in mind -- but it shouldn't have surprised anyone. Marx's writing is filled with comparisons of capitalists to werewolves and other predators who must be destroyed.

Marx admitted that capitalism is productive but said that ""capital obtains this ability only by constantly sucking in living labor as its soul, vampire-like.""

Even as the Russian regime killed millions, some journalists and intellectuals covered up the crimes.

Stalin kept most media out, so few Americans knew that millions were starving, but New York Times writer Walter Duranty saw it first-hand.

Yet he ""covered up Stalin's crimes,"" says Tom Palmer of the Atlas Network, a group that promotes free market ideas around the world.

Because Duranty wanted to support ""the cause,"" he wrote that ""report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda.""

Duranty ""saw the truckloads of bodies,"" says Palmer, yet ""he wrote on the front page of The New York Times how wonderful everything was."" He even got a Pulitzer Prize for it.

In some ways, times haven't changed that much. This year, the Times ran a series of essays commemorating the anniversary of Russian Communism, including one piece arguing that sex was better in the Soviet Union because the Revolution destroyed macho capitalist culture.

At least The New York Times eventually admitted that Duranty's work was ""some of the worst reporting in this newspaper,"" but the Pulitzer committee never withdrew its prize.

Communism kills wherever it's practiced. But people still people believe. Making a video on Communism's hundredth anniversary, I interviewed Lily Tang Williams, who grew up under the regime in China.

""Mao was like a god to me,"" she recounts. ""In the morning, we were encouraged to chant and to confess to dear Chairman Mao.""

Under Mao, Williams nearly starved. ""I was so hungry. My uncle taught me how to trap rats. But the problem is, everybody is trying to catch rats. Rats run out, too.""

Still, she says she was so brainwashed by Communist propaganda that she ""cried my eyes out when Mao died.""

But then, ""when I was college student, I met a U.S. exchange student ... He showed me a pocket Constitution and Declaration of Independence. A light bulb came on!""

For the first time, she realized, ""I have rights ... natural rights that cannot be taken away. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""

She escaped to the United States. Now she says her mission in life is to teach Americans the importance of liberty.

I think her message is wiser than that of Karl Marx, Lenin and Stalin.

""Big, powerful government, it's very scary,"" she warns. ""It will keep growing like cancer, will never stop.

Investigators in New York City were left with a range of questions Tuesday after a driver plowed a pickup truck onto a bike path and into a crowd in Lower Manhattan, killing at least eight people and injuring 11.

The suspect, identified as Sayfullo Saipov, 29, is originally from Uzbekistan and is not a U.S. citizen, federal law enforcement sources have confirmed to Fox News.

The attack on a bright Halloween afternoon occurred not far from the new World Trade Center building and the site of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

Saipov had handwritten notes pledging his loyalty to the Islamic State terror network and shouted ""Allahu akbar"" (""God is great"") after the crash, law enforcement officials told Fox News.

Saipov, who was shot by police, was taken into custody and remained hospitalized.

The suspect had a green card, a source told Fox News. Saipov came to the U.S. in 2010, and, according to the Associated Press, has a Florida driver's license but was said to be living in Paterson, N.J.

Saipov was an Uber driver who had passed a background check, the company told Fox News. It added that Saipov has now been banned from the app, and Uber has offered assistance to the FBI.

An Ohio truck driver says the man accused of killing eight people with a truck in New York City was argumentative, seemed to harbor radical views and saw his work life spiraling down.

Mirrakhmat Muminov says Sayfullo Saipov lived in Stow, Ohio, for a few years. He says he knew Saipov because they were both Uzbek truck drivers.

Muminov says Saipov lost his insurance on his truck because of a few traffic tickets. He says companies stopped hiring Saipov, so he left for New Jersey.

Muminov said he heard from Saipov's friends that Saipov's truck engine blew up a few months ago in New Jersey. He says that ""probably hurt him more than anything.""

Muminov also says Saipov was ""not happy with his life"" and would get into arguments with his friends and family.

Officials say Saipov left a handwritten note referring to the Islamic State group. Muminov says Saipov never spoke about the group, but he could tell Saipov held more radical views.

A law enforcement official says investigators are trying to talk to the 29-year-old suspect accused of killing eight people in a truck attack in a bike lane near the World Trade Center and hoping to glean information from him.

The official was not authorized to speak publicly on the ongoing probe and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Law enforcement officials identified the suspect as Sayfullo Saipov. They say he came to the U.S. legally from Uzbekistan in 2010.

He was shot once in the abdomen by an officer after he crashed the rented truck into a school bus during the rampage Tuesday afternoon. He underwent surgery and remained hospitalized.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said a note found at the scene referenced the Islamic State and that the suspect had been radicalized in the U.S. He says the contents of the note were under investigation.

Cuomo calls the driver a ""depraved coward,"" and says the attack ""did not instill terror"" among hardy New Yorkers.

Terror came back to New York City Tuesday. After killing at least eight people and injuring nearly a score with a truck, a man jumped out yelling, as always, “Allahu Akbar (God is great).”

What this attack had in common with similar truck murders in Europe is that it happened in a place normally filled with everyday life. Almost a mile north of the World Trade Center, the bike path is usually filled with walkers, cyclists, joggers and skateboarders.

Suddenly it was strewn with broken bodies, as this year in Las Ramblas in Barcelona, London Bridge and Stockholm, and in 2016 on Bastille Day in Nice and at a Berlin Christmas market. History will remember Islamic State and its offshoots and long-distance recruits mainly for their homicidal cowardice.

Chris Taylor hit a tying double off Justin Verlander during a two-run rally in the sixth inning, Corey Seager followed with a go-ahead sacrifice fly and the Dodgers beat the Astros 3-1 on Tuesday night to push this dramatic World Series to the ultimate game.

Pederson homered in the seventh against Joe Musgrove, connecting off the right-hander for the second time in three games for the record 24th long ball of this Series. Pederson pranced all the way to the plate, pointing at the Dodgers' dugout and rubbing his thumbs and index fingers together to indicate what a money shot it was.

Yu Darvish starts Wednesday for the Dodgers, trying to win their first title since 1988, and Lance McCullers Jr. for the Astros in the first World Series Game 7 ever at Dodger Stadium. Darvish was chased in the second inning of Game 2, when McCullers pitched Houston to a 5-3 victory.

George Springer's third-inning home run against starter Rich Hill had given a 1-0 lead to Verlander and the Astros, trying for the first title in their 56-season history. On Halloween night, a championship for a team with orange in its colors seemed appropriate.

But it served only to set up the 10th blown lead of the Series, the fifth by Houston, as Verlander fell to 9-1 with Houston.

Dodgers relievers combined for 4 1/3 scoreless innings. Brandon Morrow retired Alex Bregman on a grounder to strand the bases loaded in the fifth, winner Tony Watson got Marwin Gonzalez to fly out with two on and two outs in the sixth, and Kenta Maeda escaped two-on trouble in the seventh when third baseman Justin Turner gloved Jose Altuve's grounder and threw a one-hop throw that first baseman Cody Bellinger scooped just in time.

After wasting a ninth-inning lead in Game 2 and losing Game 5, Kenley Jansen retired six straight batters for the save and ended by striking out 40-year-old pinch-hitter Carlos Beltran.

This will be the third World Series Game 7 in four years. Ten of the last 12 teams that won Game 6 to force a seventh game also won the title, but the Dodgers lost the previous six World Series in which they trailed 3-2. They have won just one of their six championships at home, in 1963.

A heat wave over, the temperature dropped to 67 degrees at game time from 103 for last week's opener. The San Gabriel Mountains were occluded by heavy clouds.

Los Angelenos with a laid-back reputation were more energetic and on their feet for two-strike counts against Astros batters, a wave in Pantone 294 — also known as Dodger blue. Stadium organist Dieter Ruehle greeted the Astros with ""Hotel California"" for the start of batting practice, but there was an un-LA-like drizzle in the middle innings.

Verlander has 11 postseason wins but dropped to 0-4 in the Series with Detroit and Houston, which acquired him from the Tigers on Aug. 31 to win on nights like this.

The 2011 AL MVP and Cy Young Award winner, Verlander allowed just one baserunner before Austin Barnes singled leading off the sixth. Verlander bounced a pitch that hit Chase Utley on the front of his right foot, and Taylor sent a 97 mph fastball down the right-field line as Barnes came home. Seager followed with a sacrifice fly to the right-field warning track, a ball that likely would have landed in the pavilion in last week's hot air.

Verlander prevented more damage when Turner fouled out and the right-hander fanned Bellinger, who struck out four times for the second time in the Series.

Springer homered for the third straight game and fourth time in the Series, one shy of the record set by Reggie Jackson in 1977 and matched by Chase Utley in 2009. While it silenced the Dodger Stadium crowd, Astros fans erupted at a watch party in Minute Maid Park. Los Angeles has allowed home runs in all 14 of its postseason games.

Brian McCann singled leading off the fifth and Gonzalez doubled past Turner and down the left-field line. Hill struck out Josh Reddick and Verlander, and Springer was intentionally walked to load the bases.

Morrow relieved as the crowd booed manager Dave Roberts' decision, and Hill slapped at four cups of liquid in the dugout, sending them spraying against the wall. Appearing in his sixth straight Series game, Morrow got Bregman to ground to shortstop on his second pitch.

Watson walked Reddick leading off the seventh, Evan Gattis pinch hit for Verlander and Maeda relieved. Gattis bounced to shortstop, just beating Utley's throw from second to avoid a double play. Springer reached on an infield single that bounced off Seager's glove at shortstop and into left field, and Bregman's fly to deep center allowed pinch-runner Derek Fisher to tag up and advance to third, bringing up Altuve.

The society’s president, John Runions, told the Journal-Register that the box is “a great link” to Lincoln for the small community outside the state capitol of Springfield.

“Once I got it, I knew what it was, and my dad was the same way,” Terry Campbell said of the object. “He didn’t use it for anything. He kept it on a shelf. We knew what it was and that was just kind of a heirloom that sat there and we looked at it.”

In an exposé released by the Los Angeles Times, Munn, 37, said in 2004 she visited the set of Ratner’s movie “After the Sunset” and he exposed himself and masturbated in front of her during a short encounter in his trailer.

In 2010, the “X-Men: Apocalypse” actress wrote of the experience in her book “Suck It, Wonder Woman!” without naming Ratner. However, the director came forward and claimed he had sex with her.

“I used to date Olivia Munn, I will be honest with everybody here,” Ratner said. “I banged her a few times ... but I forgot her.""

Later, Ratner told Howard Stern that he lied about him and Munn having a sexual relationship.

Munn denied she and Ratner had a sexual relationship.

“I've made specific, conscientious choices not to work with Brett Ratner,” Munn told The Los Angeles Times.

“It feels as if I keep going up against the same bully at school who just won't quit,” she said. “You just hope that enough people believe the truth and for enough time to pass so that you can't be connected to him anymore.”

Other women spoke to The Los Angeles Times and said they were sexually harassed by Ratner. Actresses Jamie Ray Newman, Katharine Towne, Jorina King, Natasha Henstridge and model Eri Sasaki all spoke to the newspaper about Ratner.

Henstridge, 43, accused Ratner of forcing her to give him oral sex when she was 19 years old.

“He strong-armed me in a real way. He physically forced himself on me,” she told the Los Angeles Times. “At some point, I gave in and he did his thing.”

Newman, 39, said while she was on a plane with the “X-Men: The Last Stand” director in 2005, Ratner began explicitly describing “sexual acts he wanted to perform on her.”

“He was graphically describing giving me oral sex and how he was addicted to it,” Newman said.

“The Punisher” actress said the incident left her “shaken.”

Towne, 39, told the Times Ratner was “aggressive” toward her in 2005 at a party in an unnamed Hollywood star’s home.

Towne said Ratner followed her into the bathroom after she tried to escape his advances.

“He started to come on to me in a way that was so extreme,” Towne said. “I think it’s pretty aggressive to go in the bathroom with someone you don’t know and close the door.”

The “What Lies Beneath” actress said Ratner’s assistant contacted her for six months to try and set up a date. She declined the offers.

Sasaki said the director approached her while she was an extra on Ratner’s film “Rush Hour 2.” She said she was wearing a barely-there outfit for her part in the film when Ratner came by and “ran his index finger down her exposed midriff and asked her, “don’t you want to be famous?”

Sasaki said Ratner asked her later to go to the bathroom with him, offering her to be a star. She turned down his advances.

King, who also worked as extra on “Rush Hour 2,” said Ratner asked to see her breasts. The woman said she went to the bathroom to hide after rejecting his question.

“I figured if I could stay out of his eyesight, if I could stay away from him, he will forget about me and he will choose someone else, and that is exactly what happened,” King told the Los Angeles Times.

Kent Richards, who worked as a production assistant on “Rush Hour 2” confirmed Sasaki and King told him about their discomfort around Ratner. He said at least two more women complained to him about the director.

Ratner’s attorney, Martin Singer, denied the allegations made by the women. Singer said Henstridge was “upset after learning my client had a girlfriend who he would not leave for her.” The attorney dubbed King’s claims “absurd” and said Munn and Ratner “had an intimate relationship” despite Munn’s denial.

The Times reported Ratner was a friend of director James Toback, who has been accused by more than 300 women of sexual misconduct, and Roman Polanski, who fled the U.S. after he pled guilty to having sex with a 13 year-old girl in the 1970s, whom he plied with champagne and Quaaludes.

The Ratner accusations come after the bombshell allegations against Harvey Weinstein. Following the reports, a number of A-list Hollywood actors have spoken out about the sexual misconduct they experienced from stars including Weinstein, Toback and actors Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Piven.","Brett Ratner accused of sexual harassment by Olivia Munn, 5 others",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/01/brett-ratner-accused-sexual-harassment-by-olivia-munn-5-others.html

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.",Your planting guide for beautiful yellow daffodils,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/your-planting-guide-for-beautiful-yellow-daffodils.html

The teenager, who loved nothing more than writing and performing her own songs, believed that a radio tour would allow her to follow in the footsteps of her heroes like Patsy Cline, Linda Ronstadt, Martina McBride and all of the other female artists who came before her.

But Armiger told Fox News she would soon learn that the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry came with a hefty price.

Years before pop superstar Taylor Swift was groped by a radio DJ from Denver, Colo., Armiger says she was fending off a different handsy DJ while she was underage.

""I was at a radio station in Texas and was taking a promo photo with one of the on-air DJs after doing my performances and he grabbed my butt during the photo,"" Armiger told us. ""And at the same time he was whispering in my ear, 'When are you going to be legal?'""

Armiger told us she ""was shocked"" and ""terrified"" but had no one to lean on for support.

""I brought up my fears and I was told that's how it was and if I wanted to be in music, I'd have to get over it,"" she said.

Armiger decided to keep her mouth shut after that, but things came to a head in June 2016 when the singer was sued by her record label, Cold River, and filed a counterclaim alleging the label told her to ""sex it up"" in order to become successful.

According to the lawsuit, Armiger said she was asked to ""purchase 'hot, game-changing' clothes,"" ""hug, kiss and flirt"" with radio programmers. Armiger said she was told she needed to make the programmers ""wish you would take them home with you.""

Cold River Record head Pete O'Heeron told Fox News at the time the suit was ""baseless"" and ""an attempt to try and smear good people.""

Armiger said she can't comment on her battle with Cold River after a settlement was made, but said she now wants to share her stories of sexual harassment after hearing the bombshell sexual abuse allegations against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein that have rocked Hollywood.

""There's something really horrible going on behind the scenes,"" she told us, saying the country music community has its fair share of Weinstein-like behavior.

The now-26-year-old detailed several other stories of sexual harassment that she's encountered. Armiger recalled taking a radio programmer and his team to lunch when the program director asked everyone to share their ""top five list of women they would want to sleep with.""

After sharing his first choice, Armiger said a radio programmer turned to her, ""looking me in the eyes, he said, 'But you would absolutely be my No. 2.'""

Armiger said he then turned to her guitar player and said, ""Surely you've been f--king her. Where is she on your list?""

The guitar player suggested the group change the subject to something more appropriate, but Armiger said she still ""got flack"" for the exchange.

""The programmer called and said if I ever brought that guitar player back again he'd never play my music again,"" she recalled.

The singer said she was similarly rebuked after a radio DJ was interviewing her about her album ""Confessions of a Nice Girl"" at the 2010 ACM Awards.

""As we were doing the interview, he is trying to feel me up under the table -- this is on air -- trying to ask me whether or not my album title was true because surely I couldn't be a nice girl. I had to be a naughty girl,"" Armiger said.

When the DJ later asked her what her least favorite interview question was, Armiger was ""pissed"" and curtly said, ""The worst question is that you're asking me if I'm a nice girl or a naughty girl because what kind of person asks that?""

She said ""that didn't go over well"" and she learned ""not to talk back"" after that.

When Armiger filed her lawsuit against Cold River, she said many people in the country music world would not work with her anymore.

""When my story first became public and in the aftermath when I was finally to start looking for other opportunities in the industry, we went to [publishing houses] but we would be met with, 'We're not going to sign you, but we're really a big fan and we just want to know your story and how are you?'""

She continued, ""That was the consensus; that was everywhere I went. I would talk to booking agents and they were scared to work with me because they either thought somehow the tour would be canceled or I was a liability to work with.""

Armiger said she does not want to name her harassers out of fear of retribution, but she hopes coming forward with her story of harassment in the country music world will make a difference because ""it has to change.""

""I don't think it will change until people start speaking out, and for the most part they're too scared,"" she told us. ""Look at my story -- they'll see that I spoke out and spoke my truth and thought for the most part people would believe my story. I didn't ever think that it would be met with doubt or disdain.""",Katie Armiger says she was blacklisted from country music after sexual harassment allegations,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/katie-armiger-says-was-blacklisted-from-country-music-after-sexual-harassment-allegations.html

There are more than 150 types of HPV, and while certain strains can cause benign growths like warts, a limited number can cause cancer at different anatomical sites, including the mouth, throat, anus, cervis and penis.

Oral HPV is a sexually transmitted virus and can be contracted through oral sex with an infected person.

Who’s at risk?

Amongst men, those who have had many lifetime oral sexual partners have the greatest risk of carrying such high risk HPV strains. While the number of tobacco-related head and neck cancers have declined in the U. S. thanks to a growing awareness of smoking-related risks, the incidence of oral cancer in men is still growing as a result of HPV. This rise was most notable in men aged 50-59, and these trends are anticipated to increase over the next 40 years, making oropharyngeal cancer a significant health concern.

HPV and Cancer

While most high-risk HPV infections go away within 1-to-2 years, and do not cause cancer, certain HPV infections can persist for many years. Persistent infections with high-risk HPV types can lead to cancer. HPV is so common that nearly all men and women get it at some point in their lives and are asymptomatic and never know. In most individuals, their immune system clears the infection. However, in some people the virus lingers in certain tissues like the oropharynx.

Screening and Prevention

While it is possible to identify the virus by analyzing saliva, this test is not yet part of routine screening practice and is being predominantly used in research settings.

7 THINGS THAT MIGHT BE CAUSING YOUR INFERTILITY

HPV vaccination can reduce the risk of infection by the HPV types targeted by the vaccine. These vaccines provide strong protection against new HPV infections, but they are not effective at treating established HPV infections or disease caused by HPV. For them to be effective, individuals need to be vaccinated prior to being exposed to such viruses.

Currently the Gardasil vaccine is approved for use in in males and females ages 9 through 26. Given this age range, the vaccinations and discussions regarding the vaccine are largely being performed by pediatricians, primary care physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists.

Additionally, correct and consistent condom use may reduce HPV transmission between sexual partners. However, because areas not covered by a condom can be infected by the virus, condoms are unlikely to provide complete protection against the infection.

In regards to cancer, there are oral cancer screening programs available and while there are no current treatments for the HPV virus itself, there are a number of excellent curative treatment options for HPV-related oral cancer such as surgery and/or radiation-based treatments depending on the site, stage and health of the patient. Chemotherapy may added to radiation treatment in more advanced cases. HPV related oral cancers have a very favorable prognosis with modern treatments.

Both collisions were “avoidable” according to the report released Wednesday morning, the official said.

""Both of these accidents were preventable and the respective investigations found multiple failures by watch standers that contributed to the incidents,"" Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson said. ""We must do better.""

The guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with a large container ship on June 17 off the coast of Japan killing seven sailors. Already the captain, the second-in-command and the top senior enlisted sailor have been relieved of their duties.

According to the International Rules of the Road for vessels on the high seas, USS Fitzgerald was in a crossing situation with the cargo ship, Crystal off to Fitzgerald’s starboard or right side. Fitzgerald was required to maneuver, but did not until it was too late.

“In the 30 minutes leading up to the collision, neither Fitzgerald nor Crystal took such action to reduce the risk of collision until approximately one minute prior to the collision,” the report said.

Fitzgerald’s Officer of the Deck “intended to take no action” in the minutes leading up to the collision until realizing it was “too late,” the report said.

“The Officer of the Deck, the person responsible for safe navigation of the ship, exhibited poor seamanship by failing to maneuver as required, failing to sound the danger signal and failing to attempt to contact CRYSTAL on Bridge to Bridge radio. In addition, the Officer of the Deck did not call the Commanding Officer as appropriate and prescribed by Navy procedures to allow him to exercise more senior oversight and judgment of the situation,” the report said.

REPORT: TWO NAVY SEALS EYED IN STRANGULATION OF GREEN BERET IN MALI

In late August, another guided-missile destroyer, USS John S. McCain, collided with a merchant vessel, this time an oil tanker near Singapore. Ten American sailors drowned when their berthing spaces flooded.

Before the deadly collision, the bridge team aboard McCain became distracted by a false alarm signaling the warship had lost steering, according to an official briefed on the report.

“It made a bad situation worse,” the official said, adding the destroyer was in a busy shipping lane at the time of the collision.

""We are a Navy that learns from mistakes and the Navy is firmly committed to doing everything possible to prevent an accident like this from happening again,"" Richardson said. ""We must never allow an accident like this to take the lives of such magnificent young sailors and inflict such painful grief on their families and the nation.""

Both McCain’s commanding officer and the executive officer, the second in command, were relieved of command earlier this month.

The USS John S. McCain is named after Sen. John McCain’s father and grandfather, both admirals in the Navy.

In September, the top two officers of the Navy’s Japan-based 7th Fleet – where both warships were based -- were fired.

The Navy is currently without two warships capable of shooting down North Korean ballistic missiles, with the loss of McCain and Fitzgerald.

A second and more “comprehensive” investigation into a string of mishaps this year -- including a Navy warship running aground in Tokyo Bay in late January and spilling over 1,000 gallons of hydraulic fluid into Japanese waters -- is expected Thursday.

Lt. Steven Arango was attending Bates College in Maine, when he read a New York Times article that inspired him.

The article profiled Captain George Whitney, 38, a Bates College alumnus and a C.I.A paramilitary officer who was killed in December in Afghanistan.

“After I read about him, I knew right away that Bates needed to honor him,” Arango said to ConnectingVets.com.

Whitney excelled both academically and athletically at Bates College; he graduated cum laude after playing football as the starting fullback. After college, Whitney joined the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, serving in Anbar, Iraq. He then joined the C.I.A, but was killed in action during an operation in Afghanistan.

Whitney, along with two others, was awarded stars from the C.I.A for dying in the line of duty.

“He epitomized selfless service and gave his life in protection of our country,” Arango said. “Simply put, he’s a hero.”

Inspired by Whitney’s heroism, Arango petitioned Bates College to honor his legacy.

Arango decided that a sculpted bust would be the perfect tribute to Whitney, and contracted the help of retired USMC Colonel and Alabama artist Lee Busby.

Also a University of Alabama graduate, Busby sculpts Alabamians who have been killed in Iraq of Afghanistan.

""I'm no Michelangelo, but I know the world that these people operate in, and I know what they went through,” Busby told Southern Living. “And, I do have some ability to sculpt. So, that's what I want to do.""

Now, Busby is nearly halfway done with the bust of Whitney and is ready to sculpt the finishing touches.

“We are flying Caryn Whitney into Tuscaloosa to put the final touches on the bust,” Arango said. “We want to make sure the likeness is exactly of her son.”

Busby expects to complete the sculpture by December, which then will be used for pouring — the process used to make a bronze bust.

Arango is funding this project completely alone, and hopes that Bates College can provide space for the memorial.

“I just want Captain Whitney to be honored,” Arango said. “For the next 100, 200 years with Bates students walking next to him and seeing him? I promise you Bates will turn out even better students than they are now.”

Copyright © Eric Metaxas, 2017.","Editor's note: The following is an excerpt from Eric Metaxas' new book, ""MARTIN LUTHER: The Man Who Rediscovered God and Changed the World.""

One of the greatest challenges in telling the story of Martin Luther is distancing him from the endless fables, myths, and tall tales told about him in the last five centuries.

During his lifetime, Luther’s celebrity grew at such a pace that the momentum of it could not be slowed even by his death. In fact, the magma of his celebrity soon cooled into hagiographic stone, such that much of what the world has come to “know” about him is fiction. The most well-known ”facts“ of his life illustrate the point.

First, he was born into a family of peasants, the poor son of a miner who was raised in a home humble and cramped; second, his hardscrabble upbringing was a brutal one in which his dour working-class father buffeted him so viciously that it warped his psyche, causing him to see God the Father as a similarly glowering and sadistic figure to be placated and assuaged in endlessly humiliating religious contortions—or to be avoided entirely.

Third, it was a literal bolt of fire from the heavens that caused the jumpy twenty-one-year-old suddenly to blurt out a binding vow—one he had never previously considered but that in his abject fear he indeed spoke—and then felt duty bound to honor the rest of his born days, thus leading him to become a monk.

Fourth, it was on a trip to Rome that he was so shocked at the blasphemous devilry of that vile city that he decided he must destroy the soft and decadent Italian church and remake it in his own uncompromising and upright German image.

Fifth, he began this lifelong project by angrily and defiantly hammering his damning accusations against Rome onto the very door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, thus putting the quivering pope on notice that his deeds had been weighed in the balance and found wanting.

Sixth, after his great stand at the Diet of Worms—where he said, “Here I stand. I can do no other!”—he fled to the Wartburg, where in his overflowing umbrage he took on the devil personally and at least once punctuated his fury by hurling a pot of ink at the fiend who dared to trespass his quarters. Indeed, anyone who doubts this need only go to the Wartburg to see the swart blots themselves, still staining the wall of his cell these five centuries later.

Seventh, the nun he married escaped from her nunnery by hiding inside a large barrel that had only just been emptied of herring. In fact, all of the twelve nuns hid in filthy herring barrels secured to the wagon that hurtled them away to freedom.

These important details have been recounted innumerable times and are being confidently recounted this minute, told in tours of Luther sites around Germany in many languages, being written and read in otherwise excellent books about Luther, and posted in online articles and blogs. But not a single one of these seven things is true. They are each sloppy glosses on the actual facts and have over time congealed and finally ossified into the marmoreal narrative that has existed for half a millennium.

Parson Weems’s pious legends of Washington chopping down cherry trees and casting silver dollars across the wide Potomac persisted for about 150 years, but these false details about Luther have persisted for more than three times as long.

Their cultural roots are therefore that much deeper. It is my hope that ""Martin Luther"" will do its humble part in uprooting them.

Let’s focus on the latter, better known as the last ""deal zone"" of the year.

When is this year's final deal zone?

The last deal zone of the year is always centered around the first two weeks of December, starting just after Thanksgiving travelers return home and continuing up until about Dec. 15. It’s a slow period, so airlines are forced to discount fares to fill their planes.

In other words, buy tickets now for a cheap flight shortly after now and start flying shortly after Turkey Day.

RELATED: 5 EXPERT TIPS FOR GETTING THROUGHT THE AIRPORT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

How cheap is this deal zone?

See for yourself in the examples below; all are round-trip fares for travel in early to mid-December, and all were found on FareCompare earlier this week. (But remember, fares can and do change without notice).

Boston to Tampa $86; to Paris $336

Chicago to London, $353

Dallas to Los Angeles $83

Los Angeles to Denver $79; to Rome $442

New York to Ft. Lauderdale $89; to Amsterdam $360

Why is travel slow during this deal zone?

Logistics, for one thing. The deal zone is sandwiched between two very popular times to fly (Thanksgiving and Christmas/New Year’s), and most people are saving their precious vacation time for the holidays. If you can spare the time, you can celebrate with a fantastic trip for very little money.

HERE'S EXACTLY WHAT TO DO IF YOUR FLIGHT IS CANCELED OR DELAYED

And I can find these deals easily?

Look for a deal-finding tool that locates the best fares from your hometown in a specific month or season; FareCompare is one, but there are others. A word of warning, though: You will have to be flexible on travel dates, because many of the very cheapest deals are for flights on weekdays.

What if you’re not a flexible flyer?

Try flying one weekday and one weekend day (for U.S. flights, Saturdays are generally the cheaper of the two). Even if you don’t get the very cheapest prices, you’ll still save over most of the fares taking effect just a couple of weeks later.

But is it actually Facebook that’s making us unhappy?
Social media, and Facebook in particular, don’t invent things for you to get mad about, they only amplify what is already pissing you off.
The “social media is making your miserable” experiments can’t quantify how much other things might make you miserable as well.
Social media, and Facebook in particular, don’t invent things for you to get mad about, they only amplify what is already pissing you off.","Is social media making us miserable? Study after study seems to confirm the increasingly common grumbling you hear — that the more time we spend on the platforms, the worse we feel about our lives.

The latest, by Holly Shakya from the University of California and Nicholas Christakis from Yale University, actually quantifies our misery. They found that there was as much as an 8 percent drop in personal happiness after using Facebook.

But is it actually Facebook that’s making us unhappy? There are a couple major flaws in this argument.

The first, and perhaps more obvious one, is that Facebook and other social-media platforms like Twitter or Instagram are reflections of our input. They don’t generate content to show us without our participation. We choose what we see.

Social media, and Facebook in particular, don’t invent things for you to get mad about, they only amplify what is already pissing you off.

On Facebook, we generally friend people we know “in real life.” Those people then show us what they had for dinner, post pictures of their kids and pets, share their political opinions and their selfies from vacation.

If that makes you feel unhappy, Facebook gives you a range of options. If seeing magical sunsets from your friend’s trip to Barbados induces rage, it lets you click “Hide Post-See fewer posts like this.”

If your friend has become a political automaton in the wake of an election but you hope they’ll eventually mellow, you can choose the “Pause friend for 30 days” option.

If you’re struggling to get pregnant, or recently got divorced, and your friend’s pictures of snuggling with her husband or kids upsets you, you can pick “Unfollow friend.” That’s the “mute” option on Facebook.

Your friend won’t know they’ve been silenced and you won’t be unfriending them. You can always unmute if circumstances change.

In fact, Facebook is the social network that most lets you tailor your experience to get what you want out of it. Of course your friends will annoy you on Facebook, as they might in real life, but only on Facebook do you have the ability to shush them for a little while or forever.

But that gets at what Facebook can’t do: Screen your daily real-life interactions.

In short, it’s not Facebook, it’s you. The “social media is making your miserable” experiments can’t quantify how much other things might make you miserable as well.

They’re not with you on the subway when you read an op-ed that makes you fume. They don’t see your eye-roll when you catch up with a friend over coffee and you end up listening to a half-hour infomercial on all the great things happening in your friend’s life.

Social media, and Facebook in particular, don’t invent things for you to get mad about, they only amplify what is already pissing you off.

And that leads us to the other flaw in these Facebook-makes-you-unhappy studies: People are already angrier than they used to be, creating a chicken-and-egg conundrum. If you poll angry people, it’s likely the interactions that boil their broth will have a lot of overlap with their daily routine.

That daily routine, by the way, includes lots of things that constitute an improvement over the daily lives of previous generations. Even though life expectancy has increased and quality of life continues to improve across the world, we’re angrier and sadder than ever before.

A 2015 study by Ryne Sherman, Sonja Lyubomirsky and Jean M. Twenge in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science found that while contentment used to come with age, our older people are no longer happy.

We can’t blame that on Facebook.

In a piece for Quartz last April, economist Allison Schrager posited that our expectations are too high.

Schrager writes, “Research by British neuroscientists argues that happiness requires more than things simply going well; people also must get more than they expect. So even if we have more than ever before—good health, leisure time, consumer goods—we have even grander expectations.”

That’s where the change needs to start. If social media is making you feel like you should be in a bikini on a yacht instead of under the fluorescent lights at work, hunched over your computer, it might not be the worst idea to give it a break. Filter your expectations and you might find you need to filter your interactions a lot less.

“Even though #Viacom fired me today they couldn’t help but to exploit myself & my daughter for their promotional gain — Viacom let me go because as a Business Mogul I act like an adult and [partake] in adult promotions and activities that other adults do for FREE or in private!” Abraham wrote in the message.

Like the attacks in these cities, the Halloween attack in Lower Manhattan was aimed at inflicting maximum carnage.
NYPD officers showed up in force minutes after the attack began, shooting Saipov before he could kill even more New Yorkers.
They were unable to prevent the Halloween attack.","Editor's note: The following column first appeared in City Journal, a publication of the Manhattan Institute.

The Halloween assault in Lower Manhattan was straight out of the ISIS playbook. Ever since October 2010, when Al Qaeda published the second issue of its online magazine Inspire, jihadi leaders have been urging the faithful to turn ordinary cars and trucks into killing machines to “mow down the enemies of Allah.”

On Tuesday in New York, Sayfullo Saipov, 29, a green-card holder from Uzbekistan in Central Asia and resident of Florida, responded to the call.

He drove his rented Home Depot truck from West Houston Street onto a Hudson River Park bike path, one of New York’s most beloved amenities. Within ten minutes, eight people were killed and 15 were injured. A note found in the truck, law enforcement officials said, indicated that Saipov committed the attack out of devotion to ISIS.

Saipov might have killed even more people had the NYPD not been the nation’s premier counterterrorism force. NYPD officers showed up in force minutes after the attack began, shooting Saipov before he could kill even more New Yorkers.

At a news conference at 1 Police Plaza less than two hours after the deadly attack, John Miller, the New York Police Department’s chief of counterterrorism, cited the Islamic State’s updated guidance to jihadi aspirants contained in the third November 2016 issue of its own online journal, Rumiya (Rome), as the attacker’s probable inspiration. The article encouraged followers to attack “large outdoor conventions and celebrations, pedestrian-congested streets, outdoor markets, festivals, festivals, parades, [and] political rallies.” It even specified the ideal type, weight, and speed of a car needed for terror purposes, according to a translation provided by the Counter-Extremism Project.

It seems likely that the killer’s original target may have been the famous Greenwich Village Halloween parade, another beloved New York tradition that close to 1 million people typically attend. But the NYPD’s overwhelming security presence, and the numerous street closures adjacent to the parade, may have dashed his dreams of an even more memorable massacre.

While the attack investigation is ongoing and details of Saipov’s motives and plans are still being gathered, the vehicle assault bore the hallmarks of the attacks that ISIS and other militant jihadi groups have long been promoting. NYPD commissioner James O’Neill said that the terrorist emerged from his rental vehicle after crashing into a school bus screaming a statement that indicated terrorist intent. While the politically attuned O’Neill declined to identify what the attacker shouted, the language in which he was shouting, or his suspected nationality, numerous eye witnesses said that the man, dressed in dark clothing and carrying a pellet gun and a paint-ball gun, was screaming “Allahu Akhbar”—“God is Great” in Arabic.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo pointed out another hallmark of a vehicle assault. The perp, he said, was one of those “lone wolves” who “meant to cause pain and harm and probably death and the resulting terror.”

But it takes a pack to raise a lone wolf. Even if Saipov acted alone, he was part of a growing ideological fraternity numbering in the tens of thousands who now inhabit every region of the globe.

Those seeking eternal glory have staged similar attacks in at least a dozen other cities—from Nice to Paris to Barcelona to London to Jerusalem.

Like the attacks in these cities, the Halloween attack in Lower Manhattan was aimed at inflicting maximum carnage. Schools in the area were letting out students shortly after three o’clock when Saipov drove his rented truck off West Houston Street onto the bike path.

There was no shortage of targets. The streets between West Houston and Chambers were crowded with parents picking up their costumed children prepared for an evening of trick-or-treating. Pedestrians and bikers on the Hudson River bike path were stunned and helpless as Saipov careened his weapon through the crowd.

With the collapse of its self-declared “caliphate” in Syria and Iraq, ISIS is on the run. So are its adherents. But as the extremists disperse, the terrorist threat, paradoxically, increases. American and other intelligence agencies have long warned of a likely rise in vehicle and other attacks as the frustrated, furious faithful are forced to reorient their campaign. In May 2017, the U.S. Transportation and Security Agency (TSA) warned truck and bus companies to be on guard for suspicious individuals seeking to rent vehicles.

According to TSA data, Islamist terrorists have carried out more than a dozen vehicular assaults since 2014 that have killed more than 170 people. Such attacks are ever more likely, the TSA memo warned, since “unsophisticated tactics such as vehicle-ramming” are hard to prevent and capable of inflicting “mass casualties if successful.”

Saipov might have killed even more people had the NYPD not been the nation’s premier counterterrorism force. NYPD officers showed up in force minutes after the attack began, shooting Saipov before he could kill even more New Yorkers.

The NYPD, in fact, was already responding to the vehicular threat long before this type of terror became the focus of federal concern.

At Tuesday’s press conference, Miller discussed the department’s SHIELD program, which has sent officers to brief some 20,000 businesses in the private sector about the growing terrorist threat post–9/11.

Miller noted that after Rumiya reissued its call for vehicular attacks and suggested an assault on the Thanksgiving Day parade, the NYPD visited over 148 truck rental offices in the metropolitan area asking employees to watch for “suspicious indicators.” The police department conducted repeated visits in person and by phone, he said.

Even more essential has been the NYPD’s intelligence division, which has long collected information about suspicious individuals. After being heavily, and in many instances unfairly, criticized for allegedly violating civil liberties, Miller’s former boss, William Bratton, shut down a particularly controversial program that the intelligence unit had run early in its existence—a so-called “demographic unit” that collected information on the location and activities of Muslims suspected of terrorist intentions.

Another critic was New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who lambasted the NYPD for surveilling New Jersey-based Muslims and asked whether the spying was “borne out of arrogance, or out of paranoia, or out of both.” Unconfirmed news reports Tuesday night indicated that Saipov had lived for some time in Paterson, New Jersey.

But the NYPD has not scaled back most of its vital surveillance activities. In fact, New York’s Finest, working in tandem with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies that comprise the Joint Terrorism Task Force, have continued collecting information on suspected terrorists living in and visiting the city.

They were unable to prevent the Halloween attack. The so-called “flash-to-bang” trajectory of lone-wolf radicalization is accelerating. An individual intent on mayhem against “soft” targets is the toughest law enforcement terrorist challenge.

Eight people were killed Tuesday. But the toll could have been much higher had the police not responded so quickly and New Yorkers not been so stubbornly resilient.

Concluding his remarks Tuesday, Governor Cuomo issued his own call to arms. “We’re not going to let them win,” he said. “And if we change our lives, we contort ourselves to them, then they win and we lose.”

Three and a half hours after Saipov’s wicked rampage, hundreds of thousands of costumed New Yorkers poured into the streets to celebrate Halloween, as planned. Paradoxically, Saipov’s perverse mission failed: New Yorkers were not cowed, and he was denied the martyrdom that he was clearly seeking.

Shot in the stomach, Saipov will probably live to be brought to justice, not far from the scene of his heinous crime.

When Vice president Lyndon Baines Johnson accompanied President John F. Kennedy to Dallas in November of 1963, Johnson's long political career seemed to be over. With rumors abounding that Kennedy was going to drop him from the ticket in the upcoming 1964 election, Johnson had resigned himself to returning to a quiet life on his Texas ranch.

On Wednesday, the 100-year-old veteran got his recognition and finally his money, too.

Almeda received the Congressional Gold Medal, the nation's highest civilian honor. Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin also announced at a Capitol ceremony that Almeda was getting a check, 72 years after the war ended.

Shulkin's announcement drew gasps from some of the hundreds in attendance at the Gold Medal ceremony, which House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., acknowledged was ""long, long overdue.""

Almeda, dressed in his military cap, told the crowd he was glad to be able to accept the medal, noting that ""many have passed away waiting for 75 years for this time to come.""

Almeda said he and other Filipino veterans have long ""felt unrecognized for fighting for our country,"" adding, ""I wondered why"" since he and his fellow soldiers had brought ""victory during a long war in the Philippines.""

The gold medal signified that his service — and that of thousands of other Filipino veterans — is recognized, Almeda said, calling himself a warrior who ""will never quit.""

Almeda was a 24-year-old teacher when he joined the Philippine Commonwealth Army in 1941. After the war, he resumed his career as a teacher and was granted U.S. citizenship in the 1990s. In 2003, he began receiving medical benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs under a law aimed at Filipino veterans.

But Almeda, now 100 and living outside Washington, has been fighting for nearly a decade to receive a $15,000 lump-sum payment promised to Filipino veterans under the 2009 economic stimulus law.

Almeda was among more than 250,000 Filipino soldiers who served alongside U.S. soldiers in World War II, including more than 57,000 who died. After the war ended, President Harry S. Truman signed laws that stripped away promises of benefits and citizenship for Filipino veterans.

Only recently have the veterans won back some concessions and acknowledgment, including the gold medal.

Ryan said the Capitol ceremony was more than ""a feel-good story of delayed recognition. We are here to immortalize the legacy of great liberators, who have paved the way for generations to follow.""

The ceremony — and the gold medals — should ""serve to ensure that those who fought for freedom are never forgotten, and always remembered,"" Ryan said.

Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said Filipino veterans enlisted for World War II ""knowing full well that the enemy could discover who they were and retaliate against their families.""

Even after their service ""was practically erased from American records ... these veterans never gave up,"" Hirono said. ""They organized and fought for what they had earned.""

In 1990, Congress awarded U.S. citizenship to thousands of Filipino veterans and later extended VA benefits to them. The 2009 stimulus law authorized the lump-sum payments, although in some cases missing or poor records blocked the payments from being made.

""After bravely serving our country, it is frankly shameful that these veterans had to fight so hard for what they were promised,"" Hirono said.

Today, only 18,000 Filipino veterans are still alive.

In 2010, the “X-Men: Apocalypse” actress wrote of the experience in her book “Suck It, Wonder Woman!” without naming Ratner. However, the director came forward and claimed he had sex with her.

“I used to date Olivia Munn, I will be honest with everybody here,” Ratner said. “I banged her a few times ... but I forgot her.""

Later, Ratner told Howard Stern that he lied about him and Munn having a sexual relationship.

Munn denied she and Ratner had a sexual relationship.

“I've made specific, conscientious choices not to work with Brett Ratner,” Munn told The Los Angeles Times.

“It feels as if I keep going up against the same bully at school who just won't quit,” she said. “You just hope that enough people believe the truth and for enough time to pass so that you can't be connected to him anymore.”

Other women spoke to The Los Angeles Times and said they were sexually harassed by Ratner. Actresses Jamie Ray Newman, Katharine Towne, Jorina King, Natasha Henstridge and model Eri Sasaki all spoke to the newspaper about Ratner.

Henstridge, 43, accused Ratner of forcing her to give him oral sex when she was 19 years old.

“He strong-armed me in a real way. He physically forced himself on me,” she told the Los Angeles Times. “At some point, I gave in and he did his thing.”

Newman, 39, said while she was on a plane with the “X-Men: The Last Stand” director in 2005, Ratner began explicitly describing “sexual acts he wanted to perform on her.”

“He was graphically describing giving me oral sex and how he was addicted to it,” Newman said.

“The Punisher” actress said the incident left her “shaken.”

Towne, 39, told the Times Ratner was “aggressive” toward her in 2005 at a party in an unnamed Hollywood star’s home.

Towne said Ratner followed her into the bathroom after she tried to escape his advances.

“He started to come on to me in a way that was so extreme,” Towne said. “I think it’s pretty aggressive to go in the bathroom with someone you don’t know and close the door.”

The “What Lies Beneath” actress said Ratner’s assistant contacted her for six months to try and set up a date. She declined the offers.

Sasaki said the director approached her while she was an extra on Ratner’s film “Rush Hour 2.” She said she was wearing a barely-there outfit for her part in the film when Ratner came by and “ran his index finger down her exposed midriff and asked her, “don’t you want to be famous?”

Sasaki said Ratner asked her later to go to the bathroom with him, offering her to be a star. She turned down his advances.

King, who also worked as extra on “Rush Hour 2,” said Ratner asked to see her breasts. The woman said she went to the bathroom to hide after rejecting his question.

“I figured if I could stay out of his eyesight, if I could stay away from him, he will forget about me and he will choose someone else, and that is exactly what happened,” King told the Los Angeles Times.

Kent Richards, who worked as a production assistant on “Rush Hour 2” confirmed Sasaki and King told him about their discomfort around Ratner. He said at least two more women complained to him about the director.

Ratner’s attorney, Martin Singer, denied the allegations made by the women. Singer said Henstridge was “upset after learning my client had a girlfriend who he would not leave for her.” The attorney dubbed King’s claims “absurd” and said Munn and Ratner “had an intimate relationship” despite Munn’s denial.

The Ratner accusations come after the bombshell allegations against Harvey Weinstein. Following the reports, a number of A-list Hollywood actors have spoken out about the sexual misconduct they experienced from stars including Weinstein, Toback and actors Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Piven.","Brett Ratner accused of sexual harassment by Olivia Munn, 5 others",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/01/brett-ratner-accused-sexual-harassment-by-olivia-munn-5-others.html

Just one day after pleading not guilty to a 12-count indictment, Paul Manafort was described as a major flight risk by prosecutors because of his wealth and international connections.

According to court documents unsealed Tuesday, prosecutors say they believe Manafort -- a former chairman of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign -- and his business associate Richard Gates were at risk of fleeing.

“The defendants pose a risk of flight based on the serious nature of the charges, their history of deceptive and misleading conduct, the potentially significant sentences the defendants face, the strong evidence of guilt, their significant financial resources, and their foreign connections,” the court documents read.

Manafort is known to have a significant amount of wealth. Between 2012 and 2016, he listed his assets to be between $19 million and $136 million, the New York Daily News reported.

“His financial holdings are substantial, if difficult to quantify precisely,” Tuesday’s documents revealed.

The 68-year-old was also being considered a flight risk because of his foreign connections. The Washington Post reported that Manafort keeps three U.S. passports and has submitted 10 passport applications in recent years.

Prosecutors note in the documents that Manafort also has wealthy ties to Moscow and to Kiev, Ukraine, through his previous business dealings. His travel schedule in the last year reveals the many connections Manafort has overseas, increasing the possibility of flight, prosecutors said.

Monday was not a good day for President Trump, but it was an even worse day for Hillary Clinton.

Indictments handed down by Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged Trump’s former campaign chair Paul Manafort and close associate Rick Gates with a slew of white collar crimes, including failure to register as a foreign agent, tax evasion and money laundering, an embarrassment to the president. But, some have described the indictments as weak, since they focus on Manafort making false FARA filings, or not registering as a foreign agent, a charge brought by the government only six times since 1966, and which resulted in only one conviction. Enforcement of the FARA law is generally not rigorous.

More important, there was no mention of Russia, or of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Hillary needs Mueller to connect those dots.

Also released Monday was news that a Trump campaign volunteer, George Papadopoulos pled guilty Oct. 5 to lying to federal agents. Papadopoulos was brought aboard the campaign as an expert on Greece, but promoted various unsuccessful attempts to set up a meeting between Donald Trump and Putin.

Third-grader Lealond Henderson has spent the first half of this year as the number one ranked mini-bareback rider in the world. But being on top of the Pee Wee Division has come with some hard hits -- even mild concussions.

“And I had a big ol’ rainbow across my head where a horse kicked me when I landed on my hands and knees,” Henderson told FOX4 News.

The 9-year-old is one of the lightest riders in the Pee-Wee division, weighing in at 55 pounds.

""He has a natural talent to do what he's doing,” his dad Jimmy Henderson, told FOX4. “And he's been good at it ever since he's 3 years old.""

His parents said they plan to go as far with the riding as their son chooses.

""Because there are moments where he wants his Mom, so that's a good feeling too,” said his mother, Deborah Henderson. “But I know he's got it covered.”

While the 9-year-old's rank has slipped to second in the world in the past few weeks, he aims to regain the top spot in Las Vegas in December.

Terror came back to New York City Tuesday. After killing at least eight people and injuring nearly a score with a truck, a man jumped out yelling, as always, “Allahu Akbar (God is great).”

What this attack had in common with similar truck murders in Europe is that it happened in a place normally filled with everyday life. Almost a mile north of the World Trade Center, the bike path is usually filled with walkers, cyclists, joggers and skateboarders.

Suddenly it was strewn with broken bodies, as this year in Las Ramblas in Barcelona, London Bridge and Stockholm, and in 2016 on Bastille Day in Nice and at a Berlin Christmas market. History will remember Islamic State and its offshoots and long-distance recruits mainly for their homicidal cowardice.
