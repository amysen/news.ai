The 31-year-old Bergdahl faces a possible sentence of life in prison after pleading guilty last month to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. His defense this week has called a lineup of witnesses, including coworkers and military medical experts, in an effort to persuade a military judge not to send him to prison.

Lieutenant Colonel Allen Larsen, a battalion surgeon who has examined the Idaho native, testified on Tuesday that Bergdahl suffers nerve damage. He attributed it to a poor diet fed to him by his Taliban captors during his years of imprisonment, as well as torture in which lit matches were held to the soles of his feet.

Larsen described the damage as akin to that seen in U.S. soldiers held as Japanese prisoners of war during World War Two. He said Bergdahl will likely continue to feel some pain in his feet for the rest of his life.

“I think his pain is as good as it’s going to get, and it’s going to remain that way,” Larsen said by telephone from Afghanistan.

Bergdahl’s lawyers are due to call three more witnesses on Wednesday. After their testimony concludes, the judge in the case, Army Colonel Jeffery Nance, will begin deliberating his sentence.

Bergdahl was released in a 2014 Taliban prisoner swap brokered by Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration.

During last year’s presidential campaign, Republican candidate Donald Trump called Bergdahl “a no-good traitor who should have been executed.” Nance has ruled that the comments by Trump, now president and commander in chief, had not affected the fairness of the court proceeding, but said he will consider them a mitigating factor.

Prosecutors last week called multiple witnesses, including service members who described the hazards they faced in multiple hastily organized missions to rescue Bergdahl. Several were badly injured, including Master Sergeant Mark Allen, who was shot in the head, leaving him unable to speak or walk.

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

General Motors Co (GM.N) reported an overall sales drop of 2.2 percent for the month, with consumer sales down 6.6 percent. High-margin pickup truck, SUV and crossover sales were all up at the largest U.S. automaker.

GM reduced its inventory of unsold vehicles in the month by 7,000 vehicles to 813,000. The automaker has been whittling away at its large volume of unsold vehicles, a source of concern for the market. GM had advised that its inventory would rise in October.

“We are heading into the fourth quarter with good momentum, thanks to a strong U.S. economy and very strong pickup and crossover sales,” GM’s vice president for U.S. sales operations, Kurt McNeil, said in a statement.

GM slightly reduced consumer discounts as a percentage of the average transaction price, to 13.5 percent from 13.7 percent in the third quarter.

Industry experts believe consumer discounts in excess of 10 percent of the average transaction price are unhealthy for the market as they erode resale values and are unsustainable in the long term.

Industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC said last week that based on preliminary sales numbers including October, discounts have exceeded 10 percent in 15 of the last 16 months.

The U.S. auto industry is coming off a strong run that culminated in record sales of 17.55 million units in 2016. New sales got a strong lift in September as consumers replaced vehicles damaged in southeast Texas by Hurricane Harvey the previous month.

Full-year 2017 sales are still expected to be down slightly versus 2016.

Ford Motor Co (F.N) posted a 6.2 percent gain in vehicle sales in October, driven largely by a 15.9 percent jump in sales of its popular, high-priced F-Series line of pickups. Strong demand pushed the average price tag for an F-Series truck up $4,000 from the previous October to $47,300.

High-margin pickup trucks were a dominant factor in the better-than-expected results Ford posted last week.

On a conference call, Ford’s U.S. sales chief, Mark LaNeve, said the upgraded F-Series line “really has been a spectacular success” and said the market would remain “competitive” through the end of 2017 and into 2018.

Ford’s low-margin fleet sales rose 14.6 percent in October.

Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) said its sales rose 5.2 percent in October, as strong pickup truck and SUV sales offset a 12.7 drop in Toyota sedans and a 27.9 percent decrease in luxury Lexus sedans.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (FCHA.MI)(FCAU.N) reported a 13 percent sales decline. The automaker’s sales to consumers were down 4 percent, while fleet sales slid 43 percent, in line with the company’s strategy to reduce low-margin sales to car rental agencies.

FCA has pushed to sell more profitable SUVs and pickup trucks, which helped lift its North American profit margin to 8.3 percent in the third quarter.

Nissan Motor Co Ltd’s (7201.T) sales increased 8.4 percent for the month, driven by a 12.9 percent jump in pickups, SUV and crossover sales. Sales of its popular Rogue crossover model soared 43 percent in October.

But sales at Nissan’s luxury Infiniti brand fell 8.1 percent, driven largely by a 16.2 percent drop in luxury sedan sales.

The move is a major step towards a return to direct rule from London, which many fear would destabilize the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland.

It also creates a major headache for British Prime Minister Theresa May as she negotiates Britain’s exit from the European Union.

Irish Nationalists Sinn Fein and the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party have shared power in Northern Ireland for a decade under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement, which ended three decades of violence in which 3,600 died.

But Sinn Fein pulled out in January, complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner. The latest round of talks on re-establishing the devolved executive collapsed in failure on Wednesday.

“Sinn Fein is disappointed that the last few weeks of negotiations have ended in failure,” Sinn Fein’s leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O‘Neill, told journalists.

Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said the party was open to dialogue, but only it was meaningful.

Britain’s minister for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire said as there was no immediate prospect of a new executive being formed that he had no choice but to start the process of setting a budget directly from London to ensure funding for essential services.

“This can’t simply continue forever and a day ... There are decisions that have been stored up that have to be taken,” he told journalists.

The budget process could be handed back if agreement is reached between the two parties, he added.

IRISH ROLE?

In a bid to put pressure on the politicians, Brokenshire said he would take advice as to whether the salaries of the deputies in the Northern Ireland devolved parliament should be cut while there is no executive.

He said such a move would require legislation in the British parliament at Westminster.

The budget move also revives the question of what role the government of the neighboring Republic of Ireland should have in the governance of Northern Ireland if power-sharing collapses.

Dublin argues that under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement it should have a role in the direct running of the region, which borders Ireland, if power-sharing breaks down.

Foreign Minister Simon Coveney in September said “there can be no British-only direct rule,” which prompted a British government spokesman to say Britain would “never countenance” joint authority.

Sinn Fein on Wednesday called on Ireland to play a role, saying the British and Irish governments should together “act urgently to deliver equality” in Northern Ireland.

Coveney on Wednesday said the collapse of talks was “regrettable and deeply concerning” and that direct rule could complicate relations with London at a time when it is trying to negotiate favorable terms of Britain’s exit from the European Union.

“The prospect of direct rule in Northern Ireland and the Irish government’s insistence on having a role in that - an appropriate role consistent with the Good Friday Agreement - is not where we want to be,” he told RTE radio.",London to set Northern Ireland budget in move towards direct rule,https://www.reuters.com/article/nireland-politics/london-to-set-northern-ireland-budget-in-move-towards-direct-rule-idINKBN1D14XT?il=0

The company added about 154,000 subscribers to various websites, including the digital version of the New York Times, boosting its online subscribers base to 2.5 million.

Digital advertising revenue rose 11 percent to $49.2 million in the third quarter, accounting for about 43 percent of its total advertising revenue.

The newspaper publisher has been attracting more paying online readers through discounts and has been boosting digital subscriptions by tying up with online services such as Spotify.

The Times’ Truth campaign, which was launched in response to President Donald Trump’s attacks on the newspaper, has also helped drive subscriptions.

Major newspapers have been building on their online readership since the 2016 presidential election, as they market their unbiased reporting as a sales strategy.

The paper’s print advertising revenue fell 20.1 percent to $64.4 million.

Net income attributable to the company rose to $32.3 million in the quarter ended Sept. 24 from $406,000 a year earlier. On a per-share basis it earned 20 cents per share, compared with break-even last year.

Excluding items, earnings were 13 cents per share from continuing operations, beating analysts’ average estimate of 8 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Having intervened decisively in the Syrian war in 2015 in support of President Bashar al-Assad, Russia now hopes to build on the collapse of Islamic State to launch a new political process towards ending the six-year-long conflict.

Damascus has said it is ready to attend the Nov. 18 Sochi congress which is set to focus on a new constitution, saying the time is right thanks to Syrian army gains and the “terrorists’ obliteration”.

But officials in the anti-Assad opposition rejected the meeting and insisted any peace talks be held under U.N. sponsorship in Geneva, where peace talks have failed to make any progress towards ending the conflict since it erupted in 2011.

The congress amounted to a meeting “between the regime and the regime”, said Mohammad Alloush, a member of the opposition High Negotiations Committee and a senior official with the Jaish al-Islam rebel group.

The HNC was surprised it had been mentioned in a list of groups invited to the congress and would “issue a statement with other parties setting out the general position rejecting this conference”, Alloush told Reuters.

The Turkey-based Syrian National Coalition (SNC) political opposition group said the congress was an attempt to circumvent “the international desire for political transition” in Syria.

“The Coalition will not participate in any negotiations with the regime outside Geneva or without U.N. sponsorship,” SNC spokesman Ahmad Ramadan told Reuters.

A Russian negotiator said on Tuesday that Syrian groups who choose to boycott the congress risked being sidelined as the political process moves ahead.

Russia has invited 33 Syrian groups and political parties to what it calls a “Syrian Congress on National Dialogue”.

Russian President Vladimir Putin first mentioned the idea of the congress last month, saying that he believed Moscow and the Syrian government would soon finally defeat militants in Syria.

Helped by Russia’s air force and an array of Iran-backed Shi‘ite militias, Assad has defeated many of the Syrian rebels who were fighting to topple him, leaving him militarily unassailable and the rebels confined to enclaves of the west.

Damascus and its allies have also recovered swathes of central and eastern Syria from Islamic State in recent months, while a separate campaign by U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) has driven IS from other areas of the country.

The separate campaigns are now converging on Islamic State’s last strongholds in Deir al-Zor province at the Iraqi border.

Russia’s decision to invite the Kurdish groups which dominate the SDF to Sochi triggered Turkish irritation on Wednesday. Ankara, which views the dominant Syrian Kurdish groups as a national security threat, said it was unacceptable that the Kurdish YPG militia had been invited.

Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Turkish and Russian officials had discussed the issue and that he had held meetings of his own to “solve the problem on the spot.”

The company’s roughly 15,000 drivers have become a familiar sight in Britain since 2013, tapping into the rapidly growing demand for takeaway food from restaurants.

They operate in the gig economy, where many people work for different firms without a fixed contract, and are self-employed, entitling them to only basic rights.

The firm says the vast majority of its couriers enjoy flexible working but some unions and MPs have criticised its practices and say riders should be entitled to rights such as holiday entitlement and the minimum wage.

Law firm Leigh Day, which is bringing the action, said it had submitted claims on behalf of 45 couriers and that a preliminary hearing will be held at an employment tribunal on Nov. 2, where a timetable for the case will be set.

“Our argument is that these riders are controlled, managed and disciplined by Deliveroo and that they clearly do not carry out their own delivery businesses, as Deliveroo argues,” said lawyer Annie Powell.

A spokesman said the company was also calling for a change in legislation to provide other entitlements to its couriers.

“We want to be able to offer riders greater security such as injury pay and sick pay alongside flexible work, but we are currently constrained by the law,” the spokesman said.

“That’s why we have called on the government to update legislation so we can end the trade-off between flexibility and security that currently exists in law.”

The massive data breach, believed to affect almost the entire population of Malaysia, was first reported last month by Lowyat.net, a local technology news website. The website said it had received a tip-off that someone was trying to sell huge databases of personal information on its forums.

The country’s internet regulator, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), was looking into the matter with the police, Communications and Multimedia Minister Salleh Said Keruak said on Wednesday.

“We have identified several potential sources of the leak and we should be able to complete the probe soon,” Salleh told reporters at parliament.

The leaked data included lists of mobile phone numbers, identification card numbers, home addresses, and SIM card data of 46.2 million customers from at least 12 Malaysian mobile phone and mobile virtual network operators (MVNO).

LIKE EQUIFAX

Cybersecurity researchers said the leaked data was extensive enough to allow criminals to create fraudulent identities to make online purchases.

Justin Lie, CEO of Cashshield, a Singapore-based anti-fraud company, compared the Malaysian case in its “degree of complexity” to the cyber attack on U.S. credit-scoring agency Equifax Inc, which said in September that cyber criminals had stolen sensitive information from 145.5 million people.

“Now these hackers have more quality information such as birth dates, IC numbers, mobile numbers, email address and passwords,” Lie said about the Malaysian attack.

Customers of Malaysia’s biggest mobile service providers, including Maxis (MXSC.KL), Axiata Group’s Celcom (AXIA.KL) and DiGi (DSOM.KL), among others, were affected.

MCMC’s chief operating officer Mazlan Ismail said on Tuesday the regulator had met with local telecommunications companies to seek their cooperation in the probe, according to state news agency Bernama.

Celcom, Maxis and Digi said in separate statements they were cooperating with authorities on the investigation.

“ALMOST EVERY MALAYSIAN”

According to a Singapore-based cybersecurity researcher, the leaked database was initially being sold on several underground forums for 1 bitcoin, which was trading on Wednesday at around $6,500. At least one other user was posting a link for anyone to download it for free.

The researcher, who declined to be named, said he had seen at least 10 people on an online forum in the “dark web” download the data before it was taken offline.

“Discussion in the dark web shows a huge interest,” he said.

Time stamps indicate the leaked data was last updated between May and July 2014, Lowyat.net said.

“We are urging the telco and MVNO companies mentioned above to alert, and start immediately replacing the SIM cards, of all affected customers, especially those who have not updated their SIM cards since 2014,” Lowyat.net said in a post.

Malaysia’s population is around 32 million, but many have several mobile numbers. The lists are also believed to include inactive numbers and temporary ones bought by visiting foreigners, The Star newspaper reported.

Bryce Boland, FireEye’s chief technology officer in Asia Pacific, said if the data was widely available as suspected, it could be used for identity fraud and scams.

“This stolen data may ultimately impact almost every Malaysian,” he said.

The data also includes private information of more than 80,000 individuals leaked from the records of the Malaysian Medical Council, the Malaysian Medical Association, and the Malaysian Dental Association, Lowyat.net said.

Meanwhile, online employment site jobstreet.com sent emails to its customers saying some personal information of accounts created before 2012 has been exposed.

On Oct. 4, Islamist militants with sniper rifles and rocket propelled grenades killed four U.S. soldiers and at least four of their Nigerian partners in an ambush that exposed the dangers of an expanding U.S. presence in the largely desert nation.

What began as a small U.S. training operation has expanded to an 800-strong force that accompanies the Nigerians on intelligence gathering and other missions. It includes a $100million drone base in the central Nigerian city of Agadez which, however, at present only deploys surveillance drones.

“I asked them some weeks ago to arm them (the drones) and use them as needed,” Defense Minister Kalla Mountari told Reuters in an interview in his office. Asked if Washington had accepted the request, he said: “Our enemies will find out.” The deaths of the U.S. soldiers, at the hands of suspected insurgents with the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara group, shocked Americans, many of whom did not realize their country had such a large presence in Africa’s Sahel region.

The incident also highlighted the “mission creep” that has set in and expanded the U.S. role in landlocked Niger, one of the world’s poorest and most insecure countries.

Mountari said the team of 12 U.S. Special Forces soldiers and 30 Nigerian troops had been “right up to the Mali border and had neutralized some bandits” just before the ambush took place. He declined to give further details. The U.S. military has been adamant that the Oct. 3-4 mission was not intended to involve contact with enemy forces. Mountari said: “They (U.S.-Nigerien contingent) came back to Niger, they greeted the population, they gathered intelligence and it was inside the country, when they didn’t expect anything, that the attack happened.”

U.S. forces do not have a direct combat mission in Niger, but their assistance to its military does include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance in their efforts to target violent Islamist organizations. However, Mountari was clear he saw them as close partners.

“The Americans are not just exchanging information with us. They are waging war when necessary,” he said. “We are working hand in hand. The clear proof is that the Americans and Nigerians fell on the battlefield for the peace and security of our country.”

But a growing U.S. role in Niger could prove unpopular both with Americans, many of whom are tired of costly and sometimes deadly foreign adventures, and in Niger, whose citizens have mixed feelings about foreign forces on their soil.

Drone strikes have been controversial in other parts of the world because of the risk of civilian casualties.

Le président français s’exprimait devant les juges de la Cour européenne des droits de l’homme et les représentants permanents des 47 Etats membres du Conseil de l‘Europe, l’organisation de défense de l’Etat de droit.

“Nous sommes aujourd’hui dans une situation où plusieurs Etats membres ne respectent pas de manière évidente, presque revendiquée, les termes mêmes de la Convention (européenne des droits de l’homme). En Turquie, en Russie pour ne citer que ces Etats, mais ils ne sont pas les seuls, ce risque est avéré”, a déclaré le président français.

“Nous assistons au retour en force de régimes autoritaires ou d’une fascination dans de nombreux endroits européens, pour les démocraties illibérales”, a-t-il ajouté, y voyant une situation qui “peut collectivement nous affaiblir si nous décidions de ne pas la traiter”.

La Russie, après avoir promulgué, en décembre 2016, une loi permettant à sa cour constitutionnelle d’annuler les arrêts de la Cour européenne, a suspendu en juin dernier sa contribution au budget du Conseil de l’Europe en réaction à l’attitude jugée anti-russe de son Assemblée parlementaire.

Celle-ci avait suspendu les droits de vote de la délégation russe, en avril 2014, pour sanctionner l’approbation par le Parlement russe de l’annexion de la Crimée.

Les excès de l’état d’urgence proclamé en Turquie après la tentative de coup d’Etat de juillet 2016 menacent de leur côté la Cour européenne des droits de l’homme d’un afflux de milliers de plaintes propres à provoquer sa paralysie.

The most populous of the seven absolute monarchies that constitute the United Arab Emirates has only modest oil reserves. To generate electricity it relies on importing natural gas - especially from Qatar, with which it severed diplomatic ties in June. And it has virtually no natural fresh water. Yet Dubai and its population of 2.7 million people now boast GDP of around $40,000 a head, according to the government of Dubai’s Statistics Center.

An aerial view taken from a sea plane shows Swiss pilot and original Jetman Yves Rossy (front) and Vince Reffett flying over Dubai's Palm Island, Dubai, United Arab Emirates May 12, 2015.

The near 33 million people living in neighboring Saudi Arabia, by contrast, account for an average GDP of less than $22,000 a head, according to the International Monetary Fund. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants to improve on that, judging by a goal unveiled at last week’s Davos-in-the-desert conference, entitled the Future Investment Initiative, to create a regional financial powerhouse – an event which drained Dubai of many of its business and financial elite for several days.

Saudi Arabia can learn much from Dubai, which the Banker magazine just last month anointed the world’s 10th-biggest financial center. That feat is now splashed across twin thin electronic message boards outside the Gate Building, the heart of Dubai’s financial markets. Around the corner Nasdaq is building its new regional headquarters. Riyadh doesn’t even make the publication’s ranking of 57 cities.

Dubai’s success stems in part from its relative dearth of oil and gas, which account for less than 5 percent of GDP. That forced the emirate to build a more diversified, service-led economy than most of its neighbors, from its ports operation to tourism, from high tech to business and finance – and set up a number of free economic zones to encourage development.

Construction is back as a big economic contributor, too. The city is already home to some of the most eye-catching skyscrapers – including the Burj Khalifa, which at 2,722 feet is the world’s tallest. It was completed in 2008 towards the end of the last real-estate boom, when it was often said that 25 percent of the world’s operational cranes were in Dubai. That statistic is doing the rounds again, even though its veracity has long been debated - some put the past and current tally closer to 5 percent. But the surge in the bricks, mortar and, increasingly, glass business is unmistakable.

Dubai has some successful home-grown businesses, too, not least the Emirates airline, which routinely wins industry accolades. Its airport is also the busiest in the world based on the number of international travelers who fly through it, according to Airports International Council.

The emirate is relatively accepting of Western culture, too. Consumption of alcohol is allowed under certain conditions; the dress code is far less proscriptive than in some other Arab countries; and women are treated far more fairly, from being allowed to drive to holding government office and senior private-sector roles.

That is one of the most important factors behind Dubai’s rise: its economy relies on foreigners, and not just as tourists. Fewer than 10 percent of residents are Emiratis and the ratio falls each year. The UAE as a whole recognizes the issue, too: early last year it created the Ministry for Tolerance – as well as the Ministry for Happiness and Wellbeing. It sounds Orwellian, but the stated aim is to foster an inclusive society, with Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum - UAE vice president and prime minister as well as ruler of Dubai - noting that “when the Arab world was tolerant and accepting of others, it led the world ... in science, knowledge and civilization.”

Economic success has come with its costs, though. There are still strict rules against both homosexuality and sex outside marriage; a British man was recently jailed for brushing against a German man in a bar, for example, before Sheikh Mohammed pardoned him last week. The lack of bankruptcy laws gives an incentive for the indebted to leave the country rather than restructure what they owe. Labor and business laws are either non-existent or ill-defined enough to make investors worry they are insufficiently protected, too – although the legal framework is stronger for companies incorporated in the Dubai International Financial Centre.

The environment has paid a price, too. Per capita, Dubai belches out just shy of 20 tonnes of carbon emissions a year, making it a top-five polluter by that metric and worse than the United States, Australia, Russia and China. A third of the emirate’s tally stems from using fossil fuels to provide energy and water, 90 percent of which has to be desalinated before use.

The government has been increasing efforts to address that in recent years, committing to reducing water and energy use by a third and generating a quarter of its electricity from renewable supplies by 2030, by which time its population may have doubled. It further intends to reduce emissions by 75 percent by 2050. At the fourth annual World Green Economy Summit in Dubai last week, Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, chief executive of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, said it was launching a 2.5 billion dirham ($680 million) green fund as part of a previously announced 100 billion dirham fund.

That’s peanuts compared to the $500 billion Saudi’s crown prince pledged last week to build NEOM, a 26,500 square-km futuristic city on the Red Sea ripe for developing solar and wind power.

Dubai, though, despite its drawbacks, offers an atmosphere far more conducive to success. It needs that to continue: a service-based economy requires more than just its almost 3 million people to thrive; it needs to export its skills.

Saudi Arabia’s latest push to expand its economy should provide yet more customers – early morning flights from the emirate to the kingdom and the return flights in the evening are already packed.

Relations between the UAE and Saudi Arabian governments are closer than they have been for years. That’s evident not just in matters of state like joint participation in both the war in Yemen and the boycott of Qatar. It also shows up in everyday life: last month, for example, mobile phones across the UAE suddenly displayed “UAE KSA TOGETHER” where the carrier’s logo usually resides, in the run-up to the 85th anniversary of Saudi Arabia’s founding.

Of course, if Saudi Arabia significantly ups its game, Dubai would have a serious challenger to its status as a regional financial hub. That, though, would be a long way off.",Breakingviews - Dubai demonstrates the distance ahead of Saudi,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-emirates-dubai-breakingviews/breakingviews-dubai-demonstrates-the-distance-ahead-of-saudi-idUSKBN1D1503

Britain's blue chip FTSE 100 .FTSE index was up 0.2 percent at 7,505.57 points by 0950 GMT, while mid cap stocks .FTMC rose 0.7 percent.

The FTSE gave up some gains following robust UK manufacturing data, which bolstered expectations for a rate rise from the Bank of England on Thursday and sent sterling higher.

A 6 percent plunge in Next’s (NXT.L) shares was among main moves on the benchmark index after the clothing retailer said that trading was “extremely volatile”.

Next’s shares had gained around 38 percent since hitting a low in July, but were on track for their biggest one-day fall in 10 months on the day.

Shares in fellow retailers Marks & Spencer (MKS.L) and Primark-owner AB Foods (ABF.L) also fell 4.3 percent and 2.2 percent respectively.

“We’re heading into Christmas and it’s just a little bit hard to know what to expect from the retail sector given the volatility of the sales we’ve seen,” said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group.

“When inflation’s going higher, the Bank of England’s about to the raise rates and consumer spending’s falling off a cliff, all those things don’t combine well for people selling on the high street,” Lawler added.

Results also weighed on bank Standard Chartered (STAN.L), which sank more than 6 percent, on track for its biggest one-day loss in almost a year after higher expenses overshadowed better-than-expected quarterly profit.

Miners helped support the index, however, with Anglo American (AAL.L), Antofagasta (ANTO.L), BHP Billiton (BLT.L) and Glencore (GLEN.L) among the biggest gainers, up between 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent after the price of copper jumped. [MET/L]

Outsourcer G4S (GFS.L) was also among top FTSE gainers, rising 3.6 percent following an upgrade from broker Jefferies, who raised their rating on the stock to a “buy” from “hold”.

“The shares have underperformed due to disappointing Q2 organic revenue growth but momentum should recover in H118E driven by improving emerging markets and US wage inflation,” analysts at Jefferies said in a note, referring to the first half of 2018.

Outside of the blue chips, mid cap pharma firm Indivior (INDV.L) saw its shares surge 11 percent after the U.S. FDA backed approval for Indivior’s opioid addiction drug.","Standard Chartered, Next drop to bottom of buoyant FTSE after updates",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-stocks/standard-chartered-next-drop-to-bottom-of-buoyant-ftse-after-updates-idUKKBN1D149H

“Todos temos que estar comprometidos dos pés à cabeça com a luta contra o terrorismo”, afirmou Macri, durante evento em Buenos Aires.

Na terça-feira, um homem que dirigia uma caminhonete alugada atropelou pedestres e ciclistas em Nova York, deixando oito mortos, incluindo cinco cidadãos argentinos, no que autoridades norte-americanas classificaram como um ato de “terrorismo”.

As vítimas argentinas viviam em Rosário, um dos maiores polos agroexportadores do mundo e cidade natal do ícone Ernesto “Che” Guevara, que fica a 300 km de distância de Buenos Aires.

Autoridades da cidade decretaram três dias de luto para homenagear as vítimas, que estavam nos Estados Unidos para comemorar os 30 anos de formatura em uma escola local.

“Isso nos enche de dor e sofrimento”, disse a prefeita de Rosário, Mónica Fein, à mídia local.

The girl gave her parents the slip near Geneva’s central railway station on Sunday, then took the one-stop ride to the airport. Her parents rang the Swiss police, who tracked her progress through the airport on security videos, airport spokesman Bertrand Staempfli said.

She went through the security gate and managed to pass herself off as the child of adults around her, before using her small stature to slip through the departure gate without being noticed and boarding a plane, the airport said in a statement.

On her first attempt she followed a crew toward the plane and was turned back. She melted into the crowd and pretended to look for her parents. The second time, she managed to get into a plane, was spotted by an official, stopped, and handed over to police.

Staempfli declined to say which airline was involved or where it was flying to, but he said it was leaving from the airport’s French sector and the destination was in France.

The airport said in the statement it would tighten safety rules and boarding procedures as a result of what it called the “highly regrettable incident”.

If Puigdemont fails to answer Thursday’s High Court summons, an arrest warrant could be issued that would make it virtually impossible for him to stand in a snap regional election called by the Spanish government for Dec. 21.

There was currently no arrest warrant out for Puigdemont, the lawyer, Paul Bekaert, told Associated Press.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Puigdemont and his government on Friday, hours after the Catalan parliament made a unilateral declaration of independence -- a vote boycotted by the opposition and declared illegal by Spanish courts.

On Monday, Spain’s state prosecutor filed charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds against Puigdemont for defying the central government by holding an referendum on secession on Oct. 1 and later proclaiming independence.

Puigdemont traveled to Belgium at the weekend with other members of the dismissed Catalan administration and hired a lawyer.

“(He) is not going to Madrid and I suggest that they question him here in Belgium. It is possible,” Bekaert told AP, adding there were provisions in the law that allowed his questioning outside Spain.

The High Court summoned Puigdemont and 13 other former members of the Catalan government to testify in Madrid on Thursday and Friday on the prosecutor’s charges.

A judge will then decide whether those called to testify should go to jail pending an investigation that could take several years and potentially lead to a trial. The judge might also grant them conditional bail or order them to surrender their passports.

If Puigdemont and his associates did not turn up, the judge might also order them jailed as a flight risk.

The courts have also told the Catalan secessionist leaders to deposit 6.2 million euros ($7.2 million) by Friday to cover potential liabilities.

“OFF TO PRISON”?

Three former Catalan government advisors returned to Spain from Belgium late on Tuesday and were greeted at Barcelona’s international airport by a small crowd chanting “off to prison”.

Puigdemont and four others were not among those returning to Spain. He said on Tuesday he would only go back to Spain when given unspecified “guarantees” by the Spanish government.

Wednesday is a national holiday in Spain and government offices are closed, giving a brief respite in Spain’s gravest political crisis since its return to democracy some four decades ago.

Following a tumultuous month, attention is also gradually turning to the December election, called by Rajoy when Madrid took over control of the previously autonomous region.

Puigdemont said in Brussels on Tuesday he accepted the election and the Madrid government said he was welcome to stand, though legal proceedings might prevent that.

Uncertainty over how the crisis will play out has prompted more than 1,800 Catalonia-based companies to move their legal headquarters out of the region and the government to lower its country-wide economic forecasts for next year.

On Wednesday, rating agency Moody’s said the declaration of independence and the suspension of self rule were credit negative for the region and the country, and that associated uncertainty would damage sentiment and consumer spending.

Moody’s raised Spain’s credit rating to Baa2 in 2014 as the country emerged from a prolonged economic slump.

On Tuesday, Moody’s affirmed Catalonia’s long-term issuer and debt ratings of Ba3, saying the government’s reinforced control compensated for the increased risks, in particular the region’s rapidly deteriorating business climate.",Ousted Catalan leader will not return to Spain to testify: lawyer,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/ousted-catalan-leader-will-not-return-to-spain-to-testify-lawyer-idUSKBN1D14AH?il=0

Alle 12 ora italiana, l‘indice europeo STOXX 600 cresce dello 0,65%, a 397,78 punti, e tocca i livelli visti nell‘agosto 2015.

Francoforte, che era chiusa ieri per festività, dà un contributo importante, dato che guadagna oltre l‘1,6%.

In Spagna calano i timori per la crisi catalana, e la borsa di Madrid è in rialzo dello 0,37%.

Londra segna +0,23%, Parigi +0,46%.

Lo STOXX 600 è al quinto giorno consecutivo di rialzo, e a ottobre è cresciuto di almeno il 2%, anche sulla scia dei mercati globali, spinti dalla prospettiva del piano di tagli fiscali negli Usa, dalla ripresa economica e da un robusto ciclo tech.

“Dal punto di vista economico, tutto sembra andare bene al momento”, dice Jonathan Bell, chief investment officer di Stanhope Capital.

Bell comunque avverte che mentre gli investitori cavalcano l‘onda del rialzo, i mercati potrebbero essere vulnerabili a cambiamenti di politica monetaria.

Il titolo migliore di oggi è la casa farmaceutica britannica Indivior che cresce del 9% circa (ma è arrivato anche a registrare +11%) dopo che le autorità Usa hanno raccomandato il via libera a un medicinale per la dipendenza da oppioidi. Il titolo è già salito di oltre il 20% nel corso della settimana.

Un‘altra casa farmaceutica, la danese Novo Nordisk, perde il 2% circa dopo i risultati del terzo trimestre e l‘annuncio che una nuova normativa in alcuni stati Usa potrebbe danneggiare gli affari nel suo mercato-chiave.

Sempre sul fronte dei profitti, il produttore finlandese di pneumatici Nokian Tyres sale del 2% (dopo aver toccato +6%) grazie ai risultati superiori alle previsioni, mentre il bookmaker britannico Paddy Power sale del 4,6%, ai massimi da tre mesi.

Delle aziende quotate al STOXX600 che hanno già diffuso i risultati del terzo trimestre, almeno la metà hanno superato le attese, secondo Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, che prevede anche un aumento medio dei profitti del 3,5% rispetto allo stesso periodo del 2016.

C‘è qualche timore però per il settore bancario.

BNP Paribas segna -0,6% e continua la performance negativa iniziata ieri, causata per la delusione delle attività di trading sul reddito fisso. Standard Chartered perde oltre il 6,5%, la peggiore perdita quotidiana in tre mesi.

L‘istituto, molto attivo in Asia, ha postato una crescita del 78% nei profitti pre-tasse, ma sono aumentate le spese e i ricavi sono piatti, provocando timori sui dividendi.

In calo anche la banca austriaca Raiffeisen, che perde il 2%.

E cala bruscamente la catena di abbigliamento britannica Next che perde l‘8% dopo che i risultati hanno superato in negativo le previsioni degli analisti.

Transport is among the policy areas being thrashed out in talks taking place between Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens, who are aiming to form a coalition by Christmas.

The parties are discussing all policy areas before launching detailed negotiations. While the atmosphere has improved in recent days, there have been few actual deals, with immigration and climate change among the biggest sticking points.

The Greens’ demand on carmakers would go further than software fixes so far agreed between politicians and German car bosses to help repair the industry’s badly damaged reputation.

The future of Germany’s mighty car industry, the country’s biggest exporter and provider of some 800,000 jobs, is a tricky area as it tries to recover from the diesel emissions testing scandal which broke at Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) two years ago.

Despite public concern and planned diesel bans in countries including France and Britain in coming decades, German lawmakers have not yet dared ask the same of its carmakers, such as BMW, VW, Daimler and Porsche who have invested heavily in diesel.

In August, politicians and car bosses agreed to overhaul engine software on 5.3 million diesel cars to cut pollution and avoid bans on polluting vehicles but they stopped short of committing to more expensive hardware modifications.

That may have to change if the Greens share power.

“We won’t meet our targets of getting cleaner air in city centers with software upgrades alone,” Cem Ozdemir, a leader of the Greens, said as he headed into the talks.

“There must also be hardware solutions.”

Ozdemir said the auto industry was going through the biggest transformation process in its history and the car had to be reinvented to make it emission-free and more automated. Public transport must also be expanded, he added.

Putin and his Iranian hosts are expected to discuss the nuclear deal and regional crises such as the Syrian conflict, in which Moscow and Tehran are the main backers of President Bashar al-Assad, while Washington, Turkey and most Arab states support opposition groups seeking to overthrow him.

“We are very pleased that, apart from our bilateral relations, our two countries play an important role in securing peace and stability in the region,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told Putin in his welcoming remarks.

Russian and Iranian help has proved crucial for Assad, allowing him to win a series of military victories since 2015 and to reestablish his control over most of Syria. Moscow is now trying to build on that success with a new diplomatic push, including a meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sochi next month.

Moscow is also an important ally for Iran in its confrontation with the Trump administration, which on Oct. 13 refused to certify Tehran’s two-year-old nuclear deal with six major powers that include Russia and the United States.

Russia has criticized Trump’s move, which has opened a 60-day window for Congress to act to reimpose economic sanctions on Iran. These were lifted under the 2015 accord in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear program.

“This is a very important visit (by Putin) ... It shows the determination of Tehran and Moscow to deepen their strategic alliance.... which will shape the future of the Middle East,” one Iranian official told Reuters, on condition of anonymity.

“Both Russia and Iran are under American pressure ... Tehran has no other choice but to rely on Moscow to ease the U.S. pressure,” said the official.

Another Iranian official said Trump’s aggressive Iran policy had united Iran’s faction-ridden leadership in alignment with Russia.

The ADP National Employment Report said private employers hired 235,000 workers last month, exceeding a median forecast of 200,000 among economists polled by Reuters.

Domestic private payrolls in September were revised down to an increase of 110,000 from the previous 135,000.

The report is jointly developed with Moody’s Analytics.

“This labor market is tight and is destined to be tighter,” Mark Zandi, Moody’s Analytics chief economist said on a conference call with reporters.

The ADP figures come ahead of the U.S. Labor Department’s more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.

Economists polled by Reuters are looking for U.S. private payroll employment to have grown by 303,000 jobs in October, versus a drop of 40,000 the month before. Total non-farm employment is expected to have increased by 312,000.

The unemployment rate is forecast to stay steady at 4.2 percent.

The Facebook lawyer responded that there was little the company could do if a foreign advertiser used a U.S. shell corporation.
Stretch responded: “Certainly potentially.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators on Tuesday pressed Facebook Inc’s chief lawyer on why the company did not catch 2016 election ads bought using Russian rubles, why its investigation of them took so long and how much it knows about its 5 million advertisers.

Democrats and Republicans at the Senate crime subcommittee hearing fired questions for much of two hours at Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch, who said that in retrospect the company should have done more.

“In hindsight, we should have had a broader lens. There are signals we missed,” Stretch said under questioning from Democratic Senator Al Franken about how the company missed political ads bought with Russian money. Stretch called the Russia-based ads “reprehensible” for their political divisiveness.

The hearing marked the first time tech executives have appeared publicly before U.S. lawmakers on the Russia matter, and the tone represented a dramatic shift in fortunes for Silicon Valley, which for years has grown accustomed to favorable regulatory treatment in the United States.

Lawyers for Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google also faced questions at the hearing about how Russians used their services, but Facebook drew the bulk of senators’ ire because of its unique role in targeted marketing on the internet.

Facebook has broader reach than the smaller Twitter network, and it offers more powerful targeting capabilities than Google.

“I suspect that your advertising department has watched the profits go up,” Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy told Stretch, who responded that Facebook was committed to rooting out accounts that use fake names.

Lawyers for the three companies were scheduled to return to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for two more hearings on Russia ad spending.

The Russian government has denied it intended to influence the 2016 presidential election, in which Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Facebook, in a series of disclosures over two months, has said that people in Russia bought at least 3,000 U.S. political ads and published another 80,000 Facebook posts that were seen by as many as 126 million Americans over two years.

Senators said they could not understand the timing of Facebook’s disclosures.

“Why has it taken Facebook 11 months to come forward and help us understand the scope of this problem?” Democratic Senator Chris Coons asked.

Stretch responded that, when U.S. spy agencies alleged in January that Russians meddled in last year’s election, “we weren’t sitting around.” The company over the following months launched an investigation and reported the results, he said.

Facebook has also announced steps to change how it treats political ads. It said it is hiring 1,000 more people to review ads, compiling a publicly searchable archive of political ads beginning next year and requiring more information about the identity of election advertisers.

Coons said he wished the tech companies had sent their top executives on Tuesday rather than in-house lawyers.

Republican Senator John Kennedy told Stretch that he doubted Facebook’s ability to stop people overseas from buying U.S. election ads. U.S. law bars election spending by non-Americans.

“You’ve got 5 million advertisers and you’re going to tell me that you’re able to trace the origin of all those advertisements?” Kennedy asked Stretch.

The Facebook lawyer responded that there was little the company could do if a foreign advertiser used a U.S. shell corporation.

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the crime subcommittee, said he wanted to help the tech companies, but he also pressed Stretch on whether Iran and North Korea could try to do what Russia did in the United States.

Stretch responded: “Certainly potentially. The internet is borderless.”

Hanging over Facebook, Google and Twitter is the threat of legislation that would extend rules governing political advertising on television, radio and satellite to also cover social media.

The companies have responded with proposals for self-regulation, saying they would create their own public archives of election-related ads.

Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar told witnesses on Tuesday that self-regulation would lead to a “patchwork” of databases and that a uniform system would be better for voters.",U.S. senators hammer Facebook for power over elections,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-socialmedia/u-s-senators-hammer-facebook-for-power-over-elections-idUSKBN1D014V?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

The challenge for Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is to persuade her to actually buy one.

“I‘m definitely interested, but don’t currently plan to get one,” said Gu, whose monthly salary of a little over 6,000 yuan ($905.36) is less than the anniversary model’s starting price in China of 8,388 yuan.

For Apple, which is looking to rev up sales in China after several quarters of declining revenue there, the test is that Gu is not alone. While interest in the phone is high, that won’t necessarily translate into sales.

“Price appears to be a major constraint on iPhone X demand, particularly in China,” Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a recent report that showed three-quarters of Chinese respondents were excited by the upcoming launch, but only a quarter said they planned to buy one.

Investors are keen to gauge Chinese demand for the iPhone X, as it is key to reviving Apple’s fortunes in the world’s biggest smartphone market where it has lost some of its sparkle - and market share - as local phone makers have advanced.

The cheaper iPhone 8, which hit the market in September, has faced sluggish sales, but Apple has said that pre-orders for the iPhone X have been “off the charts”.

Apple, due to announce quarterly earnings on Thursday, said it had no immediate comment.

Chatter online on popular Chinese social media platform Weibo (WB.O) also signaled high levels of interest in the new model, though still generally behind levels around the 2014 launch of the very successful iPhone 6.

APPLE “GEEKS”

Xiao Ming, 32, who works for a blockchain start-up in Beijing, stayed up half the night when pre-sales of the iPhone X opened last week. He has also bought the iPhone 8.

“I always try to be one of the first to buy any new iPhone,” he said, adding he likes the new phone’s augmented reality and facial recognition features. “I’ll be very disappointed if I don’t get one on the first day.”

While he plans to buy the new phone, he noted many of his friends were less fussed. “Before, I think a lot of people would try to get it somehow, now it’s mostly the geeks,” he said.

“My friends don’t mind so much if they have an iPhone 8 or a 6, for example, because it looks similar and the price (of the iPhone X) makes you feel nervous.”

Re-sellers and iPhone accessory makers generally agreed there was a buzz about the iPhone X, Apple’s first phone to have a full-screen display and functions such as facial recognition security.

“People are really anticipating this phone because it’s the 10th anniversary version and it has more changes and modifications,” said Gary Yiu, manager of the iGeneration smartphone shop at one Hong Kong mall.

Yiu and three other phone re-sellers there said they had seen strong demand for the phone from mainland clients.

A merchant at the Huaqiangbei electronics hub in Shenzhen, who was offering an iPhone look-a-like called the “E-Feng X” from 1,599 yuan, said sales volumes were “very good”.

Some Chinese re-sellers, however, said they already canceled pre-orders for the iPhone X, concerned there wouldn’t be enough of a supply bottleneck to allow them to charge a steep premium - despite some worries about long waits.

“I saw many friends were posting pictures of themselves successfully ordering the iPhone X, so I canceled mine,” said Tony Tong, 29, a product manager at a tech firm in Beijing, who said he had ordered four phones in the hope of re-selling them for a profit. “The environment is bad for scalpers.”

Apple will hope payment plans and easy access to online credit in China will convince people to buy.

Wang Hao, a 24-year-old engineer in the northeastern port city of Dalian, said he ordered the new phone despite the high price tag. His last phone was an iPhone 6S.

“The cost is about a month’s salary for me,” he told Reuters. “But I‘m just used to it now, and there wasn’t really anything to make me choose another brand.”

The BoE surprised markets on Sept. 14 when it said, despite the big uncertainties about Brexit, that most of its policymakers thought a rate hike was likely in the coming months, if underlying inflation pressure continues to grow.

The signal came even as the Monetary Policy Committee members voted 7-2 to keep rates at their all-time low of 0.25 percent, meaning at least three of its members will have to switch their vote if the BoE is to raise rates on Nov. 2.

Following is a brief description of each of the MPC’s members and their latest comments on the outlook for rates.

For an interactive version, double-click on tmsnrt.rs/2eSYykb.

THE SEVEN WHO VOTED TO KEEP RATE UNCHANGED LAST WEEK

MARK CARNEY, GOVERNOR - LIKELY TO VOTE FOR A HIKE SOON

Since arriving at the BoE more than four years ago, Carney has signaled on previous occasions that a rate hike might be coming, only to be wrong-footed by the economy’s twists and turns. This time, he has sounded more emphatic. Carney said on Sept. 14 that he was one of the majority of MPC members who saw the balance of risks shifting toward inflation and away from weak growth and a hike was likely to be needed in the coming months. “Now, we will take that decision based on the data. I guess that possibility has definitely increased,” he said.

BEN BROADBENT, DEPUTY GOVERNOR FOR MONETARY POLICY - LIKELY TO VOTE FOR A HIKE SOON

Carney’s number two for interest rates and other measures to help the economy, Broadbent has yet to speak publicly since last week’s surprise announcement. But in August he said a hike would not be a big risk, suggesting he was getting close to changing his vote. “I think there may be some possibility for interest rates to go up a little bit,” he said “One shouldn’t overdo this. If and when it happens there will be a lot of talk about the first rate rise since ‘x’. But it’s just a rate rise and we got perfectly used to rate rises of this size in the past.”

ANDY HALDANE, CHIEF ECONOMIST - LIKELY TO VOTE FOR A HIKE SOON

Haldane shook up markets in June when he said he was likely to vote for a rate hike in the second half of 2017. Previously, he had been considered one of the strongest supporters of continued record low rates. “Provided the data are still on track, I do think that beginning the process of withdrawing some of the incremental stimulus provided last August would be prudent moving into the second half of the year.”

JON CUNLIFFE, DEPUTY GOVERNOR FOR FINANCIAL STABILITY - MIGHT VOTE FOR A RATE HIKE SOON

Cunliffe’s expertise lies in bank regulation and he is not known for taking strong individual positions on monetary policy. He is therefore likely to take his lead from Carney although on June 28, in his most recent public comments on rates, he said: “(We) do have to look at what’s happening to domestic inflation pressure, and I think that on the data we have at the moment, gives us a bit of time to see how this evolves.”

DAVE RAMSDEN, DEPUTY GOVERNOR FOR MARKETS AND BANKING - VIEW ON RATE OUTLOOK UNKNOWN

Ramsden joined the BoE in September having previously worked as the top economic advisor at Britain’s finance ministry. He has made no public comment on the outlook for rates although he voted to keep them on hold last week. He is no stranger to the MPC debates having attended 92 of its meetings in his previous role at the Treasury.

GERTJAN VLIEGHE, EXTERNAL MPC MEMBER - MIGHT VOTE FOR A RATE HIKE SOON

Vlieghe pushed up the pound by almost as much as the surprise Sept. 14 BoE announcement when, a day later, he suggested that he too was close to voting for a rate hike. Until then, the former hedge fund economist had argued against such a move and was seen as the BoE’s strongest supporter of record-low rates. “If these data trends of reducing slack, rising pay pressure, strengthening household spending and robust global growth continue, the appropriate time for a rise in Bank Rate might be as early as in the coming months,” he said on Sept. 15.

SILVANA TENREYRO, EXTERNAL MPC MEMBER - VIEWS ON RATE OUTLOOK UNKNOWN

Tenreyro is another newcomer to the MPC which she joined in July. She has voted twice to keep rates on hold and is widely considered to be one of the BoE’s more dovish policymakers based on her previous academic work which highlighted the potential damage to Britain’s economy from Brexit. So far, she has not spoken publicly since joining the BoE.

THE TWO WHO HAVE VOTED FOR A HIKE

MICHAEL SAUNDERS, EXTERNAL MPC MEMBER - HAS VOTED FOR A RATE HIKE SINCE JUNE

Saunders, a former economist with financial services firm Citi, has been in the minority of MPC members voting for a rate hike since June. “I think households should prepare for interest rates to go higher at some point. But if rates do go up, it will be in the context of the economy doing OK and unemployment being low and probably falling,” he said on July 4.

IAN MCCAFFERTY, EXTERNAL MPC MEMBER - HAS VOTED FOR A RATE HIKE SINCE JUNE

McCafferty has voted on and off for a rate hike over the past three years and is currently the other MPC member, alongside Saunders, who supports a hike to 0.50 percent. “I feel on the balance of monetary policy that there is a need for change. I think this would be justified and would be the prudent thing to do at this stage,” he said on July 4.",Factbox - The Bank of England's rate-setters and how their votes might change,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-boe-mpc/the-bank-of-englands-rate-setters-and-how-they-might-vote-idUKKBN1D14R3

The Fed has raised rates twice since January and currently forecasts one more hike by the end of the year as part of a tightening cycle that began in late 2015.

Investors have all but ruled out a move at the end of this week’s two-day policy meeting. The Fed is due to issue its latest policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).

Markets will look to it for confirmation the central bank is on track for a December rate hike, though attention will quickly turn to who will be in charge of monetary policy at the end of Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s first term in February 2018.

President Donald Trump, who has interviewed Yellen, Fed Governor Jerome Powell and three others for the top Fed job, is likely to announce the nomination on Thursday.

Powell, a soft-spoken centrist who has supported Yellen’s gradual approach to raising rates, is seen as having a lock on the position.

“The bottom line is the meeting is probably going to be a somewhat boring event for markets, overshadowed by the expected Fed chair decision,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank.

INFLATION WORRIES

Fed policymakers have been buoyed in recent months by a strengthening U.S. economy and further tightening in the labor market, although inflation has continued to remain below the central bank’s 2 percent target.

The economy unexpectedly maintained a brisk pace of growth in the third quarter, increasing at a 3.0 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department reported last week.

A decline in hiring in September also has largely been dismissed as a blip caused by the temporary displacement of workers due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. That jobs report also showed wages growing at an encouraging pace and the unemployment rate falling to more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent.

A strong rebound in job gains is anticipated when the Labor Department releases its October nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.

Inflation is the main concern for Fed policymakers who are wondering about the causes and duration of the current weakness. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation sits at 1.3 percent after retreating further from target for much of the year.

Nevertheless, Yellen and other key policymakers have said the Fed, which unveiled a plan this year to cut its balance sheet starting in October, still expects to continue to gradually raise rates given the economy’s strength. That is not expected to change on Wednesday.

“If we get what we expect to get, which is basically more of the same of what we saw in the September statement,” said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo, “then yes, their gradual policy tightening plan is in place and all signs point to a December hike.”",Fed set to hold rates steady ahead of Trump's leadership decision,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed/fed-set-to-hold-rates-steady-ahead-of-trumps-leadership-decision-idUSKBN1D13JT

Under Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai, the tech and entertainment giant has streamlined unprofitable electronics businesses and capitalized on the spread of smartphones with its image sensors.

Citing robust sales of image sensors as well as high-end TVs, Sony hiked its full-year operating profit outlook to 630 billion yen ($5.5 billion), up 26 percent from an earlier forecast and 7.5 percent higher than an average analyst estimate.

“Image sensors will be used in a wide range of areas, and the market is very large,” said Masayuki Otani, chief market analyst at Securities Japan Inc.

“Profitability is increasing, and in the mid- to long-term we expect the stock price to reach its 2007 level of 7,190 yen.”

Sony’s stock rose as much as 12.4 percent to its highest level since June 2008, becoming the most traded firm by turnover on Tokyo’s main board. It finished up 11.4 percent at 4,918 yen, giving it a market capitalization of around $54.6 billion.

The new forecast is 20 percent above its current profit record, set two decades ago when strong sales of consumer electronics dovetailed with the popularity of its first PlayStation games console and its “Men in Black” box-office hit.

To develop new profit drivers, the firm has also boosted investment in artificial intelligence and is expanding its consumer products portfolio.

It unveiled its Xperia Hello! voice-activated communication robot this month and on Wednesday said it was reviving its robotic dog AIBO that went on sale in 1999. It also aims to lead the budding virtual-reality market by drawing on the content portion of its business such as music and film.

Combined with resurgent demand for consumer audio products sparked by the rise of streaming services from Spotify to Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) Apple Music, the focus on cutting-edge technology augurs well for future profits, said Macquarie analyst Damian Thong.

“They should also push into 3D sensors which will be useful for augmented reality and the applications that surround that.”

“Great products, plus great brand, delivering great profitability,” he added. “It’s not rocket science perhaps, but for a long time, Sony seemed to have forgotten this magic formula.”",Record profit forecast for a resurgent Sony sends shares to nine-year high,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sony-stocks/record-profit-forecast-for-a-resurgent-sony-sends-shares-to-nine-year-high-idUKKBN1D139C?il=0

O suspeito, que foi baleado pela polícia e preso momentos depois do ataque no oeste de Manhattan, deixou um bilhete dizendo que cometeu o atentado em nome do grupo militante Estado Islâmico, segundo o jornal New York Times e a rede CNN.

O saldo de mortes é baixo quando comparado às dezenas de mortos de ataques semelhantes no ano passado na França e na Alemanha. Mesmo assim, foi o ataque mais letal em Nova York desde o 11 de setembro de 2001, quando suicidas sequestraram dois aviões de passageiros e os lançaram contra o World Trade Center, matando mais de 2.600 pessoas.

O Ministério de Relações Exteriores da Argentina informou em comunicado que cinco cidadãos argentinos estão entre os mortos.

O local das Torres Gêmeas se situa a poucas quadras do cenário do atropelamento de terça-feira, ocorrido quando o suspeito entrou com a caminhonete em uma ciclovia também usada por pedestres no final da tarde.

Movendo-se a uma velocidade estimada em mais de 100 km/h, o veículo derrubou todos em seu caminho antes de atingir a lateral de um ônibus escolar.

Depois disso o motorista saiu do veículo brandindo o que pareciam ser armas e foi confrontado por um policial, que o baleou no abdômen. A polícia disse ter recuperado uma arma de paint-ball e outra de chumbinho no local.

O ataque terminou em questão de segundos. Imagens de vídeo feitas por um pedestre que circularam na internet mostraram bicicletas destruídas espalhadas ao longo da ciclovia e ao menos duas pessoas caídas no chão.

Além das oito mortes, ao menos 11 pessoas foram hospitalizadas com ferimentos descritos por autoridades dos bombeiros como sérios, mas sem risco de morte. Isso exclui o suspeito, que foi operado devido aos ferimentos de bala.

A polícia não quis identificá-lo publicamente, mas uma fonte a par da investigação disse que ele se chama Sayfullo Saipov e tem 29 anos. Acredita-se que ele mora em Paterson, Nova Jersey, um ex-polo industrial localizado cerca de 40 quilômetros ao noroeste do sul de Manhattan.

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

Some 80 protesters outside the Cinematheque Française, which is showcasing Polanski’s films next month, banged on windows and carried posters with slogans such as, “If rape is an art, give Polanski all the (French movie award) Cesars”.

Two members of the Femen group briefly exposed their breasts and shouted “no honors for rapists” in the presence of Polanski before security pushed them outside.

Polanski, who had entered the building through a back entrance, was set to present his new movie “Based on a True Story” at the event.

Earlier this month, Swiss prosecutors said former German actress and model Renate Langer had told authorities that Polanski raped her at his mountain chalet in 1972 when she was 15 years old.

Langer is one of four women who have publicly accused Polanski, 84, of sexually assaulting them when they were teenagers.

The allegations predate the Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal.

Polanski, director of classic films like Rosemary’s Baby, The Pianist and Carnage, has fled U.S. sentencing in 1978 for unlawful sex with 13-year-old Samantha Geimer in Los Angeles in 1977 in a case where he pleaded guilty at the time.

“Polanski has no place in an homage organized by a public cultural institution in France. He should be in a US court of justice,” Raphaelle Remy-Leleu, spokeswoman for feminist group “Osez le féminisme” said on French CNews television.

She said the Cinematheque Française was “spitting in the face of victims of male aggression” and complicit to the impunity of the aggressors.

The Cinematheque said in a statement to French media that the organization is honoring Polanski’s work and wants to steer clear of the legal case against him. French Culture Minister Francoise Nyssen has also defended the Polanski retrospective.

“This is about his life’s work, not about the man,” she said on radio France Inter on Friday.

In a statement to Reuters last week, Polanski’s lawyer reiterated that Polanski has acknowledged having had a sexual relationship with Geimer, and repeated that he strongly denies all other allegations against him as totally baseless.

In 2009, Swiss authorities arrested Polanski on his arrival in Zurich to receive a lifetime achievement award at a film festival. Two months later, he was released on bail and put under house arrest in his Gstaad chalet.

In July 2010, he was released from house arrest after authorities decided against extradition because of potential technical faults in the U.S. request and because he had for years come to Switzerland in good faith.

“I worry that the president’s enthusiasm will not be checked by the advisers around him,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, the legislation’s lead sponsor, told reporters on a conference call.

Some Republicans have also expressed concern about Trump’s rhetoric, but none co-sponsored the bill, which is backed by seven Democrats and Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent.

Republicans control majorities in both the Senate and House, and there has been no indication that congressional leaders would allow a vote. Similar measures introduced earlier this year have also failed to advance.

However, backers said they might try to pass it later this year by introducing it as an amendment to legislation such as a as a must-pass spending bill.

“I have confidence that if this came to a vote on the floor of the Senate, it would prevail,” Murphy said.

Lawmakers have been trying to take back more control over foreign policy from the White House.

Congress passed a bill in July barring the president from lifting sanctions on Russia without lawmakers’ approval, and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Monday held a hearing on a new authorization for the use of military force, or AUMF, to exert some authority over the campaign against Islamic State and other militant groups.

The pact aims to eliminate tariffs on industrial and farm products across an 11-nation bloc whose trade totaled $356.3 billion last year.

This week’s compromise saves member nations from having to renegotiate the ambitious trade pact to accommodate the New Zealand government’s demands for firm measures to rein in housing prices.

It also brings member countries closer to an important victory in support of free trade to be finalised at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit next week in Vietnam’s central city of Danang.

“The momentum towards (an agreement) at the meeting in Danang has significantly increased,” said Japan’s chief TPP negotiator, Kazuyoshi Umemoto.

“The economic impact is certainly not small, but the even bigger message is this agreement can influence the global economic system and bring about peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific.”

Negotiators gathered for three days in Urayasu, east of the Japanese capital, to narrow down which terms of the original 12-nation deal to suspend, so as to salvage the pact at the Vietnam summit.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who was sworn in last week, has announced plans to ban foreign home purchases that should curb speculation without forcing TPP countries to renegotiate the pact.

Japan hopes the deal, which links 11 countries with a combined GDP of $12.4 trillion, can show other nations it can champion free trade in the absence of Washington’s influence.

It could also help Japan resist U.S. pressure for a two-way trade pact, which is likely to come up when President Donald Trump visits, from Sunday until Tuesday, for a summit with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

“A TPP agreement could damage the United States, so domestically people may start to realize that they can’t be left behind in free trade,” said Kensuke Yanagida, a research fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs.

O segundo maior banco privado do país anunciou nesta quarta-feira que seu lucro líquido ajustado do período somou 4,81 bilhões de reais, avanço sequencial de 2,3 por cento e de 7,8 por cento na comparação ano a ano. Em termos líquidos, o lucro de 2,88 bilhões de reais representou queda de 26,3 por cento sobre o trimestre anterior e de 10,9 por cento ante mesma etapa de 2016.

A despesa com provisões para perdas com inadimplência caiu 23,1 por cento e 33,4 por cento nas comparações trimestral e anual, respectivamente, a 3,82 bilhões de reais.

Esse dado veio acompanhado de melhora na qualidade da carteira do Bradesco, com o índice de inadimplência acima de 90 dias recuando a 4,8 por cento, queda de 0,1 ponto percentual em relação ao trimestre anterior e de 0,6 ponto contra um ano antes.

Isso ocorreu mesmo com o estoque de financiamentos recuando pelo quarto trimestre consecutivo. No fim de setembro, as operações de crédito do Bradesco totalizavam 486,86 bilhões de reais, recuo de 1,4 por cento em três meses e de 6,7 por cento ano a ano.

O recuo nos empréstimos atingiu a margem financeira, que teve redução de 5,7 por cento na medição trimestre a trimestre, para 14,6 bilhões de reais. Essa linha foi pressionada também por uma baixa contábil relativa ao ajuste de preços de ativos financeiros, que subiu 520 milhões de reais contra o segundo trimestre.

Em contrapartida, o banco teve queda sequencial de 2,7 por cento nas despesas de pessoal, para 4,83 bilhões de reais, já computando os efeitos de um plano de demissão incentivada realizado em agosto, que teve 7,4 mil adesões.

No conjunto, as despesas administrativas recuaram 3,9 por cento em 12 meses, a 9,86 bilhões de reais, refletindo entre outros fatores a redução de quase 500 agências no período. O Bradesco, que no ano passado selou a integração do HSBC, comprado um ano antes, vem gradualmente ajustando sua estrutura enquanto tenta tornar seus canais de atendimento mais digitais.

Em outra frente, o banco viu suas receitas de prestação de serviços subirem 4,3 por cento trimestre a trimestre e 5 por cento sobre o mesmo período de 2016, para 7,82 bilhões de reais.

Esse conjunto levou a uma rentabilidade sobre o patrimônio líquido de 18,1 por cento de julho a setembro, recuo de 0,1 ponto contra o trimestre anterior, mas alta de 0,5 ponto sobre mesma etapa de 2016.

Os números vão numa direção similar à mostrada pelo rival maior Itaú Unibanco, que na véspera reportou que seu lucro do terceiro trimestre tinha crescido com ajuda da queda nas despesas com provisões para perdas e administrativas.

About 60,000 refugees and migrants, mostly Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis, have become stranded in Greece after border closures in the Balkans halted the onward journey many planned to take to central and western Europe.

Nearly 148,084 refugees and migrants have crossed to Greece from Turkey this year - a fraction of the nearly 1 million arrivals in 2015 - but arrivals have picked up in recent months.

An average of 214 people arrived each day in September, up from 156 in August, 87 in July and 56 in March, Mouzalas said.

The rise has stretched Greek island camps, which are struggling to cope with numbers two to three times their capacity. Most new arrivals are women and children, according to United Nations data.

Mouzalas said the government was in talks with local authorities to move refugees and migrants to local accommodation, including hotels, and it also planned to increase the capacity of some facilities.","Refugees in Greece demand transfer to Germany, start hunger strike",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-greece/refugees-in-greece-demand-transfer-to-germany-start-hunger-strike-idUSKBN1D14UQ?il=0

China’s Communist Party has decided to insert his view of the world – “Xi Jinping Thought for the New Era of Socialism With Chinese Special Characteristics” – into the constitution. He will be only the second leader after Mao Zedong to be so honored during his lifetime. Xi stands supreme. Yet that very accumulation of authority carries a large threat, both to his power and to his state.

Xi’s central goals are to strengthen China’s economy and military power and to lead a sometimes-ferocious campaign against corruption, bolstering these aims with a steady determination to bring the news media back under the tightest control. Inserting both his thoughts and his name in the constitution will further delegitimize critical commentary and unflattering revelations by making anything that contradicts Xi’s official line an attack on the constitution. Xi wants to render independent journalism impossible and choke off China’s liveliest medium of criticism – social media. Blocking these arteries could be his largest mistake yet.

Xi’s desire to curb the media is not new. In 2013, the then-new leader gave a speech to the National Propaganda and Ideology Work Conference in Beijing, in which he argued that workers in propaganda and ideology – broadly speaking, journalists and their minders – had become so undisciplined that some bordered on committing treason. His subsequent actions have been consistent with this belief.

In a book published earlier this year, I wrote, “one phrase in his speech was particularly telling. Xi said that ‘we must unwaveringly persist in the principle that the Party manages the media, persist in politicians running newspapers periodicals, TV stations and news websites.’”

The words “politicians running newspapers” were telling because they were a direct quotation from Mao, the founder of communist rule, still venerated in spite of his murderous policies that condemned millions. The phrase enshrined the dogma that politicians – the Party – is the final judge of what journalism can say. Journalism was far too important to be left to journalists.

In the past five years, those newspapers and TV programs which had enjoyed some autonomy – granted by Deng Xiaoping who was in charge of economic and social reform from the late 1970s to the late 1980s – have lost nearly all of their latitude. Journalists no longer can undertake any investigation not expressly permitted by the all-powerful Publicity (formerly Propaganda) Department. Usually that only allowed for investigating the affairs of one whom the Party wished to destroy.

The most adventurous newspapers – such as the Southern Metropolitan Daily and Southern Weekend of Guangzhou – were muzzled in 2013. Xiao Shu, a former editorialist on the Southern Weekend, wrote that the appointment of a new, severe head of Party propaganda in Guangdong, the region in which Guangzhou is the capital, meant that “the press in Guangdong retreated into its darkest period since the start of Deng Xiaoping’s 'reform and opening up' policies in the late 1970s.”

That was just the start. The monopoly broadcaster, CCTV, dropped or toned down all its investigative and analytical programs. Journalists, who had previously suffered only dismissal if they were deemed to have gone too far, were again imprisoned. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 38 journalists were in prison in China in 2016, putting it second behind Turkey for number of reporters jailed. Writers for foreign news media find it harder to get visas and harder to do investigative reporting.

Yet for Xi and his senior colleagues, the largest threat is the social media – which have become more popular as approved journalism becomes again controlled. The online postings are often critical; an anonymous author wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this month that “even a cursory glance at China’s new social media revealed that officials were seen as skinning the people, not serving them.” These public comments could not be allowed in China. This autumn, the authorities began investigating the most popular messaging services – Weibo, Wechat and Baidu - and found that the services were exchanging “terror-related content… rumors… and pornography.”

Yet as this repression continued and deepened, the pushback from society grows, and determined journalists and film makers continue to catalogue the darker sides of China. In 2012, a film called “High Tech, Low Life” followed bloggers on bicycles examining government censorship and the harsh and yawning divisions in Chinese society.

Suppression of forbidden information and commentary is much harder now. The sinologist Perry Link said in 2014, “internally it’s getting more hard to handle, because complaints and demands from below are increasing and are better organized than before.” The middle class now numbers in the hundreds of millions: in five more years – within Xi’s presidential term - McKinsey reckons that 75 percent of China’s urban middle class will enjoy a standard of living approaching that of Italy.

This more independent, and often independent-minded, youngish cohort is rapidly growing, as is their use of social media. The meeting of these two forces is unlikely to favor an attitude of resigned obedience, the more so since many will have been abroad, and many more will read foreign material online.

The result is likely to foster a more inquiring and critical citizenry, tending to question why a political monopoly that once caused the deaths of millions and now chooses for its population what they should read, see and text to each other should rule unchallenged.

The gamble Xi is making, by hugging all power to him, is that he and the forces he controls can limit any such developments. But that will not last. Corruption, pollution, inequality, interfering bureaucracy and controlled media will become prompts for protest. Xi’s choice to strengthen authoritarian rule rather than loosen it will prove to be a large error, for himself, his country and beyond these, the world in which China is such a crucial actor.",Commentary: China's media crackdown won't work,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-china/commentary-chinas-media-crackdown-wont-work-idUSKBN1CW2JW

U.S. police declined to publicly identify the suspect, but a source familiar with the investigation said his name was Sayfullo Saipov, 29.

He had emigrated to the United States in 2010, U.S. media reported. CNN said he had left a note saying he carried out the attack in the name of Islamic State and had shouted “Allahu Akbar” - Arabic for “God is greatest” - after the violence.

“He became religious on the spur of the moment,” Mirrakhmat Muminov, a truck driver and Uzbek community activist who lives in Stow, Ohio, told Reuters by phone.

He said Saipov had previously lived in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan.

“He started studying religion in the United States,” said Muminov, adding that Saipov “couldn’t get enough” of the religious freedoms enjoyed in the United States after living in the strict confines of Uzbekistan.

In Uzbekistan, an authoritarian, predominantly Muslim country in Central Asia ruled by Moscow until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the practice of Islam is tightly controlled by a government wary of radicalism.

Tuesday’s attack shines an uncomfortable light on Islamist militancy in Central Asia which has supplied Islamic State in Syria and Iraq with thousands of fighters. If the attacker’s identity is confirmed, it would be at least the fourth deadly attack by an Uzbek national or ethnic Uzbek this year.

Muminov said Saipov had lived in Stow two or three years ago, that they had met through the local Uzbek community, and that Saipov had also worked there as a truck driver.

Muminov said he had heard about the attack from members of the local Uzbek community, some of whom he said were getting ready to be questioned by the authorities.

He said he had no first-hand information about whether Saipov had carried out the attack and painted a picture of a man who was struggling to make it in the United States, had few friends, and poor communication and English language skills.

”He was withdrawn, nervous, sometimes aggressive. Because of that he was lonely, he lived in his own world. He was not very popular,” said Muminov. He said Saipov’s English was poor and he did not speak Russian very well. Muminov said he had last spoken to Saipov about two months ago.

In a letter of condolence to President Donald Trump on Wednesday, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said Uzbekistan was ready to use “all its resources” to help investigate the New York attack.

It was the bloodiest single attack on New Yorkers since the Sept. 11, 2001, suicide hijackings of jetliners steered into the World Trade Center. It poses a challenge for Mirziyoyev, who assumed office at the end of 2016 and is trying to slowly open up his country after decades of authoritarian rule.

The British lender said in July that it was talking to Irish regulators about extending its activities in Dublin in preparation for when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.

Staley said the bank will relicense all of its branches in Europe so they become part of their Irish business but they are having to make these changes without clear direction from London or Brussels on what they need to do.

“Like all of us, we are in sway to the desires and wishes of the political bodies and I have no idea how that will go,” Staley said speaking at an event in Westminster, close to the British parliament.

“I think there is a clear recognition of the importance of the United Kingdom but the political reality that we all have to deal with, we will make adjustments,” the American added.

Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein made similar comments about the political uncertainty on Monday, when he said a lot of things were out of the bank’s control when it came to building up its new European headquarters in London.

Unless Britain negotiates new trading relations with the EU, banks, insurers and fund managers could be locked out of the bloc’s markets when it leaves.

Bank of England Deputy Governor Sam Woods said on Wednesday that job losses totalling 75,000 in banking and insurance because of Brexit were plausible.

London dominates global currency trading and is Europe’s main finance hub. Overall the sector employs more than a million people across Britain.

Some firms have started to move staff out of London, while others are waiting until early 2018 to see if Britain and the EU agree transitional arrangements to smooth Brexit.

Staley was however optimistic that London would remain at the centre of European capital markets.

Roma had won only three of their previous 19 matches in the competition before Tuesday’s game. Their poor series of results included a 7-1 home defeat by Bayern Munich, a 6-1 thumping at Barcelona and a 3-0 home defeat by Porto, which cost them a place in last season’s group stage.

Go further back and a 7-1 defeat against Manchester United also sticks in the memory.

“We said in the dressing room before the match that we have not had many great nights in the Champions League and there have been a few where we have been battered,” captain Daniele De Rossi said.

“Few believed in us, but we are top of the group and deservedly. But we don’t win matches like this so we can take photos and put them on the mantelpiece; we must to push on from here.”

Roma lead Group C with eight points from four games and are one win away from a place in the last 16.

They have won eight out of 10 matches in the league and not conceded a goal in their last four outings in all competitions.

Yet they started the season amid uncertainty.

Two of their key players, winger Mohamed Salah and defender Antonio Ruediger, left during the transfer window and, for the first time since 1993, there was no Francesco Totti in the squad, the talismanic player having retired at the age of 40.

Coach Luciano Spalletti also departed despite guiding them to second place in Serie A with a record points haul last season and was replaced by Eusebio Di Francesco, who had no previous experience coaching a big club.

But the 48-year-old has galvanised the team and the players have adapted quickly to his 4-3-3 formation.

“I like the results and the way we are trying to play,” said De Rossi.

“The coach has changed the way we confront the opponent. We are always aggressive, against everyone, even against teams that in the past we would have waited and been timid with.”

Remembering their goaless draw at home to Atletico Madrid in September, De Rossi was quick to point out that opinions can change very quickly in football.

“We didn’t deserve the stick we got for that result and we mustn’t get carried away now,” he said.

“Football is much more difficult that it seems when people are talking about it in a bar.”",Roma make peace with the Champions League,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-champions-rom/roma-make-peace-with-the-champions-league-idUKKBN1D145Q

If Puigdemont fails to answer Thursday’s High Court summons, an arrest warrant could be issued that would make it virtually impossible for him to stand in a snap regional election called by the Spanish government for Dec. 21.

There was currently no arrest warrant out for Puigdemont, the lawyer, Paul Bekaert, told Associated Press.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Puigdemont and his government on Friday, hours after the Catalan parliament made a unilateral declaration of independence -- a vote boycotted by the opposition and declared illegal by Spanish courts.

On Monday, Spain’s state prosecutor filed charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds against Puigdemont for defying the central government by holding an referendum on secession on Oct. 1 and later proclaiming independence.

Puigdemont traveled to Belgium at the weekend with other members of the dismissed Catalan administration and hired a lawyer.

“(He) is not going to Madrid and I suggest that they question him here in Belgium. It is possible,” Bekaert told AP, adding there were provisions in the law that allowed his questioning outside Spain.

The High Court summoned Puigdemont and 13 other former members of the Catalan government to testify in Madrid on Thursday and Friday on the prosecutor’s charges.

A judge will then decide whether those called to testify should go to jail pending an investigation that could take several years and potentially lead to a trial. The judge might also grant them conditional bail or order them to surrender their passports.

If Puigdemont and his associates did not turn up, the judge might also order them jailed as a flight risk.

The courts have also told the Catalan secessionist leaders to deposit 6.2 million euros ($7.2 million) by Friday to cover potential liabilities.

“OFF TO PRISON”?

Three former Catalan government advisors returned to Spain from Belgium late on Tuesday and were greeted at Barcelona’s international airport by a small crowd chanting “off to prison”.

Puigdemont and four others were not among those returning to Spain. He said on Tuesday he would only go back to Spain when given unspecified “guarantees” by the Spanish government.

Wednesday is a national holiday in Spain and government offices are closed, giving a brief respite in Spain’s gravest political crisis since its return to democracy some four decades ago.

Following a tumultuous month, attention is also gradually turning to the December election, called by Rajoy when Madrid took over control of the previously autonomous region.

Puigdemont said in Brussels on Tuesday he accepted the election and the Madrid government said he was welcome to stand, though legal proceedings might prevent that.

Uncertainty over how the crisis will play out has prompted more than 1,800 Catalonia-based companies to move their legal headquarters out of the region and the government to lower its country-wide economic forecasts for next year.

On Wednesday, rating agency Moody’s said the declaration of independence and the suspension of self rule were credit negative for the region and the country, and that associated uncertainty would damage sentiment and consumer spending.

Moody’s raised Spain’s credit rating to Baa2 in 2014 as the country emerged from a prolonged economic slump.

On Tuesday, Moody’s affirmed Catalonia’s long-term issuer and debt ratings of Ba3, saying the government’s reinforced control compensated for the increased risks, in particular the region’s rapidly deteriorating business climate.",Ousted Catalan leader will not return to Spain to testify: lawyer,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CZ0IN

The report said current plans for the modernization of the aging planes, ships and missile silos that make up the U.S. nuclear arsenal would cost 50 percent more than if the U.S. only operated and maintained its current equipment in the field.

The CBO study reviewed the Obama’s Administration’s plans for modernization of the nuclear arsenal. President Donald Trump in January directed Secretary of Defense James Mattis to conduct his own review the U.S. nuclear forces. The results could be published in the coming months.

U.S. House Armed Services Committee member Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington, said of the Obama-era plan: “Congress still doesn’t seem to have any answers as to how we will pay for this effort, or what the trade-offs with other national security efforts will be.”

The report said costs would rise from $29 billion in 2017 to $47 billion in 2027, before peaking at around $50 billion a year through the early 2030s.

Trump has said he wants to ensure the U.S. nuclear arsenal is at the “top of the pack,” saying the United States has fallen behind in its weapons capacity.

U.S. officials have noted that America’s nuclear modernization is lagging behind Russia’s upgrade of its own nuclear triad.

General Paul Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress in August he believed Moscow was already two-thirds of the way through its nuclear modernization process.

In August, the U.S. Air Force awarded Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp separate contracts to continue development work on the replacement of the aging Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system one leg of the nuclear triad.

The disclosure by Bex Bailey, 25, is the most serious to emerge from a wave of allegations of sexual misconduct by powerful men that have swept through British politics in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has ordered an investigation into the allegation, said Bailey was not given support from the party when she reported what had happened.

“Bex Bailey has shown incredible bravery by talking publicly about what has happened to her and has my full support and solidarity,” he said in a statement on his Facebook page.

“There will be no tolerance in the Labour Party for sexism, harassment or abuse. Whatever it takes, we are absolutely committed to rooting it out.”

A party spokesman said: “We would strongly recommend that the police investigate the allegations of criminal actions that Bex Bailey has made.”

Bailey told BBC radio on Tuesday that she was raped in 2011 by someone in the party who was senior to her. She said she had tried to pretend it hadn’t happened and had not reported it to police at the time.

“I was scared. I felt ashamed. I know that the Labour Party, like any family, loves a good gossip, and I didn’t want people to know and I also was worried that I wouldn’t be believed if I did,” she said.

Two years later, she told a senior party staff member, and it was suggested to her that she should not report it as it might damage her if she did. She was given no advice on what she should do next.

“That might be their genuine view, it might be that that was the case, in which case that shows that we have a serious problem in politics with this issue anyway,” said Bailey, a former member of Labour’s National Executive Committee.

She called for an independent agency such as a charity to deal with allegations rather than someone within the party “who is inclined to be loyal to the Labour Party”.

Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered investigations into two of her ministers after allegations were made against them.

The massive data breach, believed to affect almost the entire population of Malaysia, was first reported last month by Lowyat.net, a local technology news website. The website said it had received a tip-off that someone was trying to sell huge databases of personal information on its forums.

The country’s internet regulator, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), was looking into the matter with the police, Communications and Multimedia Minister Salleh Said Keruak said on Wednesday.

“We have identified several potential sources of the leak and we should be able to complete the probe soon,” Salleh told reporters at parliament.

The leaked data included lists of mobile phone numbers, identification card numbers, home addresses, and SIM card data of 46.2 million customers from at least 12 Malaysian mobile phone and mobile virtual network operators (MVNO).

Cybersecurity researchers said the leaked data was extensive enough to allow criminals to create fraudulent identities to make online purchases.

Justin Lie, CEO of Cashshield, a Singapore-based anti-fraud company, compared the Malaysian case in its “degree of complexity” to the cyber attack on U.S. credit-scoring agency Equifax Inc, which said in September that cyber criminals had stolen sensitive information from 145.5 million people.

“Now these hackers have more quality information such as birth dates, IC numbers, mobile numbers, email address and passwords,” Lie said about the Malaysian attack.

Customers of Malaysia’s biggest mobile service providers, including Maxis (MXSC.KL), Axiata Group’s Celcom (AXIA.KL) and DiGi (DSOM.KL), among others, were affected.

MCMC’s chief operating officer Mazlan Ismail said on Tuesday the regulator had met with local telecommunications companies to seek their cooperation in the probe, according to state news agency Bernama.

Celcom, Maxis and Digi said in separate statements they were cooperating with authorities on the investigation.

“ALMOST EVERY MALAYSIAN”

According to a Singapore-based cybersecurity researcher, the leaked database was initially being sold on several underground forums for 1 bitcoin, which was trading on Wednesday at around $6,500. At least one other user was posting a link for anyone to download it for free.

The researcher, who declined to be named, said he had seen at least 10 people on an online forum in the “dark web” download the data before it was taken offline.

“Discussion in the dark web shows a huge interest,” he said.

Time stamps indicate the leaked data was last updated between May and July 2014, Lowyat.net said.

“We are urging the telco and MVNO companies mentioned above to alert, and start immediately replacing the SIM cards, of all affected customers, especially those who have not updated their SIM cards since 2014,” Lowyat.net said in a post.

Malaysia’s population is around 32 million, but many have several mobile numbers. The lists are also believed to include inactive numbers and temporary ones bought by visiting foreigners, The Star newspaper reported.

Bryce Boland, FireEye’s chief technology officer in Asia Pacific, said if the data was widely available as suspected, it could be used for identity fraud and scams.

“This stolen data may ultimately impact almost every Malaysian,” he said.

The data also includes private information of more than 80,000 individuals leaked from the records of the Malaysian Medical Council, the Malaysian Medical Association, and the Malaysian Dental Association, Lowyat.net said.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

No se han conocido muchos detalles más sobre el sospechoso de 29 años desde el incidente del martes por la tarde en Manhattan, a pocas manzanas del lugar de los ataques del 11 de septiembre de 2001 contra las Torres Gemelas del World Trade Center.

The Orange County seat held by Rohrabacher is key to Democrats’ hopes to increase their numbers in the U.S. House of Representatives in next year’s elections. Neuroscientist Hans Keirstead, a stem cell researcher and entrepreneur from Laguna Beach, is one of seven Democrats aiming to beat him, according to the Federal Election Commission.

“We’ve got a Russian-tainted Congressman taking Russian-tainted money from Manafort,” Keirstead said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. “Something has to be put straight here.”

Federal investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election on Monday charged Manafort, a lobbyist and former Trump campaign manager, with money laundering.

Rohrabacher, a senior member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, has frequently praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and was considered for a role in U.S. President Donald Trump’s cabinet.

His Southern California base in Orange County was for decades a Republican stronghold and a center of support for Ronald Reagan. Reliably conservative voters there have sent Rohrabacher to the House for nearly 30 years.

But the 48th Congressional district has undergone profound demographic shifts in recent years, and it is now one of nine Republican districts in California that Democrats have targeted. Hillary Clinton beat Trump in the district in 2016, winning 152,000 votes compared to his 146,600.

“These are people who care about the environment, care about social issues,” said Drew Godinich, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in California. “Donald Trump and Donald Trump’s Republican Party are no longer a good match for them.”

Democrats’ success in the district, however, is far from assured. Despite a tilt toward Clinton for the presidency, voters there chose Rohrabacher over Democrat Suzanne Savary by more than six percentage points in 2016.

Other data on Wednesday showed a surge in private sector hiring, indicating that job growth rebounded last month after being depressed in September as hurricanes Harvey and Irma left some workers temporarily unemployed.

Manufacturing and labor strength likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to increase interest rates in December. The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise rates when policymakers conclude a two-day meeting later on Wednesday.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity slipped to a reading of 58.7 last month from 60.8 in September, which was the highest since May 2004. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.

September’s jump in the index was driven by supply chain disruptions, especially in the chemical products sector. The supply bottlenecks, which also pushed up prices of raw materials, resulted in a longer delivery times.

Longer suppliers’ delivery times are normally associated with increased activity, which is a positive contribution to the ISM index. The ISM’s supplier deliveries sub-index fell to 61.4 last month after soaring to 64.4 in September.

The survey’s prices paid sub-index dropped to 68.5 after racing to 71.5 in September, which was the highest reading since May 2011. The production sub-index slipped 1.2 points to a reading of 61.0 in October and a gauge of new orders fell to 63.4. A measure of factory employment dipped to 59.8 from 60.3 in September, which was the highest level since 2011.

Manufacturing is being supported by a strengthening global economy and weakening U.S. dollar.

PRIVATE PAYROLLS SURGE

Separately, the ADP National Employment Report showed private employers hired 235,000 workers last month, the most in seven months, after increasing payrolls by 110,000 jobs in September.

The ADP report, which is jointly produced with Moody’s Analytics, is not a good predictor of the private payrolls component of the employment report. It, however, supported expectations of a sharp rebound in employment last month after nonfarm payrolls declined by 33,000 jobs in September.

Prices for U.S. government bonds were trading higher and the dollar rose against a basket of currencies.

A third report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending increased 0.3 percent to $1.22 trillion as a surge in public construction outlays offset the third straight monthly decline in investment in private projects.

But August’s construction outlays were revised down to show a 0.1 percent gain instead of the previously reported 0.5 percent rise. Construction spending increased 2.0 percent on a year-on-year basis.

In September, investment on private construction projects fell 0.4 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in August. It was the third straight monthly drop in private construction outlays and reflected a 0.8 percent decline in spending on private nonresidential projects. Spending on nonresidential projects in September was the lowest since April 2016.

Spending on nonresidential structures has now declined for four consecutive months. Spending on oil drilling has been slowing in recent months amid moderate gains in oil prices and ample crude supplies. Spending on residential structures was unchanged in September.

The data could impact the government’s gross domestic product estimate for the third quarter published last week. The government’s advance estimate put economic growth at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the July-September quarter, with both residential and nonresidential structures subtracting from output.

In September, outlays on public construction projects jumped 2.6 percent after rising 0.7 percent in August. Spending on state and local government construction projects climbed 2.5 percent.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N) rose about 1 percent, while Goldman Sachs’ (GS.N) 1.5 percent increase gave the biggest boost to the Dow.

The rise was also supported by Facebook’s (FB.O) 1.4 percent gain ahead of its earnings report.

U.S. private employers hired 235,000 workers in October, the most since March and exceeding a median forecast of 200,000 among economists polled by Reuters, the ADP National Employment Report showed.

“We’re in a very positive environment,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey.

“Economic data and earnings continue to remain a reason for optimism. The market will look for signs of a robust economy, and I think the momentum is in place.”

Following the strong ADP data, focus shifts to Friday’s non-farm payrolls report for October. The data will reveal if the labor market has strengthened after a hurricane-ravaged September.

Third-quarter earnings have been largely positive, with 72.9 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported topping profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is above the 72 percent profit-beat rate in the past four quarters.

O segundo maior banco privado do país anunciou nesta quarta-feira que seu lucro líquido ajustado do período somou 4,81 bilhões de reais, avanço sequencial de 2,3 por cento e de 7,8 por cento na comparação ano a ano. Em termos líquidos, o lucro de 2,88 bilhões de reais representou queda de 26,3 por cento sobre o trimestre anterior e de 10,9 por cento ante mesma etapa de 2016.

A despesa com provisões para perdas com inadimplência caiu 23,1 por cento e 33,4 por cento nas comparações trimestral e anual, respectivamente, a 3,82 bilhões de reais.

Esse dado veio acompanhado de melhora na qualidade da carteira do Bradesco, com o índice de inadimplência acima de 90 dias recuando a 4,8 por cento, queda de 0,1 ponto percentual em relação ao trimestre anterior e de 0,6 ponto contra um ano antes.

Isso ocorreu mesmo com o estoque de financiamentos recuando pelo quarto trimestre consecutivo. No fim de setembro, as operações de crédito do Bradesco totalizavam 486,86 bilhões de reais, recuo de 1,4 por cento em três meses e de 6,7 por cento ano a ano.

O recuo nos empréstimos atingiu a margem financeira, que teve redução de 5,7 por cento na medição trimestre a trimestre, para 14,6 bilhões de reais. Essa linha foi pressionada também por uma baixa contábil relativa ao ajuste de preços de ativos financeiros, que subiu 520 milhões de reais contra o segundo trimestre.

Em contrapartida, o banco teve queda sequencial de 2,7 por cento nas despesas de pessoal, para 4,83 bilhões de reais, já computando os efeitos de um plano de demissão incentivada realizado em agosto, que teve 7,4 mil adesões.

No conjunto, as despesas administrativas recuaram 3,9 por cento em 12 meses, a 9,86 bilhões de reais, refletindo entre outros fatores a redução de quase 500 agências no período. O Bradesco, que no ano passado selou a integração do HSBC, comprado um ano antes, vem gradualmente ajustando sua estrutura enquanto tenta tornar seus canais de atendimento mais digitais.

Em outra frente, o banco viu suas receitas de prestação de serviços subirem 4,3 por cento trimestre a trimestre e 5 por cento sobre o mesmo período de 2016, para 7,82 bilhões de reais.

Esse conjunto levou a uma rentabilidade sobre o patrimônio líquido de 18,1 por cento de julho a setembro, recuo de 0,1 ponto contra o trimestre anterior, mas alta de 0,5 ponto sobre mesma etapa de 2016.

Os números vão numa direção similar à mostrada pelo rival maior Itaú Unibanco, que na véspera reportou que seu lucro do terceiro trimestre tinha crescido com ajuda da queda nas despesas com provisões para perdas e administrativas.

O Bradesco, que no mês passado anunciou a renúncia do presidente do conselho de administração, Lazaro Brandão, função que passou a ser acumulada pelo presidente-executivo Luiz Carlos Trabuco, comentará os resultados em teleconferência com analistas no final da manhã desta quarta-feira.

The two groups have approached Oi about purchasing the company once it emerges from bankruptcy protection, in a process that would involve a capital injection, an executive told Reuters in September.

Grace Mendonça, the solicitor-general, is part of a government working group that is trying to assuage differences between shareholders and creditors before a key Nov. 10 meeting in which bondholders will vote on a restructuring plan. The government has billions of dollars tied up in the company through state banks and unpaid regulatory fines.

TPG and China Telecom are interested in taking over the company, the sole fixed-line operator in a third of the country’s 5,500 municipalities, via a 10 billion-real (£2.3 billion) capital injection, newspaper Folha de São Paulo reported.

As part of the deal, TPG would be the majority partner and China Telecom would take a minority stake, a source told Reuters.

At the meeting, the groups will condition their bid on a new telecoms reform going into effect, Folha reported. The regulatory overhaul would make more flexible government requirements for investments by telecoms operators, analysts say.

They also will require renegotiation of 20 billion reais in outstanding regulatory fines that the company holds.

China Telecom will offer to construct fibre optic cable to the homes of clients in more than 2,000 municipalities, the newspaper reported. After that, it said, China Telecom would discuss a potential tie-up with Brazilian competitor TIM Participações SA.

A senior Bangladesh home ministry official described the accusation as outragous.

More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled predominantly Buddhist Myanmar to neighbouring Bangladesh since late August to escape violence that accompanied a brutal military counter-insurgency operation after Rohingya militant attacks on security posts in Myanmar’s Rakhine State.

Stung by international criticism and accusations of ethnic cleansing, Myanmar’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has said Rohingya refugees who can prove they were resident will be accepted back.

But for now, the flow of people is one-way, with Rohingya still preferring to risk being destitute in Bangladesh rather than stay in Myanmar in fear of their lives.

Zaw Htay, a spokesman for Suu Kyi, said Myanmar was ready to begin the repatriation process any time, based along the lines of an agreement with Bangladesh that covered returns of Rohingya to Myanmar in the early 1990s.

He said Bangladesh had yet to accept those terms.

“We are ready to start, but the other side did not accept yet, and the process was delayed. This is the number one fact,” Zaw Htay, Director-General of the Ministry of the State Counsellor’s Office, told journalists on Tuesday.

A memorandum of understanding on border liaison posts was signed with Bangladesh Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan following talks in the Myanmar capital, Naypyitaw, last week, but there was no progress on reviving the old agreement.

Zaw Htay linked the delay by Bangladesh to the money raised so far by the international community to help build gigantic refugee camps for the Rohingya.

“Currently they have got $400 million. Over their receipt of this amount, we are now afraid of delaying the programme of deporting the refugees,” he said in comments carried in a front-page article in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper on Wednesday.

“They have got international subsidies. We are now afraid they would have another consideration as to repatriation,” he said.

A senior Bangladesh home ministry official gave a scathing response.

“Their claim is outrageous. We are stunned,” the official told Reuters in Dhaka. “How can they say this when everyone knows who are making the delay?”

The Bangladesh government issued a statement last Thursday saying that Myanmar had not agreed to 10 points put forward by its minister at last week’s talks, including the full implementation of the recommendations of an Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, chaired by former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, for a sustainable return of Rohingya.

Khan told Bangladesh media last Friday that the two sides were unable to form a joint working group but said it should be set up by the time Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali goes to Myanmar for further talks on Nov. 30.

HAUNTED BY DEATH, INSECURITY

The United Nation’s new interim resident coordinator for Myanmar began his new job on Wednesday. Knut Ostby, a Norwegian, has stepped into the key humanitarian and diplomatic role at a time of growing strains with the Myanmar government over the handling of the Rohingya crisis.

Meantime, while Myanmar and Bangladesh work out how Rohingya can eventually go home, the grim exodus from Myanmar continues.

Seven Rohingya, including three babies and two children, drowned making the perilous sea crossing up the coast from Myanmar to Bangladesh earlier this week.

Given the horrors endured by many Rohingya now living in refugee camps it would be unsurprising if they were in no hurry to return to their old home.

U.N. investigators interviewing Rohingya living in refugee camps in Bangladesh said on Friday they had gathered testimony pointing to a “consistent, methodical pattern” of killings, torture, rape and arson.

The move is a major step towards a return to direct rule from London, which many fear would destabilize the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland.

It also creates a major headache for British Prime Minister Theresa May as she negotiates Britain’s exit from the European Union.

Irish Nationalists Sinn Fein and the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party have shared power in Northern Ireland for a decade under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement, which ended three decades of violence in which 3,600 died.

But Sinn Fein pulled out in January, complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner. The latest round of talks on re-establishing the devolved executive collapsed in failure on Wednesday.

“Sinn Fein is disappointed that the last few weeks of negotiations have ended in failure,” Sinn Fein’s leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O‘Neill, told journalists.

Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said the party was open to dialogue, but only it was meaningful.

Britain’s minister for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire said as there was no immediate prospect of a new executive being formed that he had no choice but to start the process of setting a budget directly from London to ensure funding for essential services.

“This can’t simply continue forever and a day ... There are decisions that have been stored up that have to be taken,” he told journalists.

The budget process could be handed back if agreement is reached between the two parties, he added.

IRISH ROLE?

In a bid to put pressure on the politicians, Brokenshire said he would take advice as to whether the salaries of the deputies in the Northern Ireland devolved parliament should be cut while there is no executive.

He said such a move would require legislation in the British parliament at Westminster.

The budget move also revives the question of what role the government of the neighboring Republic of Ireland should have in the governance of Northern Ireland if power-sharing collapses.

Dublin argues that under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement it should have a role in the direct running of the region, which borders Ireland, if power-sharing breaks down.

Foreign Minister Simon Coveney in September said “there can be no British-only direct rule,” which prompted a British government spokesman to say Britain would “never countenance” joint authority.

Sinn Fein on Wednesday called on Ireland to play a role, saying the British and Irish governments should together “act urgently to deliver equality” in Northern Ireland.

Coveney on Wednesday said the collapse of talks was “regrettable and deeply concerning” and that direct rule could complicate relations with London at a time when it is trying to negotiate favorable terms of Britain’s exit from the European Union.

“The prospect of direct rule in Northern Ireland and the Irish government’s insistence on having a role in that - an appropriate role consistent with the Good Friday Agreement - is not where we want to be,” he told RTE radio.",London to set Northern Ireland budget in move towards direct rule,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nireland-politics/london-to-set-northern-ireland-budget-in-move-towards-direct-rule-idUSKBN1D14LA?il=0

If Puigdemont fails to answer Thursday’s High Court summons, an arrest warrant could be issued that would make it virtually impossible for him to stand in a snap regional election called by the Spanish government for Dec. 21.

There was currently no arrest warrant out for Puigdemont, the lawyer, Paul Bekaert, told Associated Press.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Puigdemont and his government on Friday, hours after the Catalan parliament made a unilateral declaration of independence -- a vote boycotted by the opposition and declared illegal by Spanish courts.

On Monday, Spain’s state prosecutor filed charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds against Puigdemont for defying the central government by holding an referendum on secession on Oct. 1 and later proclaiming independence.

Puigdemont traveled to Belgium at the weekend with other members of the dismissed Catalan administration and hired a lawyer.

“(He) is not going to Madrid and I suggest that they question him here in Belgium. It is possible,” Bekaert told AP, adding there were provisions in the law that allowed his questioning outside Spain.

The High Court summoned Puigdemont and 13 other former members of the Catalan government to testify in Madrid on Thursday and Friday on the prosecutor’s charges.

A judge will then decide whether those called to testify should go to jail pending an investigation that could take several years and potentially lead to a trial. The judge might also grant them conditional bail or order them to surrender their passports.

If Puigdemont and his associates did not turn up, the judge might also order them jailed as a flight risk.

The courts have also told the Catalan secessionist leaders to deposit 6.2 million euros ($7.2 million) by Friday to cover potential liabilities.

“OFF TO PRISON”?

Three former Catalan government advisors returned to Spain from Belgium late on Tuesday and were greeted at Barcelona’s international airport by a small crowd chanting “off to prison”.

Puigdemont and four others were not among those returning to Spain. He said on Tuesday he would only go back to Spain when given unspecified “guarantees” by the Spanish government.

Wednesday is a national holiday in Spain and government offices are closed, giving a brief respite in Spain’s gravest political crisis since its return to democracy some four decades ago.

Following a tumultuous month, attention is also gradually turning to the December election, called by Rajoy when Madrid took over control of the previously autonomous region.

Puigdemont said in Brussels on Tuesday he accepted the election and the Madrid government said he was welcome to stand, though legal proceedings might prevent that.

Uncertainty over how the crisis will play out has prompted more than 1,800 Catalonia-based companies to move their legal headquarters out of the region and the government to lower its country-wide economic forecasts for next year.

On Wednesday, rating agency Moody’s said the declaration of independence and the suspension of self rule were credit negative for the region and the country, and that associated uncertainty would damage sentiment and consumer spending.

Moody’s raised Spain’s credit rating to Baa2 in 2014 as the country emerged from a prolonged economic slump.

On Tuesday, Moody’s affirmed Catalonia’s long-term issuer and debt ratings of Ba3, saying the government’s reinforced control compensated for the increased risks, in particular the region’s rapidly deteriorating business climate.",Ousted Catalan leader will not return to Spain to testify: lawyer,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1D14AH-OCATP

Manufacturing and labor strength likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to increase interest rates in December. The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise rates when policymakers conclude a two-day meeting later on Wednesday.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity slipped to a reading of 58.7 last month from 60.8 in September, which was the highest since May 2004. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.

September’s jump in the index was driven by supply chain disruptions, especially in the chemical products sector. The supply bottlenecks, which also pushed up prices of raw materials, resulted in a longer delivery times.

Longer suppliers’ delivery times are normally associated with increased activity, which is a positive contribution to the ISM index. The ISM’s supplier deliveries sub-index fell to 61.4 last month after soaring to 64.4 in September.

The survey’s prices paid sub-index dropped to 68.5 after racing to 71.5 in September, which was the highest reading since May 2011. The production sub-index slipped 1.2 points to a reading of 61.0 in October and a gauge of new orders fell to 63.4. A measure of factory employment dipped to 59.8 from 60.3 in September, which was the highest level since 2011.

Manufacturing is being supported by a strengthening global economy and weakening U.S. dollar.

PRIVATE PAYROLLS SURGE

Separately, the ADP National Employment Report showed private employers hired 235,000 workers last month, the most in seven months, after increasing payrolls by 110,000 jobs in September.

The ADP report, which is jointly produced with Moody’s Analytics, is not a good predictor of the private payrolls component of the employment report. It, however, supported expectations of a sharp rebound in employment last month after nonfarm payrolls declined by 33,000 jobs in September.

Prices for U.S. government bonds were trading higher and the dollar rose against a basket of currencies.

A third report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending increased 0.3 percent to $1.22 trillion as a surge in public construction outlays offset the third straight monthly decline in investment in private projects.

But August’s construction outlays were revised down to show a 0.1 percent gain instead of the previously reported 0.5 percent rise. Construction spending increased 2.0 percent on a year-on-year basis.

In September, investment on private construction projects fell 0.4 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in August. It was the third straight monthly drop in private construction outlays and reflected a 0.8 percent decline in spending on private nonresidential projects. Spending on nonresidential projects in September was the lowest since April 2016.

Spending on nonresidential structures has now declined for four consecutive months. Spending on oil drilling has been slowing in recent months amid moderate gains in oil prices and ample crude supplies. Spending on residential structures was unchanged in September.

The data could impact the government’s gross domestic product estimate for the third quarter published last week. The government’s advance estimate put economic growth at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the July-September quarter, with both residential and nonresidential structures subtracting from output.

In September, outlays on public construction projects jumped 2.6 percent after rising 0.7 percent in August. Spending on state and local government construction projects climbed 2.5 percent. Federal government construction spending soared 3.4 percent.",U.S. factory activity index eases off 13-1/2-year high,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/u-s-factory-activity-index-eases-off-13-1-2-year-high-idINKBN1D151N?il=0

The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

“It is nice that I get to have someone like David Einhorn and other members of the investment team pick apart their ideas,” he said.",Scooters instead of boardroom 'kabuki': how one fund manager picks winners,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedgefunds-greenlightmasters/scooters-instead-of-boardroom-kabuki-how-one-fund-manager-picks-winners-idUSKBN1930DA

Luther detested these cash-for-grace deals, much as he despised Jewish usurers. He thought that both were motivated by a greed which was antithetical to true religion.

History, though, is full of ironies. Just as the especially poverty-loving Cistercian order of Roman Catholic monks played a major role in advancing mediaeval agriculture, Protestant piety helped lay the foundation for the industrial economy, big welfare states and individualistic consumerism.

Scholars have long wondered why Protestant countries in northern Europe became the seedbeds of both capitalism and government social programmes. One approach is to look at what are sometimes called the three main tenets of Protestant theology.

The first is “sola scriptura”, Latin for “by the Bible alone”. Luther rejected the Roman Catholic reliance on traditional authorities – the Pope, the church’s tradition and Aristotelian philosophy. The rebel was certain that people could find religious truth just by reading the holy book themselves.

For the unity of Christianity, this confidence was a disaster. Protestants have argued bitterly and fought violently over exactly what the Bible teaches. For the development of capitalism, it was a godsend.

Protestant piety encouraged literacy. Personal study of the Bible eventually encouraged analytic study of other matters. And the disregard for established thinking encouraged experimentation. The Protestant ethic, as the German sociologist Max Weber called it in 1905, included openness to socially disruptive new ideas and practices. In other words, Luther’s approach helped create the skills and attitudes needed to reshape the economy.

Of course, the Reformation brought more than faith to the economic development of Europe. The dissolution of monasteries and the subsequent religious wars greatly disrupted traditional society, allowing new economic practices to take root. Protestant demand for spiritual texts also encouraged the development of printing, which eventually helped spread new technologies and to train the workers needed to run the industrial economy.

The second Lutheran principle is “sola fide”. shorthand for the idea that salvation comes from faith rather than good works. In practice, this led to encouraging personal encounters with the Saviour while doubting the spiritual value of supporting charitable institutions.

With that attitude, it is not surprising that over the centuries Protestant countries came to reject the traditional Roman Catholic idea that organised charity was naturally the work of the organised Church. Protestants also lacked the small armies of monks and nuns which Catholics could throw at social problems.

So in Protestant countries the responsibility of charity gradually fell to governments, which took them up as Christians, socialists or some combination of the two. Of course, big government is more a socialist idea than a Protestant one. It is a pretty big stretch to hold Luther even indirectly responsible for Karl Marx and his followers. Still, the Reformation probably aided the transition from the medieval welfare Church to the modern welfare state.

The final central Protestant principle is “sola gratia”, that only God’s freely given grace brings salvation. Weber thought that idea, which is more closely associated with Luther’s leading Protestant rival John Calvin than with Luther himself, was unbearably depressing. The sociologist argued that the popular response to the total spiritual dependence on God’s inscrutable will was a turn to worldly activity. Success in that was taken as a sign of divine favour.

Few scholars now accept Weber’s explanation. Still, a broader interpretation along similar lines has some merit. Calvinist theology did leave each person all alone to worry about salvation, and it did separate out the mysterious gift of grace from the approachable daily life in the world. The eventual result of that combination was probably to encourage what Weber called the spirit of capitalism, an individualistic and disciplined attention to worldly matters.

When that spirit reigns, people work hard and pile up consumption goods instead of spiritual indulgences. Business people and bureaucracies take up some of the social role of priests and sacraments. The economists’ standard assumption about human nature, that people are self-interested materialists, does not seem totally ridiculous.

Luther is certainly not responsible, even indirectly and unintentionally, for all the values and practices of the contemporary economy. For one thing, you don’t have to be Protestant to have the capitalist spirit. Countries with dominant religious traditions ranging from Roman Catholic to Confucian have taken it on. Besides, the modern economy seems to be essentially non-religious.

Nonetheless, the Reformation made a significant contribution to the industrial revolution. Luther and the movement he started helped open up Europe, and eventually the world, to a new age with new values. The modern economy is just one of the fruits of his spiritual and cultural revolution.",Breakingviews - Hadas: Martin Luther's unexpected business legacy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-luther-anniversary-breakingviews/breakingviews-hadas-martin-luthers-unexpected-business-legacy-idUSKBN1D023H

The PYD says it is not fighting to win independence, but to ensure any post-war constitution gives autonomy to regions.
“This vision is counter to reality and stands against the democratic solution,” said Hasan, who was elected to his post in September, replacing Saleh Muslim.
Hasan did not respond to a question of whether the PYD would seek Assad’s removal from office, the core demand of the Syrian opposition.
The invitation to Sochi marks the first time the Syrian Kurds have been asked to attend a major peace conference.","BEIRUT (Reuters) - The head of Syria’s main Kurdish political party indicated on Wednesday his group favors attending a Russian-sponsored peace congress later this month, the first time the Kurds would participate in a major diplomatic push to end the war.

Shahoz Hasan said his Democratic Union Party (PYD) would advocate for its decentralized model for Syria, which it says is the only way to end the six-year-old conflict that has made half of Syrians homeless and killed hundreds of thousands.

“We tabled the democratic federal solution in mid-March of 2016, and without it there are no solutions but only rendering the Syrian crisis permanent,” Hasan, PYD co-chair, said in written responses to questions from Reuters.

Although he did not firmly commit to attending the Nov. 18 peace conference in the Russian Black Sea city of Sochi, he said a majority among the PYD and its allies now favored going: “We are discussing it and the majority view is to attend”.

The PYD has emerged as one of the most powerful players in Syria since the eruption of the civil war in 2011.

Its armed affiliate, the YPG, controls swathes of northern Syria where Kurdish-led local administrations have been set up.

They are allied to the United States as the core of the Syrian Defence Forces (SDF) that, with U.S. air support and ground advisers, drove Islamic State from much of northern Syria and captured the militants’ de facto capital Raqqa last month.

The main rebel groups fighting to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad are planning to boycott the Nov. 18 peace congress in Sochi, which Moscow says will focus on a new constitution.

But attendance by the PYD could be important if it yields steps toward rapprochement between the Russian-backed government and the U.S.-backed Kurds, which between them now control most of the country.

KURDS, GOVERNMENT AVOID CLASHES

The Kurds and the government have largely avoided fighting each other during the multi-sided civil war, with both concentrating instead on fighting other enemies such as Islamic State and Arab rebels hostile to both Assad and the YPG.

The PYD says it is not fighting to win independence, but to ensure any post-war constitution gives autonomy to regions. In September, its administrations held the first part of a three-phase election that will conclude in January with the establishment of a parliament.

Syria’s foreign minister said in September that Kurdish autonomy demands were negotiable. But Damascus recently toughened its stance, declaring on Sunday that Raqqa was under SDF “occupation” and the city would only be considered liberated once the Syrian army recovered it.

Hasan said this showed Damascus was “moving away from the democratic solution” and returning to its old stance “that there is no revolutionary movement in Syria and that the pre-2011 Syria can be recreated”.

“This vision is counter to reality and stands against the democratic solution,” said Hasan, who was elected to his post in September, replacing Saleh Muslim.

He added that solving the crisis required a three-year period of political transition. Hasan did not respond to a question of whether the PYD would seek Assad’s removal from office, the core demand of the Syrian opposition.

The YPG has previously said it would have “no problem with the regime” if Kurdish rights were guaranteed.

The invitation to Sochi marks the first time the Syrian Kurds have been asked to attend a major peace conference. The PYD has been left out of diplomacy in line with the wishes of Turkey, which views it as an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party that has fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey.

Hasan said “the broad lines and fundamental elements that guarantee the solution” should be agreed ahead of time, otherwise the congress would amount to “a media carnival”.","Syrian Kurds favor attending Russia-backed peace talks, party head says",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-pyd/syrian-kurds-favor-attending-russia-backed-peace-talks-party-head-says-idUSKBN1D1518?il=0

The suspect, who was shot by police and arrested moments after the Tuesday rampage in lower Manhattan, left a note saying he carried out the attack in the name of the militant Islamic State group, the New York Times and CNN said.

It was the deadliest single attack on New York City since Sept. 11, 2001, when suicide hijackers crashed two jetliners into the World Trade Center, killing more than 2,600 people. A further 11 people were injured in Tuesday’s attack.

Similar assaults using vehicles as weapons took place in Spain in August and in France and Germany last year.

The suspect allegedly swerved the pickup onto a path filled with pedestrians and bicyclists on a sunny autumn afternoon, mowing down people in his path before slamming into the side of a school bus.

He then exited the vehicle brandishing what turned out to be a paint-ball gun and a pellet gun before a police officer shot him in the abdomen.

The attack, which left crumpled bicycles scattered along the path and victims writhing on the ground, was over in seconds.

The suspect underwent surgery for gunshot wounds.

Police declined to publicly identify the man, but a source familiar with the investigation said his name was Sayfullo Saipov, 29. He reportedly lived in Paterson, New Jersey, a one-time industrial hub about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of lower Manhattan.

He had rented the pickup from a Home Depot Inc hardware store which, according to media accounts, was located in Passaic, just south of Paterson.

U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham urged authorities to treat Saipov as an enemy combatant, a move that would allow investigators to question the man without him having a lawyer present.

ARGENTINE FRIENDS AMONG DEAD

Six victims were pronounced dead at the scene and two more at a nearby hospital, Police Commissioner James O‘Neill said.

Five of the dead were Argentine tourists, visiting New York as part of a group of friends celebrating the 30th anniversary of their high school graduation, the government there said. Belgium’s foreign minister said a Belgian citizen was also among those killed.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said police will be out in force to protect the city’s marathon on Sunday, one of the world’s top road races, which draws some 51,000 runners from around the globe.

“You’ll see a lot of officers with long guns. Other things you won’t see that are protecting us,” he told MSNBC.

A U.S. law enforcement official described the suspect as a U.S. immigrant born in Uzbekistan, a predominantly Muslim country in Central Asia that was once part of the former Soviet Union. CNN and NBC News said he entered the United States in 2010.

Uzbekistan’s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said his government would do all it could to help investigate the “extremely brutal” attack.

Authorities late on Tuesday surrounded a house in Paterson where, according to the New York Times, Saipov was believed to have lived. Paterson, known for its large immigrant population, is home to about 150,000 people, including 25,000 to 30,000 Muslims.

ABC News reported that Saipov had lived in Tampa, Florida. A check of court records related to a traffic citation that Saipov received in eastern Pennsylvania in 2015 showed he listed addresses then in Paterson and Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio.

CNN and other media outlets, citing police officials, reported that the suspect shouted “Allahu Akbar” - Arabic for “God is greatest” - when he jumped out of his truck.

Although authorities from the mayor’s office to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security all swiftly branded the attack an act of terrorism, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo stressed that the suspect was believed to have acted alone.

The New York Times said Saipov had come to the attention of law enforcement in the past. It cited three officials as saying federal authorities knew of Saipov from an unrelated probe, although it was unclear whether that was because he had ties to someone who was under scrutiny or because he was the target of an investigation.

Last week an Uzbekistan citizen living in Brooklyn was sentenced to 15 years in prison for conspiring to support Islamic State.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has pressed for a ban on travelers entering the United States from some predominantly Muslim countries, said on Twitter that he had ordered Homeland Security officials to “step up our already Extreme Vetting Program. Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!”

He also criticized the U.S. visa system, blaming Democrats and saying that he wanted a ‘merit based’ program for immigrants to the United States.

The HIS Markit/CIPS manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 56.3 in October from an upwardly revised 56.0 in September. That exceeded its long-run average and bucked economists’ forecasts in a Reuters poll for a slight decline.

“UK manufacturing made an impressive start to the final quarter of 2017 as increased inflows of new work encouraged firms to ramp up production once again,” said Rob Dobson, a senior economist at HIS Markit, which compiled the data.

“The domestic market remained strong, whereas new export orders increased at a slightly slower pace, the latter showing signs of being hit by the recent strengthening of sterling,” he said.

The pound gained further after Wednesday's data, climbing to a four-and-a-half month high against the euro EURGBP=D3 and its highest in two weeks against the U.S. dollar GBP=D3.

Sterling is still down more than 10 percent from its level before Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, but Barclays banker Mike Rigby said his clients would be wary of further gains after Thursday’s BoE decision.

“Although demand from both home and overseas markets remains robust, manufacturers will have half an eye on what the Monetary Policy Committee decides to do tomorrow,” he said.

British manufacturers enjoyed their strongest growth this year in the three months to the end of September, data showed last week, and Dobson said the sector appeared to be continuing to expand at a quarterly rate of around 1 percent.

The economy overall saw only lacklustre growth in the third quarter, expanding by 0.4 percent for its weakest year-on-year growth in four years.

Nonetheless, most economists polled by Reuters expect the Bank to raise rates for the first time in a decade on Thursday, increasing the Bank Rate to 0.5 percent from a record-low 0.25 percent.

Central bankers are likely to be concerned by signs of growing inflation pressure in the PMI survey. Manufacturers reported that raw-material costs were rising by the most since March, and in turn they were increasing the prices they charged customers at the fastest rate since April.

Headline consumer price inflation reached a five-year high of 3.0 percent in September, and the cost of raw materials rose 8.4 percent on the year, according to official data.

The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, an academic research body, said weaker productivity meant Thursday was likely to mark the start of a series of rate rises from the Bank, peaking at 2 percent in 2021.

The Bank has previously said that any rate rises would be limited and gradual, and most economists polled by Reuters doubt rates will increase at all next year.",UK factories report stronger activity in October - IHS Markit,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economy-pmi/uk-factories-report-stronger-activity-in-october-ihs-markit-idUKKBN1D1468

Roma had won only three of their previous 19 matches in the competition before Tuesday’s game. Their poor series of results included a 7-1 home defeat by Bayern Munich, a 6-1 thumping at Barcelona and a 3-0 home defeat by Porto, which cost them a place in last season’s group stage.

Go further back and a 7-1 defeat against Manchester United also sticks in the memory.

“We said in the dressing room before the match that we have not had many great nights in the Champions League and there have been a few where we have been battered,” captain Daniele De Rossi said.

Roma lead Group C with eight points from four games and are one win away from a place in the last 16.

They have won eight out of 10 matches in the league and not conceded a goal in their last four outings in all competitions.

Yet they started the season amid uncertainty.

Two of their key players, winger Mohamed Salah and defender Antonio Ruediger, left during the transfer window and, for the first time since 1993, there was no Francesco Totti in the squad, the talismanic player having retired at the age of 40.

“The coach has changed the way we confront the opponent. We are always aggressive, against everyone, even against teams that in the past we would have waited and been timid with.”

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

Among the points that Yun has made to his North Korean interlocutors is to “stop testing” nuclear bombs and missiles, the official said.

Using the so-called “New York channel,” Joseph Yun, U.S. negotiator with North Korea, has been in contact with diplomats at Pyongyang’s United Nations mission, the official said, at a time when an exchange of bellicose insults between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has fueled fears of military conflict.

While U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Oct. 17 said he would continue “diplomatic efforts ... until the first bomb drops,” the official’s comments were the clearest sign the United States was directly discussing issues beyond the release of American prisoners, despite Trump having dismissed direct talks as pointless.

There is no sign, however, that the behind-the-scenes communications have improved a relationship vexed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, the death of U.S. university student Otto Warmbier days after his release by Pyongyang in June and the detention of three other Americans.

Word of quiet engagement with Pyongyang comes despite Trump’s comments, North Korea’s weapons advances and suggestions by some U.S. and South Korean officials that Yun’s interactions with North Koreans had been reined in.

“It has not been limited at all, both (in) frequency and substance,” said the senior State Department official.

Among the points that Yun has made to his North Korean interlocutors is to “stop testing” nuclear bombs and missiles, the official said.

North Korea this year conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear detonation and has test-fired a volley of missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that, if perfected, could in theory reach the United States mainland.

The possibility that Pyongyang may be closer to attaching a nuclear warhead to an ICBM has alarmed the Trump administration, which in April unveiled a policy of “maximum pressure and engagement” that has so far failed to deter North Korea.

At the start of Trump’s presidency, Yun’s instructions were limited to seeking the release of U.S. prisoners.

“It is (now) a broader mandate than that,” said the State Department official, declining, however, to address whether authority had been given to discuss North Korea’s nuclear and missile program.

In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China welcomed any dialogue between the United States and North Korea.

“We encourage North Korea and the United States to carry out engagement and dialogue,” Hua told reporters, adding that she hoped talks could help return the issue to a diplomatic track for resolution.

SANCTIONS AND ENGAGEMENT

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has urged all United Nations members to fully and transparently implement sanctions against North Korea, which he said has emerged as a global threat.

Speaking at the United Nations on Sept. 19, Trump vowed to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened the United States or its allies, raising anxieties about the possibility of military conflict.

Twelve days later, after Tillerson said Washington was probing for a diplomatic opening, Trump said on Twitter that his chief diplomat was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man” - his mocking nickname for the North Korean leader.

Democratic U.S. senators introduced a bill on Tuesday they said would prevent Trump from launching a nuclear first strike on North Korea on his own, highlighting the issue days before the Republican’s first presidential trip to Asia.

A high-ranking North Korean defector said in Washington on Tuesday that he backed the Trump administration’s policy of pressuring Pyongyang through sanctions, coupled with “maximum engagement” with the leadership and increased efforts to get information into North Korea to educate its people.

“I strongly believe in the use of soft power before taking any military actions,” Thae Yong Ho, chief of mission at Pyongyang’s embassy in London until he defected in 2016, told the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

The New York channel is one of the few conduits the United States has for communicating with North Korea, which has itself made clear it has little interest in serious talks before it develops a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the continental United States.

The last high-level contact between Yun and the North Koreans was when he traveled to North Korea in June to secure the release of Warmbier, who died shortly after he returned home in a coma, the State Department official said.

The Trump administration has demanded North Korea release three other U.S. citizens: missionary Kim Dong Chul and academics Tony Kim and Kim Hak Song.

Warmbier’s death was a factor in the chilling of U.S.-North Korean contacts around that time but the biggest impact came from Pyongyang’s stepped-up testing, the official said.

The official said, however, that “the preferred endpoint is not a war but some kind of diplomatic settlement” and suggestions that Washington is setting up a binary choice for Pyongyang to capitulate diplomatically or military action were “misleading.”

Diplomacy, the official said, “has a lot more room to go.”

“In consultation with President Trump and our leadership team, we have decided to release the bill text on Thursday,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said in a statement.

“We are pleased with the progress we are making and we remain on schedule to take action and approve a bill at our Committee beginning next week,” the Republican lawmaker added.

In a tweet on Tuesday night before Brady’s statement, President Donald Trump said: “The Republican House members are working hard (and late) toward the Massive Tax Cuts that they know you deserve. These will be biggest ever!”

Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, are looking to tax reform for their first legislative victory since Trump took office in January. Democrats say the Trump tax plan is a giveaway to corporations and the rich.

Two sources with knowledge of the discussions said earlier on Tuesday that the bill, which had been expected on Wednesday, would emerge a day later to give lawmakers additional time to address differences over the tax treatment of retirement savings accounts and a deduction for state and local tax payments.

Trump and other top Republicans have proposed a plan that would cut taxes for corporations, small businesses and individuals by up to $6 trillion over a decade and pay for the reductions in part by eliminating trillions of dollars in deductions and other tax breaks that are often fiercely defended.

The U.S. tax code has not undergone a major overhaul since 1986, when Republican Ronald Reagan was president.

COMPROMISE?

Earlier on Tuesday, House Republicans appeared to be nearing a deal on state and local taxes that would preserve a federal deduction for property taxes but not income taxes, potentially removing a major obstacle.

Republican Representative Tom Reed of New York said the “sweet spot” compromise was gaining support among high-tax state lawmakers who have signaled their opposition to a proposal to repeal the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction.

Another New York Republican saw things differently.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

“I‘m still inclined to be opposed to it. The income tax is a major factor,” said Representative Peter King.

“This is going to affect our country for the next 20 years, for good or bad. I think the last time we did tax reform, there was like two years of debate. We’re going to have 10 days,” he said.

The SALT compromise would reduce, but not eliminate, a disproportional tax impact on upper middle-class families in high-income tax states such as New York, New Jersey and California. Those states send enough Republicans to Congress to derail a tax bill.

The House bill is expected to cut the top corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and phase out the estate tax paid by the wealthiest taxpayers over two or three years. It may also set a repatriation rate for U.S. businesses with profits overseas, according to a source familiar with a Tuesday meeting between House Speaker Paul Ryan and conservative groups.

It is also likely to set a 15 percent minimum tax on active foreign income of U.S. corporations, according to lobbyists with knowledge of negotiations.

TRUMP, PENCE ENGAGED

As the Trump administration escalated its pro-tax plan campaign, Vice President Mike Pence met with Republicans on Tuesday, while Trump hosted industry leaders and then Ryan, at the White House.

Trump said at the White House he wanted Congress to pass tax reform bills by the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23.

A proposal to limit how much money Americans can direct to their 401(k) retirement accounts and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) on a pre-tax basis is meeting resistance, including from fund managers who handle 54 million such accounts.

Republicans initially proposed capping tax-free 401(k) contributions at $2,400, down from $18,000 in 2017, but the figure is in flux.

“We are either going to strengthen the 401(k)’s and IRA’s so people can save more, or we will leave them as is,” Brady told reporters.

Senator Heidi Heitkamp, one of a few Democrats being courted by Republicans, said she could not support lowering the cap on tax-free retirement contributions. “I will not vote for that,” she told reporters.",Release of House tax bill delayed until Thursday,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/release-of-house-tax-bill-delayed-until-thursday-idUSKBN1D0008

Transport is among the policy areas being thrashed out in talks taking place between Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens, who are aiming to form a coalition by Christmas.

The parties are discussing all policy areas before launching detailed negotiations. While the atmosphere has improved in recent days, there have been few actual deals, with immigration and climate change among the biggest sticking points.

The Greens’ demand on carmakers would go further than software fixes so far agreed between politicians and German car bosses to help repair the industry’s badly damaged reputation.

The future of Germany’s mighty car industry, the country’s biggest exporter and provider of some 800,000 jobs, is a tricky area as it tries to recover from the diesel emissions testing scandal which broke at Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) two years ago.

Despite public concern and planned diesel bans in countries including France and Britain in coming decades, German lawmakers have not yet dared ask the same of its carmakers, such as BMW, VW, Daimler and Porsche who have invested heavily in diesel.

In August, politicians and car bosses agreed to overhaul engine software on 5.3 million diesel cars to cut pollution and avoid bans on polluting vehicles but they stopped short of committing to more expensive hardware modifications.

That may have to change if the Greens share power.

“We won’t meet our targets of getting cleaner air in city centers with software upgrades alone,” Cem Ozdemir, a leader of the Greens, said as he headed into the talks.

“There must also be hardware solutions.”

Ozdemir said the auto industry was going through the biggest transformation process in its history and the car had to be reinvented to make it emission-free and more automated. Public transport must also be expanded, he added.

The conservative bloc, comprising Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and Bavaria’s Christian Social Union (CSU), oppose any demand to ban the combustion engine from 2030.",German Greens make stand on car emissions in coalition talks,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics/german-greens-make-stand-on-car-emissions-in-coalition-talks-idUSKBN1D152F?il=0

The players exchanged early breaks in the final set but Rybarikova clinched the decisive lead in the tiebreak, before sealing the victory on her seventh match point.

“I am happy that I went through this match because conditions were tough and I had some problems with my leg,” Rybarikova said after the match.

“I was saying to myself that I had to win this match because I had so many match points and it would be really cruel to end the season like this.”

Rybarikova improved her record in the Azalea Group to 1-1 after dropping her first match to Julia Goerges on Tuesday.

Le titre du numéro deux mondial des cosmétiques gagne 8,92% à 121,78 dollars vers 15h00 GMT à Wall Street, après un record à 124,75 dollars en tout début de séance.

Le groupe américain table désormais sur un chiffre d‘affaires compris entre 3,63 milliards et 3,69 milliards de dollars (3,12-3,18 milliards d‘euros) au titre de son deuxième trimestre, une fourchette supérieure au consensus qui est actuellement à 3,56 milliards de dollars.

Les ventes du trimestre écoulé ont progressé de 14,2% sur un an, à 3,27 milliards de dollars. Les analystes attendaient en moyenne 3,17 milliards d‘euros, selon le consensus Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Le bénéfice net part du groupe a augmenté à 427 millions de dollars, soit 1,14 dollar par action, contre 294 millions de dollars (79 cents par action) un an plus tôt.

Hors éléments exceptionnels, le bénéfice net est ressorti à 1,21 dollar, à comparer à un consensus de 97 cents.

Ses récentes acquisitions et la demande sur les marché hong-kongais, chinois et français ont largement contribué à ces résultats, souligne Nik Modi, analyste chez RBC Capital Markets.

Estée Lauder, fondé il y a 72 ans, a racheté l‘an dernier Too Faced et BECCA Cosmetics, deux marques très populaires auprès des jeunes adultes.

Dans cette dernière région, Estée Lauder et les autres groupes de cosmétiques profitent d‘une demande croissante, particulièrement en Chine où la population voyage de plus en plus et fréquente des boutiques duty-free dans les aéroports ou des enseignes de produits de beauté comme Ulta Beauty.

The challenge for Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is to persuade her to actually buy one.

“I‘m definitely interested, but don’t currently plan to get one,” said Gu, whose monthly salary of a little over 6,000 yuan ($905.36) is less than the anniversary model’s starting price in China of 8,388 yuan.

For Apple, which is looking to rev up sales in China after several quarters of declining revenue there, the test is that Gu is not alone. While interest in the phone is high, that won’t necessarily translate into sales.

“Price appears to be a major constraint on iPhone X demand, particularly in China,” Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a recent report that showed three-quarters of Chinese respondents were excited by the upcoming launch, but only a quarter said they planned to buy one.

Investors are keen to gauge Chinese demand for the iPhone X, as it is key to reviving Apple’s fortunes in the world’s biggest smartphone market where it has lost some of its sparkle - and market share - as local phone makers have advanced.

The cheaper iPhone 8, which hit the market in September, has faced sluggish sales, but Apple has said that pre-orders for the iPhone X have been “off the charts”.

Apple, due to announce quarterly earnings on Thursday, said it had no immediate comment.

Chatter online on popular Chinese social media platform Weibo (WB.O) also signaled high levels of interest in the new model, though still generally behind levels around the 2014 launch of the very successful iPhone 6.

APPLE “GEEKS”

Xiao Ming, 32, who works for a blockchain start-up in Beijing, stayed up half the night when pre-sales of the iPhone X opened last week. He has also bought the iPhone 8.

“I always try to be one of the first to buy any new iPhone,” he said, adding he likes the new phone’s augmented reality and facial recognition features. “I’ll be very disappointed if I don’t get one on the first day.”

While he plans to buy the new phone, he noted many of his friends were less fussed. “Before, I think a lot of people would try to get it somehow, now it’s mostly the geeks,” he said.

“My friends don’t mind so much if they have an iPhone 8 or a 6, for example, because it looks similar and the price (of the iPhone X) makes you feel nervous.”

Re-sellers and iPhone accessory makers generally agreed there was a buzz about the iPhone X, Apple’s first phone to have a full-screen display and functions such as facial recognition security.

“People are really anticipating this phone because it’s the 10th anniversary version and it has more changes and modifications,” said Gary Yiu, manager of the iGeneration smartphone shop at one Hong Kong mall.

Yiu and three other phone re-sellers there said they had seen strong demand for the phone from mainland clients.

A merchant at the Huaqiangbei electronics hub in Shenzhen, who was offering an iPhone look-a-like called the “E-Feng X” from 1,599 yuan, said sales volumes were “very good”.

Some Chinese re-sellers, however, said they already canceled pre-orders for the iPhone X, concerned there wouldn’t be enough of a supply bottleneck to allow them to charge a steep premium - despite some worries about long waits.

“I saw many friends were posting pictures of themselves successfully ordering the iPhone X, so I canceled mine,” said Tony Tong, 29, a product manager at a tech firm in Beijing, who said he had ordered four phones in the hope of re-selling them for a profit. “The environment is bad for scalpers.”

Apple will hope payment plans and easy access to online credit in China will convince people to buy.

Wang Hao, a 24-year-old engineer in the northeastern port city of Dalian, said he ordered the new phone despite the high price tag. His last phone was an iPhone 6S.

“The cost is about a month’s salary for me,” he told Reuters. “But I‘m just used to it now, and there wasn’t really anything to make me choose another brand.”

The move is a major step towards a return to direct rule from London, which many fear would destabilize the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland.

It also creates a major headache for British Prime Minister Theresa May as she negotiates Britain’s exit from the European Union.

Irish Nationalists Sinn Fein and the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party have shared power in Northern Ireland for a decade under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement, which ended three decades of violence in which 3,600 died.

But Sinn Fein pulled out in January, complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner. The latest round of talks on re-establishing the devolved executive collapsed in failure on Wednesday.

“Sinn Fein is disappointed that the last few weeks of negotiations have ended in failure,” Sinn Fein’s leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O‘Neill, told journalists.

Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said the party was open to dialogue, but only it was meaningful.

Britain’s minister for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire said as there was no immediate prospect of a new executive being formed that he had no choice but to start the process of setting a budget directly from London to ensure funding for essential services.

“This can’t simply continue forever and a day ... There are decisions that have been stored up that have to be taken,” he told journalists.

The budget process could be handed back if agreement is reached between the two parties, he added.

IRISH ROLE?

In a bid to put pressure on the politicians, Brokenshire said he would take advice as to whether the salaries of the deputies in the Northern Ireland devolved parliament should be cut while there is no executive.

He said such a move would require legislation in the British parliament at Westminster.

The budget move also revives the question of what role the government of the neighboring Republic of Ireland should have in the governance of Northern Ireland if power-sharing collapses.

Dublin argues that under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement it should have a role in the direct running of the region, which borders Ireland, if power-sharing breaks down.

Foreign Minister Simon Coveney in September said “there can be no British-only direct rule,” which prompted a British government spokesman to say Britain would “never countenance” joint authority.

Sinn Fein on Wednesday called on Ireland to play a role, saying the British and Irish governments should together “act urgently to deliver equality” in Northern Ireland.

Coveney on Wednesday said the collapse of talks was “regrettable and deeply concerning” and that direct rule could complicate relations with London at a time when it is trying to negotiate favorable terms of Britain’s exit from the European Union.

“The prospect of direct rule in Northern Ireland and the Irish government’s insistence on having a role in that - an appropriate role consistent with the Good Friday Agreement - is not where we want to be,” he told RTE radio.",London to set Northern Ireland budget in move towards direct rule,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-nireland-politics/london-to-set-northern-ireland-budget-in-move-towards-direct-rule-idUKKBN1D14K1?il=0

Der 29-jährige Mann, den die Polizei am Dienstag niederschossen hat, stammt Behördenangaben und Medienberichten zufolge aus dem überwiegend muslimischen Usbekistan und wanderte vor sieben Jahren in die USA ein. Weil die Behörden von einem Terrorakt ausgehen und die Ermittlungen noch am Anfang stehen, wurden nur wenige Informationen bekanntgegeben. So schweigt die Polizei offiziell über die Identität des Mannes, der nach ihren Angaben mit einem Kleintransporter auf einem Radweg zahlreiche Menschen niederfuhr und dann in einen Schulbus raste.

Aus Ermittlerkreisen verlautete, der 29-Jährige sei kein US-Bürger, sein Einwanderungsstatus sei zunächst nicht klar. Die Bundesbehörden seien auf den Mann im Zusammenhang mit anderen Ermittlungen aufmerksam geworden, berichtete die “New York Times” unter Berufung auf drei Insider. Worum es dabei ging, schrieb sie nicht. Der Gouverneur von New York, Andrew Cuomo, wollte sich dazu nicht äußern. “Es ist zu früh, um eine konkrete Antwort zu geben”, sagte er auf einer Pressekonferenz.

Der mutmaßliche Täter wurde im Februar 1988 geboren. Nach seiner Einreise in die USA lebte er vermutlich in Ohio, Florida und New Jersey.

The blockchain, which first emerged as the architecture underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a shared database that updates itself in real-time and can process and settle transactions in minutes using computer algorithms, with no need for third-party verification.

Because it does not require manual processing, nor authentication through intermediaries, banks - both commercial ones and central banks - reckon the technology has the potential to make payments faster, more reliable and easier to audit.

“Natixis believes in the potential of distributed ledger technology for cross-border payments and is exploring several initiatives in that space,” said Frederic Dalibard, head of Digital for Corporate & Investment Banking at Natixis, one of the banks involved in the project.

Other banks that worked on the project - the prototype for which will be released by the end of the year, they said - include Barclays, HBSC and Commerzbank.

There have been other efforts to develop blockchain-based systems for cross-border payments - one of the areas most commonly identified as ripe for blockchain-based innovation, such as a UBS-led initiative to create a “utility settlement coin” that would represent each major currency.

Dalibard said Natixis believed in the particular promise of the R3 project because of the fact that the system’s architecture - which runs on R3’s “Corda” platform - could be adapted when new central bank-issued digital currencies appear.

Although many central banks are looking into issuing digital currencies, the conclusion of many of the biggest - including the European Central Bank, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan - has so far been that blockchain technology is not yet mature enough to power the world’s biggest payment systems.

German bank Berenberg last week wrote in a report that blockchain was an “overhyped technology” that faced important challenges, pointing out that there had so far been very few success stories, despite a huge number of pilots and “proofs of concept” of the technology.

But many continue to believe in its promise. UBS Wealth Management said in a research note this month that blockchain could add as much as $400 billion of annual global economic value by 2027, and that investing in the technology was akin to investing in the internet in the mid-nineties.",Top banks and R3 build blockchain-based payments system,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-banks-blockchain-r3/top-banks-and-r3-build-blockchain-based-payments-system-idUSKBN1D00ZB

Manafort and associate Rick Gates pose a significant flight risk because of the serious nature of the charges, the strong evidence of guilt, their wealth and “their history of deceptive and misleading conduct,” federal prosecutors said in a filing Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Manafort, 68, and Gates, who also worked on Trump’s campaign, pleaded not guilty on Monday in a 12-count indictment, ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government.

The charges came as part of federal special counsel Robert Mueller’s 5-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the 2016 presidential election in Trump’s favor and potential collusion by campaign aides.

The allegations are not related to campaign activities but reveal close ties to Russia, and include activities from 2006 to 2017, which overlaps with the mens’ work on Trump’s campaign.

The two men are under house arrest and have relinquished their U.S. passports, with a $10 million bond set for Manafort and a $5 million bond for Gates.

“Both defendants have substantial ties abroad, including in Ukraine, where both have spent time and have served as agents of its government,” according to the government’s memorandum in support of the conditions of release.

“And both Manafort and Gates have connections to Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs, who have provided millions of dollars to Manafort and Gates.”

The next hearing in the case, set for 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Thursday, will concern the bail conditions that were set at Monday’s arraignment.

Manafort was a longtime U.S. Republican operative before turning his attention to political consulting overseas.

He submitted 10 passport application in the last decade and currently holds three U.S. passports, the memo said.

Asked about the information in the memo, Manafort lawyer Jason Maloni told Reuters on Wednesday his client “looks forward to having these allegations tried before a judge and jury.”

The memo said Manafort’s financial assets were substantial but difficult to quantify because he listed figures on loan applications and other financial documents since 2012 that ranged from $19 million to $136 million.

Manafort and Gates owned or controlled entities and accounts worldwide including in Cyprus, Grenadines, Seychelles and England, it said.

With less than 100 days before the Games begin, barely a third of the tickets have been sold.

“It’s a bummer,” said 55-year-old motel owner Oh Young-whyan, who spent about $360,000 refurbishing his 15-room property close to the Olympics Plaza.

Oh, other hotel owners and local authorities say political tensions with North Korea and China have chilled foreign interest in the Games, which open on Feb. 9 just 80 km (50 miles) from the world’s most heavily fortified border.

Tourists are reluctant to commit to the event as North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, and U.S. President Donald Trump trade insults and threats of mutual destruction after the North conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test in September.

Ticket sales are weak, with 341,327 sold, or 32 percent of the total on offer, as of Oct. 24 - much weaker than during the run-up to the last winter Games in Sochi, Russia. More than 70 percent of Sochi’s tickets were sold before the opening ceremony.

Pyeongchang Organising Committee Secretary General Yeo Hyung-koo says there is still time to catch up. The Olympics torch relay, which began in Korea on Wednesday, will ignite domestic interest, he said.

Local business are also putting on a brave face, hoping for a late surge in interest, especially from Chinese tourists after Beijing this week set aside a dispute with Seoul over an anti-missile system.

“We still have 100 days so I‘m not that worried,” said Oh, owner of the Daekyanryung-sanbang motel, where Olympics banners were hung inside and out.

NO PASSENGERS, EMPTY AIRPORT

Nearby, a bus terminal which undertook a $447,000 makeover in preparation for the Olympics was largely empty, with only one Chinese couple and a handful of locals seen waiting for buses.

Buses bound for Seoul in the past used to have as many as 38 foreign passengers, half of them Chinese, but nowadays some buses have no passengers, said Kim Moo-gyu, the owner of the terminal.

Before this week’s diplomatic breakthrough, Chinese authorities had unofficially imposed a ban on tour groups visiting South Korea since March and stopped charter flights.

The number of Chinese visitors, which accounted for nearly half of all foreign tourists into South Korea last year, slumped 61 percent from March to September from the same period last year, official data shows.

Yangyang International Airport, the only international airport near Pyengchang, was quiet, with flight routes from Shanghai and seven other Chinese cities all cut since last November.

‘LOTS OF LOSSES’

Min Byong-kwan, the chief executive of Phoenix Hotels & Resorts, is counting on a pick-up. The ski resort spent tens of millions of dollars building six Olympics courses and renovating some 1,000 rooms to accommodate foreign officials during the Olympics.

“We are making a lot of investments - and booking a lot of losses - through the Olympics,” Min said.

“It is regrettable that the Olympics boom is falling short of our expectations so far.” But he added: “I expect the boom to experience exponential growth for the remaining 100 days.”

Pyeongchang, carved out of pine-covered slopes in northeast Gangwon province, is being festooned with banners reading “Passion Connected”, a slogan reflecting the hosts’ aim to dissolve tensions with a show of sporting goodwill.

Organizers hope athletes from North Korea, still technically at war with the South, will take part and share the mountain with American and Chinese athletes. The North has yet to confirm if it will send a team.

Han Do-sam, who sells seafood at the popular Sokcho fish market, said the improvement in ties between Beijing and Seoul was a good start.

“We hope ... it will help more foreign tourists come here when they visit for the Olympics,” Han said.

UNLIKELY TO MEET TARGET

South Korea planned to use the Olympics to introduce foreign tourism to Gangwon province. Provincial authorities set an ambitious goal of attracting 5 million visitors next year, up from an original expectation of around 3 million this year.

But Gangwon governor Choi Moon-Soon said he doubted the 2018 target would be met.

“So far we have seen declines in visits from China and Japan, which are directly affected by the North’s nuclear issue,” Choi told Reuters. “Southeastern Asian group tourists are showing signs of cancelling trips as well.”

Song Sung-sup, director of Goodmorning Travel, which specializes in Chinese tourism, was also glum, despite Tuesday’s surprise detente between South Korea and China.

“Unless China lifts a ban on charter flights to any local airport in South Korea, I‘m a bit skeptical whether signs of easing are clear at the moment,” said Song, who saw sales drop by up to 20 percent due to the frozen ties with China.

Just two years ago, the outlook looked bright.

A Chinese company had committed to build a $431 million luxury resort - China Dream City - an hour’s drive from Pyeongchang.

Pitched at Chinese tourists, it was to provide accommodation during the Games. But construction has still not begun.

Governor Choi said he was also worried about delays to a $450 million project to build a Legoland in the city of Chuncheon, about 145 km (90 miles) from the Games venue.

Legoland operator Merlin Entertainments said last month the resort’s completion date was delayed by three years to 2020 to get final partner funding and “for a lot of Korean twists and turns”, without elaborating.

Merlin CEO Nick Varney joked last month it might help ease tensions, and brighten up prospects for the Games, if Legoland were to promise North Korea’s leader an annual pass to the theme park.

(For a graphic on 'New York truck attack' click tmsnrt.rs/2z3aqZv)","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investigators on Wednesday were focused on an Uzbek immigrant they said killed eight people in New York by driving a rental truck down a riverfront bike path in an attack authorities said had all the hallmarks of terrorism.

The suspect, who was shot by police and arrested moments after the Tuesday rampage in lower Manhattan, left a note saying he carried out the attack in the name of the militant Islamic State group, the New York Times and CNN said.

It was the deadliest single attack on New York City since Sept. 11, 2001, when suicide hijackers crashed two jetliners into the World Trade Center, killing more than 2,600 people. A further 11 people were injured in Tuesday’s attack.

Similar assaults using vehicles as weapons took place in Spain in August and in France and Germany last year.

The suspect allegedly swerved the pickup onto a path filled with pedestrians and bicyclists on a sunny autumn afternoon, mowing down people in his path before slamming into the side of a school bus.

He then exited the vehicle brandishing what turned out to be a paint-ball gun and a pellet gun before a police officer shot him in the abdomen.

The attack, which left crumpled bicycles scattered along the path and victims writhing on the ground, was over in seconds.

The suspect underwent surgery for gunshot wounds.

Police declined to publicly identify the man, but a source familiar with the investigation said his name was Sayfullo Saipov, 29. He reportedly lived in Paterson, New Jersey, a one-time industrial hub about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of lower Manhattan.

He had rented the pickup from a Home Depot Inc hardware store which, according to media accounts, was located in Passaic, just south of Paterson.

U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham urged authorities to treat Saipov as an enemy combatant, a move that would allow investigators to question the man without him having a lawyer present.

ARGENTINE FRIENDS AMONG DEAD

Six victims were pronounced dead at the scene and two more at a nearby hospital, Police Commissioner James O‘Neill said.

Five of the dead were Argentine tourists, visiting New York as part of a group of friends celebrating the 30th anniversary of their high school graduation, the government there said. Belgium’s foreign minister said a Belgian citizen was also among those killed.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said police will be out in force to protect the city’s marathon on Sunday, one of the world’s top road races, which draws some 51,000 runners from around the globe.

“You’ll see a lot of officers with long guns. Other things you won’t see that are protecting us,” he told MSNBC.

A U.S. law enforcement official described the suspect as a U.S. immigrant born in Uzbekistan, a predominantly Muslim country in Central Asia that was once part of the former Soviet Union. CNN and NBC News said he entered the United States in 2010.

Uzbekistan’s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said his government would do all it could to help investigate the “extremely brutal” attack.

Authorities late on Tuesday surrounded a house in Paterson where, according to the New York Times, Saipov was believed to have lived. Paterson, known for its large immigrant population, is home to about 150,000 people, including 25,000 to 30,000 Muslims.

ABC News reported that Saipov had lived in Tampa, Florida. A check of court records related to a traffic citation that Saipov received in eastern Pennsylvania in 2015 showed he listed addresses then in Paterson and Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio.

CNN and other media outlets, citing police officials, reported that the suspect shouted “Allahu Akbar” - Arabic for “God is greatest” - when he jumped out of his truck.

Although authorities from the mayor’s office to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security all swiftly branded the attack an act of terrorism, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo stressed that the suspect was believed to have acted alone.

The New York Times said Saipov had come to the attention of law enforcement in the past. It cited three officials as saying federal authorities knew of Saipov from an unrelated probe, although it was unclear whether that was because he had ties to someone who was under scrutiny or because he was the target of an investigation.

Last week an Uzbekistan citizen living in Brooklyn was sentenced to 15 years in prison for conspiring to support Islamic State.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has pressed for a ban on travelers entering the United States from some predominantly Muslim countries, said on Twitter that he had ordered Homeland Security officials to “step up our already Extreme Vetting Program.

The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that U.S. Special Operation Forces captured the militant in Libya in the past few days.

Two of the officials identified him as Mustafa al-Imam and said he had played a role in the attack and the ambassador’s death.

The officials said the man was now in the custody of the Department of Justice and being transported back to the United States by the military.

They added that the operation was authorized by President Donald Trump and had notified the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord.

In a statement, Trump said al-Imam “will face justice in the United States for his alleged role in the September 11, 2012 attacks.”[nW1N1N000Y]

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said al-Imam was now in custody and the United States would continue to investigate and identify those who were involved in the attack.

The appropriate Congressional committees and the families of the Americans killed in the 2012 attack had also been notified, the officials said.

The attack on the embassy was the topic of numerous congressional hearings, with Republican lawmakers critical of the way in which then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton responded to the attack.

Earlier this month, U.S. prosecutors opened their case against the suspected ringleader, Ahmed Abu Khatallah.

Khatallah had been awaiting trial since 2014, when he was captured by a team of U.S. military and FBI officials in Libya and transported on a 13-day journey to the United States aboard a Navy vessel.

Militants have exploited chaos following Muammar Gaddafi’s 2011 downfall.

Other data on Wednesday showed a surge in private sector hiring, indicating that job growth rebounded last month after being depressed in September as hurricanes Harvey and Irma left some workers temporarily unemployed.

Manufacturing and labor strength likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to increase interest rates in December. The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise rates when policymakers conclude a two-day meeting later on Wednesday.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity slipped to a reading of 58.7 last month from 60.8 in September, which was the highest since May 2004. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.

September’s jump in the index was driven by supply chain disruptions, especially in the chemical products sector. The supply bottlenecks, which also pushed up prices of raw materials, resulted in a longer delivery times.

Longer suppliers’ delivery times are normally associated with increased activity, which is a positive contribution to the ISM index. The ISM’s supplier deliveries sub-index fell to 61.4 last month after soaring to 64.4 in September.

The survey’s prices paid sub-index dropped to 68.5 after racing to 71.5 in September, which was the highest reading since May 2011. The production sub-index slipped 1.2 points to a reading of 61.0 in October and a gauge of new orders fell to 63.4. A measure of factory employment dipped to 59.8 from 60.3 in September, which was the highest level since 2011.

Manufacturing is being supported by a strengthening global economy and weakening U.S. dollar.

PRIVATE PAYROLLS SURGE

Separately, the ADP National Employment Report showed private employers hired 235,000 workers last month, the most in seven months, after increasing payrolls by 110,000 jobs in September.

The ADP report, which is jointly produced with Moody’s Analytics, is not a good predictor of the private payrolls component of the employment report. It, however, supported expectations of a sharp rebound in employment last month after nonfarm payrolls declined by 33,000 jobs in September.

Prices for U.S. government bonds were trading higher and the dollar rose against a basket of currencies.

A third report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending increased 0.3 percent to $1.22 trillion as a surge in public construction outlays offset the third straight monthly decline in investment in private projects.

But August’s construction outlays were revised down to show a 0.1 percent gain instead of the previously reported 0.5 percent rise. Construction spending increased 2.0 percent on a year-on-year basis.

In September, investment on private construction projects fell 0.4 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in August. It was the third straight monthly drop in private construction outlays and reflected a 0.8 percent decline in spending on private nonresidential projects. Spending on nonresidential projects in September was the lowest since April 2016.

Spending on nonresidential structures has now declined for four consecutive months. Spending on oil drilling has been slowing in recent months amid moderate gains in oil prices and ample crude supplies. Spending on residential structures was unchanged in September.

The data could impact the government’s gross domestic product estimate for the third quarter published last week. The government’s advance estimate put economic growth at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the July-September quarter, with both residential and nonresidential structures subtracting from output.

In September, outlays on public construction projects jumped 2.6 percent after rising 0.7 percent in August. Spending on state and local government construction projects climbed 2.5 percent.

The company’s shares, which have risen more than 8 percent since Cognizant last reported quarterly earnings, fell 5 percent in morning trading.

Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (CTSH.O) said revenue from financial industry clients - which makes up the bulk of the company’s business - rose 3.8 percent to $1.43 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30.

But the increase was the slowest in three quarters. The result also failed to exceed analysts’ average estimate, according to research firm FactSet.

The company’s revenue overall rose 9.1 percent to $3.77 billion. Analysts had expected $3.76 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

“The combination of significant stock ‘run’ into the print, only ‘in line’ quarterly results, as well as the typical low visibility into next year’s IT spending budget led to this morning’s 5 percent selloff,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Moshe Katri.

Cognizant has faced lower spending from big financial clients such as central banks, that are shifting their investments to digital services such as automation from legacy services, the company’s President Rajeev Mehta said on a call with analysts.

But that shift should eventually benefit Cognizant, which has also invested heavily in cloud and digital services, including cybersecurity and data analytics, company executives said.

The company has also spent big bucks on services for the healthcare industry - its other big business - mainly through acquisitions of smaller companies such as TriZetto and TMG Health.

The investments come amid uncertainty around U.S. healthcare policy, with President Donald Trump’s administration seeking to repeal and replace Obamacare.

“We view the fact that there is ongoing change in the healthcare market place as an opportunity for us to work with clients to help them address that change,” Chief Executive Francisco D‘Souza said in an interview.

Cognizant said revenue from its healthcare sector business rose 9.3 percent in the latest quarter.

The company expects fourth-quarter earnings of at least 95 cents per share. Analysts were expecting 98 cents.

Its net income rose to $495 million or 84 cents per share in the third quarter, from $444 million or 73 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding one-time items, Cognizant earned 98 cents per share, edging past analysts’ estimates of 95 cents.","Cognizant's financial revenue growth slows, shares fall",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cognizant-tech-results/cognizants-financial-revenue-growth-slows-shares-fall-idUSKBN1D149X?il=0

Rapp said he had the impression that Spacey was drunk, pushed him away and left.
Spacey said in a Twitter post on Sunday that he was “beyond horrified” by Rapp’s account, which he said he did not recall.
Spacey immediately came under fire on social media for what many saw as a disingenuous conflation of an apology for sexual misconduct with a public acknowledgement of being gay.
“This is not a coming-out story about Kevin Spacey, but a story of survivorship by Anthony Rapp and all those who bravely speak out against unwanted sexual advances.”A representative for Spacey did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.","(Reuters) - Actor Kevin Spacey has apologized for an alleged attempt to seduce a 14-year-old boy more than 30 years ago, an encounter the two-time Oscar winner denied recalling but attributed to drunkenness as he also came out as a gay man on Twitter.

But rather than tempering an uproar over the allegation, Spacey’s combination of an apology with a statement going public about his sexual orientation stirred a backlash against the actor as Hollywood found itself embroiled in yet another sex scandal.

Adding fuel to the latest controversy was news on Monday that Netflix will soon end the landmark political drama “House of Cards,” which stars Spacey as a corrupt and closeted bisexual U.S. president.

Netflix Inc did not give an explicit reason for deciding to air just one more season of “House of Cards” before pulling the plug on the Emmy-winning, critically acclaimed show, its first original hit series.

Netflix spokeswoman Karen Barragan said the determination was made months ago, long before the allegation surfaced against Spacey, 58, who is also a Tony-winning actor and former creative director of London’s famed Old Vic theater.

But the internet streaming service and the show’s producers issued a joint statement saying they were “deeply troubled” by the accusation leveled against Spacey by actor Anthony Rapp, 46, a member of CBS’s new “Star Trek: Discovery” series.

According to Rapp, in an interview published late on Sunday by BuzzFeed, Spacey in 1986 made an unwanted sexual advance toward him when he was just 14 at the time.

Rapp said the encounter occurred after a party Spacey hosted at his New York apartment, where he said Spacey, then 26, found him watching TV alone at the end of the night when other guests had left, then carried him to a bed and lay down on top of him.

Rapp said he had the impression that Spacey was drunk, pushed him away and left.

“He was trying to seduce me,” Rapp told BuzzFeed. “I don’t know if I would have used that language. But I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually.”

Rapp was just starting his career on Broadway in a production of “Precious Sons” at the time and went on to star in the hit musical “Rent.” Spacey was then appearing in a Broadway revival of Eugene O‘Neill’s “Long Day’s Journey Into Night.”

LATEST HOLLYWOOD SEX SCANDAL

Rapp told BuzzFeed he remained unnerved by the experience decades later and felt compelled to come forward after dozens of women recently accused movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and several other Hollywood figures of sexual assault and sexual harassment.

Weinstein, who has since been expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Producers Guild of America, has denied engaging in non-consensual sex with anyone.

Spacey said in a Twitter post on Sunday that he was “beyond horrified” by Rapp’s account, which he said he did not recall.

“But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years,” Spacey tweeted.

Spacey went on to say that Rapp’s story “had encouraged me to address other things in my life.”

“As those closest to me know, in my life I have had relationships with both men and women. I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, I now choose to live life as a gay man,” wrote Spacey, who had not previously addressed his sexuality publicly.

Spacey immediately came under fire on social media for what many saw as a disingenuous conflation of an apology for sexual misconduct with a public acknowledgement of being gay.

“Coming-out stories should not be used to deflect from allegations of sexual assault,” said Sarah Kate Ellis, president of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). “This is not a coming-out story about Kevin Spacey, but a story of survivorship by Anthony Rapp and all those who bravely speak out against unwanted sexual advances.”

A representative for Spacey did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

An Oscar winner for “The Usual Suspects” and “American Beauty,” Spacey is best known lately for his role as the ruthless fictional president Frank Underwood in “House of Cards.”

The series became Netflix’s defining show when it launched in 2013, upending traditional television viewership by making all episodes of each season available for internet streaming at once.

Spacey will next be seen on the big screen playing Jean Paul Getty in Ridley Scott’s drama “All The Money in the World,” scheduled for release by Sony Pictures in December for possible awards consideration.",Kevin Spacey embroiled in Hollywood's latest sexual misconduct scandal,https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CZ0CQ-OCAEN

Producer Media Rights Capital and Netflix “have decided to suspend production on House of Cards season six, until further notice, to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew,” a statement said.

A day earlier, Netflix had said the groundbreaking show about a ruthless political power couple would conclude with season six. Representatives for Spacey did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

On Sunday, “Star Trek: Discovery” actor Anthony Rapp told Buzzfeed that Spacey made an unwanted sexual advance toward him in 1986 when he was just 14 and Spacey was 26. Spacey, a two-time Oscar winner who is now 58, said he did not recall the incident. But in a tweet he said that if he did behave as Rapp described then he apologized and it would have been due to “inappropriate drunken behavior.”

Rapp told BuzzFeed he felt compelled to come forward after dozens of women recently accused movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and several other Hollywood figures of sexual assault and sexual harassment. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

Spacey’s apology sparked a backlash because he also used the statement to come out as a gay man. Many social media users saw it as a damaging conflation of sexual misconduct and being gay.

On Monday, Netflix and MRC called the allegation against Spacey “deeply troubling.”

“House of Cards” became Netflix’s defining show when it launched in 2013, upending traditional television viewership by making all episodes of each season available online at the same time.

Earlier on Tuesday, the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences said it was revoking a planned award for Spacey that he had been due to receive in New York on Nov. 20.

The challenge for Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is to persuade her to actually buy one.

“I‘m definitely interested, but don’t currently plan to get one,” said Gu, whose monthly salary of a little over 6,000 yuan ($905.36) is less than the anniversary model’s starting price in China of 8,388 yuan.

For Apple, which is looking to rev up sales in China after several quarters of declining revenue there, the test is that Gu is not alone. While interest in the phone is high, that won’t necessarily translate into sales.

“Price appears to be a major constraint on iPhone X demand, particularly in China,” Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a recent report that showed three-quarters of Chinese respondents were excited by the upcoming launch, but only a quarter said they planned to buy one.

Investors are keen to gauge Chinese demand for the iPhone X, as it is key to reviving Apple’s fortunes in the world’s biggest smartphone market where it has lost some of its sparkle - and market share - as local phone makers have advanced.

The cheaper iPhone 8, which hit the market in September, has faced sluggish sales, but Apple has said that pre-orders for the iPhone X have been “off the charts”.

Apple, due to announce quarterly earnings on Thursday, said it had no immediate comment.

Chatter online on popular Chinese social media platform Weibo (WB.O) also signaled high levels of interest in the new model, though still generally behind levels around the 2014 launch of the very successful iPhone 6.

APPLE “GEEKS”

Xiao Ming, 32, who works for a blockchain start-up in Beijing, stayed up half the night when pre-sales of the iPhone X opened last week. He has also bought the iPhone 8.

“I always try to be one of the first to buy any new iPhone,” he said, adding he likes the new phone’s augmented reality and facial recognition features. “I’ll be very disappointed if I don’t get one on the first day.”

While he plans to buy the new phone, he noted many of his friends were less fussed. “Before, I think a lot of people would try to get it somehow, now it’s mostly the geeks,” he said.

“My friends don’t mind so much if they have an iPhone 8 or a 6, for example, because it looks similar and the price (of the iPhone X) makes you feel nervous.”

Re-sellers and iPhone accessory makers generally agreed there was a buzz about the iPhone X, Apple’s first phone to have a full-screen display and functions such as facial recognition security.

“People are really anticipating this phone because it’s the 10th anniversary version and it has more changes and modifications,” said Gary Yiu, manager of the iGeneration smartphone shop at one Hong Kong mall.

Yiu and three other phone re-sellers there said they had seen strong demand for the phone from mainland clients.

A merchant at the Huaqiangbei electronics hub in Shenzhen, who was offering an iPhone look-a-like called the “E-Feng X” from 1,599 yuan, said sales volumes were “very good”.

Some Chinese re-sellers, however, said they already canceled pre-orders for the iPhone X, concerned there wouldn’t be enough of a supply bottleneck to allow them to charge a steep premium - despite some worries about long waits.

“I saw many friends were posting pictures of themselves successfully ordering the iPhone X, so I canceled mine,” said Tony Tong, 29, a product manager at a tech firm in Beijing, who said he had ordered four phones in the hope of re-selling them for a profit. “The environment is bad for scalpers.”

Apple will hope payment plans and easy access to online credit in China will convince people to buy.

Wang Hao, a 24-year-old engineer in the northeastern port city of Dalian, said he ordered the new phone despite the high price tag. His last phone was an iPhone 6S.

“The cost is about a month’s salary for me,” he told Reuters. “But I‘m just used to it now, and there wasn’t really anything to make me choose another brand.”

Os dados divulgados pelo IHS Markit mostram que o PMI do setor chegou a 51,2 em outubro, sobre 50,9 em setembro, na terceira melhora seguida das condições operacionais.

O avanço no mês passado teve como base o crescimento contínuo dos novos trabalhos, pelo oitavo mês seguido, o que levou as empresas a elevarem o volume de produção. Entre os três grupos monitorados, somente o de bens de consumo mostrou contração no mês.

Com novos projetos em fase de preparação, os empresários do setor aumentaram o nível de empregos pela primeira vez desde fevereiro de 2015, o que segundo o IHS Markit “representou uma mudança de direção importante em relação às contrações acentuadas observadas no início do ano”.

O número de funcionários aumentou, de acordo com o PMI, tanto no subsetor de bens de consumo quanto no de bens intermediários.

Entretanto, a indústria registrou a primeira queda no volume de novos negócios provenientes do exterior desde abril, com algumas empresas citando vendas mais fracas para os Estados Unidos e menor demanda global.

A pesquisa mostrou ainda que houve relatos de preços mais altos de energia, plásticos, papelão, metais e combustiveis, levando a novo aumento da taxa de inflação de insumos. Diante disso, a elevação dos preços de fábrica chegou a um pico de sete meses.

Mas mesmo com as indicações de melhora, o nível de otimismo diminuiu em outubro e foi ao menor patamar em 19 meses, uma vez que as preocupações com a demanda básica prevaleceram sobre as projeções de vendas mais elevadas para exportações e condições econômicas melhores.","Indústria do Brasil cresce e volta a contratar em outubro pela 1ª vez em quase 3 anos, mostra PMI",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1D14MR-OBRBS

Ferguson said that after the concert, Jordaan entered her hotel room and raped her. She said her intention was not to seek revenge.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Os dados divulgados pelo IHS Markit mostram que o PMI do setor chegou a 51,2 em outubro, sobre 50,9 em setembro, na terceira melhora seguida das condições operacionais.

O avanço no mês passado teve como base o crescimento contínuo dos novos trabalhos, pelo oitavo mês seguido, o que levou as empresas a elevarem o volume de produção. Entre os três grupos monitorados, somente o de bens de consumo mostrou contração no mês.

Com novos projetos em fase de preparação, os empresários do setor aumentaram o nível de empregos pela primeira vez desde fevereiro de 2015, o que segundo o IHS Markit “representou uma mudança de direção importante em relação às contrações acentuadas observadas no início do ano”.

O número de funcionários aumentou, de acordo com o PMI, tanto no subsetor de bens de consumo quanto no de bens intermediários.

Entretanto, a indústria registrou a primeira queda no volume de novos negócios provenientes do exterior desde abril, com algumas empresas citando vendas mais fracas para os Estados Unidos e menor demanda global.

A pesquisa mostrou ainda que houve relatos de preços mais altos de energia, plásticos, papelão, metais e combustiveis, levando a novo aumento da taxa de inflação de insumos. Diante disso, a elevação dos preços de fábrica chegou a um pico de sete meses.

Mas mesmo com as indicações de melhora, o nível de otimismo diminuiu em outubro e foi ao menor patamar em 19 meses, uma vez que as preocupações com a demanda básica prevaleceram sobre as projeções de vendas mais elevadas para exportações e condições econômicas melhores.","Indústria do Brasil cresce e volta a contratar em outubro pela 1ª vez em quase 3 anos, mostra PMI",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1D14Q3-OBRTP

The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, compiled by IHS Markit, fell to 50.3 last month from September’s 51.2, marking its third month above the 50-point threshold that separates growth from contraction.

That was below all projections in a Reuters poll which had predicted a modest uptick to 51.5 and comes after another recent Reuters survey forecast India’s economy will grow at its slowest pace in four years this fiscal year.

“India’s manufacturing companies struggled somewhat as the recent recovery enjoyed by the sector lost impetus in October. Disappointingly, manufacturing production rose at the weakest pace in the current sequence of growth,” said Aashna Dodhia, an economist at IHS Markit.

“Inflows of new orders stagnated as the negative effects arising from the implementation of GST continued to dampen demand levels.”

The government’s decision to ban high value-currency notes last November, combined with the introduction of a new unified tax system, dampened consumer spending and industrial activity.

“Business confidence eased to the weakest since February as some firms expressed concerns over negative GST effects,” Dodhia said.

The new orders sub-index, a proxy for domestic demand, fell to a three-month low of 49.9 from September’s 51.0, discouraging firms from increasing output faster. Foreign demand contracted at the fastest pace since September 2013.

Firms passed on greater cost burdens and raised prices more sharply, suggesting retail inflation could extend its uptrend over the coming months.

Indian consumer inflation held steady at 3.28 percent in September, but is expected to accelerate over coming months led by higher petrol and diesel prices, complicating the task of the Reserve Bank of India as it seeks to stimulate the economy with more rate cuts.

The former JPMorgan executive has shored up the Asia-focused lender’s balance sheet, shed risky loans, slashed costs and returned it to profitability. Restarting meaningful dividend payments is proving a tougher task.

A Standard Chartered sign is seen outside of a building, with a branch of the bank, in Jakarta, Indonesia September 28, 2016

StanChart shares dropped 6 percent after it reported third-quarter results on Wednesday morning. It now trades at less than 0.8 times its tangible book value – well below the valuation of bigger rival HSBC. The reason for such a steep discount is two-fold. Investors in an emerging market bank expect steady dividends of the kind delivered by HSBC, or loan growth which reflects the economic dynamism of the lender’s operating countries. StanChart currently offers neither.

A balance sheet cleanup means the bank’s loan book has shrunk by an average of 4.7 percent a year since 2013 even as Asian economies which account for 59 percent of its assets have grown by 6 percent a year, on average. Rival DBS Group has registered 6 percent net annual loan growth for the last three financial years, according to Eikon data. If the Singaporean bank has sacrificed lending standards in its pursuit of bigger volumes this has yet to show up in significantly higher bad loan charges.

StanChart says restarting dividend payouts – which it suspended in 2015 – will depend on “earnings momentum” and changes to capital rules. Though pre-tax profit more than doubled in the third quarter, this was almost entirely due to lower bad-debt provisions, which can only fall so far. Higher income from net loan growth of 3 percent during the quarter was cancelled out by rising costs. Meanwhile, the bank’s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio slipped to 13.6 percent, compounding investor anxiety over how much surplus capital StanChart potentially has.

Having cleaned up the mess left behind by previous CEO Peter Sands, Winters is understandably cautious. He might argue that competitors are mispricing risk and that prudence will be rewarded when the credit cycle turns.

Having intervened decisively in the Syrian war in 2015 in support of President Bashar al-Assad, Russia now hopes to build on the collapse of Islamic State to launch a new political process towards ending the six-year-long conflict.

Damascus has said it is ready to attend the Nov. 18 Sochi congress which is set to focus on a new constitution, saying the time is right thanks to Syrian army gains and the “terrorists’ obliteration”.

But officials in the anti-Assad opposition rejected the meeting and insisted any peace talks be held under U.N. sponsorship in Geneva, where peace talks have failed to make any progress towards ending the conflict since it erupted in 2011.

The congress amounted to a meeting “between the regime and the regime”, said Mohammad Alloush, a member of the opposition High Negotiations Committee and a senior official with the Jaish al-Islam rebel group.

The HNC was surprised it had been mentioned in a list of groups invited to the congress and would “issue a statement with other parties setting out the general position rejecting this conference”, Alloush told Reuters.

The Turkey-based Syrian National Coalition (SNC) political opposition group said the congress was an attempt to circumvent “the international desire for political transition” in Syria.

“The Coalition will not participate in any negotiations with the regime outside Geneva or without U.N. sponsorship,” SNC spokesman Ahmad Ramadan told Reuters.

A Russian negotiator said on Tuesday that Syrian groups who choose to boycott the congress risked being sidelined as the political process moves ahead.

Russia has invited 33 Syrian groups and political parties to what it calls a “Syrian Congress on National Dialogue”.

Russian President Vladimir Putin first mentioned the idea of the congress last month, saying that he believed Moscow and the Syrian government would soon finally defeat militants in Syria.

Helped by Russia’s air force and an array of Iran-backed Shi‘ite militias, Assad has defeated many of the Syrian rebels who were fighting to topple him, leaving him militarily unassailable and the rebels confined to enclaves of the west.

Damascus and its allies have also recovered swathes of central and eastern Syria from Islamic State in recent months, while a separate campaign by U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) has driven IS from other areas of the country.

The separate campaigns are now converging on Islamic State’s last strongholds in Deir al-Zor province at the Iraqi border.

Russia’s decision to invite the Kurdish groups which dominate the SDF to Sochi triggered Turkish irritation on Wednesday. Ankara, which views the dominant Syrian Kurdish groups as a national security threat, said it was unacceptable that the Kurdish YPG militia had been invited.

Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Turkish and Russian officials had discussed the issue and that he had held meetings of his own to “solve the problem on the spot.”

The new anti-terrorism law, effective from Wednesday, gives police extended powers to search properties, conduct electronic eavesdropping and shut mosques or other locations suspected of preaching hatred.

“Some dread that now that we are out the state of emergency there could be a drop in vigilance, it is the opposite,” French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told journalists during a short visit to police officers guarding the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

“The level of threat is high everywhere in the world,” he said, referring to the attack in New York on Tuesday where a pickup truck driver killed eight people.

The new legislation transposes some of the measures contained in the state of emergency rule into law, although with some modifications.

One measure will allow the Interior Ministry, without approval from a judge, to set up large security perimeters in case of an identified threat, restricting movement of people and vehicles and with power to carry out searches inside the area.

Conservative politicians warn the regulations are not going far enough while human rights groups and members of the left fear police misconduct.

“France has become so addicted to the state of emergency that it is now injecting several of these abusive measures into ordinary law,” Human Rights Watch said before parliament backed the legislation last month.

France’s human rights watchdog, an independent body, has said it is concerned about breaches of rights of Muslims. The French Council of the Muslim Faith, the official interlocutor with the state in the regulation of Muslim religious activities, said it would remain vigilant about the bill’s implementation.

However, the concerns expressed by such rights groups have had little resonance with the public so far. A poll conducted in early October showed more than 80 percent of support for the bill.

The announcement comes a day after Sony confirmed its renaissance by forecasting its highest-ever profit this financial year, sending its shares surging to a nine-year high.

AIBO is billed as a pet that behaves like a real dog using artificial intelligence (AI) to learn and interact with its owner and surroundings. The upgrade sees AIBO equipped with new sensing and movement technologies as well as far more advanced AI backed by cloud computing to develop the dog’s personality.

Sales begin in Japan in January for 198,000 yen ($1,739).

Sony pioneered entertainment robots with AIBO in 1999. It sold about 150,000 dogs in Japan before ceasing production seven years later when its core consumer electronics business struggled in price wars with emerging Asian rivals.

“It was a difficult decision to stop the project in 2006, but we continued development in AI and robotics,” Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai said at a news briefing.

“I asked our engineers a year and a half ago to develop (new) AIBO because I strongly believe robots capable of building loving relationships with people help realize Sony’s mission (to inspire).”

The reborn AIBO features new actuator technology allowing it move more smoothly and naturally like a real dog. With sensing and AI technologies, AIBO can run toward its owner and detect smiles and words of praise, and can remember what actions please the owner. Its eyes are made of organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays making it capable of diverse expressions.

Sony said it aims to sell at least as many new AIBO as the original, without giving a time frame. It also said it is considering overseas sales.

The firm sees AI as a future pillar of growth, hoping to catch up with major technology companies such as Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google.

It invested an undisclosed sum last year in Cogitai, a U.S. AI start-up focusing on technology that allows machines to learn continually and autonomously from interaction in the real world. It also established a venture capital fund to build partnerships with researchers and start-up companies in AI and robotics.

Energy and industrial companies like General Electric will have a chance to cozy up to Beijing’s new leadership during U.S. President Donald Trump’s upcoming Asia trip, but Wall Street isn’t coming along.

Trump arrives in Beijing next Wednesday, and the administration has been on the hunt for announcements that would make for photo ops or press releases during his visit. Companies applying to join a business delegation were queried on whether they had deals with China in the works that they could unveil while overseas, people familiar with the matter told Breakingviews. Billions of dollars in sales and investments benefitting the United States are expected. For example, one of the stars of the show will probably be Sinopec’s 700-mile pipeline deal in Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which could be worth about $7 billion in investments.

U.S. corporate delegates include GE, Honeywell, Thermo Fisher and Cheniere Energy. They arrive at an opportune time to meet Chinese leaders, who just wrapped up a major party congress and rolled out new leadership slate at the end of October.

However, the United States remains locked in contentious talks over improving market access for American firms in the People’s Republic, including financial services. A senior administration official said Tuesday that progress has become more difficult. China is retrenching under President Xi Jinping, who has shown scant respect for market-based principles.

While there have been some advances on raising ownership equity caps in financial services, a deal has not been finalized, and the lack of representation by big names like Citi or Goldman Sachs on this trip suggests no major compromise is nigh. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said he hoped the one-off deals don’t overshadow the need to push for structural changes.

Convincing Beijing to expose its domestic financial industry to more foreign competition is a tougher pitch than selling goods. The Trump administration is not indifferent to the financial sector’s concerns, but low expectations for photo-op concessions have kept the industry at the back of the line this time around.",Breakingviews - Wall Street loses in search for easy China wins,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-us-breakingviews/breakingviews-wall-street-loses-in-search-for-easy-china-wins-idUSKBN1D13KH

The Japanese pitcher was lifted in the second inning of Friday’s Game Three after allowing four runs on six hits and a walk as the Dodgers fell behind 2-1 in the series.

The Dodgers battled back for a 3-1 win in Games Six on Tuesday that tied the series and has given Darvish his chance.

“We have really good people in this clubhouse and I really appreciate my team mates supporting me,” the soft-spoken 31-year-old told reporters on Tuesday.

Darvish’s awful Game Three was compounded by a racist gesture made by Houston’s Yuli Gurriel.

After hitting a home run off Darvish to put the Astros ahead the 33-year-old Cuban was caught on camera using his hands to make a slanted-eye gesture while in the dugout.

Major League Baseball opted not to suspend Gurriel for any of the remaining World Series games and will instead ban him for five games at the start of next season.

Gurriel was booed by Dodgers fans every time he came to bat on Tuesday but Darvish said he had moved on.

“I wasn’t that frustrated when I saw it the first time,” Darvish said.

”And then after the game he contacted us and said, ‘Hey, I’d like to meet you in person and apologize,’ but I told him, ‘Hey, you don’t have to do that, because you made a comment, and, like, I‘m not that mad.’

“So like I really didn’t care much about that,” he said.

While pitchers on both teams have complained about baseballs that are “slicker” to the touch, making it hard to get a good grip on the ball, Darvish said he did not know the reason why he could not get his slider working in Game Three.

“And after the game I came back and I realized that my slider, I couldn’t finish my pitches. I couldn’t get that final touch. And then it just didn’t make sense,” he said.

“I really didn’t know if it was my physical thing and mechanical adjustment that I had to make or the ball. I can’t really say. And I just need to learn from it and go to tomorrow night.”

Perez pointed to recent positive readings on U.S. gross domestic product, consumer confidence, housing prices and inflation data, which have recently exceeded expectations. Additionally, no other central bank is seen as likely to raise rates in the near term, except for the Bank of England, an expectation which has already been priced into the market.

“Right now, there’s not a lot of threats to the dollar out there, and, if anything, there’s just potential for the currency to be propelled further,” Perez said.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

Slideshow (14 Images)

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

The FSB, which coordinates financial regulation across the Group of 20 Economies (G20), said in its first report on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning that the risks they pose need monitoring.

AI and machine learning refer to technology that is replacing traditional methods to assess the creditworthiness of customers, to crunch data, price insurance contracts and spot profitable trades across markets.

There are no international regulatory standards for AI and machine learning, but the FSB left open whether new rules are needed.

Data on rapidly growing usage of AI is largely unavailable, leaving regulators unsure about the impact of potentially new and unexpected links between markets and banks, the report said.

AI could, for example, lead to “non-sustainable” increases in credit by automating credit scoring.

While AI shows substantial promise if risks are properly managed, it could create too much dependency among banks and insurers on the few specialist businesses that provide AI technology.

Expected rapid growth in AI also raises the prospect of outside technology players expanding their influence over the finance sector.

“This could in turn lead to the emergence of new systemically important players that could fall outside the regulatory perimeter,” the FSB said.

If a major AI provider went bust, it could lead to operational disruptions at a large number of financial firms at the same time, especially if used in “mission critical” applications, the report said.

Regulators could also find it difficult to identify who has made key financial decisions that go wrong.

“If AI and machine learning-based decisions cause losses to financial intermediaries across the financial system, there may be a lack of clarity around responsibility,” the report said.

REVOLUTION

The pace of technological advance will also make it harder to fashion durable rules for AI activity that some academics expect to revolutionize the financial sector.

The report said that RegTech investment, or use of machines to comply with a welter of new regulations introduced to tackle money laundering and make banks safer, could reach $6.45 billion by 2020.

Consultancy Accenture said in May that three quarters of bankers surveyed believed that AI will become the primary way banks interact with customers within the next three years.

European insurers invested $400 million in “InsurTech” or real-time technology to help to reduce payouts.

Nordea (NDA.ST), the Nordic region’s biggest bank, said last month that automation would help it to shed at least 4,000 staff. It has already introduced an AI chatbox to answer common customer questions.

Dutch bank ING (INGA.AS) wants to increase the number of traders using AI.

Fund managers are also using outside specialists to obtain machine-learning tools that sift through news and research for insight into market trends.

So-called “quant” funds use AI to manage $1 trillion in assets. Though that is only a fraction of the $40 trillion in mutual funds globally, the FSB said industry estimates suggest that could grow rapidly.

The regulators themselves are also using AI to make it easier to detect fraud and money laundering, while central banks expect to use AI for real-time predictions using big data to help to determine monetary policy, the report said.

The FSB acknowledged that AI is helping the financial sector to cut costs, improve profitability and widen choice for customers, but added that it also raises concerns over privacy of data used in AI applications.","Rise of the machines must be monitored, say global finance regulators",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-regulation-banks-artificialintelligen/rise-of-the-machines-must-be-monitored-say-global-finance-regulators-idUSKBN1D1534?il=0

Transport is among the policy areas being thrashed out in talks taking place between Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens, who are aiming to form a coalition by Christmas.

The parties are discussing all policy areas before launching detailed negotiations. While the atmosphere has improved in recent days, there have been few actual deals, with immigration and climate change among the biggest sticking points.

The Greens’ demand on carmakers would go further than software fixes so far agreed between politicians and German car bosses to help repair the industry’s badly damaged reputation.

The future of Germany’s mighty car industry, the country’s biggest exporter and provider of some 800,000 jobs, is a tricky area as it tries to recover from the diesel emissions testing scandal which broke at Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) two years ago.

Despite public concern and planned diesel bans in countries including France and Britain in coming decades, German lawmakers have not yet dared ask the same of its carmakers, such as BMW, VW, Daimler and Porsche who have invested heavily in diesel.

In August, politicians and car bosses agreed to overhaul engine software on 5.3 million diesel cars to cut pollution and avoid bans on polluting vehicles but they stopped short of committing to more expensive hardware modifications.

That may have to change if the Greens share power.

“We won’t meet our targets of getting cleaner air in city centers with software upgrades alone,” Cem Ozdemir, a leader of the Greens, said as he headed into the talks.

“There must also be hardware solutions.”

Ozdemir said the auto industry was going through the biggest transformation process in its history and the car had to be reinvented to make it emission-free and more automated. Public transport must also be expanded, he added.

The conservative bloc, comprising Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and Bavaria’s Christian Social Union (CSU), oppose any demand to ban the combustion engine from 2030.",German Greens make stand on car emissions in coalition talks,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-politics/german-greens-make-stand-on-car-emissions-in-coalition-talks-idUKKBN1D152N?il=0

“It’s not rocket science perhaps, but for a long time, Sony seemed to have forgotten this magic formula.”","TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares in Sony Corp (6758.T) soared to a nine-year high on Wednesday after it forecast record earnings that have vindicated its restructuring efforts and raised expectations of sustained momentum in profitability.

Under Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai, the tech and entertainment giant has streamlined unprofitable electronics businesses and capitalized on the spread of smartphones with its image sensors.

Citing robust sales of image sensors as well as high-end TVs, Sony hiked its full-year operating profit outlook to 630 billion yen ($5.5 billion), up 26 percent from an earlier forecast and 7.5 percent higher than an average analyst estimate.

“Image sensors will be used in a wide range of areas, and the market is very large,” said Masayuki Otani, chief market analyst at Securities Japan Inc.

“Profitability is increasing, and in the mid- to long-term we expect the stock price to reach its 2007 level of 7,190 yen.”

Sony’s stock rose as much as 12.4 percent to its highest level since June 2008, becoming the most traded firm by turnover on Tokyo’s main board. It finished up 11.4 percent at 4,918 yen, giving it a market capitalization of around $54.6 billion.

The new forecast is 20 percent above its current profit record, set two decades ago when strong sales of consumer electronics dovetailed with the popularity of its first PlayStation games console and its “Men in Black” box-office hit.

To develop new profit drivers, the firm has also boosted investment in artificial intelligence and is expanding its consumer products portfolio.

It unveiled its Xperia Hello! voice-activated communication robot this month and on Wednesday said it was reviving its robotic dog AIBO that went on sale in 1999. It also aims to lead the budding virtual-reality market by drawing on the content portion of its business such as music and film.

Combined with resurgent demand for consumer audio products sparked by the rise of streaming services from Spotify to Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) Apple Music, the focus on cutting-edge technology augurs well for future profits, said Macquarie analyst Damian Thong.

“They should also push into 3D sensors which will be useful for augmented reality and the applications that surround that.”

General Motors Co (GM.N) reported an overall sales drop of 2.2 percent for the month, with consumer sales down 6.6 percent. High-margin pickup truck, SUV and crossover sales were all up at the largest U.S. automaker.

GM reduced its inventory of unsold vehicles in the month by 7,000 vehicles to 813,000. The automaker has been whittling away at its large volume of unsold vehicles, a source of concern for the market. GM had advised that its inventory would rise in October.

“We are heading into the fourth quarter with good momentum, thanks to a strong U.S. economy and very strong pickup and crossover sales,” GM’s vice president for U.S. sales operations, Kurt McNeil, said in a statement.

GM slightly reduced consumer discounts as a percentage of the average transaction price, to 13.5 percent from 13.7 percent in the third quarter.

Industry experts believe consumer discounts in excess of 10 percent of the average transaction price are unhealthy for the market as they erode resale values and are unsustainable in the long term.

Industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC said last week that based on preliminary sales numbers including October, discounts have exceeded 10 percent in 15 of the last 16 months.

The U.S. auto industry is coming off a strong run that culminated in record sales of 17.55 million units in 2016. New sales got a strong lift in September as consumers replaced vehicles damaged in southeast Texas by Hurricane Harvey the previous month.

Full-year 2017 sales are still expected to be down slightly versus 2016.

Ford Motor Co (F.N) posted a 6.2 percent gain in vehicle sales in October, driven largely by a 15.9 percent jump in sales of its popular, high-priced F-Series line of pickups. Strong demand pushed the average price tag for an F-Series truck up $4,000 from the previous October to $47,300.

High-margin pickup trucks were a dominant factor in the better-than-expected results Ford posted last week.

On a conference call, Ford’s U.S. sales chief, Mark LaNeve, said the upgraded F-Series line “really has been a spectacular success” and said the market would remain “competitive” through the end of 2017 and into 2018.

Ford’s low-margin fleet sales rose 14.6 percent in October.

Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) said its sales rose 5.2 percent in October, as strong pickup truck and SUV sales offset a 12.7 drop in Toyota sedans and a 27.9 percent decrease in luxury Lexus sedans.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (FCHA.MI)(FCAU.N) reported a 13 percent sales decline. The automaker’s sales to consumers were down 4 percent, while fleet sales slid 43 percent, in line with the company’s strategy to reduce low-margin sales to car rental agencies.

FCA has pushed to sell more profitable SUVs and pickup trucks, which helped lift its North American profit margin to 8.3 percent in the third quarter.

Nissan Motor Co Ltd’s (7201.T) sales increased 8.4 percent for the month, driven by a 12.9 percent jump in pickups, SUV and crossover sales. Sales of its popular Rogue crossover model soared 43 percent in October.

But sales at Nissan’s luxury Infiniti brand fell 8.1 percent, driven largely by a 16.2 percent drop in luxury sedan sales.

The EU Withdrawal Bill aims to provide legal clarity by converting existing EU laws into domestic ones while ensuring that Britain is no longer subject to EU court decisions after leaving the bloc in March 2019.

One of the bill’s clauses says a UK court will no longer need to take into account anything done on or after exit day by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) or any other EU entity, but “may do so if it considers it appropriate to do so”.

David Neuberger, who recently retired as president of the UK Supreme Court, told a parliamentary committee that the clause could lead to situations where judges had to take into account economic or political factors when making their decisions.

“These are the sort of factors which judges are not naturally the people to take into account. It puts them very much into policy areas where on the whole the tradition in the country has been to keep them out,” he said.

Neuberger gave a hypothetical example, envisaging a situation where the ECJ had decided a point on a directive or regulation which affected the right to trade between EU member states, and a UK court found itself having to decide a similar point.

“Should the UK courts take into account the fact that if they decided differently from the EU court it would affect trade between the UK and the EU, or possibly financial arrangements or City interests, or that it may affect political interests or international relations between the UK and EU?” he asked.

Neuberger said that in the absence of more precise guidance from parliament, judges would do their duty and decide for themselves whether to take such factors into account.

“But they may not make decisions that are welcome here (in parliament) and it would be better to give them guidance,” he told a House of Lords committee on constitutional affairs.

Third-place finisher Charles Brumskine’s Liberty Party contested the results of last month’s vote, which set up a Nov. 7 run-off between former soccer star George Weah and Vice President Joseph Boakai.

The election is meant to usher in Liberia’s first democratic transition since 1944, after periods of military rule and civil war that ended in 2003.

In a writ issued late on Tuesday, the court instructed the Liberty Party and the National Elections Commission to file briefs by Thursday. It was unclear if the court would rule before Nov. 7.

“This is a big step in the right direction,” Liberty Party Chairman Benjamin Sanvee said in a statement. “Thankfully, the Court recognizes the gravity of the issues, and has taken action in defense of the law and democracy.”

Earlier this week, Boakai’s ruling Unity Party announced it was backing the legal challenge. It accused President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, one of its own members, of interfering in the Oct. 10 vote by holding private meetings with election magistrates.

Johnson Sirleaf, who has governed for the last 12 years, denied the meetings were inappropriate. International observers like the European Union and the Carter Center have said that they saw no major problems with the first round vote.

The court’s decision points to the increasingly assertive role some African judiciaries are playing in overseeing elections.

Kenya’s Supreme Court annulled the results of a presidential election in August, although the re-run last week was marred by an opposition boycott.

In Liberia’s capital Monrovia on Wednesday, riot police deployed outside the Supreme Court and election commission headquarters as authorities urged calm.

“The public should not panic,” Sam Collins, a police spokesman, told local radio. “People can go about their normal business.”

Weah won the first round with 38.4 percent of the vote to Boakai’s 28.8 percent and picked up an important endorsement last week from former warlord Prince Johnson, who won 8 percent of the first-round vote.

Morluba Morlu, a senior official from Weah’s CDC party, said on Wednesday that he still expected the run-off to go ahead next week.

“It is sad for a ruling party that has been in power for 12 years (to) be crying,” he said of Unity Party’s support for the legal challenge. “We don’t want any mockery of this election.”",Liberia's Supreme Court halts presidential run-off over fraud allegations,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D145X-OZATP

“We aren’t satisfied with our top-line growth and we are addressing these issues by controlling everything that is within our control,” CEO Jim Smith told analysts on an earnings call.

Although earnings-per-share beat estimates in part due to cost controls, the revenue miss pushed shares down 6.5 percent to $43.81 on the New York Stock Exchange; they were at C$56.59 in Toronto.

The results highlight the need for Thomson Reuters to find ways to generate revenue outside of managing costs, said Doug Arthur, an analyst at Huber Research Partners.

“People understand the company is doing a great job on costs,” Arthur said. “But there has been a lot of anticipation that revenues are going to hit an inflection point, and it’s just not happening.”

In its Financial & Risk segment, the company’s biggest, sales outpaced cancellations, a key indicator of future growth. Overall revenue for the unit was up slightly, but was down one percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa.

Specifically, British and European financial services clients are concerned about upcoming EU securities rules, set to take effect in January, as well as Brexit, Smith said.

”The quarter was the tale of two cities, or more like the tale of two continents,“ as the company saw unexpected softness in the UK and Europe and strength in the Americas,” Smith told Reuters. “We heard from the market, that was largely because of upcoming regulatory changes.”

Thomson Reuters still expects year-over-year growth in its financial business in 2017 and 2018, but the extent of the improvement will depend on fourth-quarter net sales, executives said on the call.

The company sees a stronger pipeline of deals for its Financial & Risk unit, Smith said.

The news and information company said full-year profits will be at the high end of its earlier forecast.

Third-quarter net earnings rose to $348 million, or 46 cents per share, from $286 million, or 36 cents per share, a year ago.

Adjusted for special items, earnings were 68 cents per share.

Total revenue grew 1 percent excluding currency to $2.79 billion. Sales in its legal business rose 1 percent to $843 million.

Analysts on average, were looking for profit of 58 cents per share, and revenue of $2.82 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/.

In a special edition marking 50 years since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, ""Time Out Tel Aviv"" rebranded itself as ""Time Out Ramallah,"" with stories provided by seven freelance Palestinian reporters and photographers. The cover photo, of an horizon-obscuring Israeli security barrier, anticipates stories that are far from the magazine's usually hip and carefree content: A Gazan correspondent tells of soirees timed around daily power cuts; in the West Bank, a rare female DJ awaits an elusive permit to perform in Israel. There is lighter fare, such as a tale of two former prisoners in Israel who run the first Palestinian food truck. But as evidenced by the lack of ads - Time Out Tel Aviv's source of income, allowing the weekly to be distributed for free - this edition is a political display, not a commercial crowd-pleaser. A quarter-century of failed talks on creating a Palestinian state alongside Israel has been interspersed with surges of violence. Israel has responded with West Bank closures and withdrawal from Gaza, which is now under Islamist Hamas rule. So deep is the rift, that just getting the Palestinian journalists past checkpoints to meet their Israeli counterparts was a challenge. Internal Palestinian pressures also shadowed some of the freelancers, who published articles without bylines lest they be accused at home of ""collaborating"" with Israel. ""Having this kind of thing in Ramallah, and a way and approach to share our stories and experiences for the whole world to hear, and for ourselves, is something encouraging,"" said Tareq Mansour, a student at Birzeit University in the West Bank who contributed to the special edition. Within Israel, 70,000 copies of ""Time Out Ramallah"" came out in Arabic and Hebrew, and around 2,000 more appeared in English in the Palestinian territories, editor Nof Nathansohn told Reuters.

But Constellation Brands, maker of Svedka vodka and Corona beer, just dropped something into that punchbowl. It’s taking the legit ganja party up a notch.

The booze company is paying C$245 million ($191 million) for a 9.9 percent stake in Canada’s Canopy Growth, a diversified cannabis firm whose brands include Tweed and Bedrocan. Constellation also received warrants allowing it to increase its share. The deal sent Canopy Growth shares 15 percent higher, giving it a C$2.5 billion market value to make it the big kahuna of the emerging public weed complex.

Though the prevailing assumption had been that cigarette manufacturers would feel most threatened by increased marijuana usage, Constellation has recognized otherwise. Where nicotine may be an addictive everyday substance, the active ingredient in pot, THC, offers something else: a longer-lasting euphoria more akin to the party spirit that Constellation’s core products impart to consumers.

In that sense, Constellation’s deal is almost entirely defensive. The $200 billion American alcohol business faces declining usage in part because of rising marijuana consumption, as Cowen & Co researchers pointed out in a 100-page report last year. Their analysis argued that alcohol incidence among American males had fallen 2 percent over the past decade, while weed tokage rose 2.6 percent.

That trend will almost certainly accelerate as more states legalize recreational marijuana. At present, just eight have done so, with another 22 making the plant available for medicinal use. Canada legalized recreational use nationwide starting next July, with edibles and THC-infused drinks coming the following year.

Fux converteu o processo inicial movido pelos advogados de Battisti de habeas corpus em uma reclamação constitucional, e reabriu prazos para a instrução do caso. Na decisão, o ministro argumentou que a “via estreita do habeas corpus não é adequada” para a causa do pedido.

O ministro do STF alegou que, conforme a Constituição, a reclamação é o tipo de ação destinada a preservar a competência da Suprema Corte e garantir a autoridade de suas decisões.

No seu despacho, de terça-feira, Fux manteve os efeitos da liminar concedida no dia 13 de outubro para evitar o prosseguimento de qualquer pedido de extradição de Battisti, mas abriu novo prazo para instruir o recurso, que agora virou uma reclamação.

O ministro do STF permitiu à defesa do ex-ativista que emende a petição inicial no prazo de 15 dias para readequá-la ao novo tipo de ação, embora não tenha permitido qualquer alteração no cerne do pedido apresentado, ou seja, evitar a extradição. Fux abriu novo prazo de 10 dias para ouvir a Presidência da República e também pediu parecer da Procuradoria-Geral da República.

Fux chegou a incluir na pauta do dia 24 de outubro da Primeira Turma do STF o mérito do antigo habeas corpus, após a Advocacia-Geral da União ter defendido o direito de Temer de rever a decisão do então presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, no último dia do seu mandato em 2010, de manter Battisti no país.

Ainda não está certo se, encerrada essa nova fase de instrução processual, o caso será julgado pela Primeira Turma ou pelo plenário do STF.

It was a rare incident in a country that has improved security since deadly attacks in 2015.

The assailant was known to authorities and said after the attack that he considered the police to be “tyrants”, the statement said.

One of the policemen was taken to hospital for treatment after being wounded in the neck, while the other was only lightly wounded, it said.

“I saw a young man with a thick beard trying to kill a policeman. He put the knife in his neck before he was pursued by a second policeman,” a witness told Reuters. “He shouted ‘Allahu Akbar’ (God is greatest) as he attacked the policemen.”

The Interior Ministry said Wednesday’s suspect had confessed that “he had adopted Takfiri thought three years ago and believes that killing security forces is a form of jihad”.

“Takfiri thought” refers to a view that Muslims should proclaim other Muslims to be infidels and justify attacks against them.

Large numbers of police were deployed to the Bardo square in the aftermath of the attack, a witness said. Blood could be seen on the ground in the square.

The square is opposite the parliament building and close to the Bardo museum, where 21 people, mostly European tourists, were killed in an attack by three gunmen in March 2015.

A security source told Reuters the attacker was 25 and from Ettadamen - one of the largest, poorest suburbs of Tunis.

“I know him well, he is the youngest in a family of six brothers including a sister who works in the parliament’s administration”, Hamid one of the attacker’s neighbors told Reuters.

Colonel Major Khelifa Chibani of Tunisia’s national guard named the attacker as Zied Gharbi. Security forces raided his house and confiscated his personal computer and other items, he said.

Sofian Sliti, a spokesman for judicial counter-terrorism investigations said that “the attacker planned to join terrorist groups in Libya”.

As well as the Bardo killings, Tunisia suffered two other major attacks in 2015, one against tourists at the beach resort of Sousse and the other against presidential guards in the capital.

The 2015 attacks severely damaged the economy, which has a large tourism sector at its Mediterranean beaches. Since then, security has been boosted at strategic sites while authorities have cracked down on militants, dismantling dozens of cells.

Tunisia was the only Arab country where a long-serving leader was toppled in the region’s 2011 uprisings without triggering civil war or large-scale violence.

The design chief will leave the British fashion brand next year. It has taken the company three years to unpick the deferential decision to hand him the chief executive role.

Bailey has been a key figure at Burberry for almost 17 years. The group’s revenue has almost quadrupled from the 594 million pounds it recorded in its 2002 financial year; he also drove the brand’s early embrace of e-commerce. The 46-year-old has been unusually powerful for a non-founding designer. That was best illustrated by the ill-judged decision to promote him to the corner office when former boss Angela Ahrendts was poached by Apple in 2014.

When slowing sales and investor disquiet made that arrangement untenable, Burberry went to great lengths to keep Bailey on board. In July 2016, the company hired Gobbetti as chief executive, but created a president role for Bailey. He retained a seat on the board, earned a higher salary than his successor and reported to Chairman John Peace rather than Gobbetti.

Bailey will surrender share awards worth approximately 16 million pounds when he leaves at the end of next year. His exit signals the deep-rooted change taking place at Burberry; the group’s former finance director and chief operating officer have already left, while Peace, chairman since 2002, will also be replaced. That gives Gobbetti greater scope to attempt the kind of successful revamp currently underway at rival label Gucci. Bailey’s departure is the end of an era for Burberry.

Having intervened decisively in the Syrian war in 2015 in support of President Bashar al-Assad, Russia now hopes to build on the collapse of Islamic State to launch a new political process towards ending the six-year-long conflict.

Damascus has said it is ready to attend the Nov. 18 Sochi congress which is set to focus on a new constitution, saying the time is right thanks to Syrian army gains and the “terrorists’ obliteration”.

But officials in the anti-Assad opposition rejected the meeting and insisted any peace talks be held under U.N. sponsorship in Geneva, where peace talks have failed to make any progress towards ending the conflict since it erupted in 2011.

The congress amounted to a meeting “between the regime and the regime”, said Mohammad Alloush, a member of the opposition High Negotiations Committee and a senior official with the Jaish al-Islam rebel group.

The HNC was surprised it had been mentioned in a list of groups invited to the congress and would “issue a statement with other parties setting out the general position rejecting this conference”, Alloush told Reuters.

The Turkey-based Syrian National Coalition (SNC) political opposition group said the congress was an attempt to circumvent “the international desire for political transition” in Syria.

“The Coalition will not participate in any negotiations with the regime outside Geneva or without U.N. sponsorship,” SNC spokesman Ahmad Ramadan told Reuters.

A Russian negotiator said on Tuesday that Syrian groups who choose to boycott the congress risked being sidelined as the political process moves ahead.

Russia has invited 33 Syrian groups and political parties to what it calls a “Syrian Congress on National Dialogue”.

Russian President Vladimir Putin first mentioned the idea of the congress last month, saying that he believed Moscow and the Syrian government would soon finally defeat militants in Syria.

Helped by Russia’s air force and an array of Iran-backed Shi‘ite militias, Assad has defeated many of the Syrian rebels who were fighting to topple him, leaving him militarily unassailable and the rebels confined to enclaves of the west.

Damascus and its allies have also recovered swathes of central and eastern Syria from Islamic State in recent months, while a separate campaign by U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) has driven IS from other areas of the country.

The separate campaigns are now converging on Islamic State’s last strongholds in Deir al-Zor province at the Iraqi border.

Russia’s decision to invite the Kurdish groups which dominate the SDF to Sochi triggered Turkish irritation on Wednesday. Ankara, which views the dominant Syrian Kurdish groups as a national security threat, said it was unacceptable that the Kurdish YPG militia had been invited.

Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Turkish and Russian officials had discussed the issue and that he had held meetings of his own to “solve the problem on the spot.”

Turkcell first sued MTN in a U.S. court in 2012, alleging the firm used bribery and wrongful influence to win a lucrative Iranian license that was originally awarded to Turkcell.

It dropped the suit a year later after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a separate case made clear U.S. courts would not have jurisdiction in a claim involving two foreign firms in an overseas dispute.

A year later, Turkcell filed in South Africa, where the case has been stuck in procedural wrangling since.

Turkcell said in a statement MTN’s pleas were “meritless, technical legal defenses” and would be rejected by the court.

“Today’s events are a positive step forward in our case, and MTN’s admissions are confirmation of our claims,” Turkcell Executive Vice President for Legal Issues Serhat Demir said, without saying which claims it believed MTN had admitted to.

MTN obtained the license in Iran in 2005 and maintains that Turkcell missed out because it would not comply with an Iranian rule that caps the shareholding in the license at 49 percent.

Iran is MTN’s third largest market out of the 22 countries the company operates in.

MTN previously appointed a retired British judge to lead an external investigation into Turkcell’s allegations. That probe dismissed the accusations, calling them “a fabric of lies, distortions and inventions”.",MTN to defend 'opportunistic' $4.2 billion suit in South African court,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mtn-group-irancell/mtn-to-defend-opportunistic-4-2-billion-suit-in-south-african-court-idUSKBN1D00ZY

“We aren’t satisfied with our top-line growth and we are addressing these issues by controlling everything that is within our control,” CEO Jim Smith told analysts on an earnings call.

Although earnings-per-share beat estimates in part due to cost controls, the revenue miss pushed shares down 6.5 percent to $43.81 on the New York Stock Exchange; they were at C$56.59 in Toronto.

The results highlight the need for Thomson Reuters to find ways to generate revenue outside of managing costs, said Doug Arthur, an analyst at Huber Research Partners.

“People understand the company is doing a great job on costs,” Arthur said. “But there has been a lot of anticipation that revenues are going to hit an inflection point, and it’s just not happening.”

In its Financial & Risk segment, the company’s biggest, sales outpaced cancellations, a key indicator of future growth. Overall revenue for the unit was up slightly, but was down one percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa.

Specifically, British and European financial services clients are concerned about upcoming EU securities rules, set to take effect in January, as well as Brexit, Smith said.

”The quarter was the tale of two cities, or more like the tale of two continents,“ as the company saw unexpected softness in the UK and Europe and strength in the Americas,” Smith told Reuters. “We heard from the market, that was largely because of upcoming regulatory changes.”

Thomson Reuters still expects year-over-year growth in its financial business in 2017 and 2018, but the extent of the improvement will depend on fourth-quarter net sales, executives said on the call.

The company sees a stronger pipeline of deals for its Financial & Risk unit, Smith said.

The news and information company said full-year profits will be at the high end of its earlier forecast.

Third-quarter net earnings rose to $348 million, or 46 cents per share, from $286 million, or 36 cents per share, a year ago.

Adjusted for special items, earnings were 68 cents per share.

Total revenue grew 1 percent excluding currency to $2.79 billion. Sales in its legal business rose 1 percent to $843 million.

The massive data breach, believed to affect almost the entire population of Malaysia, was first reported last month by Lowyat.net, a local technology news website. The website said it had received a tip-off that someone was trying to sell huge databases of personal information on its forums.

The country’s internet regulator, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), was looking into the matter with the police, Communications and Multimedia Minister Salleh Said Keruak said on Wednesday.

“We have identified several potential sources of the leak and we should be able to complete the probe soon,” Salleh told reporters at parliament.

The leaked data included lists of mobile phone numbers, identification card numbers, home addresses, and SIM card data of 46.2 million customers from at least 12 Malaysian mobile phone and mobile virtual network operators (MVNO).

LIKE EQUIFAX

Cybersecurity researchers said the leaked data was extensive enough to allow criminals to create fraudulent identities to make online purchases.

Justin Lie, CEO of Cashshield, a Singapore-based anti-fraud company, compared the Malaysian case in its “degree of complexity” to the cyber attack on U.S. credit-scoring agency Equifax Inc, which said in September that cyber criminals had stolen sensitive information from 145.5 million people.

“Now these hackers have more quality information such as birth dates, IC numbers, mobile numbers, email address and passwords,” Lie said about the Malaysian attack.

Customers of Malaysia’s biggest mobile service providers, including Maxis (MXSC.KL), Axiata Group’s Celcom (AXIA.KL) and DiGi (DSOM.KL), among others, were affected.

MCMC’s chief operating officer Mazlan Ismail said on Tuesday the regulator had met with local telecommunications companies to seek their cooperation in the probe, according to state news agency Bernama.

Celcom, Maxis and Digi said in separate statements they were cooperating with authorities on the investigation.

“ALMOST EVERY MALAYSIAN”

According to a Singapore-based cybersecurity researcher, the leaked database was initially being sold on several underground forums for 1 bitcoin, which was trading on Wednesday at around $6,500. At least one other user was posting a link for anyone to download it for free.

The researcher, who declined to be named, said he had seen at least 10 people on an online forum in the “dark web” download the data before it was taken offline.

“Discussion in the dark web shows a huge interest,” he said.

Time stamps indicate the leaked data was last updated between May and July 2014, Lowyat.net said.

“We are urging the telco and MVNO companies mentioned above to alert, and start immediately replacing the SIM cards, of all affected customers, especially those who have not updated their SIM cards since 2014,” Lowyat.net said in a post.

Malaysia’s population is around 32 million, but many have several mobile numbers. The lists are also believed to include inactive numbers and temporary ones bought by visiting foreigners, The Star newspaper reported.

Bryce Boland, FireEye’s chief technology officer in Asia Pacific, said if the data was widely available as suspected, it could be used for identity fraud and scams.

“This stolen data may ultimately impact almost every Malaysian,” he said.

The data also includes private information of more than 80,000 individuals leaked from the records of the Malaysian Medical Council, the Malaysian Medical Association, and the Malaysian Dental Association, Lowyat.net said.

O Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) informou nesta quarta-feira que a produção industrial registrou alta de 0,2 por cento em setembro sobre o mês anterior, após queda de 0,7 por cento em agosto.

A expectativa em pesquisa da Reuters era de alta de 0,6 por cento na comparação mensal.

Em relação ao mesmo mês de 2016, o setor teve avanço de 2,6 por cento, também aquém da projeção de economistas de alta de 3,1 por cento nessa base de comparação.

“A indústria vem mostrando algum tipo de melhora, mas num ritmo lento e gradual. O cenário não mudou e esse é o perfil do segmento”, explicou o coordenador da pesquisa no IBGE, André Macedo.

Esse cenário fica evidente nas leituras trimestrais. A indústria fechou o terceiro trimestre com crescimento de 0,9 por cento sobre o período anterior, após altas de 1,1 por cento no segundo trimestre e de 1,4 por cento no primeiro trimestre sobre os três últimos meses de 2016.

Em setembro, segundo o IBGE, somente a categoria de Bens Intermediários apresentou alta em relação a agosto, de 0,7 por cento. A produção de Bens de Consumo recuou 0,7 por cento enquanto a de Bens de Capital, uma medida de investimento, caiu 0,3 por cento.

A confiança da indústria vem apresentando sinais de melhora e chegou em outubro ao maior patamar desde abril de 2014, segundo a Fundação Getulio Vargas.

Isso em um ambiente no país de inflação e juros baixos de forma contínua, o que incentiva o consumo e vem ajudando na recuperação econômica, embora a retomada do emprego ainda seja baseada no trabalho informal.

Now, as tensions rise after North Korean missile launches over Japan and nuclear tests, U.S. President Donald Trump has made Megumi’s case part of his attacks on Pyongyang. He mentioned her in a September speech at the United Nations and during his Japan visit next week plans to meet her parents and other families whose loved ones were stolen.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made the abductions a keystone of his political career and said he won’t rest until all 13 of those Pyongyang admits to kidnapping have returned and divulges information about the others Japan suspects were taken. Megumi Yokota has become the poster child for the cause.

But progress has largely stalled since 2002, when five of the 13 returned home. Pyongyang said the other eight, including Megumi, were dead.

Trump is the third U.S. president abductee families have met, following George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

Yokota hopes the Trump meeting will give the issue new life. With Abe in charge, Megumi’s return may be closer, although Yokota shows hints of impatience with Abe, in office since late 2012.

“I’d like (Abe) to put his reputation and his government on the line and lead this issue to a resolution,” he said.

Toru Hasuike, the brother of abductee Kaoru Hasuike, one of those who returned to Japan, says the Trump meeting is merely a nod to Abe’s conservative base.

”This is a performance, making political use of them,“ he told Reuters, referring to the Yokotas. ”Asking America for help is strange. It’s our country, so the Japanese government should take responsibility to help them.”

Raising the issue will generate more awareness, but progress is unlikely, said Robert Boynton, a journalism professor at New York University and author of a 2016 book on the abductions.

“The sad thing is I think the North Koreans are playing a waiting game - waiting for people like the Yokotas to pass away, that the next generation won’t be as exercised and the issue will just go away,” Boynton said.

Takuya Yokota hopes to once again meet the older sister who doted on her twin brothers.

“I think of her at work, I think of her before I sleep,” he said. “When it gets cold and the snow falls ... I wonder if she’s warm enough. I think of this every day.”",Grief-stricken families of Japanese abducted by North Korea pin hopes on Trump,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-asia-japan-abductees/grief-stricken-families-of-japanese-abducted-by-north-korea-pin-hopes-on-trump-idUSKBN1D13X7

If Puigdemont fails to answer Thursday’s High Court summons, an arrest warrant could be issued that would make it virtually impossible for him to stand in a snap regional election called by the Spanish government for Dec. 21.

There was currently no arrest warrant out for Puigdemont, the lawyer, Paul Bekaert, told Associated Press.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Puigdemont and his government on Friday, hours after the Catalan parliament made a unilateral declaration of independence -- a vote boycotted by the opposition and declared illegal by Spanish courts.

On Monday, Spain’s state prosecutor filed charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds against Puigdemont for defying the central government by holding an referendum on secession on Oct. 1 and later proclaiming independence.

Puigdemont traveled to Belgium at the weekend with other members of the dismissed Catalan administration and hired a lawyer.

“(He) is not going to Madrid and I suggest that they question him here in Belgium. It is possible,” Bekaert told AP, adding there were provisions in the law that allowed his questioning outside Spain.

The High Court summoned Puigdemont and 13 other former members of the Catalan government to testify in Madrid on Thursday and Friday on the prosecutor’s charges.

A judge will then decide whether those called to testify should go to jail pending an investigation that could take several years and potentially lead to a trial. The judge might also grant them conditional bail or order them to surrender their passports.

If Puigdemont and his associates did not turn up, the judge might also order them jailed as a flight risk.

The courts have also told the Catalan secessionist leaders to deposit 6.2 million euros ($7.2 million) by Friday to cover potential liabilities.

“OFF TO PRISON”?

Three former Catalan government advisors returned to Spain from Belgium late on Tuesday and were greeted at Barcelona’s international airport by a small crowd chanting “off to prison”.

Puigdemont and four others were not among those returning to Spain. He said on Tuesday he would only go back to Spain when given unspecified “guarantees” by the Spanish government.

Wednesday is a national holiday in Spain and government offices are closed, giving a brief respite in Spain’s gravest political crisis since its return to democracy some four decades ago.

Following a tumultuous month, attention is also gradually turning to the December election, called by Rajoy when Madrid took over control of the previously autonomous region.

Puigdemont said in Brussels on Tuesday he accepted the election and the Madrid government said he was welcome to stand, though legal proceedings might prevent that.

Uncertainty over how the crisis will play out has prompted more than 1,800 Catalonia-based companies to move their legal headquarters out of the region and the government to lower its country-wide economic forecasts for next year.

On Wednesday, rating agency Moody’s said the declaration of independence and the suspension of self rule were credit negative for the region and the country, and that associated uncertainty would damage sentiment and consumer spending.

Moody’s raised Spain’s credit rating to Baa2 in 2014 as the country emerged from a prolonged economic slump.

On Tuesday, Moody’s affirmed Catalonia’s long-term issuer and debt ratings of Ba3, saying the government’s reinforced control compensated for the increased risks, in particular the region’s rapidly deteriorating business climate.",Ousted Catalan leader will not return to Spain to testify: lawyer,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia/ousted-catalan-leader-will-not-return-to-spain-to-testify-lawyer-idUKKBN1CZ0IN?il=0

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

Having intervened decisively in the Syrian war in 2015 in support of President Bashar al-Assad, Russia now hopes to build on the collapse of Islamic State to launch a new political process towards ending the six-year-long conflict.

Damascus has said it is ready to attend the Nov. 18 Sochi congress which is set to focus on a new constitution, saying the time is right thanks to Syrian army gains and the “terrorists’ obliteration”.

But officials in the anti-Assad opposition rejected the meeting and insisted any peace talks be held under U.N. sponsorship in Geneva, where peace talks have failed to make any progress towards ending the conflict since it erupted in 2011.

The congress amounted to a meeting “between the regime and the regime”, said Mohammad Alloush, a member of the opposition High Negotiations Committee and a senior official with the Jaish al-Islam rebel group.

The HNC was surprised it had been mentioned in a list of groups invited to the congress and would “issue a statement with other parties setting out the general position rejecting this conference”, Alloush told Reuters.

The Turkey-based Syrian National Coalition (SNC) political opposition group said the congress was an attempt to circumvent “the international desire for political transition” in Syria.

“The Coalition will not participate in any negotiations with the regime outside Geneva or without U.N. sponsorship,” SNC spokesman Ahmad Ramadan told Reuters.

A Russian negotiator said on Tuesday that Syrian groups who choose to boycott the congress risked being sidelined as the political process moves ahead.

Russia has invited 33 Syrian groups and political parties to what it calls a “Syrian Congress on National Dialogue”.

Russian President Vladimir Putin first mentioned the idea of the congress last month, saying that he believed Moscow and the Syrian government would soon finally defeat militants in Syria.

Helped by Russia’s air force and an array of Iran-backed Shi‘ite militias, Assad has defeated many of the Syrian rebels who were fighting to topple him, leaving him militarily unassailable and the rebels confined to enclaves of the west.

Damascus and its allies have also recovered swathes of central and eastern Syria from Islamic State in recent months, while a separate campaign by U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) has driven IS from other areas of the country.

The separate campaigns are now converging on Islamic State’s last strongholds in Deir al-Zor province at the Iraqi border.

Russia’s decision to invite the Kurdish groups which dominate the SDF to Sochi triggered Turkish irritation on Wednesday. Ankara, which views the dominant Syrian Kurdish groups as a national security threat, said it was unacceptable that the Kurdish YPG militia had been invited.

Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Turkish and Russian officials had discussed the issue and that he had held meetings of his own to “solve the problem on the spot.”

“He started studying religion in the United States,” said Muminov, adding that Saipov “couldn’t get enough” of the religious freedoms enjoyed in the United States after living in the strict confines of Uzbekistan.

In Uzbekistan, an authoritarian, predominantly Muslim country in Central Asia ruled by Moscow until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the practice of Islam is tightly controlled by a government wary of radicalism.

Tuesday’s attack shines an uncomfortable light on Islamist militancy in Central Asia which has supplied Islamic State in Syria and Iraq with thousands of fighters. If the attacker’s identity is confirmed, it would be at least the fourth deadly attack by an Uzbek national or ethnic Uzbek this year.

Muminov said Saipov had lived in Stow two or three years ago, that they had met through the local Uzbek community, and that Saipov had also worked there as a truck driver.

Muminov said he had heard about the attack from members of the local Uzbek community, some of whom he said were getting ready to be questioned by the authorities.

He said he had no first-hand information about whether Saipov had carried out the attack and painted a picture of a man who was struggling to make it in the United States, had few friends, and poor communication and English language skills.

”He was withdrawn, nervous, sometimes aggressive. Because of that he was lonely, he lived in his own world. He was not very popular,” said Muminov. He said Saipov’s English was poor and he did not speak Russian very well. Muminov said he had last spoken to Saipov about two months ago.

In a letter of condolence to President Donald Trump on Wednesday, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said Uzbekistan was ready to use “all its resources” to help investigate the New York attack.

It was the bloodiest single attack on New Yorkers since the Sept. 11, 2001, suicide hijackings of jetliners steered into the World Trade Center. It poses a challenge for Mirziyoyev, who assumed office at the end of 2016 and is trying to slowly open up his country after decades of authoritarian rule.

On New Year’s day, an Uzbek gunman burst into a nightclub in the Turkish city of Istanbul and killed 39 people. In April, an ethnic Uzbek man born in Kyrgyzstan blew up a metro train in the Russian city of St Petersburg, killing at least 14 people, and that same month an Uzbek man rammed a truck into a crowd in Stockholm, killing four people.","New York attack suspect, an Uzbek immigrant, turned to religion in U.S. - associate",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-new-york-attack/new-york-attack-suspect-an-uzbek-immigrant-turned-to-religion-in-u-s-associate-idUKKBN1D02R8?il=0

Using the so-called “New York channel,” Joseph Yun, U.S. negotiator with North Korea, has been in contact with diplomats at Pyongyang’s United Nations mission, the official said, at a time when an exchange of bellicose insults between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has fueled fears of military conflict.

While U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Oct. 17 said he would continue “diplomatic efforts ... until the first bomb drops,” the official’s comments were the clearest sign the United States was directly discussing issues beyond the release of American prisoners, despite Trump having dismissed direct talks as pointless.

There is no sign, however, that the behind-the-scenes communications have improved a relationship vexed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, the death of U.S. university student Otto Warmbier days after his release by Pyongyang in June and the detention of three other Americans.

Word of quiet engagement with Pyongyang comes despite Trump’s comments, North Korea’s weapons advances and suggestions by some U.S. and South Korean officials that Yun’s interactions with North Koreans had been reined in.

“It has not been limited at all, both (in) frequency and substance,” said the senior State Department official.

Among the points that Yun has made to his North Korean interlocutors is to “stop testing” nuclear bombs and missiles, the official said.

North Korea this year conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear detonation and has test-fired a volley of missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that, if perfected, could in theory reach the United States mainland.

The possibility that Pyongyang may be closer to attaching a nuclear warhead to an ICBM has alarmed the Trump administration, which in April unveiled a policy of “maximum pressure and engagement” that has so far failed to deter North Korea.

At the start of Trump’s presidency, Yun’s instructions were limited to seeking the release of U.S. prisoners.

“It is (now) a broader mandate than that,” said the State Department official, declining, however, to address whether authority had been given to discuss North Korea’s nuclear and missile program.

In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China welcomed any dialogue between the United States and North Korea.

“We encourage North Korea and the United States to carry out engagement and dialogue,” Hua told reporters, adding that she hoped talks could help return the issue to a diplomatic track for resolution.

SANCTIONS AND ENGAGEMENT

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has urged all United Nations members to fully and transparently implement sanctions against North Korea, which he said has emerged as a global threat.

Speaking at the United Nations on Sept. 19, Trump vowed to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened the United States or its allies, raising anxieties about the possibility of military conflict.

Twelve days later, after Tillerson said Washington was probing for a diplomatic opening, Trump said on Twitter that his chief diplomat was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man” - his mocking nickname for the North Korean leader.

Democratic U.S. senators introduced a bill on Tuesday they said would prevent Trump from launching a nuclear first strike on North Korea on his own, highlighting the issue days before the Republican’s first presidential trip to Asia.

A high-ranking North Korean defector said in Washington on Tuesday that he backed the Trump administration’s policy of pressuring Pyongyang through sanctions, coupled with “maximum engagement” with the leadership and increased efforts to get information into North Korea to educate its people.

“I strongly believe in the use of soft power before taking any military actions,” Thae Yong Ho, chief of mission at Pyongyang’s embassy in London until he defected in 2016, told the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

The New York channel is one of the few conduits the United States has for communicating with North Korea, which has itself made clear it has little interest in serious talks before it develops a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the continental United States.

The last high-level contact between Yun and the North Koreans was when he traveled to North Korea in June to secure the release of Warmbier, who died shortly after he returned home in a coma, the State Department official said.

The Trump administration has demanded North Korea release three other U.S. citizens: missionary Kim Dong Chul and academics Tony Kim and Kim Hak Song.

Warmbier’s death was a factor in the chilling of U.S.-North Korean contacts around that time but the biggest impact came from Pyongyang’s stepped-up testing, the official said.

The official said, however, that “the preferred endpoint is not a war but some kind of diplomatic settlement” and suggestions that Washington is setting up a binary choice for Pyongyang to capitulate diplomatically or military action were “misleading.”

Diplomacy, the official said, “has a lot more room to go.”

Wilshere, who broke his leg while on loan at Bournemouth last season, has been largely limited to cup appearances this season but has impressed with his creativity in Europe.

The 25-year-old has not featured for his country since the last-16 defeat by Iceland in last year’s European Championships.

However, Wenger believes a fully fit Wilshere will be an added asset in attack for England manager Gareth Southgate ahead of this month’s friendlies against Germany and Brazil.

“A super-fit Jack, I don’t know how you can keep him out of the English squad,” Wenger told a news conference on Wednesday.

“I think he is ready, personally. He was not three weeks ago, but he is ready now. In every single competition he is ready to play,” the Frenchman added.

Arsenal, who are top of Group H with three wins from as many games, will rotate their squad for Thursday’s clash with Red Star with one eye on Sunday’s Premier League game against leaders Manchester City.

”I have gone into a rotation policy and I want to stick with that as I am pleased with our performances in all competitions. We can qualify tomorrow and if we win we will qualify as top of the group and that is important.

The massive data breach, believed to affect almost the entire population of Malaysia, was first reported last month by Lowyat.net, a local technology news website. The website said it had received a tip-off that someone was trying to sell huge databases of personal information on its forums.

The country’s internet regulator, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), was looking into the matter with the police, Communications and Multimedia Minister Salleh Said Keruak said on Wednesday.

“We have identified several potential sources of the leak and we should be able to complete the probe soon,” Salleh told reporters at parliament.

The leaked data included lists of mobile phone numbers, identification card numbers, home addresses, and SIM card data of 46.2 million customers from at least 12 Malaysian mobile phone and mobile virtual network operators (MVNO).

LIKE EQUIFAX

Cybersecurity researchers said the leaked data was extensive enough to allow criminals to create fraudulent identities to make online purchases.

Justin Lie, CEO of Cashshield, a Singapore-based anti-fraud company, compared the Malaysian case in its “degree of complexity” to the cyber attack on U.S. credit-scoring agency Equifax Inc, which said in September that cyber criminals had stolen sensitive information from 145.5 million people.

“Now these hackers have more quality information such as birth dates, IC numbers, mobile numbers, email address and passwords,” Lie said about the Malaysian attack.

Customers of Malaysia’s biggest mobile service providers, including Maxis (MXSC.KL), Axiata Group’s Celcom (AXIA.KL) and DiGi (DSOM.KL), among others, were affected.

MCMC’s chief operating officer Mazlan Ismail said on Tuesday the regulator had met with local telecommunications companies to seek their cooperation in the probe, according to state news agency Bernama.

Celcom, Maxis and Digi said in separate statements they were cooperating with authorities on the investigation.

“ALMOST EVERY MALAYSIAN”

According to a Singapore-based cybersecurity researcher, the leaked database was initially being sold on several underground forums for 1 bitcoin, which was trading on Wednesday at around $6,500. At least one other user was posting a link for anyone to download it for free.

The researcher, who declined to be named, said he had seen at least 10 people on an online forum in the “dark web” download the data before it was taken offline.

“Discussion in the dark web shows a huge interest,” he said.

Time stamps indicate the leaked data was last updated between May and July 2014, Lowyat.net said.

“We are urging the telco and MVNO companies mentioned above to alert, and start immediately replacing the SIM cards, of all affected customers, especially those who have not updated their SIM cards since 2014,” Lowyat.net said in a post.

Malaysia’s population is around 32 million, but many have several mobile numbers. The lists are also believed to include inactive numbers and temporary ones bought by visiting foreigners, The Star newspaper reported.

Bryce Boland, FireEye’s chief technology officer in Asia Pacific, said if the data was widely available as suspected, it could be used for identity fraud and scams.

“This stolen data may ultimately impact almost every Malaysian,” he said.

The data also includes private information of more than 80,000 individuals leaked from the records of the Malaysian Medical Council, the Malaysian Medical Association, and the Malaysian Dental Association, Lowyat.net said.

Meanwhile, online employment site jobstreet.com sent emails to its customers saying some personal information of accounts created before 2012 has been exposed.

“(He) is not going to Madrid and I suggest that they question him here in Belgium. It is possible,” Bekaert told AP, adding there were provisions in the law that allowed his questioning outside Spain.

The High Court summoned Puigdemont and 13 other former members of the Catalan government to testify in Madrid on Thursday and Friday on the prosecutor’s charges.

A judge will then decide whether those called to testify should go to jail pending an investigation that could take several years and potentially lead to a trial. The judge might also grant them conditional bail or order them to surrender their passports.

If Puigdemont and his associates did not turn up, the judge might also order them jailed as a flight risk.

The courts have also told the Catalan secessionist leaders to deposit 6.2 million euros ($7.2 million) by Friday to cover potential liabilities.

“OFF TO PRISON”?

Three former Catalan government advisors returned to Spain from Belgium late on Tuesday and were greeted at Barcelona’s international airport by a small crowd chanting “off to prison”.

Puigdemont and four others were not among those returning to Spain. He said on Tuesday he would only go back to Spain when given unspecified “guarantees” by the Spanish government.

Wednesday is a national holiday in Spain and government offices are closed, giving a brief respite in Spain’s gravest political crisis since its return to democracy some four decades ago.

Following a tumultuous month, attention is also gradually turning to the December election, called by Rajoy when Madrid took over control of the previously autonomous region.

Puigdemont said in Brussels on Tuesday he accepted the election and the Madrid government said he was welcome to stand, though legal proceedings might prevent that.

Uncertainty over how the crisis will play out has prompted more than 1,800 Catalonia-based companies to move their legal headquarters out of the region and the government to lower its country-wide economic forecasts for next year.

On Wednesday, rating agency Moody’s said the declaration of independence and the suspension of self rule were credit negative for the region and the country, and that associated uncertainty would damage sentiment and consumer spending.

Moody’s raised Spain’s credit rating to Baa2 in 2014 as the country emerged from a prolonged economic slump.

On Tuesday, Moody’s affirmed Catalonia’s long-term issuer and debt ratings of Ba3, saying the government’s reinforced control compensated for the increased risks, in particular the region’s rapidly deteriorating business climate.",Ousted Catalan leader will not return to Spain to testify: lawyer,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia/ousted-catalan-leader-will-not-return-to-spain-to-testify-lawyer-idUKKBN1CZ0IN

Ce dispositif, créé en 1955 pendant la guerre d‘Algérie, devait initialement durer trois mois - il aura finalement été prolongé à six reprises, afin notamment de sécuriser le Tour de France, l‘Euro 2016, puis l‘élection présidentielle.

”Avec les attaques simultanées à Paris, le pays était en état de sidération“, se souvient le ministre de l‘Intérieur Gérard Collomb, dans les colonnes de l‘Express. ”Nous ne parvenions pas à évaluer le phénomène en cours, et notamment le risque que d‘autres tueries s‘ensuivent.

“Deux ans après, la menace n‘a pas baissé, mais elle a largement évolué”, ajoute-t-il, au lendemain de la signature d‘une loi antiterroriste censée prendre le relais de l‘état d‘urgence.

En l‘espace de deux ans, les attaques coordonnées type commandos ont cédé la place à des attaques dites “low-cost” et à un “terrorisme de proximité”, selon l‘expression du procureur de Paris François Molins, commis par des personnes isolées et donc plus difficilement décelables.

Au total, 241 personnes sont mortes dans des attentats commis sur le sol français depuis 2015, un bilan qui aurait été encore plus élevé si l‘état d‘urgence n‘avait pas été en vigueur, à en croire les autorités.

“Depuis deux ans, 32 projets ont été déjoués, soit grâce à des renseignements venus de l‘étranger, soit grâce à des mesures spécifiques liées à l‘état d‘urgence”, souligne Gérard Collomb.

“C‘est grâce à une perquisition administrative que les services ont découvert, l‘an dernier, que deux individus projetaient de commettre une action terroriste à l‘occasion de la campagne présidentielle” ajoute-t-il.

“EVITER DES ATTENTATS”

L‘état d‘urgence permet à l‘Etat d‘assigner à résidence toute personne “dont l‘activité est dangereuse pour la sécurité et l‘ordre publics” et d‘ordonner “des perquisitions à domicile de jour comme de nuit” sans passer par l‘autorité judiciaire.

Au total, 4.457 perquisitions administratives ont été menées, permettant la saisie de 625 armes, dont 78 de guerre, et 752 personnes ont été assignées à résidence.

“Cela a incontestablement permis d‘éviter des attentats et de clarifier de nombreuses situations”, estime le ministre de l‘Intérieur.

Les perquisitions administratives ont “permis de prévenir des projets moins construits”, reconnaît toutefois le patron de la Direction générale de la sécurité intérieure (DGSI) Laurent Nunez dans Le Monde. “Mais les services ne font pas de différence. Des projets peu élaborés peuvent faire beaucoup de dégâts, on l’a vu à Nice”.

L‘efficacité du dispositif est pointé du doigt depuis deux ans par les associations de défense des droits de l‘homme qui dénoncent un dispositif liberticide et des dérives.

“Sur près de 4.500 perquisitions administratives qui ont été diligentées, à peine 600 ont été fructueuses (essentiellement des infractions à la législation des armes et des stupéfiants) et moins de 20 étaient relatives à un délit en lien avec le terrorisme”, note l‘avocat de la Ligue des Droits de l‘Homme Patrick Spinosi dans une tribune au Monde.

“REPARTIR BREDOUILLES”

“Du point de vue de cette menace, qui est la seule à justifier ces mesures de contrainte exceptionnelles, dans plus de 99 % des cas, des forces de police sont entrées (souvent de nuit) chez des particuliers, pour repartir bredouilles, après avoir enfoncé leur porte et fouillé leur intimité, sur la base de soupçons manifestement infondés”, ajoute-t-il.

Au-delà des défenseurs des droits de l‘Homme, la prolongation de l‘état d‘urgence a suscité des réserves au sein même du Conseil d‘Etat. Le vice-président Jean-Marc Sauvé a estimé l‘an dernier qu‘il s‘agissait d’“un état de crise qui ne peut être renouvelé indéfiniment” et a jugé opportun de fixer une durée maximale aux assignations à résidence.

La fin du dispositif ne devrait pas pour autant faire taire les critiques. La loi sur la sécurité intérieure et la lutte contre le terrorisme, appelée à prendre le relais dès jeudi, transpose certaines mesures du régime d‘exception dans le droit commun, au grand dam de certaines ONG.

Face aux inquiétudes, Emmanuel Macron a assuré mardi à Strasbourg que la loi n‘avait “aucunement pour objet de pérenniser l‘état d‘urgence comme certains l‘ont dit mais elle prévoit des mesures nécessaires à la protection de nos compatriotes, strictement encadrées et soumises à un contrôle renforcé du juge”. Il a également rappelé que la loi serait réévaluée “d‘ici deux ans” afin d‘ajuster certaines mesures.

“Il ne faut jamais baisser la garde”, renchérit Gérard Collomb. “Il serait présomptueux de croire que la fin de l‘état d‘urgence signifie que le danger est derrière nous.”",L'état d'urgence prend fin en France après deux ans de vif débat,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRKBN1D01XG-OFRTP

Le conducteur, blessé par la police, serait un ressortissant ouzbek âgé de 29 ans qui a laissé une note dans laquelle il dit avoir agi au nom de l‘Etat islamique, rapportent CNN et le New York Times.

Il s‘agit de l‘attaque la plus meurtrière commise à New York depuis celles du 11 septembre 2001 contre les tours du World Trade Center, elles aussi, situées dans le bas de Manhattan.

L‘assaillant a engagé sa camionnette à contre-sens d‘une piste et a fauché des passants à plus de 100km/h avant de percuter un car de ramassage scolaire.

Le conducteur en est alors sorti en brandissant ce qui semblait être des armes de poing avant d‘être blessé par balle à l‘abdomen par un policier. Un pistolet de paintball et une autre arme factice ont été découverts sur les lieux.

Les faits se sont déroulés en quelques secondes. Dans une vidéo tournée par un passant et diffusée sur internet, on peut voir des vélos endommagés et éparpillés le long de la piste ainsi que deux corps à terre.

Le suspect a été hospitalisé et opéré. La police n‘a pas révélé son identité. Selon une source proche de l‘enquête, il s‘agit d‘un Ouzbek nommé Sayfullo Saipov et âgé de 29 ans.

Les autorités ouzbèkes ont fait savoir que l‘information était en cours de vérification et le président Chavkat Mirzioïev a adressé une lettre de condoléances à Donald Trump, l‘assurant que son pays était prêt à coopérer pleinement dans l‘enquête.

D‘après la presse, l‘assaillant vivait à Paterson, dans le New Jersey, à une quarantaine de kilomètres de Manhattan. Il aurait loué la camionnette dans un magasin de bricolage Home Depot, à Passaic, au sud de Paterson.

Six des décès ont été constatés sur place et les deux autres à l‘hôpital, selon le préfet de police James O‘Neil. Cinq des huit tués étaient Argentins, a fait savoir le ministère des Affaires étrangères à Buenos Aires. Ils se trouvaient à New York pour fêter le 30e anniversaire de leur baccalauréat. Un sixième Argentin, membre du même groupe, figure parmi les blessés et un Belge compte parmi les tués, selon Bruxelles.

D‘après CNN et NBC News, le suspect est arrivé aux Etats-Unis en 2010. Aux premières heures de mercredi, des policiers se sont déployés autour d‘une maison de Paterson, ville industrielle connue pour l‘importance de sa population immigrée, où vivent 25.000 à 30.000 musulmans.

“PAS D‘ÉLÉMENTS ÉVOQUANT UN COMPLOT PLUS LARGE”

Saipov a comparu en 2015 devant la justice de Pennsylvanie pour des infractions au code de la route commises la même année. Selon les documents judiciaires, il a alors déclaré des adresses à Paterson et Cuyahoga Falls, dans l‘Ohio. Il aurait également vécu à Tampa, en Floride, indique ABC.

Bill de Blasio, maire de New York, a très vite parlé d‘un acte terroriste, tout comme le département de la Sécurité intérieure. Andrew Cuomo, gouverneur de l‘Etat, a quant à lui assuré que le suspect avait agi seul.

“Il n‘y a pas d‘éléments évoquant un complot plus large (...) Ce sont les actes d‘un individu isolé visant à causer la douleur et probablement la mort”, a-t-il déclaré à la presse.

Donald Trump a lui aussi évoqué “une attaque terroriste” et a dénoncé mercredi le système américain d‘attribution de visas pour les ressortissants étrangers.

La législation américaine prévoit depuis 1990 l‘allocation annuelle d‘un petit nombre de visas pour les ressortissants de pays ayant un faible taux d‘immigration vers les Etats-Unis. L‘attribution se fait par tirage au sort des candidats à l‘émigration dans le cadre du “Diversity Immigrant Visa Program”.

Dans un message sur Twitter, Donald Trump a déclaré qu‘il souhaitait une attribution de ces visas “au mérite” et non plus “au hasard”. Il a dit avoir ordonné au département de la Sécurité intérieure de renforcer le programme de contrôle des étrangers (Extreme Vetting Program).

Prié de dire lors de sa conférence de presse si le conducteur avait vraiment crié “Allah Akbar” (“Dieu est le plus grand” en arabe) comme plusieurs organes de presse l‘ont rapporté, le préfet O‘Neill s‘est borné à répondre que les propos tenus par le suspect quand il est sorti de son véhicule, ainsi que les circonstances générales, avaient conduit les enquêteurs à qualifier l‘incident de “terroriste”.

Emmanuel Macron a exprimé “l‘émotion et la solidarité de la France à New York et aux États-Unis”. “Notre combat pour la liberté nous unit plus que jamais”, a déclaré le président français sur Twitter.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots.
On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.
Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.",Born-again BlackBerry: Canadian icon hopes to ride trucks to growth,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-recovery/born-again-blackberry-canadian-icon-hopes-to-ride-trucks-to-growth-idUSKBN1901P1

The FSB, which coordinates financial regulation across the Group of 20 Economies (G20), said in its first report on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning that the risks they pose need monitoring.

AI and machine learning refer to technology that is replacing traditional methods to assess the creditworthiness of customers, to crunch data, price insurance contracts and spot profitable trades across markets.

There are no international regulatory standards for AI and machine learning, but the FSB left open whether new rules are needed.

Data on rapidly growing usage of AI is largely unavailable, leaving regulators unsure about the impact of potentially new and unexpected links between markets and banks, the report said.

AI could, for example, lead to “non-sustainable” increases in credit by automating credit scoring.

While AI shows substantial promise if risks are properly managed, it could create too much dependency among banks and insurers on the few specialist businesses that provide AI technology.

Expected rapid growth in AI also raises the prospect of outside technology players expanding their influence over the finance sector.

“This could in turn lead to the emergence of new systemically important players that could fall outside the regulatory perimeter,” the FSB said.

If a major AI provider went bust, it could lead to operational disruptions at a large number of financial firms at the same time, especially if used in “mission critical” applications, the report said.

Regulators could also find it difficult to identify who has made key financial decisions that go wrong.

“If AI and machine learning-based decisions cause losses to financial intermediaries across the financial system, there may be a lack of clarity around responsibility,” the report said.

REVOLUTION

The pace of technological advance will also make it harder to fashion durable rules for AI activity that some academics expect to revolutionize the financial sector.

The report said that RegTech investment, or use of machines to comply with a welter of new regulations introduced to tackle money laundering and make banks safer, could reach $6.45 billion by 2020.

Consultancy Accenture said in May that three quarters of bankers surveyed believed that AI will become the primary way banks interact with customers within the next three years.

European insurers invested $400 million in “InsurTech” or real-time technology to help to reduce payouts.

Nordea (NDA.ST), the Nordic region’s biggest bank, said last month that automation would help it to shed at least 4,000 staff. It has already introduced an AI chatbox to answer common customer questions.

Dutch bank ING (INGA.AS) wants to increase the number of traders using AI.

Fund managers are also using outside specialists to obtain machine-learning tools that sift through news and research for insight into market trends.

So-called “quant” funds use AI to manage $1 trillion in assets. Though that is only a fraction of the $40 trillion in mutual funds globally, the FSB said industry estimates suggest that could grow rapidly.

The regulators themselves are also using AI to make it easier to detect fraud and money laundering, while central banks expect to use AI for real-time predictions using big data to help to determine monetary policy, the report said.

The FSB acknowledged that AI is helping the financial sector to cut costs, improve profitability and widen choice for customers, but added that it also raises concerns over privacy of data used in AI applications.","Rise of the machines must be monitored, say global finance regulators",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-regulation-banks-artificialintelligen/rise-of-the-machines-must-be-monitored-say-global-finance-regulators-idUKKBN1D1534

Sheikh Ali Salman, secretary general of al-Wefaq party, and Sheikh Hassan Sultan are accused of colluding with Qatar to carry out “hostile acts” in Bahrain and damage its national interests and prestige, according to a statement on state news agency BNA.

The men met Qatari officials as well as affiliated agents inside Lebanese Shi‘ite militia Hezbollah, the statement said. It accused them of transferring confidential information and receiving financial support from Qatar.

There was no immediate comment from al-Wefaq.

The prosecutor ordered that both men be taken into custody.

Salman is already serving a four-year prison sentence for inciting hatred and insulting the interior ministry, after he was arrested in 2015.

He was summoned and interrogated about the new accusations in the presence of his lawyer, the statement said.

It did not elaborate on whether Sultan was detained.

Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cut diplomatic, transport and trade ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of financing terrorism.

Bahrain and close ally Saudi Arabia believe Qatar is fomenting unrest in the island kingdom by supporting protests and sporadic attacks against security forces, backed by arch-rival Iran.

Both countries deny the charges and say the boycott is an attempt to rein in support for reform in Bahrain.

The Sunni-ruled kingdom, where the U.S. Fifth Fleet is based, has been on edge since 2011 “Arab Spring” protests led by its Shi‘ite majority were put down by the government with the help of fellow Gulf Arab states.

The government banned al-Wefaq and revoked the citizenship of the country’s top Shi‘ite Muslim cleric as part of a crackdown on the opposition.

India’s annual demand for petroleum coke, an energy intensive fuel that emits harmful sulfur oxides and ample carbon dioxide when burned, has doubled to 27 million tonnes in the past four years. The country imports about 14 million tonnes annually, mainly from the United States.

Its use was banned around New Delhi to rein in pollution. The country’s environmentalists are trying to stop imports of petroleum coke, known as petcoke, which emits sulfur oxides that are known to cause lung disease and acid rain.

To replace petcoke, industries from dyeing units to brick kilns are switching to imports of coal.

The national capital region alone consumes 2.2 million tonnes of petcoke a year. A country-wide import ban would require replacing 14 million tonnes of petcoke a year with 24 million to 31 million tonnes of coal, according to industry calculations, most of which has to be imported.

Jamil Rahman, a coal trader in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, said he has been getting enquiries about replacing local petcoke with Indonesian thermal coal.

Some enquiries were also made about replacing petcoke with high grade, low-sulfur coal from the U.S., traders said.

“Moving to coal is inevitable,” said Lalit Goel, the head of a textile industry body around New Delhi.

The increased demand for coal to replace petcoke, which will largely have to be met by imports, coincides with increasing coal consumption in India for power generation.

India is the world’s second-biggest buyer of foreign coal even though imports have held steady in the last two years because of rising local output.

But demand has picked up in 2017 and coal-fired power plants were left with only five days of inventories on average as of Oct. 26, compared with 15 days at the end of 2016.

“Indian coal imports will gain momentum in Q4 2017, especially for Indonesian coal,” said Rodrigo Echeverri, head of hard commodities research at Noble Group, at an industry event last week.

India’s coal imports will top 18 million tonnes in October for the first time since the middle of 2016, according to ship tracking data on Thomson Reuters Eikon.

The jump in imports comes just as other major buyers across Asia have also stepped up purchases.

Overall Asian coal imports rose above 80 million tonnes in October, after stagnating between 60 million and 70 million tonnes a month for the last two years, the tracking data shows.

As a result, traders now expect the first coal supply shortfall in years, and spot Newcastle coal prices at the Australian port of Newcastle have been hovering around $100 per ton for weeks. That is up from just over $70 in the middle of the year and around $50 in the first half of 2016, before coal markets first started tightening after years of slump.

BOON FOR MINERS

The tight market is a concern for consumers just as the peak winter demand in the northern hemisphere looms.

But the rising demand is a boon for specialist thermal coal suppliers such as Swiss commodity merchant and miner Glencore, Australia’s Whitehaven Coal, and Indonesia’s Adaro Energy, whose stocks have far outperformed those of diversified miners like BHP Billiton or Rio Tinto.

Demand is so strong that a traffic jam of dry-bulk carriers has built up off the eastern and southern coasts of Indonesia’s island of Kalimantan, one of the world’s biggest coal mining regions.

Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that over 100 ships are currently waiting off the region’s coal ports, either loading or waiting to take on coal.

“Indian utilities have been buying a lot of low calorific coal recently, supplied mainly from Indonesia. The ships are now off Kalimantan waiting to load,” said one trader involved in exporting Indonesian coal.",Indian petcoke ban to boost coal imports amid already tight market,https://www.reuters.com/article/india-coal/indian-petcoke-ban-to-boost-coal-imports-amid-already-tight-market-idINKBN1D14UM

Manafort and associate Rick Gates pose a significant flight risk because of the serious nature of the charges, the strong evidence of guilt, their wealth and “their history of deceptive and misleading conduct,” federal prosecutors said in a filing Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Manafort, 68, and Gates, who also worked on Trump’s campaign, pleaded not guilty on Monday in a 12-count indictment, ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government.

The charges came as part of federal special counsel Robert Mueller’s 5-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the 2016 presidential election in Trump’s favor and potential collusion by campaign aides.

The allegations are not related to campaign activities but reveal close ties to Russia, and include activities from 2006 to 2017, which overlaps with the mens’ work on Trump’s campaign.

The two men are under house arrest and have relinquished their U.S. passports, with a $10 million bond set for Manafort and a $5 million bond for Gates.

“Both defendants have substantial ties abroad, including in Ukraine, where both have spent time and have served as agents of its government,” according to the government’s memorandum in support of the conditions of release.

“And both Manafort and Gates have connections to Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs, who have provided millions of dollars to Manafort and Gates.”

The next hearing in the case, set for 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Thursday, will concern the bail conditions that were set at Monday’s arraignment.

Manafort was a longtime U.S. Republican operative before turning his attention to political consulting overseas.

He submitted 10 passport application in the last decade and currently holds three U.S. passports, the memo said.

Asked about the information in the memo, Manafort lawyer Jason Maloni told Reuters on Wednesday his client “looks forward to having these allegations tried before a judge and jury.”

The memo said Manafort’s financial assets were substantial but difficult to quantify because he listed figures on loan applications and other financial documents since 2012 that ranged from $19 million to $136 million.

Other data on Wednesday showed a surge in private sector hiring, indicating that job growth rebounded last month after being depressed in September as hurricanes Harvey and Irma left some workers temporarily unemployed.

Manufacturing and labor strength likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to increase interest rates in December. The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise rates when policymakers conclude a two-day meeting later on Wednesday.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity slipped to a reading of 58.7 last month from 60.8 in September, which was the highest since May 2004. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.

September’s jump in the index was driven by supply chain disruptions, especially in the chemical products sector. The supply bottlenecks, which also pushed up prices of raw materials, resulted in a longer delivery times.

Longer suppliers’ delivery times are normally associated with increased activity, which is a positive contribution to the ISM index. The ISM’s supplier deliveries sub-index fell to 61.4 last month after soaring to 64.4 in September.

The survey’s prices paid sub-index dropped to 68.5 after racing to 71.5 in September, which was the highest reading since May 2011. The production sub-index slipped 1.2 points to a reading of 61.0 in October and a gauge of new orders fell to 63.4. A measure of factory employment dipped to 59.8 from 60.3 in September, which was the highest level since 2011.

Manufacturing is being supported by a strengthening global economy and weakening U.S. dollar.

PRIVATE PAYROLLS SURGE

Separately, the ADP National Employment Report showed private employers hired 235,000 workers last month, the most in seven months, after increasing payrolls by 110,000 jobs in September.

The ADP report, which is jointly produced with Moody’s Analytics, is not a good predictor of the private payrolls component of the employment report. It, however, supported expectations of a sharp rebound in employment last month after nonfarm payrolls declined by 33,000 jobs in September.

Prices for U.S. government bonds were trading higher and the dollar rose against a basket of currencies.

A third report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending increased 0.3 percent to $1.22 trillion as a surge in public construction outlays offset the third straight monthly decline in investment in private projects.

But August’s construction outlays were revised down to show a 0.1 percent gain instead of the previously reported 0.5 percent rise. Construction spending increased 2.0 percent on a year-on-year basis.

In September, investment on private construction projects fell 0.4 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in August. It was the third straight monthly drop in private construction outlays and reflected a 0.8 percent decline in spending on private nonresidential projects. Spending on nonresidential projects in September was the lowest since April 2016.

Spending on nonresidential structures has now declined for four consecutive months. Spending on oil drilling has been slowing in recent months amid moderate gains in oil prices and ample crude supplies. Spending on residential structures was unchanged in September.

The data could impact the government’s gross domestic product estimate for the third quarter published last week. The government’s advance estimate put economic growth at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the July-September quarter, with both residential and nonresidential structures subtracting from output.

In September, outlays on public construction projects jumped 2.6 percent after rising 0.7 percent in August. Spending on state and local government construction projects climbed 2.5 percent.

The new anti-terrorism law, effective from Wednesday, gives police extended powers to search properties, conduct electronic eavesdropping and shut mosques or other locations suspected of preaching hatred.

“Some dread that now that we are out the state of emergency there could be a drop in vigilance, it is the opposite,” French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told journalists during a short visit to police officers guarding the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

“The level of threat is high everywhere in the world,” he said, referring to the attack in New York on Tuesday where a pickup truck driver killed eight people.

The new legislation transposes some of the measures contained in the state of emergency rule into law, although with some modifications.

One measure will allow the Interior Ministry, without approval from a judge, to set up large security perimeters in case of an identified threat, restricting movement of people and vehicles and with power to carry out searches inside the area.

Conservative politicians warn the regulations are not going far enough while human rights groups and members of the left fear police misconduct.

“France has become so addicted to the state of emergency that it is now injecting several of these abusive measures into ordinary law,” Human Rights Watch said before parliament backed the legislation last month.

France’s human rights watchdog, an independent body, has said it is concerned about breaches of rights of Muslims. The French Council of the Muslim Faith, the official interlocutor with the state in the regulation of Muslim religious activities, said it would remain vigilant about the bill’s implementation.

However, the concerns expressed by such rights groups have had little resonance with the public so far. A poll conducted in early October showed more than 80 percent of support for the bill.

Images like these are rare and hard to find. The color illustrations printed in black and white albums were a significant innovation of the time, comics expert Eric Leroy said, and Herge was reluctant to switch to color drawings for fear of losing his trademark touch. Also up for grabs are sketches for the book 'The Castafiore Emerald', offering a unique insight into the craftsmanship behind Herge's works and his thought processes as an illustrator.

It was a rare incident in a country that has improved security since deadly attacks in 2015.

The assailant was known to authorities and said after the attack that he considered the police to be “tyrants”, the statement said.

One of the policemen was taken to hospital for treatment after being wounded in the neck, while the other was only lightly wounded, it said.

“I saw a young man with a thick beard trying to kill a policeman. He put the knife in his neck before he was pursued by a second policeman,” a witness told Reuters. “He shouted ‘Allahu Akbar’ (God is greatest) as he attacked the policemen.”

The Interior Ministry said Wednesday’s suspect had confessed that “he had adopted Takfiri thought three years ago and believes that killing security forces is a form of jihad”.

“Takfiri thought” refers to a view that Muslims should proclaim other Muslims to be infidels and justify attacks against them.

Large numbers of police were deployed to the Bardo square in the aftermath of the attack, a witness said. Blood could be seen on the ground in the square.

The square is opposite the parliament building and close to the Bardo museum, where 21 people, mostly European tourists, were killed in an attack by three gunmen in March 2015.

A security source told Reuters the attacker was 25 and from Ettadamen - one of the largest, poorest suburbs of Tunis.

“I know him well, he is the youngest in a family of six brothers including a sister who works in the parliament’s administration”, Hamid one of the attacker’s neighbors told Reuters.

Colonel Major Khelifa Chibani of Tunisia’s national guard named the attacker as Zied Gharbi. Security forces raided his house and confiscated his personal computer and other items, he said.

Sofian Sliti, a spokesman for judicial counter-terrorism investigations said that “the attacker planned to join terrorist groups in Libya”.

As well as the Bardo killings, Tunisia suffered two other major attacks in 2015, one against tourists at the beach resort of Sousse and the other against presidential guards in the capital.

The 2015 attacks severely damaged the economy, which has a large tourism sector at its Mediterranean beaches. Since then, security has been boosted at strategic sites while authorities have cracked down on militants, dismantling dozens of cells.

The move is a major step towards a return to direct rule from London, which many fear would destabilize the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland.

It also creates a major headache for British Prime Minister Theresa May as she negotiates Britain’s exit from the European Union.

Irish Nationalists Sinn Fein and the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party have shared power in Northern Ireland for a decade under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement, which ended three decades of violence in which 3,600 died.

But Sinn Fein pulled out in January, complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner. The latest round of talks on re-establishing the devolved executive collapsed in failure on Wednesday.

“Sinn Fein is disappointed that the last few weeks of negotiations have ended in failure,” Sinn Fein’s leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O‘Neill, told journalists.

Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said the party was open to dialogue, but only it was meaningful.

Britain’s minister for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire said as there was no immediate prospect of a new executive being formed that he had no choice but to start the process of setting a budget directly from London to ensure funding for essential services.

“This can’t simply continue forever and a day ... There are decisions that have been stored up that have to be taken,” he told journalists.

The budget process could be handed back if agreement is reached between the two parties, he added.

IRISH ROLE?

In a bid to put pressure on the politicians, Brokenshire said he would take advice as to whether the salaries of the deputies in the Northern Ireland devolved parliament should be cut while there is no executive.

He said such a move would require legislation in the British parliament at Westminster.

The budget move also revives the question of what role the government of the neighboring Republic of Ireland should have in the governance of Northern Ireland if power-sharing collapses.

Dublin argues that under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement it should have a role in the direct running of the region, which borders Ireland, if power-sharing breaks down.

Foreign Minister Simon Coveney in September said “there can be no British-only direct rule,” which prompted a British government spokesman to say Britain would “never countenance” joint authority.

Sinn Fein on Wednesday called on Ireland to play a role, saying the British and Irish governments should together “act urgently to deliver equality” in Northern Ireland.

Coveney on Wednesday said the collapse of talks was “regrettable and deeply concerning” and that direct rule could complicate relations with London at a time when it is trying to negotiate favorable terms of Britain’s exit from the European Union.

Markets now see an almost 90 percent chance that the BoE will raise rates to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent on Thursday.
NIESR, however, on Wednesday said a weaker outlook for productivity meant the BoE needed to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points roughly every six months to keep inflation in check.
“Now that we have lowered our productivity growth forecast, we have also raised the interest rate (path).
However, this outlook for growth and interest rates assumed Britain’s departure from the European Union would not lead to major economic disruption, he added.","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s National Institute of Economic and Social Research said it expects the Bank of England to start a sustained rate-tightening cycle on Thursday, which will lead to interest rates peaking at 2 percent in 2021.

FILE PHOTO: A pedestrian walks past the Bank of England in the City of London, Britain April 19, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo

NIESR’s forecast is more hawkish than almost all the economists polled by Reuters last week, and comes a day before economists expect the BoE to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade.

Three months ago, NIESR brought forward its expectation for a first BoE rate rise to February 2018, at a time when most economists still expected the BoE to wait until 2019 before beginning to raise rates.

In September the BoE surprised markets by saying most of its policymakers expected to back a rate rise “over the coming months”.

BoE Governor Mark Carney said this largely reflected a weaker outlook for productivity - which has stagnated in Britain since the financial crisis and reduced the rate at which Britain’s economy can grow without creating excessive inflation.

Markets now see an almost 90 percent chance that the BoE will raise rates to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent on Thursday.

However, most economists polled by Reuters do not see enough in the way of inflation pressures to justify raising rates now, and think a mix of muted price pressures and Brexit uncertainty make a further rate rise unlikely in 2018.

NIESR, however, on Wednesday said a weaker outlook for productivity meant the BoE needed to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points roughly every six months to keep inflation in check.

“Now that we have lowered our productivity growth forecast, we have also raised the interest rate (path). There is a risk of overheating,” NIESR economist Amit Kara said.

NIESR forecasts that consumer price inflation, which hit a five-year high of 3.0 percent in September, will peak at 3.2 percent before the end of the year.

But unlike the United States and the euro zone, Britain’s economy has underperformed over the past 12 months, with the weakest year-on-year growth in four years at 1.5 percent.

The company’s roughly 15,000 drivers have become a familiar sight in Britain since 2013, tapping into the rapidly growing demand for takeaway food from restaurants.

They operate in the gig economy, where many people work for different firms without a fixed contract, and are self-employed, entitling them to only basic rights.

The firm says the vast majority of its couriers enjoy flexible working but some unions and MPs have criticised its practices and say riders should be entitled to rights such as holiday entitlement and the minimum wage.

Law firm Leigh Day, which is bringing the action, said it had submitted claims on behalf of 45 couriers and that a preliminary hearing will be held at an employment tribunal on Nov. 2, where a timetable for the case will be set.

“Our argument is that these riders are controlled, managed and disciplined by Deliveroo and that they clearly do not carry out their own delivery businesses, as Deliveroo argues,” said lawyer Annie Powell.

A spokesman said the company was also calling for a change in legislation to provide other entitlements to its couriers.

“We want to be able to offer riders greater security such as injury pay and sick pay alongside flexible work, but we are currently constrained by the law,” the spokesman said.

“That’s why we have called on the government to update legislation so we can end the trade-off between flexibility and security that currently exists in law.”

The run-up to the Nov. 3 release of the redesigned glass and stainless steel device has been dominated by concerns over the supply and accuracy of the new system, which aims to improve on Samsung’s (005930.KS) face unlock feature.

At $999 (£752.6), the iPhone X is the most expensive phone the company has ever launched, but demand is already far outstripping supply, according to analysts.

“It’s thin, it’s powerful, it has ambitious ideas about what cameras on phones can be used for, and it pushes the design language of phones into a strange new place,” Verge reviewer Nilay Patel said.

Apple shares rose as much as 1.4 percent to a record high of $169.09 on Tuesday.

There is no home button on the iPhone X, a key feature in previous phones.

The fingerprint sensor is gone as well, replaced by FaceID, which unlocks the phone by recognising a face with the help of a front-facing “TrueDepth” infrared camera.

So does the FaceID work? Reviewers had reservations.

While the feature works even if the user changes their appearance, wearing sunglasses for instance, it may not work as well if some key facial features are obscured.

“I tried the phone with at least five of my coworkers. None of their faces unlocked it - although none of them look remotely like me,” CNET reviewer Scott Stein said.

Reviewers said Apple had given guidance that the system works best at a distance of 25 to 50 centimetres away from your face.

WORTH IT OR NOT?

Apple touted the iPhone X as a completely reimagined device. It has a display that covers the entire screen but for a notch at the top that houses sensors, lenses, microphones and speakers.

But many reviewers agreed that while some customers may be willing to pay the steep premium, as they usually do for new Apple devices, others may find the price unnecessary.

“For a lot of people, it’ll be worth it. For a lot of people, it’ll seem ridiculous,” Verge’s Patel said.

“But fundamentally, it’s a new iPhone, and that means you probably already know if you want to spend a thousand dollars on one.”

The iPhone X has three cameras, one in front and two at the back, which reviewers said were “top notch” and the best so far in an iPhone.

The device’s battery seemed to last up to a day, even after running heavy-duty apps, reviewers said.

This is the first time Apple has used an OLED display, which CNBC’s Todd Haselton said was the best display he had ever seen on a smartphone.","iPhone X is best yet and FaceID works, mostly - reviewers",https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone/iphone-x-is-best-yet-and-faceid-works-mostly-reviewers-idUKKBN1D01WL

“In consultation with President Trump and our leadership team, we have decided to release the bill text on Thursday,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said in a statement.

“We are pleased with the progress we are making and we remain on schedule to take action and approve a bill at our Committee beginning next week,” the Republican lawmaker added.

In a tweet on Tuesday night before Brady’s statement, President Donald Trump said: “The Republican House members are working hard (and late) toward the Massive Tax Cuts that they know you deserve. These will be biggest ever!”

Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, are looking to tax reform for their first legislative victory since Trump took office in January. Democrats say the Trump tax plan is a giveaway to corporations and the rich.

Two sources with knowledge of the discussions said earlier on Tuesday that the bill, which had been expected on Wednesday, would emerge a day later to give lawmakers additional time to address differences over the tax treatment of retirement savings accounts and a deduction for state and local tax payments.

Trump and other top Republicans have proposed a plan that would cut taxes for corporations, small businesses and individuals by up to $6 trillion over a decade and pay for the reductions in part by eliminating trillions of dollars in deductions and other tax breaks that are often fiercely defended.

The U.S. tax code has not undergone a major overhaul since 1986, when Republican Ronald Reagan was president.

COMPROMISE?

Earlier on Tuesday, House Republicans appeared to be nearing a deal on state and local taxes that would preserve a federal deduction for property taxes but not income taxes, potentially removing a major obstacle.

Republican Representative Tom Reed of New York said the “sweet spot” compromise was gaining support among high-tax state lawmakers who have signaled their opposition to a proposal to repeal the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction.

Another New York Republican saw things differently.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

“I‘m still inclined to be opposed to it. The income tax is a major factor,” said Representative Peter King.

“This is going to affect our country for the next 20 years, for good or bad. I think the last time we did tax reform, there was like two years of debate. We’re going to have 10 days,” he said.

The SALT compromise would reduce, but not eliminate, a disproportional tax impact on upper middle-class families in high-income tax states such as New York, New Jersey and California. Those states send enough Republicans to Congress to derail a tax bill.

The House bill is expected to cut the top corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and phase out the estate tax paid by the wealthiest taxpayers over two or three years. It may also set a repatriation rate for U.S. businesses with profits overseas, according to a source familiar with a Tuesday meeting between House Speaker Paul Ryan and conservative groups.

It is also likely to set a 15 percent minimum tax on active foreign income of U.S. corporations, according to lobbyists with knowledge of negotiations.

TRUMP, PENCE ENGAGED

As the Trump administration escalated its pro-tax plan campaign, Vice President Mike Pence met with Republicans on Tuesday, while Trump hosted industry leaders and then Ryan, at the White House.

Trump said at the White House he wanted Congress to pass tax reform bills by the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23.

A proposal to limit how much money Americans can direct to their 401(k) retirement accounts and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) on a pre-tax basis is meeting resistance, including from fund managers who handle 54 million such accounts.

Republicans initially proposed capping tax-free 401(k) contributions at $2,400, down from $18,000 in 2017, but the figure is in flux.

“We are either going to strengthen the 401(k)’s and IRA’s so people can save more, or we will leave them as is,” Brady told reporters.

Senator Heidi Heitkamp, one of a few Democrats being courted by Republicans, said she could not support lowering the cap on tax-free retirement contributions. “I will not vote for that,” she told reporters.",Release of House tax bill delayed until Thursday,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/release-of-house-tax-bill-delayed-until-thursday-idUSKBN1D0008?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

“His experience, and the networks that come with it, will be a tremendous asset to our firm and our portfolio companies as they grow from solution innovators to market leaders,” Allegis founder Bob Ackerman said in a statement.

Allegis is looking to raise between $200 million and $400 million to invest in series C funding rounds, a source with knowledge of the plans said. Such rounds typically involve the last private cash injected into a company before it goes public.

San Francisco-based Allegis also said it would change its name to AllegisCyber and open an office in the Washington area to tap into the region’s high density of cyber engineers and robust investment opportunities.

Allegis said that DeWalt had previously consulted on several investments, including a stake they took in Callsign, where DeWalt sits on the board.

DeWalt has this year joined the boards of a string of cyber security companies including ForgeRock, Optiv, Phantom and Claroty. He has sat on the board of Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) since late 2011.

Allegis’ existing cyber security investments include Area 1, Bracket Computing, CyberGRX, E8 Security, Shape Security, Signifyd, Synack, tCell.io and vArmour.",Former FireEye CEO joins cyber venture fund Allegis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dewalt-allegis/former-fireeye-ceo-joins-cyber-venture-fund-allegis-idUSKBN1CV3OW

Il Consiglio Ue del 15 dicembre avvierà un periodo di sei mesi di deliberazioni in materia di maggiore integrazione con un ulteriore vertice nel giugno 2018 che deciderà come sarà in futuro la zona euro.

Non c‘è accordo su come dovrebbe essere finanziato, se con imposte speciali o contributi dei singoli paesi, se possa prestare denaro o fare trasferimenti. Alcuni paesi vogliono che il bilancio sia di supporto a riforme o investimenti, altri ritengono che dovrebbe essere destinato a pagare sussidi ai disoccupati o reagire a shock macroeconomici che colpiscono un numero ristretto di paesi della zona euro. Non c‘è neppure accordo su come completare l‘unione bancaria attraverso uno schema di garanzia dei depositi paneuropeo. Su quest‘ultimo punto è netta l‘opposizione della Germania che teme che le banche tedesche più sane finiscano per aiutare concorrenti più deboli in altre paesi Ue come l‘Italia.

Speaking at a news conference after his re-election as premier, Abe said he trusted Kuroda’s ability as central bank governor and leaves monetary policy to him.

“We have created a situation in a short period of time that Japan is no longer in deflation as a result of strengthening policy coordination between the government and the BOJ,” Abe said, referring to improved job creation and availability.

“The government and the BOJ have achieved a major result on employment, which is the most important responsibility of politics.”

Abe went on to urge the central bank to continue efforts to accelerate inflation towards its 2 percent target. He pledged to put a decisive end to deflation by encouraging companies to raise wages.

His Liberal Democratic Party-led coalition retained its two-thirds “super majority” in parliament’s lower house in the Oct. 22 election. His coalition’s victory raised expectations that Kuroda is likely to be reappointed.

That would mean Kuroda’s legacy stimulus program will stay for the time being even as U.S. and European central banks head towards normalizing crisis-mode monetary policy.

Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer -

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

Veselnitskaya represented Prevezon Holdings Ltd, a Russian-controlled company, which in May this year agreed to pay nearly $6 million to the U.S. government to settle a $230 million Russian tax fraud case related to Hermitage Capital, an American fund that invested in Russia.

In a court filing in federal court in Manhattan on Monday U.S. prosecutors said the settlement payment was due on Oct. 31, but in a letter on Tuesday filed in federal court in Manhattan lawyers for Prevezon disagreed.

About half of the settlement money was supposed to come from 3 million euros owed to Prevezon that the U.S. government had asked the Netherlands to freeze.

The Netherlands lifted the hold on the money on October 10, but the same day imposed a new freeze on the account based on a complaint by William Browder, chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management, the Prevezon letter said.

In Monday’s court filing, U.S. prosecutors said the $6 million payment was due regardless of the new freeze on the funds and they intended to file a motion to enforce the settlement.

In its letter, Prevezon asked the court to help obtain temporary U.S. immigration status for Veselnitskaya and its owner, Denis Katsyv, so she could attend upcoming hearings about the dispute.

Veselnitskaya met Donald Trump Jr in New York last year while she was in the United States to represent Prevezon in the money laundering case.

Trump Jr. said in a statement at the time that he and Veselnitskaya “primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children” after Russia in 2012 banned adoptions of Russian children by Americans in retaliation for sanctions imposed under the U.S. Magnitsky Act.

The Magnitsky Act was passed by Congress after Hermitage Capital’s Browder claimed that the tax fraud scheme involving Prevezon was uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky, an auditor for Hermitage Capital, who died in a Russian prison.

Trump Jr. has released emails related to the meeting during last year’s election that described Veselnitskaya as a Russian government attorney who could provide information that would “incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”",Russian lawyer who met Trump Jr. seeks return to U.S. to defend money laundering settlement,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-lawyer/russian-lawyer-who-met-trump-jr-seeks-return-to-u-s-to-defend-money-laundering-settlement-idUSKBN1D139W?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

General Motors Co (GM.N) reported an overall sales drop of 2.2 percent for the month, with consumer sales down 6.6 percent. High-margin pickup truck, SUV and crossover sales were all up at the largest U.S. automaker.

GM reduced its inventory of unsold vehicles in the month by 7,000 vehicles to 813,000. The automaker has been whittling away at its large volume of unsold vehicles, a source of concern for the market. GM had advised that its inventory would rise in October.

“We are heading into the fourth quarter with good momentum, thanks to a strong U.S. economy and very strong pickup and crossover sales,” GM’s vice president for U.S. sales operations, Kurt McNeil, said in a statement.

GM slightly reduced consumer discounts as a percentage of the average transaction price, to 13.5 percent from 13.7 percent in the third quarter.

Industry experts believe consumer discounts in excess of 10 percent of the average transaction price are unhealthy for the market as they erode resale values and are unsustainable in the long term.

Industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC said last week that based on preliminary sales numbers including October, discounts have exceeded 10 percent in 15 of the last 16 months.

The U.S. auto industry is coming off a strong run that culminated in record sales of 17.55 million units in 2016. New sales got a strong lift in September as consumers replaced vehicles damaged in southeast Texas by Hurricane Harvey the previous month.

Full-year 2017 sales are still expected to be down slightly versus 2016.

Ford Motor Co (F.N) posted a 6.2 percent gain in vehicle sales in October, driven largely by a 15.9 percent jump in sales of its popular, high-priced F-Series line of pickups. Strong demand pushed the average price tag for an F-Series truck up $4,000 from the previous October to $47,300.

High-margin pickup trucks were a dominant factor in the better-than-expected results Ford posted last week.

On a conference call, Ford’s U.S. sales chief, Mark LaNeve, said the upgraded F-Series line “really has been a spectacular success” and said the market would remain “competitive” through the end of 2017 and into 2018.

Ford’s low-margin fleet sales rose 14.6 percent in October.

Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) said its sales rose 5.2 percent in October, as strong pickup truck and SUV sales offset a 12.7 drop in Toyota sedans and a 27.9 percent decrease in luxury Lexus sedans.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (FCHA.MI)(FCAU.N) reported a 13 percent sales decline. The automaker’s sales to consumers were down 4 percent, while fleet sales slid 43 percent, in line with the company’s strategy to reduce low-margin sales to car rental agencies.

FCA has pushed to sell more profitable SUVs and pickup trucks, which helped lift its North American profit margin to 8.3 percent in the third quarter.

Nissan Motor Co Ltd’s (7201.T) sales increased 8.4 percent for the month, driven by a 12.9 percent jump in pickups, SUV and crossover sales. Sales of its popular Rogue crossover model soared 43 percent in October.

But sales at Nissan’s luxury Infiniti brand fell 8.1 percent, driven largely by a 16.2 percent drop in luxury sedan sales.

The challenge for Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is to persuade her to actually buy one.

“I‘m definitely interested, but don’t currently plan to get one,” said Gu, whose monthly salary of a little over 6,000 yuan ($905.36) is less than the anniversary model’s starting price in China of 8,388 yuan.

For Apple, which is looking to rev up sales in China after several quarters of declining revenue there, the test is that Gu is not alone. While interest in the phone is high, that won’t necessarily translate into sales.

“Price appears to be a major constraint on iPhone X demand, particularly in China,” Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a recent report that showed three-quarters of Chinese respondents were excited by the upcoming launch, but only a quarter said they planned to buy one.

Investors are keen to gauge Chinese demand for the iPhone X, as it is key to reviving Apple’s fortunes in the world’s biggest smartphone market where it has lost some of its sparkle - and market share - as local phone makers have advanced.

The cheaper iPhone 8, which hit the market in September, has faced sluggish sales, but Apple has said that pre-orders for the iPhone X have been “off the charts”.

Apple, due to announce quarterly earnings on Thursday, said it had no immediate comment.

Chatter online on popular Chinese social media platform Weibo (WB.O) also signaled high levels of interest in the new model, though still generally behind levels around the 2014 launch of the very successful iPhone 6.

APPLE “GEEKS”

Xiao Ming, 32, who works for a blockchain start-up in Beijing, stayed up half the night when pre-sales of the iPhone X opened last week. He has also bought the iPhone 8.

“I always try to be one of the first to buy any new iPhone,” he said, adding he likes the new phone’s augmented reality and facial recognition features. “I’ll be very disappointed if I don’t get one on the first day.”

While he plans to buy the new phone, he noted many of his friends were less fussed. “Before, I think a lot of people would try to get it somehow, now it’s mostly the geeks,” he said.

“My friends don’t mind so much if they have an iPhone 8 or a 6, for example, because it looks similar and the price (of the iPhone X) makes you feel nervous.”

Re-sellers and iPhone accessory makers generally agreed there was a buzz about the iPhone X, Apple’s first phone to have a full-screen display and functions such as facial recognition security.

“People are really anticipating this phone because it’s the 10th anniversary version and it has more changes and modifications,” said Gary Yiu, manager of the iGeneration smartphone shop at one Hong Kong mall.

Yiu and three other phone re-sellers there said they had seen strong demand for the phone from mainland clients.

A merchant at the Huaqiangbei electronics hub in Shenzhen, who was offering an iPhone look-a-like called the “E-Feng X” from 1,599 yuan, said sales volumes were “very good”.

Some Chinese re-sellers, however, said they already canceled pre-orders for the iPhone X, concerned there wouldn’t be enough of a supply bottleneck to allow them to charge a steep premium - despite some worries about long waits.

“I saw many friends were posting pictures of themselves successfully ordering the iPhone X, so I canceled mine,” said Tony Tong, 29, a product manager at a tech firm in Beijing, who said he had ordered four phones in the hope of re-selling them for a profit. “The environment is bad for scalpers.”

Apple will hope payment plans and easy access to online credit in China will convince people to buy.

Wang Hao, a 24-year-old engineer in the northeastern port city of Dalian, said he ordered the new phone despite the high price tag. His last phone was an iPhone 6S.

“The cost is about a month’s salary for me,” he told Reuters. “But I‘m just used to it now, and there wasn’t really anything to make me choose another brand.”

It is unlikely to happen at next year’s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang but Hunt does not have much time for the naysayers who laugh off the prospects of a nation without any Alpine DNA.

For good reason too.

Hunt, who became performance director of British Ski and Snowboard (BSS) a year ago, has previous when it comes to mocking conventional wisdom.

When he joined British Cycling in 2005, then performance director Dave Brailsford put him in charge of a women’s endurance squad used to making up the numbers.

Hunt, who had no expertise in cycling, applied his background in exercise science and physiology to such great effect that Rebecca Romero and Wendy Houvenaghel won gold and silver in the individual pursuit in Beijing in 2008.

Now he believes Britain’s skiers and snowboarders can make a similar jump from also-rans to medal winners.

“We’ve set out to become a top-five nation,” Hunt said in an interview at a media day for Britain’s Pyeongchang hopefuls at Hemel Hempstead’s Snow Centre.

”As soon as you say something like that, and I’ve done that a couple of times so I know what’s going to happen, you get 33 percent of the team saying ‘yeah that’s what we want, want to start winning, we want ambition’.

”Then you have the “that will never happen brigade”. They think just because it hasn’t been done means it can’t be done.

”When we said at British Cycling that we wanted to have a Tour de France champion by 2013 the room burst into laughter.

“Then you have the middle group who will take a step to the left or right depending on how it’s going to pan out. That’s why you have to deliver what you said you were going to deliver.”

Hunt’s second Olympics as a cycling coach was London 2012 where the hosts won 12 medals, after which he joined Team Sky as Sporting Director, before being poached by the Premier League to run its Elite Player Performance Plan.

“It’s been an interesting journey for me,” Hunt, now responsible for all the snow disciplines -- including Alpine, cross-country, freestyle, snowboard and ski jumping, said.

“There are some fundamental aspects of performance that are very similar across all sports. You take good leadership, good coaching and strap that around a very defensible performance plan. You need a clear vision and strategy.”

Britain won it’s first ever Olympic medal on snow when Jenny Jones came third in the snowboard slopestyle in Sochi 2014.

Last year, the team earned 15 World Cup podiums across the various disciplines and heading into Pyeonchang there are realistic medal hopes for the likes of slalom skier Dave Ryding, snowboarders Katie Ormerod and Billy Morgan and freestyle skiers James Woods and Katie Summerhayes.

Hunt said his first year in charge has been about “plugging gaps” and while he does not expect a medal rush in South Korea, he is confident the team can better Sochi.

”I‘m not Harry Potter with a magic wand saying we are suddenly going to be a competitive nation. But we have a process in place. Pyeongchang is 100 days and I‘m hoping it will be our most successful Games.

SLC is expected to name a new head coach by the end of the year.

“We are discussing with about three or four coaches, including Nic Pothas. We hope to finalise the decision by the end of the year,” De Silva said.

Other data on Wednesday showed a surge in private sector hiring, indicating that job growth rebounded last month after being depressed in September as hurricanes Harvey and Irma left some workers temporarily unemployed.

Manufacturing and labor strength likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to increase interest rates in December. The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise rates when policymakers conclude a two-day meeting later on Wednesday.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity slipped to a reading of 58.7 last month from 60.8 in September, which was the highest since May 2004. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.

September’s jump in the index was driven by supply chain disruptions, especially in the chemical products sector. The supply bottlenecks, which also pushed up prices of raw materials, resulted in a longer delivery times.

Longer suppliers’ delivery times are normally associated with increased activity, which is a positive contribution to the ISM index. The ISM’s supplier deliveries sub-index fell to 61.4 last month after soaring to 64.4 in September.

The survey’s prices paid sub-index dropped to 68.5 after racing to 71.5 in September, which was the highest reading since May 2011. The production sub-index slipped 1.2 points to a reading of 61.0 in October and a gauge of new orders fell to 63.4. A measure of factory employment dipped to 59.8 from 60.3 in September, which was the highest level since 2011.

Manufacturing is being supported by a strengthening global economy and weakening U.S. dollar.

PRIVATE PAYROLLS SURGE

Separately, the ADP National Employment Report showed private employers hired 235,000 workers last month, the most in seven months, after increasing payrolls by 110,000 jobs in September.

The ADP report, which is jointly produced with Moody’s Analytics, is not a good predictor of the private payrolls component of the employment report. It, however, supported expectations of a sharp rebound in employment last month after nonfarm payrolls declined by 33,000 jobs in September.

Prices for U.S. government bonds were trading higher and the dollar rose against a basket of currencies.

A third report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending increased 0.3 percent to $1.22 trillion as a surge in public construction outlays offset the third straight monthly decline in investment in private projects.

But August’s construction outlays were revised down to show a 0.1 percent gain instead of the previously reported 0.5 percent rise. Construction spending increased 2.0 percent on a year-on-year basis.

In September, investment on private construction projects fell 0.4 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in August. It was the third straight monthly drop in private construction outlays and reflected a 0.8 percent decline in spending on private nonresidential projects. Spending on nonresidential projects in September was the lowest since April 2016.

Spending on nonresidential structures has now declined for four consecutive months. Spending on oil drilling has been slowing in recent months amid moderate gains in oil prices and ample crude supplies. Spending on residential structures was unchanged in September.

The data could impact the government’s gross domestic product estimate for the third quarter published last week. The government’s advance estimate put economic growth at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the July-September quarter, with both residential and nonresidential structures subtracting from output.

In September, outlays on public construction projects jumped 2.6 percent after rising 0.7 percent in August. Spending on state and local government construction projects climbed 2.5 percent.

Speaking at a news conference after his re-election as premier, Abe said he trusted Kuroda’s ability as central bank governor and leaves monetary policy to him.

“We have created a situation in a short period of time that Japan is no longer in deflation as a result of strengthening policy coordination between the government and the BOJ,” Abe said, referring to improved job creation and availability.

“The government and the BOJ have achieved a major result on employment, which is the most important responsibility of politics.”

Abe went on to urge the central bank to continue efforts to accelerate inflation towards its 2 percent target. He pledged to put a decisive end to deflation by encouraging companies to raise wages.

His Liberal Democratic Party-led coalition retained its two-thirds “super majority” in parliament’s lower house in the Oct. 22 election. His coalition’s victory raised expectations that Kuroda is likely to be reappointed.

That would mean Kuroda’s legacy stimulus program will stay for the time being even as U.S. and European central banks head towards normalizing crisis-mode monetary policy.

Abe took office in December 2012, promising to pull Japan out of nearly two decades of economic stagnation and deflation. He hand-picked Kuroda as BOJ governor a few months later.

The world’s third largest economy is gradually recovering but prices are lagging behind, hovering far below the 2 percent inflation goal.

The report said current plans for the modernization of the aging planes, ships and missile silos that make up the U.S. nuclear arsenal would cost 50 percent more than if the U.S. only operated and maintained its current equipment in the field.

The CBO study reviewed the Obama’s Administration’s plans for modernization of the nuclear arsenal. President Donald Trump in January directed Secretary of Defense James Mattis to conduct his own review the U.S. nuclear forces. The results could be published in the coming months.

U.S. House Armed Services Committee member Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington, said of the Obama-era plan: “Congress still doesn’t seem to have any answers as to how we will pay for this effort, or what the trade-offs with other national security efforts will be.”

The report said costs would rise from $29 billion in 2017 to $47 billion in 2027, before peaking at around $50 billion a year through the early 2030s.

Trump has said he wants to ensure the U.S. nuclear arsenal is at the “top of the pack,” saying the United States has fallen behind in its weapons capacity.

U.S. officials have noted that America’s nuclear modernization is lagging behind Russia’s upgrade of its own nuclear triad.

General Paul Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress in August he believed Moscow was already two-thirds of the way through its nuclear modernization process.

In August, the U.S. Air Force awarded Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp separate contracts to continue development work on the replacement of the aging Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system one leg of the nuclear triad.

Days later the Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co separate $900 million contracts to continue work on a replacement for the AGM-86B air-launched nuclear cruise missile.

McGowan is one of more than a dozen women who have accused movie producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault or sexual harassment.

The felony drug charge stems from an investigation of personal belongings that tested positive for narcotics after being left behind on a United flight arriving at Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia on Jan. 20, according to police.

“Are they trying to silence me?” McGowan said on Twitter on Monday. “There is a warrant out for my arrest in Virginia. What a load of horseshit.”

The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Police Department said in a statement on Monday that on Feb. 1 it had issued the warrant for possession of a controlled substance.

“The Airports Authority police have attempted to contact Ms. McGowan so she can appear in a Loudon County, Virginia, court to respond to the charge,” the statement said.

McGowan, who on Twitter has accused Weinstein of sex assault, was linked publicly to him following reports by the New York Times and the New Yorker.

She was the keynote speaker Friday at a women’s conference in Detroit, where she urged attendees to speak out on sex assault. McGowan, whose acting career included a featured role in the 1996 horror film “Scream,” also has tweeted regularly about the subject on Twitter with the hashtag #ROSEARMY.

The Times reported that Weinstein, 65, had reached eight previously undisclosed settlements with women who accused him of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact.

The New Yorker reported that 13 women had claimed that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them.

Fresh from deflecting a takeover from one U.S. rival, the Dutch group confirmed on Monday that it is considering merging its paint unit with another, former DuPont subsidiary Axalta. A combination makes sense. But new Chief Executive Thierry Vanlancker is busy grappling with weak results and a chemicals spinoff.

The 20 billion euro Dulux owner has already resisted a 25 billion euro bid from paintmaker PPG and grappled with activist investor Elliott Advisors this year. As part of its defence, it pledged to spin off or sell its specialty chemicals division and boost margins at its coatings businesses. Its CEO and finance chief stepped down. Since taking charge in July, Vanlancker has twice lowered the company’s guidance for 2017 earnings. This is hardly an encouraging backdrop.

There is some logic to combining the world’s third- and fourth-largest paintmakers. Bernstein analysts reckon Akzo and Axalta could cut costs by 250 million euros, equivalent to 2 percent of their combined paint revenue, though competition regulators may demand disposals. Taxed at Akzo’s 26 percent rate and capitalised, the synergies would be worth 1.9 billion euros ($2.2 billion). That helps explain the $1.2 billion jump in Axalta’s market value after Reuters reported the talks on Friday.

Even so, it’s hard to see how the deal can be a true “merger of equals”, as Akzo suggested in its statement. The Dutch group’s chemicals arm could fetch anywhere between 8 billion euros and 12 billion euros. Take the mid-point of this range, deduct it from Akzo’s enterprise value of 21.1 billion euros, and assume the group’s 1.7 billion euros of debt stays with the paint business. In that scenario, Akzo’s equity would still be worth some 35 percent more than Axalta’s inflated market value.

The worry for Akzo shareholders is that the Dutch company could be willing to hand most of the benefits of a deal to Axalta in an attempt to escape another bid from PPG, which will be free to renew its pursuit in December. Negotiating a big deal with a supposedly equal partner would also suck in resources. Even if the numbers stack up, the risk of Akzo dropping one or more balls is high.",Breakingviews - Axalta deal complicates Akzo's juggling act,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-axalta-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-axalta-deal-complicates-akzos-juggling-act-idUSKBN1CZ2B5

With only 17 months remaining until Britain’s expected departure, the slow pace of talks has increased the possibility of it leaving without a deal, alarming business leaders who say time is running out for them to make investment decisions.

British and EU negotiators met in Brussels on Tuesday and agreed to hold further divorce talks on Nov.9-10.

The pressure has spurred the British government to step up its Brexit plans, employing thousands more workers and spending millions to make sure customs posts, laws and systems work on day one of Brexit, even without a deal on a future relationship.

At a meeting with her ministers on Tuesday, Prime Minister Theresa May was updated on plans for the tax and customs authority to add a further 3,000-5,000 workers next year and for spending of 500 million pounds ($660.45 million) for Brexit.

“Alongside the negotiations in Brussels, it is crucial that we are putting our own domestic preparations in place so that we are ready at the point that we leave the EU,” May’s spokesman told reporters.

“The preparatory work has seen a significant acceleration in recent months. Departments are preparing detailed delivery plans for each of the around 300 programs underway across government.”

May wants to silence critics in her ruling Conservative Party who are pressing her to walk away from talks, which have faltered over how much Britain should pay to leave the bloc, and also to step up the negotiations.

SPEED UP TALKS

EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier reaffirmed his message in the Slovak capital Bratislava that he was ready to “speed up negotiations”.

“We have clearly proposed three (different dates) for new rounds. In the next few hours or days we’ll be working with British delegations to find the right dates because we need to work in a very intense way to find this agreement before December,” Barnier told reporters, in comments that supported sterling.

“The agenda for the new round of negotiations will be fixed within hours or days.”

May’s government has also long said it would welcome an acceleration in the talks.

After a top-level meeting in Brussels on Oct.19-20, Barnier has proposed three more negotiating rounds before the end of the year. London prefers “continued negotiations”.

“What does ‘continuous negotiations’ mean, we don’t know exactly. We are ready to accelerate but we must have something to talk about. We are very happy to increase the number of times we meet,” said an EU official.

Before leaving the EU, May faces a struggle to get parliamentary support for a law to sever political, financial and legal ties with the bloc - the EU Withdrawal Bill, for which lawmakers have proposed hundreds of amendments.

Asked whether May was preparing to offer a concession over a final vote on any deal struck with the EU, her spokesman said there was “lots of speculation in relation to Brexit”.

“We’ve always said that we’ll do whatever is necessary,” he said.","Britain accelerates Brexit plans, divorce talks also to speed up",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-cabinet/britain-accelerates-brexit-plans-divorce-talks-also-to-speed-up-idUKKBN1D01PM

The announcement comes a day after Sony confirmed its renaissance by forecasting its highest-ever profit this financial year, sending its shares surging to a nine-year high.

AIBO is billed as a pet that behaves like a real dog using artificial intelligence (AI) to learn and interact with its owner and surroundings. The upgrade sees AIBO equipped with new sensing and movement technologies as well as far more advanced AI backed by cloud computing to develop the dog’s personality.

Sales begin in Japan in January for 198,000 yen ($1,739).

Sony pioneered entertainment robots with AIBO in 1999. It sold about 150,000 dogs in Japan before ceasing production seven years later when its core consumer electronics business struggled in price wars with emerging Asian rivals.

“It was a difficult decision to stop the project in 2006, but we continued development in AI and robotics,” Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai said at a news briefing.

“I asked our engineers a year and a half ago to develop (new) AIBO because I strongly believe robots capable of building loving relationships with people help realize Sony’s mission (to inspire).”

The reborn AIBO features new actuator technology allowing it move more smoothly and naturally like a real dog. With sensing and AI technologies, AIBO can run toward its owner and detect smiles and words of praise, and can remember what actions please the owner. Its eyes are made of organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays making it capable of diverse expressions.

Sony said it aims to sell at least as many new AIBO as the original, without giving a time frame. It also said it is considering overseas sales.

The firm sees AI as a future pillar of growth, hoping to catch up with major technology companies such as Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google.

It invested an undisclosed sum last year in Cogitai, a U.S. AI start-up focusing on technology that allows machines to learn continually and autonomously from interaction in the real world. It also established a venture capital fund to build partnerships with researchers and start-up companies in AI and robotics.

The FSB, which coordinates financial regulation across the Group of 20 Economies (G20), said in its first report on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning that the risks they pose need monitoring.

AI and machine learning refer to technology that is replacing traditional methods to assess the creditworthiness of customers, to crunch data, price insurance contracts and spot profitable trades across markets.

There are no international regulatory standards for AI and machine learning, but the FSB left open whether new rules are needed.

Data on rapidly growing usage of AI is largely unavailable, leaving regulators unsure about the impact of potentially new and unexpected links between markets and banks, the report said.

AI could, for example, lead to “non-sustainable” increases in credit by automating credit scoring.

While AI shows substantial promise if risks are properly managed, it could create too much dependency among banks and insurers on the few specialist businesses that provide AI technology.

Expected rapid growth in AI also raises the prospect of outside technology players expanding their influence over the finance sector.

“This could in turn lead to the emergence of new systemically important players that could fall outside the regulatory perimeter,” the FSB said.

If a major AI provider went bust, it could lead to operational disruptions at a large number of financial firms at the same time, especially if used in “mission critical” applications, the report said.

Regulators could also find it difficult to identify who has made key financial decisions that go wrong.

“If AI and machine learning-based decisions cause losses to financial intermediaries across the financial system, there may be a lack of clarity around responsibility,” the report said.

REVOLUTION

The pace of technological advance will also make it harder to fashion durable rules for AI activity that some academics expect to revolutionize the financial sector.

The report said that RegTech investment, or use of machines to comply with a welter of new regulations introduced to tackle money laundering and make banks safer, could reach $6.45 billion by 2020.

Consultancy Accenture said in May that three quarters of bankers surveyed believed that AI will become the primary way banks interact with customers within the next three years.

European insurers invested $400 million in “InsurTech” or real-time technology to help to reduce payouts.

Nordea (NDA.ST), the Nordic region’s biggest bank, said last month that automation would help it to shed at least 4,000 staff. It has already introduced an AI chatbox to answer common customer questions.

Dutch bank ING (INGA.AS) wants to increase the number of traders using AI.

Fund managers are also using outside specialists to obtain machine-learning tools that sift through news and research for insight into market trends.

So-called “quant” funds use AI to manage $1 trillion in assets. Though that is only a fraction of the $40 trillion in mutual funds globally, the FSB said industry estimates suggest that could grow rapidly.

The regulators themselves are also using AI to make it easier to detect fraud and money laundering, while central banks expect to use AI for real-time predictions using big data to help to determine monetary policy, the report said.

The FSB acknowledged that AI is helping the financial sector to cut costs, improve profitability and widen choice for customers, but added that it also raises concerns over privacy of data used in AI applications.","Rise of the machines must be monitored, say global finance regulators",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1D1534-OCATC

The Appalachian region has lost about 33,500 mining jobs since 2011, according to the Appalachian Regional Commission.
A White House official did not respond to requests for comment on coal policy and retraining for coal workers.
Coal jobs are preferable to those in natural gas, they said, because the mines are close to home, while pipeline work requires travel.
“That’s a major part of the reason that coal mines have been able to survive,” he said.","WAYNESBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - When Mike Sylvester entered a career training center earlier this year in southwestern Pennsylvania, he found more than one hundred federally funded courses covering everything from computer programming to nursing.

He settled instead on something familiar: a coal mining course.

”I think there is a coal comeback,” said the 33-year-old son of a miner.

Despite broad consensus about coal’s bleak future, a years-long effort to diversify the economy of this hard-hit region away from mining is stumbling, with Obama-era jobs retraining classes undersubscribed and future programs at risk under President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget.

Trump has promised to revive coal by rolling back environmental regulations and moved to repeal Obama-era curbs on carbon emissions from power plants.

“I have a lot of faith in President Trump,” Sylvester said.

But hundreds of coal-fired plants have closed in recent years, and cheap natural gas continues to erode domestic demand. The Appalachian region has lost about 33,500 mining jobs since 2011, according to the Appalachian Regional Commission.

Although there have been small gains in coal output and hiring this year, driven by foreign demand, production levels remain near lows hit in 1978.

A White House official did not respond to requests for comment on coal policy and retraining for coal workers.

What many experts call false hopes for a coal resurgence have mired economic development efforts here in a catch-22: Coal miners are resisting retraining without ready jobs from new industries, but new companies are unlikely to move here without a trained workforce. The stalled diversification push leaves some of the nation’s poorest areas with no clear path to prosperity.

Federal retraining programs have fared better, with some approaching full participation, in the parts of Appalachia where mining has been crushed in a way that leaves little hope for a comeback, according to county officials and recruiters. They include West Virginia and Kentucky, where coal resources have been depleted.

But in southern Pennsylvania, where the industry still has ample reserves and is showing flickers of life, federal jobs retraining programs see sign-up rates below 20 percent, the officials and recruiters said. In southern Virginia’s coal country, participation rates run about 50 percent, they said.

“Part of our problem is we still have coal,” said Robbie Matesic, executive director of Greene County’s economic development department.

Out-of-work miners cite many reasons beyond faith in Trump policy for their reluctance to train for new industries, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen former and prospective coal workers, career counselors and local economic development officials. They say mining pays well; other industries are unfamiliar; and there’s no income during training and no guarantee of a job afterward.

In Pennsylvania, Corsa Coal opened a mine in Somerset in June which will create about 70 jobs – one of the first mines to open here in years. And Consol Energy recently expanded its Bailey mine complex in Greene County.

But Consol also announced in January that it plans to sell its coal holdings to focus on natural gas. And it has commissioned a recruitment agency, GMS Mines and Repair, to find contract laborers for its coal expansion who will be paid about $13 an hour - half the hourly wage of a starting unionized coal worker. The program Sylvester signed up for was set up by GMS.

The new hiring in Pennsylvania is related mainly to an uptick in foreign demand for metallurgical coal, used in producing steel, rather than domestic demand for thermal coal from power plants, the industry’s main business. Some market analysts describe the foreign demand as a temporary blip driven by production problems in the coal hub of Australia.

“The coal industry has stabilized, but it’s not going to come back,” said Blair Zimmerman, a 40-year veteran of the mines who is now the commissioner for Greene County, one of Pennsylvania’s oldest coal regions. “We need to look at the future.”

EMPTY SEATS

The Pennsylvania Department of Labor has received about $2 million since 2015 from the federal POWER program, an initiative of former President Barack Obama to help retrain workers in coal-dependent areas. But the state is having trouble putting even that modest amount of money to good use.

In Greene and Washington counties, 120 people have signed up for jobs retraining outside the mines, far short of the target of 700, said Ami Gatts, director of the Washington-Greene County Job Training Agency. In Westmoreland and Fayette counties, participation in federal job retraining programs has been about 15 percent of capacity, officials said.

“I can’t even get them to show up for free food I set up in the office,” said Dave Serock, an ex-miner who recruits in Fayette County for Southwest Training Services.

Programs administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission, a federal and state partnership to strengthen the region’s economy, have had similar struggles. One $1.4 million ARC project to teach laid-off miners in Greene County and in West Virginia computer coding has signed up only 20 people for 95 slots. Not a single worker has enrolled in another program launched this summer to prepare ex-miners to work in the natural gas sector, officials said.

Greene County Commissioner Zimmerman said he’d like to see a big company like Amazon or Toyota come to southwestern Pennsylvania to build a distribution or manufacturing plant that could employ thousands.

But he knows first the region needs a ready workforce.

Amazon spokeswoman Ashley Robinson said the company the company typically works with local organizations to evaluate whether locations have an appropriate workforce and has no current plans for distribution operations in Western Pennsylvania. Toyota spokesman Edward Lewis said the company considers local workforce training an “important consideration” when deciding where to locate facilities.

SIGNS OF LIFE

For Sean Moodie and his brother Steve spent the last two years working in the natural gas industry, but see coal as a good bet in the current political climate.

“I am optimistic that you can make a good career out of coal for the next 50 years,” said Sean Moodie.

Coal jobs are preferable to those in natural gas, they said, because the mines are close to home, while pipeline work requires travel. Like Sylvester, the Moodie brothers are taking mining courses offered by Consol’s recruiter, GMS.

Bob Levo, who runs a GMS training program, offered a measure of realism: The point of the training is to provide low-cost and potentially short-term labor to a struggling industry, he said.

“That’s a major part of the reason that coal mines have been able to survive,” he said. “They rely on us to provide labor at lower cost.”

Clemmy Allen, 63, a veteran miner and head of the United Mineworkers of America’s Career Centers, said miners are taking a big risk in holding out for a coal recovery.

He’s placing his hopes for the region’s future on retraining. UMWA’s 64-acre campus in Prosperity, Pennsylvania - which once trained coal miners - will use nearly $3 million in federal and state grants to retrofit classrooms to teach cybersecurity, truck driving and mechanical engineering.

“Unlike when I worked in the mines,” he said, “if you get laid off now, you are pretty much laid off.”

Até então, a moeda norte-americana subia ante o real também com os investidores à espera de sinais de como o Federal Reserve, banco central norte-americano, vai gerenciar sua política monetária.

Às 12:54, o dólar recuava 0,18 por cento, a 3,2670 reais na venda, depois de atingir 3,2933 reais na máxima da sessão. O dólar futuro cedisa 0,26 por cento.

Em outubro, a moeda norte-americana saltou 3,32 por cento e se aproximou de 3,30 reais, maior avanço mensal desde novembro de 2016 (+6,18 por cento), quando Donald Trump foi eleito presidente dos Estados Unidos.

“A moeda a 3,30 reais está um pouco esticada, então muitos acabam aproveitando para realizar um pouco dos lucros”, comentou um profissional da mesa de câmbio de uma corretora nacional.

O foco dos investidores, no entanto, continuava sendo o Fed, que deve deixar inalterada a taxa de juros em reunião nesta sessão e com anúncio às 16:00 (horário de Brasília), em meio às especulações sobre quem será seu próximo comandante, mas deverá destacar uma economia firme conforme caminha para possível aumento dos juros no próximo mês.

O Fed elevou os juros duas vezes desde janeiro e prevê atualmente mais um aumento até o fim do ano como parte do ciclo de aperto monetário que começou no final de 2015.

U.S. police declined to publicly identify the suspect, but a source familiar with the investigation said his name was Sayfullo Saipov, 29.

He had emigrated to the United States in 2010, U.S. media reported. CNN said he had left a note saying he carried out the attack in the name of Islamic State and had shouted “Allahu Akbar” - Arabic for “God is greatest” - after the violence.

“He became religious on the spur of the moment,” Mirrakhmat Muminov, a truck driver and Uzbek community activist who lives in Stow, Ohio, told Reuters by phone.

He said Saipov had previously lived in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan.

“He started studying religion in the United States,” said Muminov, adding that Saipov “couldn’t get enough” of the religious freedoms enjoyed in the United States after living in the strict confines of Uzbekistan.

In Uzbekistan, an authoritarian, predominantly Muslim country in Central Asia ruled by Moscow until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the practice of Islam is tightly controlled by a government wary of radicalism.

Tuesday’s attack shines an uncomfortable light on Islamist militancy in Central Asia which has supplied Islamic State in Syria and Iraq with thousands of fighters. If the attacker’s identity is confirmed, it would be at least the fourth deadly attack by an Uzbek national or ethnic Uzbek this year.

Muminov said Saipov had lived in Stow two or three years ago, that they had met through the local Uzbek community, and that Saipov had also worked there as a truck driver.

‘AGGRESSIVE LONER’

Slideshow (2 Images)

Muminov said he had heard about the attack from members of the local Uzbek community, some of whom he said were getting ready to be questioned by the authorities.

He said he had no first-hand information about whether Saipov had carried out the attack and painted a picture of a man who was struggling to make it in the United States, had few friends, and poor communication and English language skills.

”He was withdrawn, nervous, sometimes aggressive. Because of that he was lonely, he lived in his own world. He was not very popular,” said Muminov. He said Saipov’s English was poor and he did not speak Russian very well. Muminov said he had last spoken to Saipov about two months ago.

In a letter of condolence to President Donald Trump on Wednesday, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said Uzbekistan was ready to use “all its resources” to help investigate the New York attack.

It was the bloodiest single attack on New Yorkers since the Sept. 11, 2001, suicide hijackings of jetliners steered into the World Trade Center. It poses a challenge for Mirziyoyev, who assumed office at the end of 2016 and is trying to slowly open up his country after decades of authoritarian rule.

On New Year’s day, an Uzbek gunman burst into a nightclub in the Turkish city of Istanbul and killed 39 people. In April, an ethnic Uzbek man born in Kyrgyzstan blew up a metro train in the Russian city of St Petersburg, killing at least 14 people, and that same month an Uzbek man rammed a truck into a crowd in Stockholm, killing four people.","New York attack suspect, an Uzbek immigrant, turned to religion in U.S.: associate",https://www.reuters.com/article/new-york-attack-uzbekistan/new-york-attack-suspect-an-uzbek-immigrant-turned-to-religion-in-u-s-associate-idINKBN1D152P?il=0

The ADP National Employment survey showed private U.S. employers added 235,000 jobs in October, surpassing estimates for 200,000 and setting up expectations for a strong U.S. nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.

The ADP number was the latest in a string of strong data releases on the U.S. economy that have backed the Federal Reserve’s stance that weakness in reports earlier this year was transitory.

“There’s a lot of positivity in the air,” said Juan Perez, a currency strategist at foreign exchange company Tempus Inc in Washington.

Perez pointed to recent positive readings on U.S. gross domestic product, consumer confidence, housing prices and inflation data, which have recently exceeded expectations. Additionally, no other central bank is seen as likely to raise rates in the near term, except for the Bank of England, an expectation which has already been priced into the market.

“Right now, there’s not a lot of threats to the dollar out there, and, if anything, there’s just potential for the currency to be propelled further,” Perez said.

The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at the end of its meeting later in the day.

The market also is focused on President Donald Trump’s tax reform plans, which could also be revealed later in the day.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

Zuma, 75, who previously described the “State of Capture” report as “unfair” in parliament, said setting up such an inquiry was his prerogative.

The report published a year ago recommended a judicial investigation into allegations of systemic corruption by Zuma, some of his ministers and heads of state-owned companies.

The report focused on allegations that Zuma’s friends, the businessmen and brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, had influenced the appointment of ministers. Zuma and the Guptas have denied the accusations.

FILE PHOTO - A pump jack used to help lift crude oil from a well in South Texas’ Eagle Ford Shale formation stands idle in Dewitt County, Texas, U.S. on January 13, 2016. REUTERS/Anna Driver/File Photo

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon.

Revenue at the $56 billion health-coverage firm fell 5 percent in the three months to the end of September, partly from dumping some Obamacare policies. But profit jumped 48 percent as the company kept costs under control. That offers alluring protection for CVS, whose pharmacy and drug-benefit business is threatened by rising competition and transparency.

A trader points up at a display on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange August 20, 2012. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

Amazon is at the forefront of this challenge. The internet company is ramping up an effort to sell pills and other goods to patients - and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos regards short-term profit as an afterthought.

CVS’s other business is to act as the middleman negotiating cheaper drug prices and keeping a slug of the savings. Decent returns here depend on keeping the market opaque. Clients, however, are wondering if the system benefits them; reducing the murkiness of price setting, whether by political process or Amazon-inspired competition, could leave less for CVS.

Now consider Aetna. The firm’s management wouldn’t talk about CVS’s bid on the earnings call with investors. But it has over 22 million people covered by its medical plans and is becoming better at figuring out how to squeeze more profit out of them by reducing spending.

In its big healthcare segment, its medical benefits ratio – a key measure of costs relative to premiums – decreased to 81.5 percent in the first nine months of 2017, an improvement of a fifth of a percentage point from the same period last year. That helped it to easily beat analysts’ profit estimate. Aetna also raised earnings guidance for the full year.

Finding growth will be more difficult for Aetna. Extracting itself from the individual policy market for Obamacare probably means a stagnant top line in 2018. Merging with big direct rivals is also out of the question after regulators shot down its proposed deal for Humana. That makes a CVS bid and its 25 percent premium to Aetna’s undisturbed share price more tempting.

The real attraction of Aetna, however, is the insurer sending all these clients its way. CVS has made a big push into offering medical services such as vaccinations, routine medical care for earaches and even performing home infusions. It’s more convenient for patients and cheaper than an emergency room.

At least Thomas Morel is hoping they will. He’s a 30-year-old former financier who saw how much Canadians liked the sport, or game, or pastime, or whatever axe-throwing might be.

“And I told myself, this is bound to work in Paris,” Morel said.

So he opened Les Cognees - French for “axes” or “hatchets” - where people can gather after work and pay to hurl heavy edged weapons around. What could go wrong?

Quite a lot, obviously, but safeguards are in place: no alcohol is served, the blades of the axes are blunted and security measures are read out to participants when they arrive.

And they are arriving. Morel’s venue is in the city’s north-east 18th district, a traditionally working-class neighborhood showing tentative signs of gentrification. On a typical day this week, it had attracted about 30 men and women in their mid-20s to mid-30s.

Some had come with friends and some, improbably, were there on corporate outings. For example, 29-year-old Antoine Verdier, a legal manager, and his boss, Camille Cocaud, had come on a team-building exercise.

“It’s a great way to unwind after work,” Cocaud said.

“It’s a real melting pot,” Morel said. “You get the young hipsters, you get companies on team-building, but you also get punks, you get mothers with children, you get families.”

Morel’s timing is good. France is trying to get more people to take part in sports, partly to promote the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.

In fact, Morel can see a great marketing opportunity approaching, although some might say it’s a tad over-ambitious:

Seager’s deep fly ball to right field allowed Chase Utley to scamper home for the go-ahead run, igniting the sold-out crowd of 54,128 as the Dodgers tied the series up at 3-3 to set up Wednesday’s winner-take-all showdown.

Dodgers center fielder Chris Taylor continued his clutch hitting in the post-season, tying the game 1-1 earlier in the inning with a double down the right field line off of losing pitcher Justin Verlander.

“I was just trying to put a ball in play,” Taylor said.

“He’s really tough with that fastball up in the zone and a good slider. I was just trying to get the barrel on the ball and hope for something good and it worked out for me,” he said.

Taylor has reached base safely 26 times this post-season, a Dodgers franchise record.

Dodgers slugger Joc Pederson hit a solo 373-foot blast in the bottom of the seventh to provide the National League champions with an insurance run, and reliever Kenley Jansen came in during the eighth inning for a drama-free six-out save.

The loss was the first of the post-season for the hard-throwing Verlander, who had a no decision in Game Two.

Dodgers starter Rich Hill was sharp but gave up a solo home run to center fielder George Springer in the third inning for a 1-0 Astros lead on a cloudy and cool evening in Los Angeles.

Dodgers reliever Tony Watson, who came into the game in the top of the sixth inning and escaped a two on-two out jam, was the winning pitcher.

The defensive play of the game came in the top of the seventh when the Astros had runners on first and third with two outs, and second baseman Jose Altuve hit a soft ground ball to Justin Turner.

The third baseman charged to pick up the ball and make a quick throw to first baseman Cody Bellinger, who took it on the hop to get the speedy Altuve and keep the Dodgers 2-1 in front.

Darvish had a nightmare Game Three in Houston, where he could not get out of the second inning in the shortest start in his major league career.

The 20 billion euro no-frills airline will meet its full-year profit goal, despite a rostering mess that led to the cancellation of thousands of flights. Passenger numbers were up 11 percent to 72.1 million in the six months to Sept. 30, according to Tuesday’s half-year report from the company. Ryanair’s fare cuts helped, but it also got lucky with rivals’ bankruptcies.

Despite cancelled flights that will affect more than 700,000 passengers, Ryanair looks on track for record profit in the financial year to March. A bet that fare cuts of 5 percent in the first half would drive bookings and offset some of the negative public relations looks to have paid off. Ryanair’s lean business model gives it that kind of leverage. Where its staff costs are equivalent to 5 euros per passenger excluding fuel, low-cost rival Norwegian Air Shuttle’s are three times higher. A one-off hit of 25 million euros to compensate passengers is manageable at under 2 percent of half-year profit, which rose 11 percent year-on-year to 1.3 billion euros.

Pugnacious Chief Executive Michael O’Leary did get a helping hand from competitors, however. Ryanair is adding more aircraft to bases in the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy to pick up extra business from the bankruptcies of Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia, which together carried close to 60 million passengers per year. Their exit from the market is a gift to Ryanair’s ambitions to fly 200 million customers annually by 2024.

The bankruptcies also ease Ryanair’s labour issues. An influx of applications from former Air Berlin and Monarch employees may help offset pilot shortages. Ryanair needs to hire 600 to 700 new pilots per year to keep its growth plans on track, according to Bernstein estimates. That gives pilots leverage in skirmishes over pay – O’Leary announced that captains based in certain airports will be paid a fifth more than Norwegian from November, adding 100 million euros to its annual payroll bill. As long as Ryanair can keep its other costs down and passengers queuing up, that’s a small price to pay to ensure enough pilots are on hand for the future.",Breakingviews - Twin tailwinds help Ryanair weather pilot crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ryanair-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-twin-tailwinds-help-ryanair-weather-pilot-crisis-idUSKBN1D01BP

The announcement comes a day after Sony confirmed its renaissance by forecasting its highest-ever profit this financial year, sending its shares surging to a nine-year high.

AIBO is billed as a pet that behaves like a real dog using artificial intelligence (AI) to learn and interact with its owner and surroundings. The upgrade sees AIBO equipped with new sensing and movement technologies as well as far more advanced AI backed by cloud computing to develop the dog’s personality.

Sales begin in Japan in January for 198,000 yen ($1,739).

Sony pioneered entertainment robots with AIBO in 1999. It sold about 150,000 dogs in Japan before ceasing production seven years later when its core consumer electronics business struggled in price wars with emerging Asian rivals.

“It was a difficult decision to stop the project in 2006, but we continued development in AI and robotics,” Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai said at a news briefing.

“I asked our engineers a year and a half ago to develop (new) AIBO because I strongly believe robots capable of building loving relationships with people help realize Sony’s mission (to inspire).”

The reborn AIBO features new actuator technology allowing it move more smoothly and naturally like a real dog. With sensing and AI technologies, AIBO can run toward its owner and detect smiles and words of praise, and can remember what actions please the owner. Its eyes are made of organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays making it capable of diverse expressions.

Sony said it aims to sell at least as many new AIBO as the original, without giving a time frame. It also said it is considering overseas sales.

The firm sees AI as a future pillar of growth, hoping to catch up with major technology companies such as Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google.

It invested an undisclosed sum last year in Cogitai, a U.S. AI start-up focusing on technology that allows machines to learn continually and autonomously from interaction in the real world. It also established a venture capital fund to build partnerships with researchers and start-up companies in AI and robotics.

He failed to accomplish either.

The dust was barely settling on the capture of Islamic State’s de facto capital Raqqa, a major success for Washington and the coalition it assembled across the region and beyond. While most of the actual fighting has been done by local forces, without U.S. support the Islamist group would still almost certainly dominate huge swathes of the region. Its dramatic early victories in 2014 seriously rattled authorities in Baghdad and Riyadh in particular – but now that it is largely on the ropes, neither government has much appetite for being dictated to by America.

Those in the Trump and Obama administration might be loathe to admit it, but over the last three years both followed a similar approach on Middle East policy. Occasionally dubbed “ISIS first,” it prioritized the group’s defeat above all other regional interests. It was a reasonable approach, and – while remnants of IS remain – it has proved remarkably successful.

The problem is that there is little clarity on what will now define U.S. Mideast policy. Without a single guiding principle, there is the real risk that an already-conflicted approach could fall apart entirely.

In some respects, this is already happening. With the diminished threat from IS, Washington’s always awkward alliance with the Shi’ite-dominated, Iran-allied Baghdad government and the various political entities of Iraqi Kurdistan has deteriorated with dramatic speed. A Kurdish independence referendum last month was followed quickly by an Iraqi government advance into oil-rich areas around the Kurdish city of Kirkuk. For much of the last week, Kurdish and Iraqi government forces – both U.S.-funded and equipped, and until recently allies in the bloody battle for Mosul – have been at each other’s throats.

Across the rest of the region, the historical Sunni-Shi’ite rivalry continues to grow more complex. In Syria, Iran and Russia have essentially succeeded in their attempts to salvage Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Washington appears to have accepted this as the cost of stability and pushing back against Islamic State, while giving Saudi Arabia effective carte blanche to pursue its own war in Yemen against Houthi rebels allied with Tehran.

With IS weakened, the Trump White House clearly now hopes to make the confrontation with Iran its overarching regional priority. Trump’s October 13 announcement that he would not recertify the nuclear deal negotiated by the previous administration was the clearest signal of that so far, followed closely by new sanctions against Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, which the U.S. labels a sponsor of terror.

On Iran, however, Washington has little realistic chance of achieving the wide, unified coalition it formed against IS. America’s allies remain deeply divided on the best approach to Tehran, with European states openly reluctant to tear up the nuclear agreement also signed by Moscow and Beijing.

The Gulf states are anything but a unified coalition. The Saudi and United Arab Emirates-backed blockade of Qatar continues, putting the United States – which has major military bases in all three countries – in an awkward position, one it appears to have extremely limited ability to remedy.

The face-off between Qatar and neighbors long-infuriated by its support for groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood may now be beyond Washington’s ability to resolve. If anything, however, Tillerson was even less likely to achieve his other objective for the visit, that of turning the Iraqi government against Tehran.

When it comes to defeating Islamic State, Baghdad has been at least as dependent on Iran-backed Shi’ite militias as on Washington or the Kurds. Tillerson’s demand this weekend that those militias return to Iran will have been seen as particularly unreasonable – not least because many of their members are Shi’ite Iraqi nationals.

Tillerson’s visit risks reinforcing a narrative that had been growing in strength since the Obama administration – that America has ever-less control and influence over traditional friends and enemies alike, particularly at a time when they increasingly feel they can turn to alternatives such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Under President Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey – a reliable U.S. ally as far back as the end of the nineteenth century – has become increasingly hostile. Egypt’s military government too is increasingly keen to assert its independence, even as it continues to receive large quantities of U.S. aid.

Peter Van Buren: What you need to know about post-IS battle for Mideast

Maysam Behravesh: The unlikely - and ironic - effects of Islamic State's fall in Iraq

Relations with Israel might be marginally better under Trump than Obama but they remain much looser than in recent decades. Trump has sent mixed signals on a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; suggested – but not acted upon – moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and unsettled Israelis after reports that he disclosed Israeli-provided classified information about Islamic State to Russia’s foreign minister earlier this year. Israel’s concerns about Iran’s rising influence and an unpredictable U.S. administration make it likely that the Jewish state will intensify its own efforts at regional diplomacy, particularly with the Gulf states.

It’s a paradox that this is happening at the same time as the largely successful coalition effort against Islamic State – a coalition that depended heavily on the United States, and which perhaps no other country could have ushered into existence in quite the same way. In contrast to the unilateral U.S. military intervention in Iraq, Washington went to great efforts to work with and through regional partners, and it has proved remarkably effective. (The irony isn’t confined to the Middle East. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte is celebrating a U.S.-assisted victory over IS in Marawi City at the same time that he intensifies his courtship of Russia and China.)

U.S. military assistance will remain. IS is not completely gone, and will continue to lash out. It may yet seize new safe havens as it has in parts of Libya and Afghanistan. The wider battle against al Qaeda-inspired militancy will unquestionably continue, often with U.S. military support and coordination.

After more than a decade of war and perceived failure, however, America’s enthusiasm for attempting to reshape the Middle East may be running out. But even if it isn’t, the willingness of those in the region to listen may also be exhausted.

“We aren’t satisfied with our top-line growth and we are addressing these issues by controlling everything that is within our control,” CEO Jim Smith told analysts on an earnings call.

Although earnings-per-share beat estimates in part due to cost controls, the revenue miss pushed shares down 6.5 percent to $43.81 on the New York Stock Exchange; they were at C$56.59 in Toronto.

The results highlight the need for Thomson Reuters to find ways to generate revenue outside of managing costs, said Doug Arthur, an analyst at Huber Research Partners.

“People understand the company is doing a great job on costs,” Arthur said. “But there has been a lot of anticipation that revenues are going to hit an inflection point, and it’s just not happening.”

In its Financial & Risk segment, the company’s biggest, sales outpaced cancellations, a key indicator of future growth. Overall revenue for the unit was up slightly, but was down one percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa.

Specifically, British and European financial services clients are concerned about upcoming EU securities rules, set to take effect in January, as well as Brexit, Smith said.

”The quarter was the tale of two cities, or more like the tale of two continents,“ as the company saw unexpected softness in the UK and Europe and strength in the Americas,” Smith told Reuters. “We heard from the market, that was largely because of upcoming regulatory changes.”

Thomson Reuters still expects year-over-year growth in its financial business in 2017 and 2018, but the extent of the improvement will depend on fourth-quarter net sales, executives said on the call.

The company sees a stronger pipeline of deals for its Financial & Risk unit, Smith said.

The news and information company said full-year profits will be at the high end of its earlier forecast.

Third-quarter net earnings rose to $348 million, or 46 cents per share, from $286 million, or 36 cents per share, a year ago.

Adjusted for special items, earnings were 68 cents per share.

Total revenue grew 1 percent excluding currency to $2.79 billion. Sales in its legal business rose 1 percent to $843 million.

Analysts on average, were looking for profit of 58 cents per share, and revenue of $2.82 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/.

Ce PLFSS, qui traduit plusieurs propositions faites par Emmanuel Macron pendant sa campagne pour la présidentielle, prévoit 5,2 milliards d‘euros d‘économies sur l‘ensemble des dépenses de sécurité sociale, l‘effort étant principalement concentré sur l‘assurance maladie.

L‘une des mesures phares de ce texte - et des plus contestées - fait basculer une partie du financement de la protection sociale des cotisations salariales vers la contribution sociale généralisée (CSG), dont le taux va augmenter 1,7 point.

Le PLFSS prévoit une transformation du crédit d‘impôt pour la compétitivité et l‘emploi (CICE) en baisse pérenne des charges patronales sur les bas salaires à partir de 2019.

D‘ici là, l‘Assemblée devrait adopter lors de la suite de la discussion du projet de loi de finances (PLF) un abaissement du taux de ce crédit d‘impôt de 7% à 6% à compter du 1er janvier 2018.

La fin du régime social des indépendants (RSI) et son adossement au régime général - autre engagement de campagne d‘Emmanuel Macron - figure également dans ce texte, qui prévoit une période transitoire de deux ans.

Sur le plan financier, ce PLFSS s‘inscrit dans la perspective d‘un retour à l‘équilibre des comptes sociaux en 2020. Il prévoit une amélioration de trois milliards d‘euros du solde global de la Sécurité sociale (régime général et Fonds de solidarité vieillesse, FSV) et un retour dans le vert du régime général en 2018.

La progression de l‘objectif national de dépenses d‘assurance maladie (Ondam) a été fixée à 2,3% en 2018, contre 2,1% cette année.

Sur les autres branches de la Sécurité sociale, le PLFSS acte notamment une revalorisation du minimum vieillesse au 1er avril 2018, un abaissement de la prestation d‘accueil du jeune enfant (Paje).

Il prévoit également une hausse importante du prix du tabac étalée sur trois ans, une augmentation des taxes sur les sodas ou encore une extension de l‘obligation vaccinale pour les enfants en bas âge de trois à onze vaccins, à compter du 1er janvier.

Les groupes La République en marche (LREM) et MoDem ont voté pour ce PLFSS présenté par le ministre de l‘Action et des Comptes publics Gérald Darmanin et la ministre des Solidarités et de la Santé Agnès Buzyn.

Le groupe les Constructifs a majoritairement voté contre, quelques-uns de ses députés se sont abstenus.

Le groupe Les Républicains (LR) a voté contre tout comme ceux de gauche, celui de la Nouvelle gauche (exPS), de la France insoumise (LFI) et de la gauche démocrate et républicaine (GDR, PC).

Le PLFSS a été adopté par 354 voix contre 192.

Le Sénat examinera à son tour à partir du lundi 13 novembre ce projet de loi de financement pour la Sécurité sociale qui devrait être définitivement adopté par le Parlement début décembre.

Voici les détails des principales dispositions de ce PLFSS.

* HAUSSE DE LA CSG ET SUPPRESSION DE COTISATIONS SOCIALES

La hausse de 1,7 point du taux de la CSG - qui s‘applique à l‘ensemble des revenus, dont les pensions et l‘épargne - ne concernera ni les allocations chômage ni les indemnités journalières. Elle est destinée à compenser la suppression de certaines cotisations salariales.

Pour les salariés du privé, la suppression de cotisations se fera en deux temps et portera sur les cotisations maladie et chômage, qui représentent 3,15% de la rémunération brute.

Pour les indépendants, le changement concernera les cotisations d‘allocations familiales, maladie et maternité et se traduira par un gain de pouvoir d‘achat pour les trois quarts d‘entre eux.

A l‘inverse des salariés du privé et de la majorité des indépendants, les fonctionnaires ne bénéficieront que d‘une neutralisation de la hausse de la CSG - via la suppression de cotisations et la création d‘une prime compensatoire - sans gain de pouvoir d‘achat.

La hausse de la CSG concernera les 60% de retraités ayant les revenus les plus élevés, c‘est-à-dire ceux dont la pension est au moins égale à 1.400 euros par mois pour une personne seule de plus de 65 ans. Les retraités les plus modestes, exonérés de CSG ou soumis à la CSG à taux réduit, ne seront pas concernés.

* TRANSFORMATION DU CICE

Le texte transforme, à compter de 2019, le Crédit d‘impôt compétitivité emploi (CICE) en allègement pérenne de 6% des cotisations sociales des entreprises pour les rémunérations n‘excédant pas 2,5 fois le SMIC.

Le texte supprime également le crédit d‘impôt de taxe sur les salaires (CITS), instauré dans la loi de finances pour 2017 qui concernait le secteur de l‘économie sociale et solidaire, en le transformant en réduction de cotisations patronales.

* FISCALITÉ DES ACTIONS GRATUITES

Un amendement du groupe LREM a allégé la fiscalité sur les actions gratuites distribuées dans les entreprises, ramenant la contribution patronale de 30% à 20%.

Cette disposition, qui efface une mesure prise contre l‘avis du gouvernement dans le cadre PLF 2017, rétablit le régime fiscal instauré par la loi Macron de 2015.

* REPORT DE LA GÉNÉRALISATION DU TIERS PAYANT

La mise en place du tiers payant généralisé, prévue au 30 novembre 2017 mais jugée “irréaliste” dans un récent rapport de l‘Inspection générale des affaires sociales (Igas), a été reportée via un amendement gouvernemental.

Actuellement en vigueur pour les bénéficiaires de la couverture maladie universelle complémentaire, les patients souffrant d‘affections de longue durée et les femmes en congés maternité, ce dispositif permet d‘éviter aux patients d‘avoir à avancer leurs frais de santé.

Sa généralisation va faire l‘objet d‘une concertation.

* SUPPRESSION DU RSI

Le texte supprime le régime social des indépendants (RSI) et prévoit son adossement au régime général, avec une période transitoire de deux ans.

* MESURES DE PRÉVENTION

Le PLFSS entend renforcer la lutte contre la tabagisme en instaurant une hausse de près de trois euros en trois ans du paquet de cigarettes. La taxe sur les boissons sucrées, dite “taxe sodas”, a également été durcie via un amendement de la commission visant à accentuer la lutte contre l‘obésité.

L‘obligation vaccinale pour les jeunes enfants est étendue de trois à huit vaccins. En plus des vaccinations contre la diphtérie, le tétanos et la poliomyélite, déjà obligatoires, les enfants nés à partir du 1er janvier 2018 devront désormais également être vaccinés contre la coqueluche, la bactérie Haemophius influenzae de type b, l‘hépatite B, le pneumocoque, le méningocoque C, la rougeole, les oreillons et la rubéole.

Les onze vaccins seront obligatoires pour toute admission en collectivité (crèche, garderie, colonie de vacances, école) mais il n‘y aura pas de sanction pour les parents refusant de vacciner leur enfant.

* ÉVOLUTION DES ALLOCATIONS FAMILIALES

La prestation d‘accueil au jeune enfant (PAJE) va baisser de 15 euros par mois pour les naissances enregistrées à partir du 1er avril 2018. Cette mesure, vivement dénoncée par tous les groupes, a été votée par le seul groupe LREM.

Une augmentation de 30% de l’aide à la garde d’enfants versée aux familles monoparentales a également été votée.",L'Assemblée vote le budget de la Sécu pour 2018,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRKBN1D02BN-OFRTP

The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, compiled by IHS Markit, fell to 50.3 last month from September’s 51.2, marking its third month above the 50-point threshold that separates growth from contraction.

That was below all projections in a Reuters poll which had predicted a modest uptick to 51.5 and comes after another recent Reuters survey forecast India’s economy will grow at its slowest pace in four years this fiscal year.

The government’s decision to ban high value-currency notes last November, combined with the introduction of a new unified tax system, dampened consumer spending and industrial activity.

“Business confidence eased to the weakest since February as some firms expressed concerns over negative GST effects,” Dodhia said.

The new orders sub-index, a proxy for domestic demand, fell to a three-month low of 49.9 from September’s 51.0, discouraging firms from increasing output faster. Foreign demand contracted at the fastest pace since September 2013.

Firms passed on greater cost burdens and raised prices more sharply, suggesting retail inflation could extend its uptrend over the coming months.

Indian consumer inflation held steady at 3.28 percent in September, but is expected to accelerate over coming months led by higher petrol and diesel prices, complicating the task of the Reserve Bank of India as it seeks to stimulate the economy with more rate cuts.

The report excluded the impact of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s shock withdrawal of high-value banknotes last year and the implementation of a nationwide multi-rate goods and services tax (GST), steps that affected businesses and dragged the economy to a three-year-low in the April-June quarter.

“In the case of GST, we know that this is a very complicated reform,” Dixon said, adding that the agency would observe the GST for the next two or three years to see its full implementation.

This month Modi eased tax rules for small and medium-sized companies in a bid to address growing criticism of his stewardship of Asia’s third-largest economy.

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

The Orange County seat held by Rohrabacher is key to Democrats’ hopes to increase their numbers in the U.S. House of Representatives in next year’s elections. Neuroscientist Hans Keirstead, a stem cell researcher and entrepreneur from Laguna Beach, is one of seven Democrats aiming to beat him, according to the Federal Election Commission.

“We’ve got a Russian-tainted Congressman taking Russian-tainted money from Manafort,” Keirstead said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. “Something has to be put straight here.”

Federal investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election on Monday charged Manafort, a lobbyist and former Trump campaign manager, with money laundering.

Rohrabacher, a senior member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, has frequently praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and was considered for a role in U.S. President Donald Trump’s cabinet.

His Southern California base in Orange County was for decades a Republican stronghold and a center of support for Ronald Reagan. Reliably conservative voters there have sent Rohrabacher to the House for nearly 30 years.

But the 48th Congressional district has undergone profound demographic shifts in recent years, and it is now one of nine Republican districts in California that Democrats have targeted. Hillary Clinton beat Trump in the district in 2016, winning 152,000 votes compared to his 146,600.

“These are people who care about the environment, care about social issues,” said Drew Godinich, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in California. “Donald Trump and Donald Trump’s Republican Party are no longer a good match for them.”

Attraverso il cosiddetto ‘canale New York’ Joseph Yun, negoziatore Usa con la Corea del Nord, è in contatto con diplomatici della missione di Pyongyang presso le Nazioni Unite, dice la fonte, in un momento in cui uno scambio di bellicosi insulti fra Trump e il leader Kim Jong Un ha alimentato i timori di un‘escalation militare.

Mentre il segretario di Stato Usa Rex Tillerson il 17 ottobre ha detto che proseguirà “gli sforzi diplomatici... fino allo scoppio della prima bomba”, le parole del funzionario indicano chiaramente che gli Stati Uniti stanno discutendo direttamente di questioni oltre quella del rilascio di prigionieri americani, nonostante Trump abbia detto che colloqui diretti non hanno senso.

Non c‘è però alcun segnale che questo genere di comunicazione abbia migliorato un rapporto tra i due Paesi su cui hanno pesato i test nucleari e missilistici della Corea del Nord, la morte dello studente universitario Usa Otto Warmbier a pochi giorni dal rilascio da parte di Pyongyang a giugno e la detenzione di altri tre americani.

While business surveys on Wednesday suggested Asia’s export-driven expansion still has legs, the readings are starting to reflect signs of fatigue after an impressive sprint so far this year, suggesting regional economic growth has peaked.

Still, barring any unexpected shocks, most analysts polled by Reuters expect the global economy will remain on a roll for one more year, even if China sees a gradual loss of momentum.

In the West, similar preliminary surveys last week looked solid enough not to derail plans by Federal Reserve to gradually reduce its balance sheet and by the European Central Bank to slow bond buying. The Bank of England may raise interest rates for the first time since 2007 on Thursday despite the Brexit shock.

Taken together, the recent data points to global economic growth of around 3.5 percent this year, analysts at Capital Economics said, adding the world economy should be able to sustain that rate in 2018.

In China, a private survey showed manufacturing output rising at the weakest pace in four months in October and companies continued to shed staff despite a slight pick-up in domestic and export orders.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) was unchanged from September’s reading of 51.0, and in line with forecasts.

But production growth slowed markedly, nearing the 50-point threshold that separates expansion from contraction.

Similar PMI surveys in Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam and India also suggested growth was starting to fade, while activity in Malaysia contracted.

“We expect (China‘s) growth momentum to weaken in the coming months as the drags from slower credit growth, reduced fiscal support post-Party Congress and the environmental crackdown all intensify,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics.

The Caixin China report followed a similar official survey on Tuesday which pointed to an unexpected cooldown in the manufacturing sector in the face of a weakening property market and a crackdown on smog, which is forcing some steel mills and factories in the northeast to curtail or halt production.

China’s economy has surprised with growth of nearly 7 percent this year, driven by a renaissance in its “smokestack” industries, such as steel. It is now almost sure to surpass the official target of around 6.5 percent.

But property and construction activity, two key growth drivers, are feeling the weight of government measures to cool the heat in the housing market. Higher borrowing costs are also hurting some firms as regulators clamp down on riskier forms of lending.

Officials speaking at a twice-a-decade Communist Party congress last month emphasised a shift in focus to high-quality rather than high-speed growth and alluded to further efforts to contain excessive risk-taking in the financial system, sending 10-year Chinese government bond yields to their highest in three years.

“The Caixin PMI reflects companies that are smaller in scale and they are at the centre of the deleveraging reform,” said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING.

“I don’t think this is a one-off.”

SUPER TECH

Strong global demand for electronics has fuelled solid economic and corporate profit growth this year in Asia’s tech-oriented exporters: South Korea, Taiwan and Japan.

Taiwan reported its fastest quarterly growth in 2-1/2 years on Tuesday as it benefits from growth in more advanced technologies and the rollout of new smartphone models such as Apple Inc’s iPhones and other tech gadgets.

Taiwan’s October PMI came in at 53.6, easing from September but still the highest reading in Asia.

Soaring memory chip sales helped South Korea’s exports record a 12th consecutive month of growth in October, though the pace cooled from September, data showed on Wednesday.

“Towards the end of the year ... the super-tech cycle is likely to slow,” said Trinh Nguyen, a senior economist for emerging Asia at Natixis.

She believes that the recent tech recovery has been cyclical, not structural, and that 2017 growth rates have been flattered to some extent by comparisons with a relatively soft performance last year.

“We do not expect trade to recover to its pre-crisis levels. You have a deceleration of trade liberalisation and of the expansion of the supply chains and the change in structure of the Chinese economy.”

Asian financial markets showed little reaction to the PMIs, as investors focused on the progress of a U.S. tax-cut plan being developed by President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans and Trump’s imminent announcement of the next head of the Federal Reserve, which could shape the growth and policy outlooks for the global economy for years to come.

The Fed, which ends a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, has raised rates twice this year and is expected to do so again in December, with data on Tuesday showing consumer confidence at a 17-year high reinforcing that view.","Global Economy: China's war on smog, risk, taking edge off Asia's growth sprint",https://www.reuters.com/article/global-economy/global-economy-chinas-war-on-smog-risk-taking-edge-off-asias-growth-sprint-idINKBN1D13NU

Other data on Wednesday showed a surge in private sector hiring, indicating that job growth rebounded last month after being depressed in September as hurricanes Harvey and Irma left some workers temporarily unemployed.

Manufacturing and labor strength likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to increase interest rates in December. The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise rates when policymakers conclude a two-day meeting later on Wednesday.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity slipped to a reading of 58.7 last month from 60.8 in September, which was the highest since May 2004. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.

September’s jump in the index was driven by supply chain disruptions, especially in the chemical products sector. The supply bottlenecks, which also pushed up prices of raw materials, resulted in a longer delivery times.

Longer suppliers’ delivery times are normally associated with increased activity, which is a positive contribution to the ISM index. The ISM’s supplier deliveries sub-index fell to 61.4 last month after soaring to 64.4 in September.

The survey’s prices paid sub-index dropped to 68.5 after racing to 71.5 in September, which was the highest reading since May 2011. The production sub-index slipped 1.2 points to a reading of 61.0 in October and a gauge of new orders fell to 63.4. A measure of factory employment dipped to 59.8 from 60.3 in September, which was the highest level since 2011.

Manufacturing is being supported by a strengthening global economy and weakening U.S. dollar.

PRIVATE PAYROLLS SURGE

Separately, the ADP National Employment Report showed private employers hired 235,000 workers last month, the most in seven months, after increasing payrolls by 110,000 jobs in September.

The ADP report, which is jointly produced with Moody’s Analytics, is not a good predictor of the private payrolls component of the employment report. It, however, supported expectations of a sharp rebound in employment last month after nonfarm payrolls declined by 33,000 jobs in September.

Prices for U.S. government bonds were trading higher and the dollar rose against a basket of currencies.

A third report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending increased 0.3 percent to $1.22 trillion as a surge in public construction outlays offset the third straight monthly decline in investment in private projects.

But August’s construction outlays were revised down to show a 0.1 percent gain instead of the previously reported 0.5 percent rise. Construction spending increased 2.0 percent on a year-on-year basis.

In September, investment on private construction projects fell 0.4 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in August. It was the third straight monthly drop in private construction outlays and reflected a 0.8 percent decline in spending on private nonresidential projects. Spending on nonresidential projects in September was the lowest since April 2016.

Spending on nonresidential structures has now declined for four consecutive months. Spending on oil drilling has been slowing in recent months amid moderate gains in oil prices and ample crude supplies. Spending on residential structures was unchanged in September.

The data could impact the government’s gross domestic product estimate for the third quarter published last week. The government’s advance estimate put economic growth at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the July-September quarter, with both residential and nonresidential structures subtracting from output.

In September, outlays on public construction projects jumped 2.6 percent after rising 0.7 percent in August. Spending on state and local government construction projects climbed 2.5 percent.

Republicans in Congress have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, which they have said drives up costs for consumers and interferes with personal medical decisions. Democrats have warned that repeal would leave millions of Americans without health coverage.

President Donald Trump promised to kill the law in his 2016 election campaign, and he has taken executive and administrative actions to undermine it.

“The market’s going to be extremely confusing. There’s going to be entire complexity of choice,” said David Anderson, a health policy researcher at Duke University.

The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, estimated this week that 2018 enrollment would have held steady from 2017, with 12.2 million people signing up for individual health coverage under the Affordable Care Act had there not been administration efforts to undercut it.

The Trump administration has cut the 2018 enrollment period in half to six weeks from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15 for states using the federal Healthcare.gov website. Enrollment previously ran until Jan. 31, and many consumers often signed up in the last two weeks, according to state officials and organizations that help people choose insurance.

Senate Republicans and Democrats are working on legislation to stabilize Obamacare markets in the short term, but the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that about 1 million fewer people will enroll for 2018 plans due to Trump policies.

The administration has cut off billions of dollars in subsidies that insurers use to discount out-of-pocket medical costs for low-income Americans, slashed Obamacare advertising and cut funding to groups that help people enroll in health insurance. Several insurers have exited Obamacare markets due to concerns over subsidies and other Trump actions.

The Department of Health and Human Services said on Monday that premiums for the most popular Obamacare plans would rise 37 percent in 2018. Americans eligible for Obamacare tax credits to buy insurance may pay less for coverage, but costs would increase for middle-class consumers who do not get subsidies.

“It’s been such a flood of information. A lot of the population thinks the Affordable Care Act has already been put under,” said Daniel Polsky, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics. “The strange premium increases are going to be very confusing for consumers.”

The Trump administration is now planning changes for 2019. Last week, it proposed a rule giving states more flexibility over the benefits that must be covered by insurance.

Monsanto is banking on weed killers using a chemical known as dicamba - and seeds engineered to resist it - to dominate soybean production in the United States, the world’s second-largest exporter.

The United States has faced a weed-killer crisis this year caused by the new formulations of dicamba-based herbicides, which farmers and weed experts say have harmed crops because they evaporate and drift away from where they are applied.

Monsanto and BASF say the herbicides are safe when properly applied. They need to convince regulators after the flood of complaints to state agriculture departments.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) last year approved use of the weed killers on dicamba-resistant crops during the summer growing season. Previously, farmers used dicamba to kill weeds before they planted seeds, and not while the crops were growing.

However, the EPA approved such use only until Nov. 9, 2018, because “extraordinary precautions” are needed to prevent dicamba products from tainting vulnerable crops, a spokesman told Reuters in a statement last week. The agency wanted to be able to step in if there were problems, he said.

Next year, the EPA will determine whether to extend its approval by reviewing damage complaints and consulting with state and industry experts. States are separately considering new restrictions on usage for 2018.

Major soybean-growing states, including Arkansas, Missouri and Illinois, each received roughly four years’ worth of complaints about possible pesticide damage to crops this year due to dicamba use, state regulators said.

Now agriculture officials face long backlogs of cases to investigate, which are driving up costs for lab tests and overtime. Several states had to reassign employees to handle the load.

“We don’t have the staff to be able to handle 400 investigations in a year plus do all the other required work,” said Paul Bailey, director of the Plant Industries division of the Missouri Department of Agriculture.

In Missouri, farmers filed about 310 complaints over suspected dicamba damage, on top of the roughly 80 complaints about pesticides the state receives in a typical year, he said.

Nationwide, states launched 2,708 investigations into dicamba-related plant injury by Oct. 15, according to data compiled by the University of Missouri.

States investigate such complaints to determine whether applicators followed the rules for using chemicals. Those found to have violated regulations can be fined.

Monsanto has said that U.S. farmers spraying this past summer failed to follow detailed instructions of up to 4,550 words printed on labels.

The companies will change usage instructions in hopes of avoiding a repeat of the past summer’s problems.

“With significant adoption and a lot of interest in this new technology, we recognize that many states have received a number of reports of potential off-target application of dicamba in 2017,” Monsanto spokeswoman Charla Lord said last month.

PHOTOGRAPHING DAMAGED SOYBEANS

State investigators try to visit fields within days after farmers report possible damage to take photos before signs of injury, such as cupped leaves on soybean plants hit by dicamba, disappear. They question farmers and the people who applied the herbicide, and often gather samples from plants to test.

In Arkansas, farmers filed about 985 complaints associated with dicamba, the most of any state. Investigators are probing about 1,200 total complaints involving pesticide use, which includes weed killers, said Terry Walker, director of the Arkansas State Plant Board.

Arkansas delayed inspections of animal feed and allowed overtime to handle the dicamba cases, which is not normal practice, Walker said. He was unable to provide a cost estimate for dealing with the complaints.

Among the farmers who reported damage was Reed Storey, who said he wanted to ensure state officials knew dicamba caused damage even when users follow the instructions.

“I‘m calling strictly to let y‘all know that we have an issue with this product,” Storey, who spoke last month, said he told Arkansas regulators.

Illinois received about 421 total pesticide complaints, the most since at least 1989, said Warren Goetsch, acting chief of the Bureau of Environmental Programs at the Illinois Department of Agriculture. That includes at least 245 complaints associated with dicamba, which could take until next year to finish investigating, he said.

“It’s frustrating I think for us that we’re as behind as we are,” Goetsch said.

MONSANTO‘S BIG BET

Monsanto is betting on dicamba-tolerant soybeans to replace those that withstand glyphosate, an herbicide used for decades but which is becoming less effective as weeds develop resistance. The company aims for its dicamba-resistant seeds to account for half the U.S. soybeans planted by 2019.

Monsanto, which is in the process of being acquired by Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE) for $63.5 billion, said it plans to open a call center to help customers use dicamba next year and is talking with states about the product.

Monsanto’s net sales increased $1.1 billion, or 8 percent, in fiscal year 2017 due partly to increased sales of its dicamba-resistant soybean seeds.

The company and BASF already face several lawsuits from farmers alleging damage to plants from dicamba used by neighbors.

ANALYZING PLANT SAMPLES

The EPA provides grants to states that help fund investigations into pesticide damage and this year offered 35 states extra assistance analyzing plant samples for dicamba, according to the agency.

Minnesota and Illinois turned to the EPA for help, with the latter saying the federal agency has better equipment to detect low levels of dicamba.

In Iowa, the state’s laboratory bureau received 515 samples to test this year, up 35 percent, as dicamba use helped drive up the total number of pesticide complaints to 270 from a typical range of 70 to 120, according to the state. Each test costs up to $9.

“We are really anxious to flip the page and look ahead to 2018 and try to figure out the things that can be done to improve the situation,” said Mike Naig, deputy secretary of the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.","Monsanto, BASF weed killers strain U.S. states with damage complaints",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pesticides-complaints/monsanto-basf-weed-killers-strain-u-s-states-with-damage-complaints-idUSKBN1D14N0

Papadopoulos pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents about his dealings with Russians, including an April 2016 meeting in which he was told the Russians had “dirt” on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton that entailed “thousands of emails.”

Prosecutors on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team said in court records that Papadopoulos had conversations and email exchanges with an unnamed “campaign supervisor” about efforts to improve U.S.-Russia relations by setting up meetings between senior campaign and Russian officials.

According to those records, the campaign supervisor conveyed to Papadopoulos in a March 6, 2016, discussion that “a principal foreign policy focus of the campaign was an improved U.S. relationship with Russia.”

A source familiar with the investigation said Clovis was the campaign supervisor referenced in the court records.

Victoria Toensing, a lawyer for Clovis, did not dispute that but added that her client never said improving U.S.-Russia relations was a “principal foreign policy focus” because that was not his view of Trump’s priorities.

Mueller is leading a probe into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trump’s favor and into potential collusion by Trump aides.

Russia denies the allegations and Trump denies any collusion.

‘OPPOSED ANY RUSSIA TRIP’

George Papadopoulos (3rd L) appears in a photograph released on Donald Trump's social media accounts with a headline stating that the scene was of his campaign's national security meeting in Washington, D.C. U.S. on March 31, 2016 and published April 1, 2016. Social Media/Handout via REUTERS

Prosecutors said in the court records that Papadopoulos emailed the supervisor and several others to tell them he had met with a professor who had in turn introduced him to a Russian woman and the Russian ambassador in London, and that they discussed setting up meetings to talk about U.S.-Russia ties in a Trump presidency.

The supervisor replied that he would “work it through the campaign” and not to make a commitment at that point. “Great work,” the supervisor added in the email.

In August 2016, the supervisor wrote to Papadopoulos in reference to a possible “off the record” meeting with Russian officials, saying: “I would encourage you” and another foreign policy adviser “to make the trip.”

In her response, Toensing said: “Dr. Clovis always vigorously opposed any Russian trip for Donald Trump or staff. However, if a volunteer made suggestions on any foreign policy matter, Dr. Clovis, a polite gentleman from Iowa, would have expressed courtesy and appreciation.”

Clovis has since been nominated by Trump to a top post as chief scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Debbie Stabenow, the ranking member of the Senate panel that will vet the nomination, told Reuters she was concerned.

“The emerging information about his role in the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia raises serious concerns,” she said in a statement.

NBC News reported on Tuesday that Clovis had been questioned by Mueller’s team and testified before the grand jury.

But not all countries in North Africa feel they have that freedom when they perceive a two-front ideological battle against IS and Iran.","These are challenging times for North Africa’s Muslim governments. Even as Islamic State is ousted from its strongholds in Iraq and Syria, the extremist group is continuing its battle against authorities in countries like Morocco, Algeria and Egypt.

On Oct. 16, the Egyptian military announced that six soldiers and at least 24 IS militants were killed in attacks on military outposts in North Sinai. That same weekend, Moroccan police arrested 11 members of an “extremely dangerous” IS-linked cell and seized chemical products used to make bombs. Algerian forces, meanwhile, have killed at least 71 Islamist fighters so far this year – the most since 2014.

The list of arrests, shootouts and seizure of passports from citizens who want to be foreign fighters goes on. But North African leaders have to navigate a particularly tortuous sectarian path. To avoid the perception that fighting extremism amounts to the persecution of the defenders of the faith, their governments have to be seen to be making visible gestures of Islamic piety – while also cracking down on Shi’ite proselytizing so as to rebut IS claims that authorities are complicit with Iran’s “plots and schemes” to carve up the region and spread Shi’ite Islam.

The Islamist PJD party in Morocco warned recently of a “sectarian Shi’ite invasion;” the Grand Mufti of Mauritania called on his country’s leaders to resist the “rising Shi’ite tide.” One North African government minister I interviewed denounced “the intrusion of Shi’ism through social media, university dormitories, high schools and even qur’anic schools,” concluding gravely, “I ask myself whether the Persians want to dominate the Arab world.”

After Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Bahrein, is North Africa the next realm of a more assertive Iranian foreign policy? These fears come from Iran’s attempt to expand its influence in Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia – and its “backyard:” Senegal, Niger, Guinea and Mali.

Iran’s foreign minister toured the region in June, meeting with heads of government in Algeria, Mauritania and Tunisia in search of improved ties. Iran may simply be looking for new economic partnerships to offset current sanctions, but its outreach is enough to make some local powers nervous. Around the same time, Iran launched satellites beaming Arabic-language Shi’ite religious programming into North African homes.

There are thought to be fewer than 20,000 Shi’ites in Algeria, and the government recently mandated the registration of all of them. The Algerian minister of religious affairs has said that Shi’ites have no right to spread their faith in Algeria, “because that causes sedition and other problems.” ""Algeria cannot play host to a sectarian war that does not concern it,” he explained in an interview. “Neither Shi'ism, nor Wahhabism nor any of the other sects are the product of Algerians, nor do they come from Algeria. We refuse to be the battleground for two external and foreign ideologies.” Diplomatic relations resist easy categories, however. Algeria is one of only a handful of countries, along with Iran, to maintain good relations with Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are Shi’ite. Algiers was Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s first stop in North Africa in June.

Given the tiny number of Shi’ites living in North Africa and the tight control over mosques in the region, widespread Shi’ite religious influence on the ground is unrealistic. Whether or not the scale of proselytism justifies the level of concern, Moroccan and Algerian leaders view Iran’s Africa policy as a threat to their domestic order and regional security. The prospect of sectarian strife exists for “heterodox” – i.e. non-Sunni – minorities scattered across the region, numbering in the millions who live under mainstream Sunni rule. Some of these groups are offshoots of Shi’ite Islam, but are not necessarily the source of conflict. In Algeria, their mere difference – and the government’s toleration of them – sometimes provokes attack from local hardliners.

North Africa’s Sunni governments struggle with the reality that two adversaries – Iran and IS – are the net beneficiaries of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the crushing of Sunni opposition in Syria in 2017. The decline of Saudi influence after the Sept. 11 attacks and the downfall of Sunni Baathist rule in Iraq enhanced Iran’s stature while diminishing Sunni Arab influence in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria – and opening a path for IS.

Officially, there is no Shi’ite minority in Morocco; unofficial estimates put the number at less than 2 percent. Nonetheless, the foreign ministry in Rabat has accused Iran of trying to alter “the kingdom’s religious fundamentals.” The bad blood is the legacy of a sour relationship between Ayatollah Khomenei and King Hassan II (the father of current Moroccan King Mohammed VI) in the 1980s. The Ayatollah’s claims of Islamic supremacy over all Muslims threatened the Moroccan King’s role as “Emir al Mouamine” – leader of the faithful – of scores of millions of followers across Northwest Africa. Hassan chaired the international council of Islamic scholars that declared the Ayatollah to be an apostate – “if he is Muslim, then I’m not” – and openly supported Iraq in its war with Iran.

In turn, Hassan thought he saw an Iranian hand behind his domestic travails. Tehran provided safe haven to the Moroccan armed opposition group Chabiba Islamiya, and Hassan publicly accused Iran of fomenting riots against rising living costs and the violent uprising in the northern Rif region that is home to many Berbers. Street contestation in the Rif region has again put Rabat off balance in 2017 and revived the accusations a generation later.

The contrast with neighboring Tunisia is significant. Tunis has enjoyed unbroken relations with Iran since 1990, including high-level exchanges before and after the January, 2011 revolution that sparked what became known as the Arab Spring. Trade with Iran increased significantly as a result, but hardly registered compared to much more significant trade with the EU, North Africa, China and Turkey. Tunisia prides itself on being an island of sectarian tolerance in a rapidly polarizing region. Senior religious affairs officials proudly state that they represent all religions, including Christians and Jews, although in reality the country has very few non-Sunni Muslims. After the January 15 revolution, Tunisia signed the United Nations Convention on Human Rights and helped protect religious freedom in Article 6 of its new constitution.

Saudi Arabia has maintained its natural advantage, however. A month after the Iranian foreign minister left Tunis, a Saudi government delegation arrived, including 53 businessmen. They signed agreements with the government worth $200 million in development projects, including several hospitals and the renovations of a historic mosque in Kairouan.

But not all countries in North Africa feel they have that freedom when they perceive a two-front ideological battle against IS and Iran. In response to the State Department’s admonishments on religious freedoms in Algeria, the Algerian Minister said: “If they want to accuse us of defending Islam and our historic traditions, then let them.”

The defeat of IS in Raqqa has bought time for North African governments to consolidate their religious communities. But that same defeat also removes an obstacle to Iranian influence – not unlike the fall of Baghdad almost 15 years ago. Don’t expect the competition for leadership from the Persian Gulf to be resolved anytime soon.","Commentary: In Sunni North Africa, fears of Iran’s Shi’ite shadow",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-commentary-laurence-afterislamicstate/commentary-in-sunni-north-africa-fears-of-irans-shiite-shadow-idUSKBN1CV376

(For a graphic on 'New York truck attack' click tmsnrt.rs/2z3aqZv)","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investigators on Wednesday were focused on an Uzbek immigrant they said killed eight people in New York by driving a rental truck down a riverfront bike path in an attack authorities said had all the hallmarks of terrorism.

The suspect, who was shot by police and arrested moments after the Tuesday rampage in lower Manhattan, left a note saying he carried out the attack in the name of the militant Islamic State group, the New York Times and CNN said.

It was the deadliest single attack on New York City since Sept. 11, 2001, when suicide hijackers crashed two jetliners into the World Trade Center, killing more than 2,600 people. A further 11 people were injured in Tuesday’s attack.

Similar assaults using vehicles as weapons took place in Spain in August and in France and Germany last year.

The suspect allegedly swerved the pickup onto a path filled with pedestrians and bicyclists on a sunny autumn afternoon, mowing down people in his path before slamming into the side of a school bus.

He then exited the vehicle brandishing what turned out to be a paint-ball gun and a pellet gun before a police officer shot him in the abdomen.

The attack, which left crumpled bicycles scattered along the path and victims writhing on the ground, was over in seconds.

The suspect underwent surgery for gunshot wounds.

Police declined to publicly identify the man, but a source familiar with the investigation said his name was Sayfullo Saipov, 29. He reportedly lived in Paterson, New Jersey, a one-time industrial hub about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of lower Manhattan.

He had rented the pickup from a Home Depot Inc hardware store which, according to media accounts, was located in Passaic, just south of Paterson.

U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham urged authorities to treat Saipov as an enemy combatant, a move that would allow investigators to question the man without him having a lawyer present.

ARGENTINE FRIENDS AMONG DEAD

Six victims were pronounced dead at the scene and two more at a nearby hospital, Police Commissioner James O‘Neill said.

Five of the dead were Argentine tourists, visiting New York as part of a group of friends celebrating the 30th anniversary of their high school graduation, the government there said. Belgium’s foreign minister said a Belgian citizen was also among those killed.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said police will be out in force to protect the city’s marathon on Sunday, one of the world’s top road races, which draws some 51,000 runners from around the globe.

“You’ll see a lot of officers with long guns. Other things you won’t see that are protecting us,” he told MSNBC.

A U.S. law enforcement official described the suspect as a U.S. immigrant born in Uzbekistan, a predominantly Muslim country in Central Asia that was once part of the former Soviet Union. CNN and NBC News said he entered the United States in 2010.

Uzbekistan’s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said his government would do all it could to help investigate the “extremely brutal” attack.

Authorities late on Tuesday surrounded a house in Paterson where, according to the New York Times, Saipov was believed to have lived. Paterson, known for its large immigrant population, is home to about 150,000 people, including 25,000 to 30,000 Muslims.

ABC News reported that Saipov had lived in Tampa, Florida. A check of court records related to a traffic citation that Saipov received in eastern Pennsylvania in 2015 showed he listed addresses then in Paterson and Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio.

CNN and other media outlets, citing police officials, reported that the suspect shouted “Allahu Akbar” - Arabic for “God is greatest” - when he jumped out of his truck.

Although authorities from the mayor’s office to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security all swiftly branded the attack an act of terrorism, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo stressed that the suspect was believed to have acted alone.

The New York Times said Saipov had come to the attention of law enforcement in the past. It cited three officials as saying federal authorities knew of Saipov from an unrelated probe, although it was unclear whether that was because he had ties to someone who was under scrutiny or because he was the target of an investigation.

Last week an Uzbekistan citizen living in Brooklyn was sentenced to 15 years in prison for conspiring to support Islamic State.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has pressed for a ban on travelers entering the United States from some predominantly Muslim countries, said on Twitter that he had ordered Homeland Security officials to “step up our already Extreme Vetting Program. Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!”

He also criticized the U.S. visa system, blaming Democrats and saying that he wanted a ‘merit based’ program for immigrants to the United States.

Other data on Wednesday showed a surge in private sector hiring, indicating that job growth rebounded last month after being depressed in September as hurricanes Harvey and Irma left some workers temporarily unemployed.

Manufacturing and labor strength likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to increase interest rates in December. The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise rates when policymakers conclude a two-day meeting later on Wednesday.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity slipped to a reading of 58.7 last month from 60.8 in September, which was the highest since May 2004. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.

September’s jump in the index was driven by supply chain disruptions, especially in the chemical products sector. The supply bottlenecks, which also pushed up prices of raw materials, resulted in a longer delivery times.

Longer suppliers’ delivery times are normally associated with increased activity, which is a positive contribution to the ISM index. The ISM’s supplier deliveries sub-index fell to 61.4 last month after soaring to 64.4 in September.

The survey’s prices paid sub-index dropped to 68.5 after racing to 71.5 in September, which was the highest reading since May 2011. The production sub-index slipped 1.2 points to a reading of 61.0 in October and a gauge of new orders fell to 63.4. A measure of factory employment dipped to 59.8 from 60.3 in September, which was the highest level since 2011.

Manufacturing is being supported by a strengthening global economy and weakening U.S. dollar.

PRIVATE PAYROLLS SURGE

Separately, the ADP National Employment Report showed private employers hired 235,000 workers last month, the most in seven months, after increasing payrolls by 110,000 jobs in September.

The ADP report, which is jointly produced with Moody’s Analytics, is not a good predictor of the private payrolls component of the employment report. It, however, supported expectations of a sharp rebound in employment last month after nonfarm payrolls declined by 33,000 jobs in September.

Prices for U.S. government bonds were trading higher and the dollar rose against a basket of currencies.

A third report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending increased 0.3 percent to $1.22 trillion as a surge in public construction outlays offset the third straight monthly decline in investment in private projects.

But August’s construction outlays were revised down to show a 0.1 percent gain instead of the previously reported 0.5 percent rise. Construction spending increased 2.0 percent on a year-on-year basis.

In September, investment on private construction projects fell 0.4 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in August. It was the third straight monthly drop in private construction outlays and reflected a 0.8 percent decline in spending on private nonresidential projects. Spending on nonresidential projects in September was the lowest since April 2016.

Spending on nonresidential structures has now declined for four consecutive months. Spending on oil drilling has been slowing in recent months amid moderate gains in oil prices and ample crude supplies. Spending on residential structures was unchanged in September.

The data could impact the government’s gross domestic product estimate for the third quarter published last week. The government’s advance estimate put economic growth at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the July-September quarter, with both residential and nonresidential structures subtracting from output.

In September, outlays on public construction projects jumped 2.6 percent after rising 0.7 percent in August. Spending on state and local government construction projects climbed 2.5 percent.

Shares of Twitter soared more than 18 percent to $20.31 in afternoon trading. The company also said user growth resumed in the third quarter after stalling in the prior three months.

Twitter has never had a profitable quarter based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but said it “will likely be GAAP profitable” in the fourth quarter if it hits the high end of its estimates.

The social media company has struggled to convert its appeal among celebrities and public figures such as U.S. President Donald Trump to attract users and advertisers amid fierce competition from Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Snap Inc’s (SNAP.N) Snapchat. It has worked in recent months to sign live-streaming deals and make other changes to improve user experience.

Revenue from data licensing and other sources in the third quarter was $87 million, Twitter said, up 22 percent from a year earlier. That helped cushion an 8 percent decrease in advertising revenue.

Twitter said it signed a “significant number” of enterprise deals in the third quarter, which would help stabilize its revenue flow. It did not name the companies it had inked deals with.

Twitter reported quarterly revenue of $590 million, down 4 percent from a year earlier, attributing much of the decrease to a previously announced decision to wind down its TellApart advertising product.

Analysts on average had expected revenue of $587 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

San Francisco-based Twitter also disclosed that it had discovered an error in how it had measured its user base since 2014 and revised its estimates downward, but said the difference amounted to less than 1 percent.

The company reported 330 million monthly active users in the quarter ended on Sept. 30, up 4 million from a quarter earlier, helped by email and push notifications.

In the United States, where growth had stalled earlier this year, the number of users rose to 69 million from 68 million.

Analysts on average expected 330.4 million monthly active users worldwide and 69 million in the United States, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.

Twitter said that in past estimates it had wrongly counted people who logged into applications associated with the company’s Fabric software platform, which Twitter sold this year to Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.

Unlike Facebook, Twitter does not disclose daily active users, but says that number is less than half the monthly figure.

The decline in quarterly revenue was the third since Twitter’s debut as a public company in 2013 and raised concerns about growth among some analysts.

“Yes, they grew 4 million MAU sequentially, which is good enough for the stock to stay at current levels, but revenue growth remains a problem,” said Michael Pachter, managing director, equity research at Wedbush Securities.

“It’s great that they are controlling expenses and generating EBITDA growth, but investors want to see faster MAU growth and some revenue growth,” Pachter said.

Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on a conference call that the company was trying out ways to attract and engage more users.

“We’re playing a lot with better matching people with their interests and with topics they care about. This is an area of experimentation,” he said.

Also on Thursday, Twitter said it banned advertisements from accounts owned by Russian media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, citing allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that the outlets tried to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election.

The company has been under scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers as part of a broad investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election.

COST CUTS, SMALLER LOSS

Twitter’s net loss narrowed to $21 million, or 3 cents per share, from $103 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 10 cents per share.

Analysts expected a profit of 6 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Twitter cut expenses by 16 percent from a year earlier. Stock-based compensation declined 36 percent, but Twitter said the cuts were broad-based, covering sales and marketing and research and development.

Expenses would selectively increase moving forward, the company said.

Chief Operating Officer Anthony Noto told analysts that Twitter was still in the early stages of exploring a product around its TweetDeck interface.

“We’ve only done concept tests,” he said.

The company has stepped up efforts to keep people hooked through live-streaming deals, including for concerts, professional golf and news programs.

Twitter last month began testing tweets as long as 280 characters, double the existing cap, and has announced plans to toughen its rules on online sexual harassment.

The world’s biggest maker of semiconductors, televisions and smartphones replaced the leaders of its three main businesses, named CFO Lee Sang-hoon as the likely new board chairman, and said veteran co-CEOs J.K. Shin and Yoon Boo-keun would resign.

The shake-up at South Korea’s biggest company is designed to ease investors’ concerns about a leadership vacuum following the arrest and conviction of group scion Jay Y. Lee on bribery charges earlier this year.

“It’s a younger generation of leaders, but the divisional structure has not fundamentally changed,” said Park Ju-gun, head of research firm CEO Score.

The new appointees are all long-serving Samsung insiders whose elevations suggest continuity rather than any new direction at the $348 billion company.

Kim Ki-nam, 59, was appointed to lead the Device Solutions division which makes components including memory chips, the major driver of the firm’s record third-quarter profit of 14.5 trillion won ($12.91 billion).

Park Jung-hoon, a fund manager at HDC Asset Management which holds Samsung Electronics shares, said there had been “some concerns” that Kim would move to expand chip capacity and upset the currently favourable supply-demand balance.

“However, today’s (post-earnings call with analysts) said the chips business will focus on profitability, not market share - suggesting they will continue the current course without deviation, which put our minds to rest,” he told Reuters.

In other appointments, Samsung said Koh Dong-jin, 56, would head IT and Mobile Communications, and Kim Hyun-suk, 56, would lead Consumer Electronics. The changes were effective immediately.

DOUBLING DOWN

Samsung said it would double dividends next year to 9.6 trillion won and keep them at that level until 2020, as it responds to investor pressure to share its vast cash reserves and catch up with some of its more generous peers.

It also said 2017 capital expenditure would be its biggest ever, climbing 81 percent to 46.2 trillion won ($41 billion) as it builds new chip factories and clean-rooms to stay ahead of demand for servers and devices with ever greater memory.

Third-quarter operating profit nearly tripled from the same period a year earlier, matching Samsung’s earlier estimate. Revenue jumped 29.8 percent to 62 trillion won, also in line with its earlier estimate.

The shareholder return policy for the next three years ramped up guidance to a level higher than its current range of 30-50 percent of free cash flow to 50 percent over three years.

Samsung’s holdings of cash and cash equivalent stood at 76 trillion won at the end of September, eight percent higher than the previous quarter.

While the dividend policy builds on the investor-friendly trend Samsung started in 2015, it was not as generous as some investors had hoped, analysts said.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has paid nearly 22 cents for every dollar it earned over the past five years, while Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has shared 53 cents. Meanwhile Samsung has paid just 11 cents, according to Reuters data.

South Korean family-run business empires like Samsung Group have a reputation for low dividend payouts and other governance practices that favor controlling shareholders at the expense of ordinary investors.

Samsung shares closed up 1.9 percent, while the Kospi benchmark share price index .KS11 rose 0.9 percent. The stock has risen 71 percent over the past 12 months.

Samsung said the earnings outlook was positive with the chips market likely to “remain favourable” in 2018.

Foreign nationals were behind 5 percent of home purchases in Metro Vancouver in September, up from about 0.9 percent in August 2016, the month the 15 percent levy was enacted in response to offshore money flowing into the west coast city’s overheated housing market.

In the suburb of Richmond, home to Canada’s largest immigrant population, foreign buyers accounted for 10.8 percent of purchases in September, while in nearby Burnaby, foreign buyers were behind 9.6 percent of deals.

The numbers were still below those of July 2016, when more than 24 percent of home sales in both Burnaby and Richmond involved foreign nationals, as buyers scrambled to close to deals before the tax took effect.

British Columbia’s New Democratic government inherited the foreign buyer tax from the previous Liberal government, and Finance Minister Carole James has been reviewing the levy as part of a new strategy on housing affordability.

“I‘m concerned about the role of foreign speculation in B.C.’s housing market. ... All options are on the table as we look at the impact the tax has had on the housing market,” she said in a statement.

Sales of detached homes in the Vancouver area plunged sharply in the months after the foreign buyer tax was announced, with the market remaining tepid over the past year.

General Motors Co (GM.N) reported an overall sales drop of 2.2 percent for the month, with consumer sales down 6.6 percent. High-margin pickup truck, SUV and crossover sales were all up at the largest U.S. automaker.

GM reduced its inventory of unsold vehicles in the month by 7,000 vehicles to 813,000. The automaker has been whittling away at its large volume of unsold vehicles, a source of concern for the market. GM had advised that its inventory would rise in October.

“We are heading into the fourth quarter with good momentum, thanks to a strong U.S. economy and very strong pickup and crossover sales,” GM’s vice president for U.S. sales operations, Kurt McNeil, said in a statement.

GM slightly reduced consumer discounts as a percentage of the average transaction price, to 13.5 percent from 13.7 percent in the third quarter.

Industry experts believe consumer discounts in excess of 10 percent of the average transaction price are unhealthy for the market as they erode resale values and are unsustainable in the long term.

Industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC said last week that based on preliminary sales numbers including October, discounts have exceeded 10 percent in 15 of the last 16 months.

The U.S. auto industry is coming off a strong run that culminated in record sales of 17.55 million units in 2016. New sales got a strong lift in September as consumers replaced vehicles damaged in southeast Texas by Hurricane Harvey the previous month.

Full-year 2017 sales are still expected to be down slightly versus 2016.

Ford Motor Co (F.N) posted a 6.2 percent gain in vehicle sales in October, driven largely by a 15.9 percent jump in sales of its popular, high-priced F-Series line of pickups. Strong demand pushed the average price tag for an F-Series truck up $4,000 from the previous October to $47,300.

High-margin pickup trucks were a dominant factor in the better-than-expected results Ford posted last week.

On a conference call, Ford’s U.S. sales chief, Mark LaNeve, said the upgraded F-Series line “really has been a spectacular success” and said the market would remain “competitive” through the end of 2017 and into 2018.

Ford’s low-margin fleet sales rose 14.6 percent in October.

Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) said its sales rose 5.2 percent in October, as strong pickup truck and SUV sales offset a 12.7 drop in Toyota sedans and a 27.9 percent decrease in luxury Lexus sedans.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (FCHA.MI)(FCAU.N) reported a 13 percent sales decline. The automaker’s sales to consumers were down 4 percent, while fleet sales slid 43 percent, in line with the company’s strategy to reduce low-margin sales to car rental agencies.

The pact aims to eliminate tariffs on industrial and farm products across an 11-nation bloc whose trade totaled $356.3 billion last year.

This week’s compromise saves member nations from having to renegotiate the ambitious trade pact to accommodate the New Zealand government’s demands for firm measures to rein in housing prices.

It also brings member countries closer to an important victory in support of free trade to be finalised at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit next week in Vietnam’s central city of Danang.

“The momentum towards (an agreement) at the meeting in Danang has significantly increased,” said Japan’s chief TPP negotiator, Kazuyoshi Umemoto.

“The economic impact is certainly not small, but the even bigger message is this agreement can influence the global economic system and bring about peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific.”

Negotiators gathered for three days in Urayasu, east of the Japanese capital, to narrow down which terms of the original 12-nation deal to suspend, so as to salvage the pact at the Vietnam summit.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who was sworn in last week, has announced plans to ban foreign home purchases that should curb speculation without forcing TPP countries to renegotiate the pact.

Japan hopes the deal, which links 11 countries with a combined GDP of $12.4 trillion, can show other nations it can champion free trade in the absence of Washington’s influence.

It could also help Japan resist U.S. pressure for a two-way trade pact, which is likely to come up when President Donald Trump visits, from Sunday until Tuesday, for a summit with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

“A TPP agreement could damage the United States, so domestically people may start to realize that they can’t be left behind in free trade,” said Kensuke Yanagida, a research fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs.

A revelação de Bex Bailey, hoje com 25 anos, é a mais séria a emergir de uma onda de alegações de má conduta sexual de homens poderosos a assolar a política britânica na esteira do escândalo do produtor de cinema norte-americano Harvey Weinstein.

O líder trabalhista, Jeremy Corbyn, que ordenou uma investigação sobre a alegação, disse que Bex não recebeu apoio do partido quando relatou o que ocorreu.

“Bex Bailey mostrou uma coragem incrível ao falar publicamente sobre o que aconteceu com ela e tem meu total apoio e minha solidariedade”, disse em um comunicado publicado em sua página de Facebook.

“Não haverá tolerância no Partido Trabalhista com sexismo, assédio ou abuso. Custe o que custar, estamos absolutamente comprometidos a extirpá-los”.

Na terça-feira, Bex disse à rádio BBC que foi violentada por alguém que era seu superior no partido em 2011. Ela disse que tentou fingir que nada havia acontecido e que não o denunciou à polícia na ocasião.

“Estava assustada. Sentia vergonha. Sei que o Partido Trabalhista, como toda família, adora uma boa fofoca, e não queria que as pessoas soubessem, e também temi que não acreditassem em mim se falasse”, disse.

Dois anos depois ela contou o caso a um membro de alto escalão do partido, e ficou subentendido que ela não deveria relatar o ocorrido porque isso poderia prejudicá-la. Ela não recebeu nenhum conselho sobre o que deveria fazer em seguida.

“Essa pode ser a visão genuína, pode ser que esse fosse o caso, em cujo caso isso mostra que temos mesmo um problema sério na política com esta questão”, disse Bex, ex-membro do Comitê Executivo Nacional dos trabalhistas.

O governo uzbeque se manifestou depois que uma autoridade das forças de segurança dos EUA descreveu o suspeito como um imigrante nascido no Uzbequistão, um país predominantemente muçulmano da Ásia Central que foi parte da União Soviética.

O presidente uzbeque, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, fez a oferta de ajuda em uma carta de pêsames a Trump na qual repudiou o ataque “extremamente brutal” e disse que não pode haver justificativa para tamanha violência.

“De nosso lado, estamos prontos para usar todo nosso poder e recursos para cooperar na investigação deste ato terrorista”, escreveu Mirziyoyev na carta, que foi publicada no site do Ministério das Relações Exteriores de seu país. “Expressamos nossa solidariedade com o povo dos EUA”.

O ataque isolado mais letal contra nova-iorquinos desde o 11 de setembro de 2001, quando suicidas sequestraram dois aviões de passageiros e os lançaram contra o World Trade Center, é um desafio para Mirziyoyev, que tomou posse no final de 2016 e está tentando abrir sua nação lentamente depois de décadas de governos autoritários.

U.S. police declined to publicly identify the suspect, but a source familiar with the investigation said his name was Sayfullo Saipov, 29.

He had emigrated to the United States in 2010, U.S. media reported. CNN said he had left a note saying he carried out the attack in the name of Islamic State and had shouted “Allahu Akbar” - Arabic for “God is greatest” - after the violence.

""He became religious on the spur of the moment,"" Mirrakhmat Muminov, a truck driver and Uzbek community activist who lives in Stow, Ohio, told Reuters by phone. (Graphics on 'New York truck attack' - here%20YORK-SHOOTING/010051HK3E6/NEWYORK.jpg)

He said Saipov had previously lived in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan.

“He started studying religion in the United States,” said Muminov, adding that Saipov “couldn’t get enough” of the religious freedoms enjoyed in the United States after living in the strict confines of Uzbekistan.

In Uzbekistan, an authoritarian, predominantly Muslim country in Central Asia ruled by Moscow until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the practice of Islam is tightly controlled by a government wary of radicalism.

Tuesday’s attack shines an uncomfortable light on Islamist militancy in Central Asia which has supplied Islamic State in Syria and Iraq with thousands of fighters. If the attacker’s identity is confirmed, it would be at least the fourth deadly attack by an Uzbek national or ethnic Uzbek this year.

Muminov said Saipov had lived in Stow two or three years ago, that they had met through the local Uzbek community, and that Saipov had also worked there as a truck driver.

‘AGGRESSIVE LONER’

Slideshow (26 Images)

Muminov said he had heard about the attack from members of the local Uzbek community, some of whom he said were getting ready to be questioned by the authorities.

He said he had no first-hand information about whether Saipov had carried out the attack and painted a picture of a man who was struggling to make it in the United States, had few friends, and poor communication and English language skills.

”He was withdrawn, nervous, sometimes aggressive. Because of that he was lonely, he lived in his own world. He was not very popular,” said Muminov. He said Saipov’s English was poor and he did not speak Russian very well. Muminov said he had last spoken to Saipov about two months ago.

In a letter of condolence to President Donald Trump on Wednesday, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said Uzbekistan was ready to use “all its resources” to help investigate the New York attack.

It was the bloodiest single attack on New Yorkers since the Sept. 11, 2001, suicide hijackings of jetliners steered into the World Trade Center. It poses a challenge for Mirziyoyev, who assumed office at the end of 2016 and is trying to slowly open up his country after decades of authoritarian rule.

On New Year’s day, an Uzbek gunman burst into a nightclub in the Turkish city of Istanbul and killed 39 people.

The FSB, which coordinates financial regulation across the Group of 20 Economies (G20), said in its first report on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning that the risks they pose need monitoring.

AI and machine learning refer to technology that is replacing traditional methods to assess the creditworthiness of customers, to crunch data, price insurance contracts and spot profitable trades across markets.

There are no international regulatory standards for AI and machine learning, but the FSB left open whether new rules are needed.

Data on rapidly growing usage of AI is largely unavailable, leaving regulators unsure about the impact of potentially new and unexpected links between markets and banks, the report said.

AI could, for example, lead to “non-sustainable” increases in credit by automating credit scoring.

While AI shows substantial promise if risks are properly managed, it could create too much dependency among banks and insurers on the few specialist businesses that provide AI technology.

Expected rapid growth in AI also raises the prospect of outside technology players expanding their influence over the finance sector.

“This could in turn lead to the emergence of new systemically important players that could fall outside the regulatory perimeter,” the FSB said.

If a major AI provider went bust, it could lead to operational disruptions at a large number of financial firms at the same time, especially if used in “mission critical” applications, the report said.

Regulators could also find it difficult to identify who has made key financial decisions that go wrong.

“If AI and machine learning-based decisions cause losses to financial intermediaries across the financial system, there may be a lack of clarity around responsibility,” the report said.

REVOLUTION

The pace of technological advance will also make it harder to fashion durable rules for AI activity that some academics expect to revolutionize the financial sector.

The report said that RegTech investment, or use of machines to comply with a welter of new regulations introduced to tackle money laundering and make banks safer, could reach $6.45 billion by 2020.

Consultancy Accenture said in May that three quarters of bankers surveyed believed that AI will become the primary way banks interact with customers within the next three years.

European insurers invested $400 million in “InsurTech” or real-time technology to help to reduce payouts.

Nordea (NDA.ST), the Nordic region’s biggest bank, said last month that automation would help it to shed at least 4,000 staff. It has already introduced an AI chatbox to answer common customer questions.

Dutch bank ING (INGA.AS) wants to increase the number of traders using AI.

Fund managers are also using outside specialists to obtain machine-learning tools that sift through news and research for insight into market trends.

So-called “quant” funds use AI to manage $1 trillion in assets. Though that is only a fraction of the $40 trillion in mutual funds globally, the FSB said industry estimates suggest that could grow rapidly.

The regulators themselves are also using AI to make it easier to detect fraud and money laundering, while central banks expect to use AI for real-time predictions using big data to help to determine monetary policy, the report said.

The FSB acknowledged that AI is helping the financial sector to cut costs, improve profitability and widen choice for customers, but added that it also raises concerns over privacy of data used in AI applications.","Rise of the machines must be monitored, say global finance regulators",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-regulation-banks-artificialintelligen/rise-of-the-machines-must-be-monitored-say-global-finance-regulators-idUSKBN1D1534

“It’s not rocket science perhaps, but for a long time, Sony seemed to have forgotten this magic formula.”","TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares in Sony Corp (6758.T) soared to a nine-year high on Wednesday after it forecast record earnings that have vindicated its restructuring efforts and raised expectations of sustained momentum in profitability.

Under Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai, the tech and entertainment giant has streamlined unprofitable electronics businesses and capitalized on the spread of smartphones with its image sensors.

Citing robust sales of image sensors as well as high-end TVs, Sony hiked its full-year operating profit outlook to 630 billion yen ($5.5 billion), up 26 percent from an earlier forecast and 7.5 percent higher than an average analyst estimate.

“Image sensors will be used in a wide range of areas, and the market is very large,” said Masayuki Otani, chief market analyst at Securities Japan Inc.

“Profitability is increasing, and in the mid- to long-term we expect the stock price to reach its 2007 level of 7,190 yen.”

Sony’s stock rose as much as 12.4 percent to its highest level since June 2008, becoming the most traded firm by turnover on Tokyo’s main board. It finished up 11.4 percent at 4,918 yen, giving it a market capitalization of around $54.6 billion.

Sony Corp's logo is seen at its news conference in Tokyo, Japan November 1, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon

The new forecast is 20 percent above its current profit record, set two decades ago when strong sales of consumer electronics dovetailed with the popularity of its first PlayStation games console and its “Men in Black” box-office hit.

To develop new profit drivers, the firm has also boosted investment in artificial intelligence and is expanding its consumer products portfolio.

It unveiled its Xperia Hello! voice-activated communication robot this month and on Wednesday said it was reviving its robotic dog AIBO that went on sale in 1999. It also aims to lead the budding virtual-reality market by drawing on the content portion of its business such as music and film.

Combined with resurgent demand for consumer audio products sparked by the rise of streaming services from Spotify to Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) Apple Music, the focus on cutting-edge technology augurs well for future profits, said Macquarie analyst Damian Thong.

“They should also push into 3D sensors which will be useful for augmented reality and the applications that surround that.”

“Great products, plus great brand, delivering great profitability,” he added. “It’s not rocket science perhaps, but for a long time, Sony seemed to have forgotten this magic formula.”",Record profit forecast for a resurgent Sony sends shares to nine-year high,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-sony-stocks/record-profit-forecast-for-a-resurgent-sony-sends-shares-to-nine-year-high-idUKKBN1D139I?il=0

The players exchanged early breaks in the final set but Rybarikova clinched the decisive lead in the tiebreak, before sealing the victory on her seventh match point.

“I am happy that I went through this match because conditions were tough and I had some problems with my leg,” Rybarikova said after the match.

“I was saying to myself that I had to win this match because I had so many match points and it would be really cruel to end the season like this.”

Rybarikova improved her record in the Azalea Group to 1-1 after dropping her first match to Julia Goerges on Tuesday.

Mladenovic will now have to beat Goerges in their match later in the week to have any chances to reach the final four.

Herbalife has been buying back shares and its stock price has soared some 50 percent this year, piling pressure on Ackman’s $10 billion hedge fund as paper losses mounted and the cost to borrow the shares rose.

Ackman did not disclose how much his firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, had lost by buying shares to cover its short position.

“We covered the shorts and replaced them with outright put positions,” Ackman told Reuters, adding that potential losses on Herbalife will now be capped at 3 percent of the firm’s capital. “We can still lose money but the loss is capped.”

Short positions, in which borrowed shares are sold in hopes they can be replaced later at a lower price, have the potential for heavy losses that increase as a stock’s price rises. Put options give the holder the option to sell a stock at a set price.

Herbalife’s stock price has rose in part by its decision to buy back a big chunk of its shares, a move many in the market interpreted as trying to pressure Ackman into giving up on his years-long crusade against the company.

Herbalife stock dipped 0.1 percent to $72.56 on Wednesday.

Pershing Square International, the firm’s hedge fund portfolio, nursed small losses for the year through the middle of October after logging double-digit losses in 2015 and 2016.

President Donald Trump, who has interviewed Yellen, Fed Governor Jerome Powell and three others for the top Fed job, is likely to announce the nomination on Thursday.

Powell, a soft-spoken centrist who has supported Yellen’s gradual approach to raising rates, is seen as having a lock on the position.

“The bottom line is the meeting is probably going to be a somewhat boring event for markets, overshadowed by the expected Fed chair decision,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank.

INFLATION WORRIES

Fed policymakers have been buoyed in recent months by a strengthening U.S. economy and further tightening in the labor market, although inflation has continued to remain below the central bank’s 2 percent target.

The economy unexpectedly maintained a brisk pace of growth in the third quarter, increasing at a 3.0 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department reported last week.

A decline in hiring in September also has largely been dismissed as a blip caused by the temporary displacement of workers due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. That jobs report also showed wages growing at an encouraging pace and the unemployment rate falling to more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent.

A strong rebound in job gains is anticipated when the Labor Department releases its October nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.

Inflation is the main concern for Fed policymakers who are wondering about the causes and duration of the current weakness. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation sits at 1.3 percent after retreating further from target for much of the year.

Nevertheless, Yellen and other key policymakers have said the Fed, which unveiled a plan this year to cut its balance sheet starting in October, still expects to continue to gradually raise rates given the economy’s strength. That is not expected to change on Wednesday.

“If we get what we expect to get, which is basically more of the same of what we saw in the September statement,” said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo, “then yes, their gradual policy tightening plan is in place and all signs point to a December hike.”",Fed set to hold rates steady ahead of Trump's leadership decision,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed/fed-set-to-hold-rates-steady-ahead-of-trumps-leadership-decision-idUKKBN1D13JT

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Flown in from Athens following a handover ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium, which hosted the first modern Games in 1896, the flame arrives at a time of heightened tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.

South Korea’s top priority is to deliver a “safe and secure” Olympics but there is little doubt international confidence in the Games has been undermined by the threats and insults exchanged by U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un in recent months.

In October, France’s sports minister raised the possibility of a boycott if the crisis deepened, while Seoul has been moved to reassure top foreign diplomats that the Games, taking place just 80 km (50 miles) from the world’s most-heavily armed border, will be safe.

Despite the long shadow of security concerns cast over the Games, the message on Wednesday was one of peace and hope. Of the power of sport to overcome division, and, as the torch relay slogan goes -- to “Let everyone shine”.

South Korean sports minister Do Jong-hwan and 2010 Vancouver Games figure skating champion Kim Yuna carried the flame in a special lantern as they gingerly stepped off a Korean Air flight at Incheon airport on Wednesday.

Organising chief Lee Hee-beom described the arrival of the flame as “a very significant moment” in Korea’s history and promised athletes and visitors they would have “the time of their lives” during the Feb. 9-25 Games.

“The wait is over for South Korea. We are now 100 days to the Olympic Games,” he said at a ceremony.

“The Olympic Games and the Olympic flame are symbols of hope and peace. The Games have the power to bring the world together.”

Figure skater Kim and Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon then lit a cauldron with the Olympic flame, which was last seen in South Korea almost 30 years ago during the 1988 Seoul Summer Games, signalling the start of the torch relay.

Robots, cable cars, steam locomotives and zip wires are some of the methods of transportation that will take the torch along its 2,018 km route through nine provinces and eight major cities before arriving in Pyeongchang, some 180 km east of Seoul.

The first of 7,500 torchbearers was local figure skater You Young, the 13-year-old who Koreans hope will one day emulate former champion Kim.

“It is my dream to represent my country at an Olympic Winter Games and I am working hard to make that dream a reality very soon,” said You, who became the country’s youngest national champion aged 11.

“I’ll remember this day forever.”

Kim retired after winning silver at the 2014 Sochi Olympics and her absence from the competition in Pyeongchang is one of the reasons being cited for lacklustre ticket sales.

But Kim may yet have a major part to play at the Games as she is widely tipped to be the final torchbearer who lights the Olympic cauldron on Feb. 9.

The Games will feature approximately 3,000 athletes from 95 NOCs, though there has been no confirmation whether North Korea plan to take part.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is eager to have North Korean athletes at the Games, though only figure skaters Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik have met the qualifying standard.

They may be even slower to close that gap if the laudable push for transparency is not backed up by the threat of eventual sanctions.

A City worker rests in the sun in London's Exchange Square March 13, 2007. REUTERS/Alessia Pierdomenico

The government in April gave organisations with at least 250 employees one year to disclose their gender wage gap. By mid-October, less than six months before the deadline, only 2 percent had done so. Extrapolating from such a small sample is difficult but it’s already clear that organisations where women both earn more than men on average and are overrepresented in the top pay quartile are rare. Yellow Dot, which runs nurseries, and The Commission for Equality and Human Rights are among the exceptions.

That tallies with statistics for the whole economy from the national statistics office, which show that men are on average paid nearly a fifth more than women even though the differential is at its narrowest on record. Women are more likely to be employed in low-paid sectors and rack up fewer hours at work. But even stripping out part-time work, the median hourly gap between male and female pay is 9.4 percent.

The idea is that transparency at company level will give women leverage to fight pay inequality. But Austria’s experience suggests otherwise. Its wage gap – one of the highest in Europe – has dropped just 2 percentage points to 21.7 percent since similar rules were introduced six years ago. First, it’s primarily highly-educated women seeking out the data. Second, few companies are doing much about their findings.

Granted, the British data will be published online rather than being held by internal work councils as in Austria. Media scrutiny and competition for the best talent might nudge companies to change. For example, an accounting graduate can now see that PwC offers higher mean wages and bonuses to female employees than rival Deloitte and promotes more women to top posts.

But closing the gender pay gap will also require changes to corporate cultures where men are more likely than women to climb the greasy pole. Governments are becoming more interventionist when companies pollute the environment or fail to pay enough taxes. Pay gaps may be another issue which may be fixed quickest by using sticks rather than carrots.",Breakingviews - UK gender pay equality drive is too easy to skirt,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-pay-breakingviews/breakingviews-uk-gender-pay-equality-drive-is-too-easy-to-skirt-idUSKBN1CZ1WL

The announcement comes a day after Sony confirmed its renaissance by forecasting its highest-ever profit this financial year, sending its shares surging to a nine-year high.

AIBO is billed as a pet that behaves like a real dog using artificial intelligence (AI) to learn and interact with its owner and surroundings. The upgrade sees AIBO equipped with new sensing and movement technologies as well as far more advanced AI backed by cloud computing to develop the dog’s personality.

Sales begin in Japan in January for 198,000 yen ($1,739).

Sony pioneered entertainment robots with AIBO in 1999. It sold about 150,000 dogs in Japan before ceasing production seven years later when its core consumer electronics business struggled in price wars with emerging Asian rivals.

“It was a difficult decision to stop the project in 2006, but we continued development in AI and robotics,” Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai said at a news briefing.

“I asked our engineers a year and a half ago to develop (new) AIBO because I strongly believe robots capable of building loving relationships with people help realize Sony’s mission (to inspire).”

The reborn AIBO features new actuator technology allowing it move more smoothly and naturally like a real dog. With sensing and AI technologies, AIBO can run toward its owner and detect smiles and words of praise, and can remember what actions please the owner. Its eyes are made of organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays making it capable of diverse expressions.

Sony said it aims to sell at least as many new AIBO as the original, without giving a time frame. It also said it is considering overseas sales.

The firm sees AI as a future pillar of growth, hoping to catch up with major technology companies such as Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google.

It invested an undisclosed sum last year in Cogitai, a U.S. AI start-up focusing on technology that allows machines to learn continually and autonomously from interaction in the real world.

Transport is among the policy areas being thrashed out in talks taking place between Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens, who are aiming to form a coalition by Christmas.

The parties are discussing all policy areas before launching detailed negotiations. While the atmosphere has improved in recent days, there have been few actual deals, with immigration and climate change among the biggest sticking points.

The Greens’ demand on carmakers would go further than software fixes so far agreed between politicians and German car bosses to help repair the industry’s badly damaged reputation.

The future of Germany’s mighty car industry, the country’s biggest exporter and provider of some 800,000 jobs, is a tricky area as it tries to recover from the diesel emissions testing scandal which broke at Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) two years ago.

Despite public concern and planned diesel bans in countries including France and Britain in coming decades, German lawmakers have not yet dared ask the same of its carmakers, such as BMW, VW, Daimler and Porsche who have invested heavily in diesel.

In August, politicians and car bosses agreed to overhaul engine software on 5.3 million diesel cars to cut pollution and avoid bans on polluting vehicles but they stopped short of committing to more expensive hardware modifications.

That may have to change if the Greens share power.

“We won’t meet our targets of getting cleaner air in city centers with software upgrades alone,” Cem Ozdemir, a leader of the Greens, said as he headed into the talks.

“There must also be hardware solutions.”

Ozdemir said the auto industry was going through the biggest transformation process in its history and the car had to be reinvented to make it emission-free and more automated. Public transport must also be expanded, he added.

Reuters analysis of federal jobs data shows that out of 656,000 new manufacturing jobs created between 2010 and 2014, two thirds can be attributed to foreign direct investment.

More recent jobs numbers are not yet available, but over $700 billion in foreign capital has poured in over the last two years bringing total foreign investment to $3.7 trillion at the end of 2016, a world record.

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said King, an American, was suffering from “dangerous” heart disease and kidney problems.

“His illness has intensified, his feet have swollen and sometimes he becomes unconscious and his condition worsens every day,” Mujahid said in a statement.

“We have tried to treat him time to time but we do not have medical facilities as we are in a war situation,” he said.

The U.S. State Department called for the immediate and unconditional release of King and other hostages.

King and his Australian colleague Timothy Weeks were kidnapped in August 2016 as they were returning to their compound in the Afghan capital.

Afghan and Western officials believe the men are being held by the Haqqani network, a militant group affiliated with the Taliban that has carried out many other kidnappings. They acknowledge that an unsuccessful rescue attempt was made in eastern Afghanistan months after the two were taken.

The Taliban statement came around two weeks after Pakistani troops rescued Canadian Joshua Boyle and his American wife Caitlan Coleman from an area near the Afghan border. They had been held by the Haqqanis since being kidnapped in 2012.

“We aren’t satisfied with our top-line growth and we are addressing these issues by controlling everything that is within our control,” CEO Jim Smith told analysts on an earnings call.

Although earnings-per-share beat estimates in part due to cost controls, the revenue miss pushed shares down 6.5 percent to $43.81 on the New York Stock Exchange; they were at C$56.59 in Toronto.

The results highlight the need for Thomson Reuters to find ways to generate revenue outside of managing costs, said Doug Arthur, an analyst at Huber Research Partners.

“People understand the company is doing a great job on costs,” Arthur said. “But there has been a lot of anticipation that revenues are going to hit an inflection point, and it’s just not happening.”

In its Financial & Risk segment, the company’s biggest, sales outpaced cancellations, a key indicator of future growth. Overall revenue for the unit was up slightly, but was down one percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa.

Specifically, British and European financial services clients are concerned about upcoming EU securities rules, set to take effect in January, as well as Brexit, Smith said.

”The quarter was the tale of two cities, or more like the tale of two continents,“ as the company saw unexpected softness in the UK and Europe and strength in the Americas,” Smith told Reuters. “We heard from the market, that was largely because of upcoming regulatory changes.”

Thomson Reuters still expects year-over-year growth in its financial business in 2017 and 2018, but the extent of the improvement will depend on fourth-quarter net sales, executives said on the call.

The company sees a stronger pipeline of deals for its Financial & Risk unit, Smith said.

The news and information company said full-year profits will be at the high end of its earlier forecast.

Third-quarter net earnings rose to $348 million, or 46 cents per share, from $286 million, or 36 cents per share, a year ago.

Adjusted for special items, earnings were 68 cents per share.

Total revenue grew 1 percent excluding currency to $2.79 billion. Sales in its legal business rose 1 percent to $843 million.

A timely oversight just as recycling was catching on SOUNDBITE (English) ANNE MARIE THEILEN, FOUNDER OF SCRAP SAYING: ""Truly the essential part of Scrap is creativity, not only with children but with adults. We want parents to be involved in the schools, we want teachers to have the supplies to do their work but mainly artists are the real problem introducing art into the classroom because if they had no supplies they were not really welcomed by the teachers. They had to come with their baggage. So this was very fortunate because it was at a time that this country was beginning to believe in recycling, re-using. So it was just a perfect time, so we had a lot of supplies donated to us, trucks of supplies."" SCRAP now calls itself America's oldest creative re-use centre - and the inspiration for hundreds of others like it around the world. Selling to artists and the public - and ten times a year, giving to teachers whatever they need free of charge. SOUNDBITE (English) EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SCRAP, BEN DELANEY, SAYING: ""We have goals to divert more materials all the time. We're averaging about 250 tonnes a year of material diverted. That's equivalent in weight to about 25 empty school buses every year. So that much material doesn't go to landfill, we don't have the pollution from the trucks, we don't have the pollution from shipping and re-manufacturing."" Materials are also used to run free workshops designed to inspire sustainable creativity SOUNDBITE (English) EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SCRAP, BEN DELANEY, SAYING: ""There is illusions that we have this planet forever. I think we are here for a short time. I think we definitely are going to disintegrate eventually. We have misused a lot of our resources. It's not only the forest and trees but it's people. We are misusing people. We are not educating people to a point where they understand how environmental issues evolve constantly and our planet is in great difficulty. It's known, we don't want to recognise it however.""

Using the so-called “New York channel,” Joseph Yun, U.S. negotiator with North Korea, has been in contact with diplomats at Pyongyang’s United Nations mission, the official said, at a time when an exchange of bellicose insults between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has fueled fears of military conflict.

While U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Oct. 17 said he would continue “diplomatic efforts ... until the first bomb drops,” the official’s comments were the clearest sign the United States was directly discussing issues beyond the release of American prisoners, despite Trump having dismissed direct talks as pointless.

There is no sign, however, that the behind-the-scenes communications have improved a relationship vexed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, the death of U.S. university student Otto Warmbier days after his release by Pyongyang in June and the detention of three other Americans.

Word of quiet engagement with Pyongyang comes despite Trump’s comments, North Korea’s weapons advances and suggestions by some U.S. and South Korean officials that Yun’s interactions with North Koreans had been reined in.

“It has not been limited at all, both (in) frequency and substance,” said the senior State Department official.

Among the points that Yun has made to his North Korean interlocutors is to “stop testing” nuclear bombs and missiles, the official said.

North Korea this year conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear detonation and has test-fired a volley of missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that, if perfected, could in theory reach the United States mainland.

The possibility that Pyongyang may be closer to attaching a nuclear warhead to an ICBM has alarmed the Trump administration, which in April unveiled a policy of “maximum pressure and engagement” that has so far failed to deter North Korea.

At the start of Trump’s presidency, Yun’s instructions were limited to seeking the release of U.S. prisoners.

“It is (now) a broader mandate than that,” said the State Department official, declining, however, to address whether authority had been given to discuss North Korea’s nuclear and missile program.

In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China welcomed any dialogue between the United States and North Korea.

“We encourage North Korea and the United States to carry out engagement and dialogue,” Hua told reporters, adding that she hoped talks could help return the issue to a diplomatic track for resolution.

SANCTIONS AND ENGAGEMENT

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has urged all United Nations members to fully and transparently implement sanctions against North Korea, which he said has emerged as a global threat.

Speaking at the United Nations on Sept. 19, Trump vowed to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened the United States or its allies, raising anxieties about the possibility of military conflict.

Twelve days later, after Tillerson said Washington was probing for a diplomatic opening, Trump said on Twitter that his chief diplomat was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man” - his mocking nickname for the North Korean leader.

Democratic U.S. senators introduced a bill on Tuesday they said would prevent Trump from launching a nuclear first strike on North Korea on his own, highlighting the issue days before the Republican’s first presidential trip to Asia.

A high-ranking North Korean defector said in Washington on Tuesday that he backed the Trump administration’s policy of pressuring Pyongyang through sanctions, coupled with “maximum engagement” with the leadership and increased efforts to get information into North Korea to educate its people.

“I strongly believe in the use of soft power before taking any military actions,” Thae Yong Ho, chief of mission at Pyongyang’s embassy in London until he defected in 2016, told the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

The New York channel is one of the few conduits the United States has for communicating with North Korea, which has itself made clear it has little interest in serious talks before it develops a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the continental United States.

The last high-level contact between Yun and the North Koreans was when he traveled to North Korea in June to secure the release of Warmbier, who died shortly after he returned home in a coma, the State Department official said.

The Trump administration has demanded North Korea release three other U.S. citizens: missionary Kim Dong Chul and academics Tony Kim and Kim Hak Song.

Warmbier’s death was a factor in the chilling of U.S.-North Korean contacts around that time but the biggest impact came from Pyongyang’s stepped-up testing, the official said.

The official said, however, that “the preferred endpoint is not a war but some kind of diplomatic settlement” and suggestions that Washington is setting up a binary choice for Pyongyang to capitulate diplomatically or military action were “misleading.”

Diplomacy, the official said, “has a lot more room to go.”

A senior Bangladesh home ministry official described the accusation as outrageous.

More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled predominantly Buddhist Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh since late August to escape violence that accompanied a brutal military counter-insurgency operation after Rohingya militant attacks on security posts in Myanmar’s Rakhine State.

Stung by international criticism and accusations of ethnic cleansing, Myanmar’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has said Rohingya refugees who can prove they were resident will be accepted back.

But for now, the flow of people is one-way, with Rohingya still preferring to risk being destitute in Bangladesh rather than stay in Myanmar in fear of their lives.

Zaw Htay, a spokesman for Suu Kyi, said Myanmar was ready to begin the repatriation process any time, based along the lines of an agreement with Bangladesh that covered returns of Rohingya to Myanmar in the early 1990s.

He said Bangladesh had yet to accept those terms.

“We are ready to start, but the other side did not accept yet, and the process was delayed. This is the number one fact,” Zaw Htay, Director-General of the Ministry of the State Counsellor’s Office, told journalists on Tuesday.

A memorandum of understanding on border liaison posts was signed with Bangladesh Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan following talks in the Myanmar capital, Naypyitaw, last week, but there was no progress on reviving the old agreement.

Zaw Htay linked the delay by Bangladesh to the money raised so far by the international community to help build gigantic refugee camps for the Rohingya.

“Currently they have got $400 million. Over their receipt of this amount, we are now afraid of delaying the program of deporting the refugees,” he said in comments carried in a front-page article in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper on Wednesday.

“They have got international subsidies. We are now afraid they would have another consideration as to repatriation,” he said.

“Their claim is outrageous. We are stunned,” the official told Reuters in Dhaka. “How can they say this when everyone knows who are making the delay?”

The Bangladesh government issued a statement last Thursday saying that Myanmar had not agreed to 10 points put forward by its minister at last week’s talks, including the full implementation of the recommendations of an Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, chaired by former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, for a sustainable return of Rohingya.

Khan told Bangladesh media last Friday that the two sides were unable to form a joint working group but said it should be set up by the time Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali goes to Myanmar for further talks on Nov. 30.

HAUNTED BY DEATH, INSECURITY

The United Nation’s new interim resident coordinator for Myanmar began his new job on Wednesday. Knut Ostby, a Norwegian, has stepped into the key humanitarian and diplomatic role at a time of growing strains with the Myanmar government over the handling of the Rohingya crisis.

Meantime, while Myanmar and Bangladesh work out how Rohingya can eventually go home, the grim exodus from Myanmar continues.

Seven Rohingya, including three babies and two children, drowned making the perilous sea crossing up the coast from Myanmar to Bangladesh earlier this week.

Given the horrors endured by many Rohingya now living in refugee camps it would be unsurprising if they were in no hurry to return to their old home.

U.N. investigators interviewing Rohingya living in refugee camps in Bangladesh said on Friday they had gathered testimony pointing to a “consistent, methodical pattern” of killings, torture, rape and arson.

A worry for Myanmar as it prepares to scrutinize any returnees is the risk of Islamist militants sneaking into the country, as several groups, including al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), have called for a jihad to fight for the Rohingya.

The FSB, which coordinates financial regulation across the Group of 20 Economies (G20), said in its first report on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning that the risks they pose need monitoring.

AI and machine learning refer to technology that is replacing traditional methods to assess the creditworthiness of customers, to crunch data, price insurance contracts and spot profitable trades across markets.

There are no international regulatory standards for AI and machine learning, but the FSB left open whether new rules are needed.

Data on rapidly growing usage of AI is largely unavailable, leaving regulators unsure about the impact of potentially new and unexpected links between markets and banks, the report said.

AI could, for example, lead to “non-sustainable” increases in credit by automating credit scoring.

While AI shows substantial promise if risks are properly managed, it could create too much dependency among banks and insurers on the few specialist businesses that provide AI technology.

Expected rapid growth in AI also raises the prospect of outside technology players expanding their influence over the finance sector.

“This could in turn lead to the emergence of new systemically important players that could fall outside the regulatory perimeter,” the FSB said.

If a major AI provider went bust, it could lead to operational disruptions at a large number of financial firms at the same time, especially if used in “mission critical” applications, the report said.

Regulators could also find it difficult to identify who has made key financial decisions that go wrong.

“If AI and machine learning-based decisions cause losses to financial intermediaries across the financial system, there may be a lack of clarity around responsibility,” the report said.

REVOLUTION

The pace of technological advance will also make it harder to fashion durable rules for AI activity that some academics expect to revolutionize the financial sector.

The report said that RegTech investment, or use of machines to comply with a welter of new regulations introduced to tackle money laundering and make banks safer, could reach $6.45 billion by 2020.

Consultancy Accenture said in May that three quarters of bankers surveyed believed that AI will become the primary way banks interact with customers within the next three years.

European insurers invested $400 million in “InsurTech” or real-time technology to help to reduce payouts.

Nordea (NDA.ST), the Nordic region’s biggest bank, said last month that automation would help it to shed at least 4,000 staff. It has already introduced an AI chatbox to answer common customer questions.

Dutch bank ING (INGA.AS) wants to increase the number of traders using AI.

Fund managers are also using outside specialists to obtain machine-learning tools that sift through news and research for insight into market trends.

So-called “quant” funds use AI to manage $1 trillion in assets. Though that is only a fraction of the $40 trillion in mutual funds globally, the FSB said industry estimates suggest that could grow rapidly.

The regulators themselves are also using AI to make it easier to detect fraud and money laundering, while central banks expect to use AI for real-time predictions using big data to help to determine monetary policy, the report said.

The FSB acknowledged that AI is helping the financial sector to cut costs, improve profitability and widen choice for customers, but added that it also raises concerns over privacy of data used in AI applications.","Rise of the machines must be monitored, say global finance regulators",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-regulation-banks-artificialintelligen/rise-of-the-machines-must-be-monitored-say-global-finance-regulators-idUKKBN1D152L?il=0

Used by the military for monitoring and imagery, drones have become popular worldwide in recent years, with people posting breath-taking videos on social media and e-commerce companies looking to use them for deliveries.

In India, however, it is illegal for the general public to fly drones without the approval of government authorities, because of concern over the safety of other users of airspace and people on the ground.

Users of drones weighing more than two kilograms will need a security clearance, operating permit, unique identification number and a remote pilot licence, according to the draft regulations.

Drones have several commercial uses, such as in agriculture and mining, said Jayant Sinha, junior minister for civil aviation, adding that the policies were expected to encourage the drone industry.

The ministry has asked for public comments within 30 days, after which the regulations will be finalised. The policy is expected to come out by the end of the year.

The use of drones would be banned within a certain distance from airports, the country’s borders and some areas excluded by the home ministry. Violators would be charged under provisions of the Indian penal code, according to the proposed rules.

Once the regulations are finalised, e-commerce companies would be allowed to use drones to deliver goods, said civil aviation secretary RN Choubey, adding that the government was working on technologies to curb the use of rogue drones.

Jason Kenney, a former federal cabinet minister, was elected with 61.1 percent of the vote, the United Conservative Party announced at an event in Alberta’s largest city of Calgary.

Kenney will head a party formed this year from the Progressive Conservative and Wildrose parties. It presents a serious challenge in the 2019 provincial election to the incumbent left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP), which took power in 2015 helped partly by a divided right.

Alberta, where the Conservatives held power for 40 years before being ousted in a shock election by the NDP, is home to Canada’s vast oil sands and is the largest exporter of crude to the United States. But it has been struggling with a three-year slump in global oil prices and a C$10.3 billion ($8.24 billion) deficit.

Kenney has been eager to develop policies aimed at cutting costs for the oil and gas sector and is likely to be welcomed by the energy industry.

Ein Polizeisprecher sagte dazu lediglich, die Äußerungen des Mannes beim Verlassen des Fahrzeugs und die gesamten Umstände passten zu einem “Terror-Anschlag”.

Der Mann habe wohl allein gehandelt, sagte der Gouverneur des Bundesstaates New York, Andrew Cuomo. Es gebe keine Hinweise darauf, dass es sich um eine breiter angelegte Tat handele. Sollte sich der Verdacht bestätigen, wäre es der schwerste islamistische Anschlag in New York seit dem Flugzeug-Attentat auf das World Trade Center, bei dem am 11. September 2001 mehr als 2600 Menschen getötet wurden.

Die Tat trägt die Handschrift ähnlicher Anschläge, die Islamisten in diesem und im vergangenen Jahr in Europa verübt hatten, etwa in Nizza, Berlin und Barcelona. Die Extremisten-Miliz Islamischer Staat (IS) hatte diese Taten für sich reklamiert.

TRUMP WILL EINREISEKONTROLLEN VERSCHÄRFEN

Der New Yorker Bürgermeister Bill de Blasio sprach von einem “feigen Akt des Terrors”. Trump erklärte über Twitter: “Wir dürfen es nicht zulassen, dass der IS zurückkehrt oder in unser Land gelangt, nachdem wir ihn im Nahen Osten und anderswo besiegt haben. Es reicht.” Er habe das Heimatschutzministerium angewiesen, die Sicherheitskontrollen bei der Einreise zu verschärfen. “Politisch korrekt zu sein, ist gut, aber nicht dafür”, twitterte er. Trump versucht seit Monaten unter Verweis auf Sicherheitsgründe ein umstrittenes Einreiseverbot für Menschen aus mehreren muslimischen Ländern durchzusetzen. In einer offiziellen Mitteilung sprach er später den Opfern und deren Angehörigen sein Mitgefühl aus und dankte den Sicherheits- und Rettungskräften. Unter den Toten waren auch fünf Mitglieder einer Reisegruppe aus Argentinien.

Der Polizei zufolge hatte der Täter den Pickup bei einem Baumarkt gemietet. Er sei dann am Nachmittag mit hoher Geschwindigkeit etwa 20 Straßenblocks weit über einen Radweg gerast, der parallel zu einem Highway in der Nähe des Hudson River verläuft. Dabei habe der Wagen zahlreiche Passanten erfasst. TV-Bilder zeigten mehrere beschädigte und überfahrene Fahrräder. Das Fahrzeug stieß letztlich mit einem Schulbus zusammen. Dabei wurden zwei Kinder und zwei Erwachsene verletzt. Anschließend sei der Fahrer offenbar bewaffnet aus dem Wagen gestiegen, teilte die Polizei mit. Daraufhin sei auf ihn geschossen worden. Der Mann sei im Bauch getroffen worden. Er habe ein Luftgewehr und eine Paintball-Waffe getragen. Der Feuerwehr zufolge wurden elf Schwerverletzte in Krankenhäuser gebracht. Von ihnen sei aber niemand in Lebensgefahr.

Wall Street analysts scrambled to raise their price targets, with the most bullish pegging the companies’ stocks to rise between 21 percent and 47 percent in the next 12 months.

Google is “looking 20 years young,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak, who bumped up his price target on the stock by 9 percent to $1,150.

Amazon’s (AMZN.O) shares rose as much as 9 percent to a three-month high of $1,063.77. Microsoft (MSFT.O), Alphabet and Intel hit their highest in a decade.

“I expect markets to close the week on new record highs and a good portion of that should be attributed to the results that came from the tech companies,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York.

Amazon, which is winning business from older, big-box rivals, pleased investors with its transparency around Whole Foods, the premium grocer it recently bought.

“The Street went into third quarter earnings concerned about lack of disclosure around Whole Foods, and Amazon surprised to the upside here by breaking out Whole Foods contribution,” analysts at JP Morgan said.

Amazon’s shares, have risen 30 percent this year through Thursday’s close, as its AWS cloud business has stayed ahead of the competition.

Alphabet’s Google, a relatively smaller player in the cloud business, doesn’t break out revenue for Google Cloud Platform, but analysts estimate the business is growing very fast, complementing the company’s core advertising business.

The company’s stock is also relatively cheap, trading at 25.8 times forward 12-month earnings, despite its 30 percent run this year, excluding gains on Friday.

Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) revenue rose the most in percentage terms in three years, underscoring the success of Chief Executive Satya Nadella’s turnaround strategy.

“Maybe one man has changed the culture of a large organization of over 120,000 people to enable a more creative and innovative mass focused on winning. These results sure seem to indicate so,” Jefferies analysts said.

Even old guard Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has been struggling with tepid growth, said revenue from its higher-margin data center business rose 7 percent, slightly beating expectations.",No end in sight for tech giant share gains,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-technology-results-stocks/no-end-in-sight-for-tech-giant-share-gains-idUSKBN1CW1LF

India’s annual demand for petroleum coke, an energy intensive fuel that emits harmful sulfur oxides and ample carbon dioxide when burned, has doubled to 27 million tonnes in the past four years. The country imports about 14 million tonnes annually, mainly from the United States.

Its use was banned around New Delhi to rein in pollution. The country’s environmentalists are trying to stop imports of petroleum coke, known as petcoke, which emits sulfur oxides that are known to cause lung disease and acid rain.

To replace petcoke, industries from dyeing units to brick kilns are switching to imports of coal.

The national capital region alone consumes 2.2 million tonnes of petcoke a year. A country-wide import ban would require replacing 14 million tonnes of petcoke a year with 24 million to 31 million tonnes of coal, according to industry calculations, most of which has to be imported.

Jamil Rahman, a coal trader in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, said he has been getting enquiries about replacing local petcoke with Indonesian thermal coal.

Some enquiries were also made about replacing petcoke with high grade, low-sulfur coal from the U.S., traders said.

“Moving to coal is inevitable,” said Lalit Goel, the head of a textile industry body around New Delhi.

The increased demand for coal to replace petcoke, which will largely have to be met by imports, coincides with increasing coal consumption in India for power generation.

India is the world’s second-biggest buyer of foreign coal even though imports have held steady in the last two years because of rising local output.

But demand has picked up in 2017 and coal-fired power plants were left with only five days of inventories on average as of Oct. 26, compared with 15 days at the end of 2016.

“Indian coal imports will gain momentum in Q4 2017, especially for Indonesian coal,” said Rodrigo Echeverri, head of hard commodities research at Noble Group, at an industry event last week.

India’s coal imports will top 18 million tonnes in October for the first time since the middle of 2016, according to ship tracking data on Thomson Reuters Eikon.

The jump in imports comes just as other major buyers across Asia have also stepped up purchases.

Overall Asian coal imports rose above 80 million tonnes in October, after stagnating between 60 million and 70 million tonnes a month for the last two years, the tracking data shows.

As a result, traders now expect the first coal supply shortfall in years, and spot Newcastle coal prices at the Australian port of Newcastle have been hovering around $100 per ton for weeks. That is up from just over $70 in the middle of the year and around $50 in the first half of 2016, before coal markets first started tightening after years of slump.

BOON FOR MINERS

The tight market is a concern for consumers just as the peak winter demand in the northern hemisphere looms.

But the rising demand is a boon for specialist thermal coal suppliers such as Swiss commodity merchant and miner Glencore, Australia’s Whitehaven Coal, and Indonesia’s Adaro Energy, whose stocks have far outperformed those of diversified miners like BHP Billiton or Rio Tinto.

Demand is so strong that a traffic jam of dry-bulk carriers has built up off the eastern and southern coasts of Indonesia’s island of Kalimantan, one of the world’s biggest coal mining regions.

Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that over 100 ships are currently waiting off the region’s coal ports, either loading or waiting to take on coal.

“Indian utilities have been buying a lot of low calorific coal recently, supplied mainly from Indonesia. The ships are now off Kalimantan waiting to load,” said one trader involved in exporting Indonesian coal.",Indian petcoke ban to boost coal imports amid already tight market,https://www.reuters.com/article/india-coal/indian-petcoke-ban-to-boost-coal-imports-amid-already-tight-market-idINKBN1D14AX

The frontrunners are Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, former chair of the African Union and Zuma’s ex-wife, but with several other senior ANC figures running, the contest is too close to call.

The ANC’s next leader will probably become president in 2019 given the party’s electoral dominance. First they face the tough task of winning back voters disillusioned with Zuma’s rule and investors spooked by ratings downgrades.

The fractious, sometimes violent, branch meetings start the decisive final stretch of the race to succeed Zuma, whose rule has been marred by corruption allegations and a sharp economic slowdown.

Ramaphosa, a former union leader and one of the country’s richest people, is viewed more favourably by foreign investors, who help cover the country’s deficits. Many of them are unsettled by Dlamini-Zuma’s calls to radically redistribute wealth and change the ownership structure of the central bank.

Ramaphosa and Dlamini-Zuma’s campaign teams did not reply to requests for comment on reports of intimidation and manipulation of the nomination process in some provinces.

“The real fight is in December, but psychologically the battle for the soul of the ANC has begun,” said Stan Itshegetseng, who chaired a branch meeting in the Diepkloof district of the sprawling Soweto township on Sunday.

It took 11 hours for Itshegetseng’s branch of over 320 members to nominate Ramaphosa for ANC president, recommend more than 20 other officials for the party’s National Executive Committee and agree on a delegate to send to the December party conference.

Nominations in the branches matter because they send 90 percent of the more than 5,000 delegates who will vote in December. Branch meetings started last month and are due to end in mid-November.

FACTIONAL BATTLE

Unless change comes under the ANC’s next leader, some analysts believe the ANC could lose the 2019 election, a once unthinkable scenario for a party that has led comfortably since sweeping to power under Nelson Mandela at the end of apartheid in 1994.

As the ANC’s electoral majority has shrunk, so the battle for control of the party has intensified between the factions backing Dlamini-Zuma and Ramaphosa.

Zuma and the ANC’s youth and women’s leagues he controls want Dlamini-Zuma, while Ramaphosa is backed by a diverse group of labor unions, communists and ANC members who say the party has lost its way under Zuma. Provincial ANC leaders are split.

Carol Sono, a branch member in Diepkloof, said Dlamini-Zuma’s stints as health minister, foreign minister and home affairs minister meant she was the most qualified. “It’s only because of patriarchy that she wasn’t chosen sooner,” Sono said.

Kedi Saletese, a branch secretary in the Orlando district of Soweto, said only Ramaphosa could tackle corruption and help the ANC reclaim its image as a defender of ordinary South Africans.

“Now people see the ANC as a stepladder to enrich themselves. It makes you ashamed to wear an ANC T-shirt,” she said. Saletese’s branch - like Itshegetseng’s in Diepkloof - nominated Ramaphosa on Sunday.

The Gauteng province, where Soweto and the country’s commercial capital, Johannesburg, are based, is an area where Ramaphosa enjoys strong support.

Ramaphosa also polls well in the Eastern Cape and Limpopo provinces, whereas Dlamini-Zuma is likely to receive a greater share of votes in provinces including her native Kwa-Zulu Natal and Mpumalanga, where the premier is viewed as a Zuma ally.

Earlier this year there was a spate of political killings in Kwa-Zulu Natal, and some officials have expressed concern there could be more bloodshed as the leadership race nears its climax.

At the three branches Reuters visited in Soweto on Sunday, there was no sign of violence, though a coordinator for Ramaphosa’s campaign said he had been threatened with being “taken out permanently” for his choice of leader.

Activists for Ramaphosa and Dlamini-Zuma mingled with party members, urging loyalty before the nominations began.

Republicans in Congress have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, which they have said drives up costs for consumers and interferes with personal medical decisions. Democrats have warned that repeal would leave millions of Americans without health coverage.

President Donald Trump promised to kill the law in his 2016 election campaign, and he has taken executive and administrative actions to undermine it.

“The market’s going to be extremely confusing. There’s going to be entire complexity of choice,” said David Anderson, a health policy researcher at Duke University.

The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, estimated this week that 2018 enrollment would have held steady from 2017, with 12.2 million people signing up for individual health coverage under the Affordable Care Act had there not been administration efforts to undercut it.

The Trump administration has cut the 2018 enrollment period in half to six weeks from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15 for states using the federal Healthcare.gov website. Enrollment previously ran until Jan. 31, and many consumers often signed up in the last two weeks, according to state officials and organizations that help people choose insurance.

Senate Republicans and Democrats are working on legislation to stabilize Obamacare markets in the short term, but the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that about 1 million fewer people will enroll for 2018 plans due to Trump policies.

The administration has cut off billions of dollars in subsidies that insurers use to discount out-of-pocket medical costs for low-income Americans, slashed Obamacare advertising and cut funding to groups that help people enroll in health insurance. Several insurers have exited Obamacare markets due to concerns over subsidies and other Trump actions.

The Department of Health and Human Services said on Monday that premiums for the most popular Obamacare plans would rise 37 percent in 2018. Americans eligible for Obamacare tax credits to buy insurance may pay less for coverage, but costs would increase for middle-class consumers who do not get subsidies.

“It’s been such a flood of information. A lot of the population thinks the Affordable Care Act has already been put under,” said Daniel Polsky, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics. “The strange premium increases are going to be very confusing for consumers.”

The Trump administration is now planning changes for 2019. Last week, it proposed a rule giving states more flexibility over the benefits that must be covered by insurance. Under Obamacare, all insurers have to cover a set of 10 benefits, such as maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs.",Obamacare 2018 enrollment clouded by uncertainty under Trump,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-enrollment/obamacare-2018-enrollment-clouded-by-uncertainty-under-trump-idUSKBN1D14G9

Das teilte das Unternehmen am Donnerstag nach einer Sitzung des Aufsichtsrats in Eschborn bei Frankfurt mit. Kengeter werde das Unternehmen noch bis zum 31. Dezember führen. Zur Nachfolge des 50-jährigen ehemaligen Investmentbankers, der 2015 auf dem Chefsessel der Börse Platz genommen hatte, wurde zunächst nichts mitgeteilt. Die Finanzaufsicht BaFin und die beim Wirtschaftsministerium in Wiesbaden angesiedelte hessische Börsenaufsicht erklärten nur Stunden nach Bekanntwerden des Rücktritts, dass sie die angekündigte Zuverlässigkeitsprüfung Kengeters nicht mehr vornehmen werden.

Zuletzt hatten Insider dem bisherigen Finanzchef Gregor Pottmeyer die besten Chancen eingeräumt, wenigstens für eine Übergangszeit. Aber auch andere Vorstandsmitglieder wurden genannt. Klaus Nieding von der Deutschen Schutzvereinigung für Wertpapierbesitz (DSW) sagte zu Reuters, die Börse benötige nun einen nicht nur in der Branche gut vernetzten Chef, sondern einen Top-Manager, der auch intensive Beziehungen zur Landes- und Bundespolitik habe. Denn die Politik hat bei der Börse einen großen Einfluss. “Für die Deutsche Börse AG gilt es nach der britischen ”Brexit“-Entscheidung jetzt, die führende europäische Börse zu werden”, sagte Nieding.

An den Finanzmärkten wurde die Aussicht auf einen personellen Neuanfang mit Erleichterung aufgenommen. Die im Leitindex Dax notierte Börse-Aktie verteuerte sich um fast ein Prozent. Nach Handelsschluss werden auch noch die Quartalszahlen des Konzerns erwartet.

WIE GEHT ES WEITER?

Der Druck auf Kengeter war zuletzt massiv gestiegen: Die Staatsanwaltschaft Frankfurt hatte erst Anfang der Woche die Ermittlungen gegen ihn wieder aufgenommen, nachdem zuvor ein Deal mit der Justiz am Widerspruch des zuständigen Gerichts gescheitert war. Sowohl im Aufsichtsrat als auch bei großen Aktionären der Börse hatten sich zuletzt die Stimmen gemehrt, die eine Ablösung Kengeters forderten. Der durch die Affäre enstandene Imageschaden für die Börse sei zu groß.

Kengeter wird vorgeworfen, er habe Aktien der Deutschen Börse erworben, um von Kursgewinnen zu profitieren - als er bereits plante, die Londoner Börse LSE zu übernehmen. Dieses Vorhaben war später gescheitert. Kengeter beteuert bis heute seine Unschuld. Aufsichtsratschef Joachim Faber, der das umstrittene Aktienoptionsprogramm auf den Weg brachte, hatte sich lange hinter Kengeter gestellt. Allerdings war der Druck zuletzt auch auf Faber gestiegen - intern wie extern.

Der Deal mit der Staatsanwaltschaft sah die Einstellung des Verfahrens gegen eine Zahlung von 500.000 Euro durch Kengeter vor. Das Amtsgericht Frankfurt durchkreuzte die Pläne.

That means an additional 700,000 people now live in districts where the Taliban has at least some influence.

The updated figures are a sign of the deteriorating security situation in the war-torn country, even as the United States has committed several thousand more troops.

The gains being made by the Taliban and a spate of recent attacks underscore worries about Afghan security forces’ ability to deal with a relentless insurgency that they have struggled to contain since most foreign troops left at the end of 2014.

In total, about 43 percent of Afghanistan’s districts are either under Taliban control or being contested, three percent higher than six months ago, SIGAR said.

U.S. forces in Afghanistan also withheld certain data on the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, the report said, including “casualties, personnel strength, attrition, and the operational readiness of equipment.”

“In a significant development this quarter, U.S. Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A) classified or otherwise restricted information SIGAR has until now publicly reported,” the report said.

Afghanistan’s worsening security situation was highlighted on Tuesday when a suicide bomber in the capital killed as many as eight people.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.

The increase in the campaign of U.S. air strikes in recent months is part of a new strategy aimed at reversing Taliban gains and forcing the insurgents to seek peace talks with the Afghan government.

The SIGAR report, citing the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, also said there had been a 52 percent increase in civilian casualties from coalition and Afghan air strikes in the first nine months of 2017 compared with the same period in 2016.

There had also been a sharp increase in “insider attacks” by militants, targeting U.S. and Afghan forces. In June, three Americans were killed an one wounded when an Afghan soldier opened fire on them.","Taliban increases influence, territory in Afghanistan: U.S. watchdog",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-afghanistan-militants/taliban-increases-influence-territory-in-afghanistan-u-s-watchdog-idINKBN1D02M7

O governo uzbeque se manifestou depois que uma autoridade das forças de segurança dos EUA descreveu o suspeito como um imigrante nascido no Uzbequistão, um país predominantemente muçulmano da Ásia Central que foi parte da União Soviética.

O presidente uzbeque, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, fez a oferta de ajuda em uma carta de pêsames a Trump na qual repudiou o ataque “extremamente brutal” e disse que não pode haver justificativa para tamanha violência.

“De nosso lado, estamos prontos para usar todo nosso poder e recursos para cooperar na investigação deste ato terrorista”, escreveu Mirziyoyev na carta, que foi publicada no site do Ministério das Relações Exteriores de seu país. “Expressamos nossa solidariedade com o povo dos EUA”.

O ataque isolado mais letal contra nova-iorquinos desde o 11 de setembro de 2001, quando suicidas sequestraram dois aviões de passageiros e os lançaram contra o World Trade Center, é um desafio para Mirziyoyev, que tomou posse no final de 2016 e está tentando abrir sua nação lentamente depois de décadas de governos autoritários.

First, he committed to addressing the shortcomings of the Iran nuclear deal, without terminating it. Second, he called for a comprehensive strategy to counter Iranian aggression throughout the Middle East. More sanctions, however, will not be enough to accomplish either of these goals.

Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, at a news conference in Tehran, May 22, 2017. TIMA via REUTERS

The president’s twin objectives of fixing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the nuclear deal is known, and confronting Iran’s destabilizing regional behavior are closely connected. Barack Obama overlooked Tehran’s military expansion into Iraq and Syria, among other actions, for the purpose of winning Iranian cooperation on the nuclear issue. The result was not just a disastrous deal, but a diminished U.S. ability to accomplish any of its strategic objectives in the region.

To defend our vital interests in the Middle East and potentially improve a deeply flawed nuclear deal, the United States must first rebuild leverage by countering Tehran’s growing aggression and influence in the region. That cannot be accomplished overnight. Nor can it be done solely through the use of sanctions or the threat of withdrawal from the agreement.

Along with more sanctions, and before trying to fix or abandon the deal, policymakers must develop a comprehensive strategy, utilizing every element of American power, to rebuild and apply counter-pressure against the full spectrum of Iran’s destabilizing behaviors.The Gemunder Center Iran Task Force at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), which we co-chair, recently detailed such a strategy, consisting of two elements.

U.S. President Donald Trump discusses the Iran nuclear deal in the White House, October 13, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque

First, restore credible U.S. military leverage against Iran. American officials should prepare – and make clear they are preparing – contingency plans to defend the United States and its allies from Iranian nuclear-capable missiles. The United States should be prepared to shoot down Iranian nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, including test launches, and respond forcefully to any Iranian harassment of U.S. naval vessels. To this end, it should deploy the Aegis missile defense system to the Persian Gulf (like we already do in Europe and East Asia).

It is also critical that the United States has a post-Islamic State strategy for Syria, including more assistance to our allies on the ground in holding territory hard-won from IS. This is necessary to prevent Iran, Hezbollah and their proxies from dictating that country’s future and consolidating a land bridge from Iran to Lebanon.

Second, Washington must take the lead in assembling a coherent regional coalition against Iran. This will require more concerted cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to develop robust missile defenses against Iran’s region-wide proliferation of advanced missiles.

The Trump administration and Congress must also augment the recent Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on defense aid to Israel by removing Obama-era caps on missile defense assistance. The MoU must be treated as the floor, not the ceiling, for bilateral cooperation against Iran’s and Hezbollah’s growing presence and capabilities on Israel’s northern borders. Similarly, we must ensure U.S. and Gulf air and maritime defenses can operate in close coordination as Iran’s military capabilities expand under the nuclear deal.

Trump is absolutely right to call the JCPOA “unacceptable” in its current form. By allowing restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic missile program, and conventional arms purchases to expire over the next 15 years, the JCPOA actively grants Iran the right to become a de facto ICBM-armed, militarily modernized nuclear power.

The FSB, which coordinates financial regulation across the Group of 20 Economies (G20), said in its first report on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning that the risks they pose need monitoring.

AI and machine learning refer to technology that is replacing traditional methods to assess the creditworthiness of customers, to crunch data, price insurance contracts and spot profitable trades across markets.

There are no international regulatory standards for AI and machine learning, but the FSB left open whether new rules are needed.

Data on rapidly growing usage of AI is largely unavailable, leaving regulators unsure about the impact of potentially new and unexpected links between markets and banks, the report said.

AI could, for example, lead to “non-sustainable” increases in credit by automating credit scoring.

While AI shows substantial promise if risks are properly managed, it could create too much dependency among banks and insurers on the few specialist businesses that provide AI technology.

Expected rapid growth in AI also raises the prospect of outside technology players expanding their influence over the finance sector.

“This could in turn lead to the emergence of new systemically important players that could fall outside the regulatory perimeter,” the FSB said.

If a major AI provider went bust, it could lead to operational disruptions at a large number of financial firms at the same time, especially if used in “mission critical” applications, the report said.

Regulators could also find it difficult to identify who has made key financial decisions that go wrong.

“If AI and machine learning-based decisions cause losses to financial intermediaries across the financial system, there may be a lack of clarity around responsibility,” the report said.

REVOLUTION

The pace of technological advance will also make it harder to fashion durable rules for AI activity that some academics expect to revolutionize the financial sector.

The report said that RegTech investment, or use of machines to comply with a welter of new regulations introduced to tackle money laundering and make banks safer, could reach $6.45 billion by 2020.

Consultancy Accenture said in May that three quarters of bankers surveyed believed that AI will become the primary way banks interact with customers within the next three years.

European insurers invested $400 million in “InsurTech” or real-time technology to help to reduce payouts.

Nordea (NDA.ST), the Nordic region’s biggest bank, said last month that automation would help it to shed at least 4,000 staff. It has already introduced an AI chatbox to answer common customer questions.

Dutch bank ING (INGA.AS) wants to increase the number of traders using AI.

Fund managers are also using outside specialists to obtain machine-learning tools that sift through news and research for insight into market trends.

So-called “quant” funds use AI to manage $1 trillion in assets. Though that is only a fraction of the $40 trillion in mutual funds globally, the FSB said industry estimates suggest that could grow rapidly.

The regulators themselves are also using AI to make it easier to detect fraud and money laundering, while central banks expect to use AI for real-time predictions using big data to help to determine monetary policy, the report said.

The FSB acknowledged that AI is helping the financial sector to cut costs, improve profitability and widen choice for customers, but added that it also raises concerns over privacy of data used in AI applications.","Rise of the machines must be monitored, say global finance regulators",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-regulation-banks-artificialintelligen/rise-of-the-machines-must-be-monitored-say-global-finance-regulators-idUKKBN1D1534?il=0

As Madrid began direct rule of Catalonia, Attorney General Jose Manuel Maza called for charges of rebellion, sedition, fraud and misuse of funds to be brought against Catalan leaders who organized an illegal referendum on independence from Spain.

The Oct. 1 vote in the prosperous region with its own language and culture has triggered Spain’s biggest crisis in decades. On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dismissed Catalonia’s secessionist government, called a regional election for Dec. 21 and said the central government would take direct control.

That process began smoothly on Monday as employees ignored calls for civil disobedience and turned up for work, while secessionist parties agreed to stand in the December poll.

A senior Spanish government official said on Monday that Puigdemont had traveled to Belgium. He drove to the French city of Marseilles to catch a flight to Belgium with five other members of his sacked administration, Spanish media reported.

Belgian lawyer Paul Bekaert, whose website says he is involved in a human rights organization, said he had taken on Puigdemont as a client but would not confirm whether he was working with him on a political asylum claim.

“I can confirm Carles Puigdemont has appointed me as his legal representative, as he is currently in Belgium,” Bekaert told Reuters. “At the moment there are no specific dossiers I am preparing for him.”

Bekaert told Belgian broadcaster VTM that Puigdemont had not fled Catalonia, was not hiding and would make a public appearance in Brussels on Tuesday.

After what he described as an hour-long meeting in his office in western Belgium, the lawyer - who quoted his experience with asylum and extradition cases, as well as with Spain - said his client was in high spirits, driven by “strong support among his backers in Catalonia”.

‘THINGS HAVE TO CARRY ON’

Some of the most prominent ousted Catalan leaders, including Puigdemont and Vice President Oriol Junqueras, had said they would not accept their dismissal.

But their respective parties, PdeCat and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, said on Monday they would take part in the election called by Rajoy, a tacit acceptance of direct rule from Madrid. The regional parliament canceled a meeting for Tuesday, another signal lawmakers accepted they had been dismissed.

A call for widespread civil disobedience from the main civic groups behind the secessionist campaign failed to attract many followers. Public-sector workers such as teachers, firefighters and the police mostly started work as normal on Monday and there was no sign of widespread absenteeism.

A trade union, Intersindical-CSC, which had called for a general strike in Catalonia, said on Monday it had canceled it.

Other regional leaders did not turn up to their offices, although some of their staff did.

One of 140 senior officials appointed directly by the outgoing government described the situation as “normal” and said he had not yet received any letter of dismissal.

“We civil servants want everything to be normal. Things have to carry on. The day-to-day work still has to be done,” he said.

Some 200,000 public-sector workers receive salaries paid by the Catalan region, and 100,000 others in the region rely directly on the Madrid government.

Hundreds of thousands of supporters of a unified Spain marched on Sunday in one of the biggest shows of force yet by the so-called silent majority that has watched as regional political leaders push for Catalan independence.

WORSENED ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Two opinion polls showed support for independence may have started to wane. A Sigma Dos survey published in El Mundo showed 33.5 percent of Catalans were in favor of independence, while a Metroscopia poll published by El Pais put that number at 29 percent. That compared with 41.1 percent in July, according to an official survey carried out by the Catalan government.

Opponents of secession largely boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum, when participants voted overwhelmingly for independence on a turnout of 43 percent.

Spain’s interior ministry named a new chief for the regional police on Saturday, who has insisted that the 17,000 officers of the force should remain neutral.

The force has already withdrawn protection for dismissed regional government members, who were also left without their official cars. Their portraits were removed from the walls of public buildings.

The government’s move to impose direct rule received the backing of several influential Catalan business lobbies, which called on firms to stay in the region. The chaos has prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the euro zone’s fourth-largest.

North Korean hackers have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars from banks during the past three years, including a heist in 2016 at Bangladesh Bank that yielded $81 million, according to Dmitri Alperovitch, chief technology officer at cyber security firm CrowdStrike.

Alperovitch told the Reuters Cyber Security Summit on Tuesday that banks were concerned Pyongyang’s hackers may become more destructive by using the same type of “wiper” viruses they deployed across South Korea and at Sony Corp’s (6758.T) Hollywood studio.

The North Korean government has repeatedly denied accusations by security researchers and the U.S. government that it has carried out cyber attacks.

North Korean hackers could leverage knowledge about financial networks gathered during cyber heists to disrupt bank operations, according to Alperovitch, who said his firm has conducted “war game” exercises for several banks.

“The difference between theft and destruction is often a few keystrokes,” Alperovitch said.

“We know they attacked South Korean banks,” said the source, who added that fears have grown that banks in the United States will be targeted next.

Tensions between Washington and Pyongyang have been building after a series of nuclear and missile tests by North Korea and bellicose verbal exchanges between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

John Carlin, a former U.S. assistant attorney general, told the Reuters summit that other firms, among them defense contractors, retailers and social media companies, were also concerned.

“They are thinking ‘Are we going to see an escalation in attacks from North Korea?'” said Carlin, chair of Morrison & Foerster international law firm’s global risk and crisis management team.

Jim Lewis, a cyber expert with Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies, said it is unlikely that North Korea would launch destructive attacks on American banks because of concerns about U.S. retaliation.

Representatives of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the top U.S. banking regulators, declined to comment. Both have ramped up cyber security oversight in recent years.

Applauding Pruitt’s move, House Speaker Paul Ryan called the plan to stop power plants from dumping unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into the atmosphere ”a vast, unlawful expansion of government authority” into the energy sector that had been “especially devastating” to coal country.

The reality is different. Republicans say that deregulating carbon pollution will revive the coal industry, but it won’t. The decades-long decline in coal jobs reflects larger economic forces: mechanization, tapped-out coal veins in Appalachia, and stiffer competition from increasingly cheap energy production from solar panels, wind turbines, and natural gas. In the last decade, coal’s share of the U.S. energy portfolio declined from half to one-third. This predates the Clean Power Plan, which has not yet even taken effect.

The Trump administration may not even be able to repeal the Clean Power regulation. Liberal states and environmental groups already are lining up to challenge Pruitt’s plans in court. The federal government is legally obligated to limit carbon pollution and coal is the most carbon-intensive energy source. Unless Republicans change the law, they may be forced to uphold the plan. Anyway, the Democrats will reinstate the rule if they win back control of the White House.

Although Ryan called the Clean Power Plan a “signature climate rule” of the Obama administration, it was Republican President Richard Nixon who signed the Clean Air Act of 1970, which requires EPA to regulate pollutants that endanger human health. In 2007, the Supreme Court held in Massachusetts v. EPA that clear evidence — some of it produced by the government’s own scientists — demonstrated that carbon emissions cause global warming, which in turn causes dangers such as smog, deadly heat waves, and hurricanes. Therefore, the court ruled that EPA had to regulate carbon.

George W. Bush stalled on implementation until the end of his administration, and Barack Obama spent his first few years in office trying to craft legislation in which the government would create a cap-and-trade program to regulate carbon. Because the Senate failed to pass cap-and-trade, the Obama administration eventually came up with the Clean Power Plan.

Even if Pruitt were able to convince courts that the Clean Power Plan’s costs outweigh its benefits – an argument for which environmentalists have plenty of counter-evidence – the EPA would still be obligated to come up with a replacement carbon pollution regulation. Courts could order EPA to produce a regulation by a certain time and hold Pruitt in contempt of court if he fails to comply. That’s what happened to EPA administrator William D. Ruckelshaus in 1984 for not issuing standards on radioactive airborne materials.

Although other regulatory rollbacks might trigger apoplexy among green organizations, in this case they say they are certain of victory. Michael Brune, president of the Sierra Club, the largest U.S. environmental organization, while predicting that “Donald Trump and Scott Pruitt will go down in infamy for launching one of the most egregious attacks ever on public health,” also noted, “No matter who is in the White House, EPA is legally required to limit dangerous carbon pollution.”

To be sure, Pruitt’s plan represents a threat to the environment. Coal is the dirtiest major source of energy in the United States. In addition to contributing to climate change, it produces a host of toxins such as nitrous oxide and mercury and is a major source of smog. When it drafted the Clean Power rule, the EPA estimated that it would prevent 90,000 childhood asthma attacks, 300,000 missed work and school days, and 3,600 premature deaths per year by 2030. If the courts do let Pruitt repeal the rule, it could slow the transition away from coal, causing dirtier air and more global warming.

However, the only way to lastingly prevent carbon regulation would be to revise the Clean Air Act to stipulate that its standards do not apply to carbon. Republicans in Congress have tried to do just that. Their most recent bill, released in February, immediately attracted over 100 co-sponsors, all of them Republicans.

Preventing carbon regulation would be extremely unpopular. Polls show large majorities of the public, sometimes including a majority of Republican voters, support regulating climate pollution.

As David Doniger, director of the climate program at the left-leaning Natural Resources Defense Council and a former EPA official, told me in April for an article I wrote in The Washington Post: “After the Bush administration...the Clean Air Act was still in effect and the Obama administration started to set things right. It’s not a very satisfying thing to think of this as a 30-years war, but it’s longer than a four-year battle.”

Trump does have considerable political capital invested in the battle. In March, he issued an executive order directing Pruitt to get rid of the Clean Power rule. As a candidate, the president repeatedly promised to end his predecessor’s “war on coal” and put the miners back to work.

However, market realities will make this promise impossible to keep as coal’s slide continues. In 2016, natural gas passed coal as the leading source of American electricity, a shift the U.S. Energy Information Agency finds is “mainly a market-driven response to lower natural gas prices.” There’s no sign of the fracking-driven cheap gas boom abating. In fact, Trump hopes to boost it by deregulating fracking on federal land. Whether governments will cut carbon pollution swiftly enough to stave off climate catastrophe remains an open question. But laws in place from a time when Republicans were more moderate will ultimately ensure that carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants is regulated — insufficient and late though it may be — and coal’s foreordained death will hardly have been slowed at all.",Commentary: EPA repeal of Clean Power Plan won’t get Trump what he wants,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-adler-coal-commentary/commentary-epa-repeal-of-clean-power-plan-wont-get-trump-what-he-wants-idUSKBN1CT2TT

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

On Oct. 4, Islamist militants with sniper rifles and rocket propelled grenades killed four U.S. soldiers and at least four of their Nigerian partners in an ambush that exposed the dangers of an expanding U.S. presence in the largely desert nation.

What began as a small U.S. training operation has expanded to an 800-strong force that accompanies the Nigerians on intelligence gathering and other missions. It includes a $100million drone base in the central Nigerian city of Agadez which, however, at present only deploys surveillance drones.

“I asked them some weeks ago to arm them (the drones) and use them as needed,” Defense Minister Kalla Mountari told Reuters in an interview in his office. Asked if Washington had accepted the request, he said: “Our enemies will find out.” The deaths of the U.S. soldiers, at the hands of suspected insurgents with the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara group, shocked Americans, many of whom did not realize their country had such a large presence in Africa’s Sahel region.

The incident also highlighted the “mission creep” that has set in and expanded the U.S. role in landlocked Niger, one of the world’s poorest and most insecure countries.

Mountari said the team of 12 U.S. Special Forces soldiers and 30 Nigerian troops had been “right up to the Mali border and had neutralized some bandits” just before the ambush took place. He declined to give further details. The U.S. military has been adamant that the Oct. 3-4 mission was not intended to involve contact with enemy forces. Mountari said: “They (U.S.-Nigerien contingent) came back to Niger, they greeted the population, they gathered intelligence and it was inside the country, when they didn’t expect anything, that the attack happened.”

U.S. forces do not have a direct combat mission in Niger, but their assistance to its military does include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance in their efforts to target violent Islamist organizations. However, Mountari was clear he saw them as close partners.

“The Americans are not just exchanging information with us. They are waging war when necessary,” he said. “We are working hand in hand. The clear proof is that the Americans and Nigerians fell on the battlefield for the peace and security of our country.”

But a growing U.S. role in Niger could prove unpopular both with Americans, many of whom are tired of costly and sometimes deadly foreign adventures, and in Niger, whose citizens have mixed feelings about foreign forces on their soil.

Drone strikes have been controversial in other parts of the world because of the risk of civilian casualties.

(For a graphic on 'New York truck attack' click tmsnrt.rs/2z3aqZv)","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investigators on Wednesday were focused on an Uzbek immigrant they said killed eight people in New York by driving a rental truck down a riverfront bike path in an attack authorities said had all the hallmarks of terrorism.

The suspect, who was shot by police and arrested moments after the Tuesday rampage in lower Manhattan, left a note saying he carried out the attack in the name of the militant Islamic State group, the New York Times and CNN said.

It was the deadliest single attack on New York City since Sept. 11, 2001, when suicide hijackers crashed two jetliners into the World Trade Center, killing more than 2,600 people. A further 11 people were injured in Tuesday’s attack.

Similar assaults using vehicles as weapons took place in Spain in August and in France and Germany last year.

The suspect allegedly swerved the pickup onto a path filled with pedestrians and bicyclists on a sunny autumn afternoon, mowing down people in his path before slamming into the side of a school bus.

He then exited the vehicle brandishing what turned out to be a paint-ball gun and a pellet gun before a police officer shot him in the abdomen.

The attack, which left crumpled bicycles scattered along the path and victims writhing on the ground, was over in seconds.

The suspect underwent surgery for gunshot wounds.

Police declined to publicly identify the man, but a source familiar with the investigation said his name was Sayfullo Saipov, 29. He reportedly lived in Paterson, New Jersey, a one-time industrial hub about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of lower Manhattan.

He had rented the pickup from a Home Depot Inc hardware store which, according to media accounts, was located in Passaic, just south of Paterson.

U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham urged authorities to treat Saipov as an enemy combatant, a move that would allow investigators to question the man without him having a lawyer present.

ARGENTINE FRIENDS AMONG DEAD

Six victims were pronounced dead at the scene and two more at a nearby hospital, Police Commissioner James O‘Neill said.

Five of the dead were Argentine tourists, visiting New York as part of a group of friends celebrating the 30th anniversary of their high school graduation, the government there said. Belgium’s foreign minister said a Belgian citizen was also among those killed.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said police will be out in force to protect the city’s marathon on Sunday, one of the world’s top road races, which draws some 51,000 runners from around the globe.

“You’ll see a lot of officers with long guns. Other things you won’t see that are protecting us,” he told MSNBC.

A U.S. law enforcement official described the suspect as a U.S. immigrant born in Uzbekistan, a predominantly Muslim country in Central Asia that was once part of the former Soviet Union. CNN and NBC News said he entered the United States in 2010.

Uzbekistan’s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said his government would do all it could to help investigate the “extremely brutal” attack.

Slideshow (29 Images)

Authorities late on Tuesday surrounded a house in Paterson where, according to the New York Times, Saipov was believed to have lived. Paterson, known for its large immigrant population, is home to about 150,000 people, including 25,000 to 30,000 Muslims.

ABC News reported that Saipov had lived in Tampa, Florida. A check of court records related to a traffic citation that Saipov received in eastern Pennsylvania in 2015 showed he listed addresses then in Paterson and Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio.

CNN and other media outlets, citing police officials, reported that the suspect shouted “Allahu Akbar” - Arabic for “God is greatest” - when he jumped out of his truck.

Although authorities from the mayor’s office to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security all swiftly branded the attack an act of terrorism, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo stressed that the suspect was believed to have acted alone.

The New York Times said Saipov had come to the attention of law enforcement in the past. It cited three officials as saying federal authorities knew of Saipov from an unrelated probe, although it was unclear whether that was because he had ties to someone who was under scrutiny or because he was the target of an investigation.

Last week an Uzbekistan citizen living in Brooklyn was sentenced to 15 years in prison for conspiring to support Islamic State.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has pressed for a ban on travelers entering the United States from some predominantly Muslim countries, said on Twitter that he had ordered Homeland Security officials to “step up our already Extreme Vetting Program. Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!”

He also criticized the U.S. visa system, blaming Democrats and saying that he wanted a ‘merit based’ program for immigrants to the United States.

The Fed has raised rates twice since January and currently forecasts one more hike by the end of the year as part of a tightening cycle that began in late 2015.

Investors have all but ruled out a move at the end of this week’s two-day policy meeting. The Fed is due to issue its latest policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).

Markets will look to it for confirmation the central bank is on track for a December rate hike, though attention will quickly turn to who will be in charge of monetary policy at the end of Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s first term in February 2018.

President Donald Trump, who has interviewed Yellen, Fed Governor Jerome Powell and three others for the top Fed job, is likely to announce the nomination on Thursday.

Powell, a soft-spoken centrist who has supported Yellen’s gradual approach to raising rates, is seen as having a lock on the position.

“The bottom line is the meeting is probably going to be a somewhat boring event for markets, overshadowed by the expected Fed chair decision,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank.

INFLATION WORRIES

Fed policymakers have been buoyed in recent months by a strengthening U.S. economy and further tightening in the labor market, although inflation has continued to remain below the central bank’s 2 percent target.

The economy unexpectedly maintained a brisk pace of growth in the third quarter, increasing at a 3.0 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department reported last week.

A decline in hiring in September also has largely been dismissed as a blip caused by the temporary displacement of workers due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. That jobs report also showed wages growing at an encouraging pace and the unemployment rate falling to more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent.

A strong rebound in job gains is anticipated when the Labor Department releases its October nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.

Inflation is the main concern for Fed policymakers who are wondering about the causes and duration of the current weakness. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation sits at 1.3 percent after retreating further from target for much of the year.

Nevertheless, Yellen and other key policymakers have said the Fed, which unveiled a plan this year to cut its balance sheet starting in October, still expects to continue to gradually raise rates given the economy’s strength. That is not expected to change on Wednesday.

“If we get what we expect to get, which is basically more of the same of what we saw in the September statement,” said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo, “then yes, their gradual policy tightening plan is in place and all signs point to a December hike.”",Fed set to hold rates steady ahead of Trump's leadership decision,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed/fed-set-to-hold-rates-steady-ahead-of-trumps-leadership-decision-idUSKBN1D13JT?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

The challenge for Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is to persuade her to actually buy one.

“I‘m definitely interested, but don’t currently plan to get one,” said Gu, whose monthly salary of a little over 6,000 yuan ($905.36) is less than the anniversary model’s starting price in China of 8,388 yuan.

For Apple, which is looking to rev up sales in China after several quarters of declining revenue there, the test is that Gu is not alone. While interest in the phone is high, that won’t necessarily translate into sales.

“Price appears to be a major constraint on iPhone X demand, particularly in China,” Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a recent report that showed three-quarters of Chinese respondents were excited by the upcoming launch, but only a quarter said they planned to buy one.

Investors are keen to gauge Chinese demand for the iPhone X, as it is key to reviving Apple’s fortunes in the world’s biggest smartphone market where it has lost some of its sparkle - and market share - as local phone makers have advanced.

The cheaper iPhone 8, which hit the market in September, has faced sluggish sales, but Apple has said that pre-orders for the iPhone X have been “off the charts”.

Apple, due to announce quarterly earnings on Thursday, said it had no immediate comment.

Chatter online on popular Chinese social media platform Weibo (WB.O) also signaled high levels of interest in the new model, though still generally behind levels around the 2014 launch of the very successful iPhone 6.

APPLE “GEEKS”

Xiao Ming, 32, who works for a blockchain start-up in Beijing, stayed up half the night when pre-sales of the iPhone X opened last week. He has also bought the iPhone 8.

“I always try to be one of the first to buy any new iPhone,” he said, adding he likes the new phone’s augmented reality and facial recognition features. “I’ll be very disappointed if I don’t get one on the first day.”

While he plans to buy the new phone, he noted many of his friends were less fussed. “Before, I think a lot of people would try to get it somehow, now it’s mostly the geeks,” he said.

“My friends don’t mind so much if they have an iPhone 8 or a 6, for example, because it looks similar and the price (of the iPhone X) makes you feel nervous.”

Re-sellers and iPhone accessory makers generally agreed there was a buzz about the iPhone X, Apple’s first phone to have a full-screen display and functions such as facial recognition security.

“People are really anticipating this phone because it’s the 10th anniversary version and it has more changes and modifications,” said Gary Yiu, manager of the iGeneration smartphone shop at one Hong Kong mall.

Yiu and three other phone re-sellers there said they had seen strong demand for the phone from mainland clients.

A merchant at the Huaqiangbei electronics hub in Shenzhen, who was offering an iPhone look-a-like called the “E-Feng X” from 1,599 yuan, said sales volumes were “very good”.

Some Chinese re-sellers, however, said they already canceled pre-orders for the iPhone X, concerned there wouldn’t be enough of a supply bottleneck to allow them to charge a steep premium - despite some worries about long waits.

“I saw many friends were posting pictures of themselves successfully ordering the iPhone X, so I canceled mine,” said Tony Tong, 29, a product manager at a tech firm in Beijing, who said he had ordered four phones in the hope of re-selling them for a profit. “The environment is bad for scalpers.”

Apple will hope payment plans and easy access to online credit in China will convince people to buy.

Wang Hao, a 24-year-old engineer in the northeastern port city of Dalian, said he ordered the new phone despite the high price tag. His last phone was an iPhone 6S.

“The cost is about a month’s salary for me,” he told Reuters. “But I‘m just used to it now, and there wasn’t really anything to make me choose another brand.”

O Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) informou nesta quarta-feira que a produção industrial registrou alta de 0,2 por cento em setembro sobre o mês anterior, após queda de 0,7 por cento em agosto.

A expectativa em pesquisa da Reuters era de alta de 0,6 por cento na comparação mensal.

Em relação ao mesmo mês de 2016, o setor teve avanço de 2,6 por cento, também aquém da projeção de economistas de alta de 3,1 por cento nessa base de comparação.

“A indústria vem mostrando algum tipo de melhora, mas num ritmo lento e gradual. O cenário não mudou e esse é o perfil do segmento”, explicou o coordenador da pesquisa no IBGE, André Macedo.

Esse cenário fica evidente nas leituras trimestrais. A indústria fechou o terceiro trimestre com crescimento de 0,9 por cento sobre o período anterior, após altas de 1,1 por cento no segundo trimestre e de 1,4 por cento no primeiro trimestre sobre os três últimos meses de 2016.

Em setembro, segundo o IBGE, somente a categoria de Bens Intermediários apresentou alta em relação a agosto, de 0,7 por cento. A produção de Bens de Consumo recuou 0,7 por cento enquanto a de Bens de Capital, uma medida de investimento, caiu 0,3 por cento.

Entre os ramos pesquisados, 8 dos 24 apresentaram ganhos, com destaque para coque, produtos derivados do petróleo e biocombustíveis (+6,7 por cento) e produtos alimentícios (+4,1 por cento).

A confiança da indústria vem apresentando sinais de melhora e chegou em outubro ao maior patamar desde abril de 2014, segundo a Fundação Getulio Vargas.

Isso em um ambiente no país de inflação e juros baixos de forma contínua, o que incentiva o consumo e vem ajudando na recuperação econômica, embora a retomada do emprego ainda seja baseada no trabalho informal.

“A indústria é um setor que ainda não tem fôlego para trajetória de recuperação consolidada.

Papadopoulos pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents about his dealings with Russians, including an April 2016 meeting in which he was told the Russians had “dirt” on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton that entailed “thousands of emails.”

Prosecutors on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team said in court records that Papadopoulos had conversations and email exchanges with an unnamed “campaign supervisor” about efforts to improve U.S.-Russia relations by setting up meetings between senior campaign and Russian officials.

According to those records, the campaign supervisor conveyed to Papadopoulos in a March 6, 2016, discussion that “a principal foreign policy focus of the campaign was an improved U.S. relationship with Russia.”

A source familiar with the investigation said Clovis was the campaign supervisor referenced in the court records.

Victoria Toensing, a lawyer for Clovis, did not dispute that but added that her client never said improving U.S.-Russia relations was a “principal foreign policy focus” because that was not his view of Trump’s priorities.

Mueller is leading a probe into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trump’s favor and into potential collusion by Trump aides.

Russia denies the allegations and Trump denies any collusion.

‘OPPOSED ANY RUSSIA TRIP’

George Papadopoulos (3rd L) appears in a photograph released on Donald Trump's social media accounts with a headline stating that the scene was of his campaign's national security meeting in Washington, D.C. U.S. on March 31, 2016 and published April 1, 2016. Social Media/Handout via REUTERS

Prosecutors said in the court records that Papadopoulos emailed the supervisor and several others to tell them he had met with a professor who had in turn introduced him to a Russian woman and the Russian ambassador in London, and that they discussed setting up meetings to talk about U.S.-Russia ties in a Trump presidency.

The supervisor replied that he would “work it through the campaign” and not to make a commitment at that point. “Great work,” the supervisor added in the email.

In August 2016, the supervisor wrote to Papadopoulos in reference to a possible “off the record” meeting with Russian officials, saying: “I would encourage you” and another foreign policy adviser “to make the trip.”

In her response, Toensing said: “Dr. Clovis always vigorously opposed any Russian trip for Donald Trump or staff. However, if a volunteer made suggestions on any foreign policy matter, Dr. Clovis, a polite gentleman from Iowa, would have expressed courtesy and appreciation.”

Clovis has since been nominated by Trump to a top post as chief scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Debbie Stabenow, the ranking member of the Senate panel that will vet the nomination, told Reuters she was concerned.

“The emerging information about his role in the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia raises serious concerns,” she said in a statement.

NBC News reported on Tuesday that Clovis had been questioned by Mueller’s team and testified before the grand jury.

The Appalachian region has lost about 33,500 mining jobs since 2011, according to the Appalachian Regional Commission.
A White House official did not respond to requests for comment on coal policy and retraining for coal workers.
Coal jobs are preferable to those in natural gas, they said, because the mines are close to home, while pipeline work requires travel.
“That’s a major part of the reason that coal mines have been able to survive,” he said.","WAYNESBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - When Mike Sylvester entered a career training center earlier this year in southwestern Pennsylvania, he found more than one hundred federally funded courses covering everything from computer programming to nursing.

He settled instead on something familiar: a coal mining course.

”I think there is a coal comeback,” said the 33-year-old son of a miner.

Despite broad consensus about coal’s bleak future, a years-long effort to diversify the economy of this hard-hit region away from mining is stumbling, with Obama-era jobs retraining classes undersubscribed and future programs at risk under President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget.

Trump has promised to revive coal by rolling back environmental regulations and moved to repeal Obama-era curbs on carbon emissions from power plants.

“I have a lot of faith in President Trump,” Sylvester said.

But hundreds of coal-fired plants have closed in recent years, and cheap natural gas continues to erode domestic demand. The Appalachian region has lost about 33,500 mining jobs since 2011, according to the Appalachian Regional Commission.

Although there have been small gains in coal output and hiring this year, driven by foreign demand, production levels remain near lows hit in 1978.

A White House official did not respond to requests for comment on coal policy and retraining for coal workers.

What many experts call false hopes for a coal resurgence have mired economic development efforts here in a catch-22: Coal miners are resisting retraining without ready jobs from new industries, but new companies are unlikely to move here without a trained workforce. The stalled diversification push leaves some of the nation’s poorest areas with no clear path to prosperity.

Federal retraining programs have fared better, with some approaching full participation, in the parts of Appalachia where mining has been crushed in a way that leaves little hope for a comeback, according to county officials and recruiters. They include West Virginia and Kentucky, where coal resources have been depleted.

But in southern Pennsylvania, where the industry still has ample reserves and is showing flickers of life, federal jobs retraining programs see sign-up rates below 20 percent, the officials and recruiters said. In southern Virginia’s coal country, participation rates run about 50 percent, they said.

“Part of our problem is we still have coal,” said Robbie Matesic, executive director of Greene County’s economic development department.

Out-of-work miners cite many reasons beyond faith in Trump policy for their reluctance to train for new industries, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen former and prospective coal workers, career counselors and local economic development officials. They say mining pays well; other industries are unfamiliar; and there’s no income during training and no guarantee of a job afterward.

In Pennsylvania, Corsa Coal opened a mine in Somerset in June which will create about 70 jobs – one of the first mines to open here in years. And Consol Energy recently expanded its Bailey mine complex in Greene County.

But Consol also announced in January that it plans to sell its coal holdings to focus on natural gas. And it has commissioned a recruitment agency, GMS Mines and Repair, to find contract laborers for its coal expansion who will be paid about $13 an hour - half the hourly wage of a starting unionized coal worker. The program Sylvester signed up for was set up by GMS.

The new hiring in Pennsylvania is related mainly to an uptick in foreign demand for metallurgical coal, used in producing steel, rather than domestic demand for thermal coal from power plants, the industry’s main business. Some market analysts describe the foreign demand as a temporary blip driven by production problems in the coal hub of Australia.

Officials for U.S. coal companies operating in the region, including Consol and Corsa, declined requests for comment.

“The coal industry has stabilized, but it’s not going to come back,” said Blair Zimmerman, a 40-year veteran of the mines who is now the commissioner for Greene County, one of Pennsylvania’s oldest coal regions. “We need to look at the future.”

EMPTY SEATS

The Pennsylvania Department of Labor has received about $2 million since 2015 from the federal POWER program, an initiative of former President Barack Obama to help retrain workers in coal-dependent areas. But the state is having trouble putting even that modest amount of money to good use.

In Greene and Washington counties, 120 people have signed up for jobs retraining outside the mines, far short of the target of 700, said Ami Gatts, director of the Washington-Greene County Job Training Agency. In Westmoreland and Fayette counties, participation in federal job retraining programs has been about 15 percent of capacity, officials said.

“I can’t even get them to show up for free food I set up in the office,” said Dave Serock, an ex-miner who recruits in Fayette County for Southwest Training Services.

Programs administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission, a federal and state partnership to strengthen the region’s economy, have had similar struggles. One $1.4 million ARC project to teach laid-off miners in Greene County and in West Virginia computer coding has signed up only 20 people for 95 slots. Not a single worker has enrolled in another program launched this summer to prepare ex-miners to work in the natural gas sector, officials said.

Greene County Commissioner Zimmerman said he’d like to see a big company like Amazon or Toyota come to southwestern Pennsylvania to build a distribution or manufacturing plant that could employ thousands.

But he knows first the region needs a ready workforce.

Amazon spokeswoman Ashley Robinson said the company the company typically works with local organizations to evaluate whether locations have an appropriate workforce and has no current plans for distribution operations in Western Pennsylvania. Toyota spokesman Edward Lewis said the company considers local workforce training an “important consideration” when deciding where to locate facilities.

SIGNS OF LIFE

For Sean Moodie and his brother Steve spent the last two years working in the natural gas industry, but see coal as a good bet in the current political climate.

“I am optimistic that you can make a good career out of coal for the next 50 years,” said Sean Moodie.

Coal jobs are preferable to those in natural gas, they said, because the mines are close to home, while pipeline work requires travel. Like Sylvester, the Moodie brothers are taking mining courses offered by Consol’s recruiter, GMS.

Bob Levo, who runs a GMS training program, offered a measure of realism: The point of the training is to provide low-cost and potentially short-term labor to a struggling industry, he said.

“That’s a major part of the reason that coal mines have been able to survive,” he said. “They rely on us to provide labor at lower cost.”

Clemmy Allen, 63, a veteran miner and head of the United Mineworkers of America’s Career Centers, said miners are taking a big risk in holding out for a coal recovery.

He’s placing his hopes for the region’s future on retraining. UMWA’s 64-acre campus in Prosperity, Pennsylvania - which once trained coal miners - will use nearly $3 million in federal and state grants to retrofit classrooms to teach cybersecurity, truck driving and mechanical engineering.

“Unlike when I worked in the mines,” he said, “if you get laid off now, you are pretty much laid off.”

Stretch responded: “Certainly potentially.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators on Tuesday pressed Facebook Inc’s chief lawyer on why the company did not catch 2016 election ads bought using Russian rubles, why its investigation of them took so long and how much it knows about its 5 million advertisers.

Democrats and Republicans at the Senate crime subcommittee hearing fired questions for much of two hours at Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch, who said that in retrospect the company should have done more.

“In hindsight, we should have had a broader lens. There are signals we missed,” Stretch said under questioning from Democratic Senator Al Franken about how the company missed political ads bought with Russian money. Stretch called the Russia-based ads “reprehensible” for their political divisiveness.

The hearing marked the first time tech executives have appeared publicly before U.S. lawmakers on the Russia matter, and the tone represented a dramatic shift in fortunes for Silicon Valley, which for years has grown accustomed to favorable regulatory treatment in the United States.

Lawyers for Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google also faced questions at the hearing about how Russians used their services, but Facebook drew the bulk of senators’ ire because of its unique role in targeted marketing on the internet.

Facebook has broader reach than the smaller Twitter network, and it offers more powerful targeting capabilities than Google.

“I suspect that your advertising department has watched the profits go up,” Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy told Stretch, who responded that Facebook was committed to rooting out accounts that use fake names.

Lawyers for the three companies were scheduled to return to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for two more hearings on Russia ad spending.

The Russian government has denied it intended to influence the 2016 presidential election, in which Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Facebook, in a series of disclosures over two months, has said that people in Russia bought at least 3,000 U.S. political ads and published another 80,000 Facebook posts that were seen by as many as 126 million Americans over two years.

Senators said they could not understand the timing of Facebook’s disclosures.

“Why has it taken Facebook 11 months to come forward and help us understand the scope of this problem?” Democratic Senator Chris Coons asked.

Stretch responded that, when U.S. spy agencies alleged in January that Russians meddled in last year’s election, “we weren’t sitting around.” The company over the following months launched an investigation and reported the results, he said.

Facebook has also announced steps to change how it treats political ads. It said it is hiring 1,000 more people to review ads, compiling a publicly searchable archive of political ads beginning next year and requiring more information about the identity of election advertisers.

Coons said he wished the tech companies had sent their top executives on Tuesday rather than in-house lawyers.

Republican Senator John Kennedy told Stretch that he doubted Facebook’s ability to stop people overseas from buying U.S. election ads. U.S. law bars election spending by non-Americans.

“You’ve got 5 million advertisers and you’re going to tell me that you’re able to trace the origin of all those advertisements?” Kennedy asked Stretch.

The Facebook lawyer responded that there was little the company could do if a foreign advertiser used a U.S. shell corporation.

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the crime subcommittee, said he wanted to help the tech companies, but he also pressed Stretch on whether Iran and North Korea could try to do what Russia did in the United States.

Stretch responded: “Certainly potentially. The internet is borderless.”

Hanging over Facebook, Google and Twitter is the threat of legislation that would extend rules governing political advertising on television, radio and satellite to also cover social media.

The companies have responded with proposals for self-regulation, saying they would create their own public archives of election-related ads.

Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar told witnesses on Tuesday that self-regulation would lead to a “patchwork” of databases and that a uniform system would be better for voters.",U.S. senators hammer Facebook for power over elections,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-socialmedia/u-s-senators-hammer-facebook-for-power-over-elections-idUSKBN1D014V

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

About 60,000 refugees and migrants, mostly Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis, have become stranded in Greece after border closures in the Balkans halted the onward journey many planned to take to central and western Europe.

Nearly 148,084 refugees and migrants have crossed to Greece from Turkey this year - a fraction of the nearly 1 million arrivals in 2015 - but arrivals have picked up in recent months.

An average of 214 people arrived each day in September, up from 156 in August, 87 in July and 56 in March, Mouzalas said.

The rise has stretched Greek island camps, which are struggling to cope with numbers two to three times their capacity. Most new arrivals are women and children, according to United Nations data.

Mouzalas said the government was in talks with local authorities to move refugees and migrants to local accommodation, including hotels, and it also planned to increase the capacity of some facilities.","Refugees in Greece demand transfer to Germany, start hunger strike",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-greece/refugees-in-greece-demand-transfer-to-germany-start-hunger-strike-idUSKBN1D14UQ

REUTERS/Axel Schmidt

Talks between conservatives, Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) resumed on Monday after Chancellor Angela Merkel convened a weekend meeting to clear the air between ideologically diverse parties forced by electoral arithmetic into awkward partnership.

“The weekend pause for thought did us good,” said Andreas Scheuer, a leader in the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU). Other party leaders agreed.

But Monday’s talks, on education, digitalization, pensions and labor issues, as well as domestic security, were always expected to be less contentious than the immigration, fiscal and climate policies that divided them last week.

One sign of the division came in an interview Merkel ally Peter Altmaier gave to the newspaper Die Zeit, where he shot down media reports about a reshuffling of ministerial portfolios. Der Spiegel magazine reported the FDP might head a weakened finance ministry, with key European affairs functions hived off to another ministry.

The PYD says it is not fighting to win independence, but to ensure any post-war constitution gives autonomy to regions.
“This vision is counter to reality and stands against the democratic solution,” said Hasan, who was elected to his post in September, replacing Saleh Muslim.
Hasan did not respond to a question of whether the PYD would seek Assad’s removal from office, the core demand of the Syrian opposition.
The invitation to Sochi marks the first time the Syrian Kurds have been asked to attend a major peace conference.","BEIRUT (Reuters) - The head of Syria’s main Kurdish political party indicated on Wednesday his group favours attending a Russian-sponsored peace congress later this month, the first time the Kurds would participate in a major diplomatic push to end the war.

Shahoz Hasan said his Democratic Union Party (PYD) would advocate for its decentralised model for Syria, which it says is the only way to end the six-year-old conflict that has made half of Syrians homeless and killed hundreds of thousands.

“We tabled the democratic federal solution in mid-March of 2016, and without it there are no solutions but only rendering the Syrian crisis permanent,” Hasan, PYD co-chair, said in written responses to questions from Reuters.

Although he did not firmly commit to attending the Nov. 18 peace conference in the Russian Black Sea city of Sochi, he said a majority among the PYD and its allies now favoured going: “We are discussing it and the majority view is to attend”.

The PYD has emerged as one of the most powerful players in Syria since the eruption of the civil war in 2011.

Its armed affiliate, the YPG, controls swathes of northern Syria where Kurdish-led local administrations have been set up.

They are allied to the United States as the core of the Syrian Defence Forces (SDF) that, with U.S. air support and ground advisers, drove Islamic State from much of northern Syria and captured the militants’ de facto capital Raqqa last month.

The main rebel groups fighting to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad are planning to boycott the Nov. 18 peace congress in Sochi, which Moscow says will focus on a new constitution.

But attendance by the PYD could be important if it yields steps towards rapprochement between the Russian-backed government and the U.S.-backed Kurds, which between them now control most of the country.

KURDS, GOVERNMENT AVOID CLASHES

The Kurds and the government have largely avoided fighting each other during the multi-sided civil war, with both concentrating instead on fighting other enemies such as Islamic State and Arab rebels hostile to both Assad and the YPG.

The PYD says it is not fighting to win independence, but to ensure any post-war constitution gives autonomy to regions. In September, its administrations held the first part of a three-phase election that will conclude in January with the establishment of a parliament.

Syria’s foreign minister said in September that Kurdish autonomy demands were negotiable. But Damascus recently toughened its stance, declaring on Sunday that Raqqa was under SDF “occupation” and the city would only be considered liberated once the Syrian army recovered it.

Hasan said this showed Damascus was “moving away from the democratic solution” and returning to its old stance “that there is no revolutionary movement in Syria and that the pre-2011 Syria can be recreated”.

“This vision is counter to reality and stands against the democratic solution,” said Hasan, who was elected to his post in September, replacing Saleh Muslim.

He added that solving the crisis required a three-year period of political transition. Hasan did not respond to a question of whether the PYD would seek Assad’s removal from office, the core demand of the Syrian opposition.

The YPG has previously said it would have “no problem with the regime” if Kurdish rights were guaranteed.

The invitation to Sochi marks the first time the Syrian Kurds have been asked to attend a major peace conference. The PYD has been left out of diplomacy in line with the wishes of Turkey, which views it as an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party that has fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey.

Hasan said “the broad lines and fundamental elements that guarantee the solution” should be agreed ahead of time, otherwise the congress would amount to “a media carnival”.","Syrian Kurds favour attending Russia-backed peace talks, party head says",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-pyd/syrian-kurds-favour-attending-russia-backed-peace-talks-party-head-says-idUKKBN1D151T?il=0

The suspect, who was shot by police and arrested moments after the Tuesday rampage in lower Manhattan, left a note saying he carried out the attack in the name of the militant Islamic State group, the New York Times and CNN said.

It was the deadliest single attack on New York City since Sept. 11, 2001, when suicide hijackers crashed two jetliners into the World Trade Center, killing more than 2,600 people. A further 11 people were injured in Tuesday’s attack.

Similar assaults using vehicles as weapons took place in Spain in August and in France and Germany last year.

The suspect allegedly swerved the pickup onto a path filled with pedestrians and bicyclists on a sunny autumn afternoon, mowing down people in his path before slamming into the side of a school bus.

He then exited the vehicle brandishing what turned out to be a paint-ball gun and a pellet gun before a police officer shot him in the abdomen.

The attack, which left crumpled bicycles scattered along the path and victims writhing on the ground, was over in seconds.

The suspect underwent surgery for gunshot wounds.

Police declined to publicly identify the man, but a source familiar with the investigation said his name was Sayfullo Saipov, 29. He reportedly lived in Paterson, New Jersey, a one-time industrial hub about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of lower Manhattan.

He had rented the pickup from a Home Depot Inc hardware store which, according to media accounts, was located in Passaic, just south of Paterson.

U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham urged authorities to treat Saipov as an enemy combatant, a move that would allow investigators to question the man without him having a lawyer present.

ARGENTINE FRIENDS AMONG DEAD

Six victims were pronounced dead at the scene and two more at a nearby hospital, Police Commissioner James O‘Neill said.

Five of the dead were Argentine tourists, visiting New York as part of a group of friends celebrating the 30th anniversary of their high school graduation, the government there said. Belgium’s foreign minister said a Belgian citizen was also among those killed.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said police will be out in force to protect the city’s marathon on Sunday, one of the world’s top road races, which draws some 51,000 runners from around the globe.

“You’ll see a lot of officers with long guns. Other things you won’t see that are protecting us,” he told MSNBC.

A U.S. law enforcement official described the suspect as a U.S. immigrant born in Uzbekistan, a predominantly Muslim country in Central Asia that was once part of the former Soviet Union. CNN and NBC News said he entered the United States in 2010.

Uzbekistan’s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said his government would do all it could to help investigate the “extremely brutal” attack.

Authorities late on Tuesday surrounded a house in Paterson where, according to the New York Times, Saipov was believed to have lived. Paterson, known for its large immigrant population, is home to about 150,000 people, including 25,000 to 30,000 Muslims.

ABC News reported that Saipov had lived in Tampa, Florida. A check of court records related to a traffic citation that Saipov received in eastern Pennsylvania in 2015 showed he listed addresses then in Paterson and Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio.

CNN and other media outlets, citing police officials, reported that the suspect shouted “Allahu Akbar” - Arabic for “God is greatest” - when he jumped out of his truck.

Although authorities from the mayor’s office to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security all swiftly branded the attack an act of terrorism, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo stressed that the suspect was believed to have acted alone.

The New York Times said Saipov had come to the attention of law enforcement in the past. It cited three officials as saying federal authorities knew of Saipov from an unrelated probe, although it was unclear whether that was because he had ties to someone who was under scrutiny or because he was the target of an investigation.

Last week an Uzbekistan citizen living in Brooklyn was sentenced to 15 years in prison for conspiring to support Islamic State.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has pressed for a ban on travelers entering the United States from some predominantly Muslim countries, said on Twitter that he had ordered Homeland Security officials to “step up our already Extreme Vetting Program. Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!”

He also criticized the U.S. visa system, blaming Democrats and saying that he wanted a ‘merit based’ program for immigrants to the United States.

A section of the Juba barracks camp, Freetown, Sierra Leone, September 21, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation / Eromo Egbejule

In the early morning of Aug. 14, a major mudslide hit Mount Sugarloaf, which overlooks the capital city, slicing it in two.

The collapse killed 400 people, with hundreds more still missing, and left an estimated 3,000 homeless.

Corpses floated in the flood waters, while some families were forced to dig for the bodies of their loved ones under the rubble. Deen’s wife and six children back home in the Pentagon New Site slum on the mountain slopes survived, but his four brothers, sister-in-law and his nephew were killed.

Home to a little over 1 million people according to a 2015 census, Freetown’s population swelled at the turn of the century as citizens in rural areas fled a decade-long civil war that ended in 2002.

The city was originally designed to house only around 300,000 people, and is now struggling to meet basic needs for housing, electricity, sewage and water, said Jamie Hitchen, a policy researcher at the London-based Africa Research Institute.

Homes are being built in areas identified as “at risk”, and despite the creation of an EU-funded Freetown Development Plan in 2014, city planning has been given little priority, he added.

“So far the government’s response to annual floods has been superficial and short-term,” Hitchen told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “Urban management problems are one of the major causes, along with deforestation and climate change.”

Freetown, initially designed by colonial-era British administrators, has been plagued by heavy rains and flooding yearly since 2008.

Its many slums and informal settlements are built high on mountain slopes, leaving tens of thousands of inhabitants vulnerable to death and displacement when the rains come.

Builders have encroached into protected forest areas on the hills behind the city, causing soil erosion - a phenomenon that contributed to the August landslide.

Officials at Freetown City Council said there are laws to prevent illegal construction, but these are often flouted or permits obtained through bribery.

In 2014, the Sierra Leone Urban Research Centre carried out an environmental assessment to map areas at risk of flooding, but the government did not act on it.

“Over the years, many people were displaced by crisis including the... civil war, so many people escaped to the city and built houses in areas where they shouldn‘t,” said Cornelius Deveaux, deputy minister of information.

CHEAP BUT RISKY

High levels of poverty, however, are putting slum communities at risk of disasters.

In a country where GDP per capita is $1,400 and 60 percent of people live on less than $1.25 a day, according to U.N. data, having a home is judged as more important than safety.

Parts of the Regent area where the August disaster happened remain at risk of further landslides and flooding but many residents say they have nowhere else to go.

“The closer to the mountain you go, the cheaper (it is) to rent houses for your family,” said Salim Bangura, 38, who lives with his wife in Congo Town slum.

“Some of us don’t have electricity but we need a roof over our head as we struggle to make ends meet,” said Bangura, who gets by peddling food and household goods.

He and his neighbors know that in a pre-election year, politicians may make promises of mass housing to get them to move, but they have been offered nothing yet.

“This is the only life we know,” he said.

CAMPS TO CLOSE

All eight members of Deen’s family are living in a small tent in Juba camp, alongside nearly 500 people who lost their homes in the mudslide.

Food, clothing and medicine come mostly from relief agencies including the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which has refurbished the only health center near the disaster zone.

Kim Eva Dickson, UNFPA head in Sierra Leone, said it was providing women and girls with antenatal care, ultrasound scans, mother and baby kits, and personal hygiene supplies.

Among disaster-hit communities living in temporary shelters, “the risks of unwanted pregnancies ... sexually transmitted diseases and gender-based violence increases,” she said.

The government, meanwhile, has provided counseling for the bereaved still grieving over lost relatives and possessions.

Public resources were stretched thin by the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak that killed over 4,000 people in Sierra Leone. But the government is giving cash totaling about $171 to each family affected by the mudslide, with the last payment due in November.

It plans to close the two formal camps in mid-November, leaving their more than 2,000 residents with a choice of taking a cash payment or moving to new homes being built for them.

Households that opt for cash will each get about $284 to help them rebuild their lives - enough to rent a one-bedroom apartment in downtown Freetown for a year.

The government has an agreement with local companies to construct 53 houses on the outskirts of the city for displaced families, and is in talks with other investors to build more homes for survivors.

This is separate from a long-term plan to create affordable housing for about 35,000 citizens in all, said Deveaux.

NEW HOMES SHUNNED

Deen has heard the government is building free housing estates at 6 Mile on the outskirts of Freetown, but said there has been little information about the project.

Previous government action has made local people wary.

After floods in 2015, the government evicted some 100 families living in Crab Town slum, and moved them to a location about 20 km (12 miles) from Freetown.

But they were back in the capital a couple of months later having rented out their new homes, said Hitchen.

The new housing stock was better than in the slums, but the village lacked basic amenities, work opportunities were few and people were cut off from their community networks.

“We don’t want to go to somewhere without knowing what we are getting into,” said Deen.",Mudslide in Sierra Leone exposes dangers of Freetown's unchecked sprawl,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D14XD-OZATP

Putin and his Iranian hosts are expected to discuss the nuclear deal and regional crises such as the Syrian conflict, in which Moscow and Tehran are the main backers of President Bashar al-Assad, while Washington, Turkey and most Arab states support opposition groups seeking to overthrow him.

“We are very pleased that, apart from our bilateral relations, our two countries play an important role in securing peace and stability in the region,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told Putin in his welcoming remarks.

Russian and Iranian help has proved crucial for Assad, allowing him to win a series of military victories since 2015 and to reestablish his control over most of Syria. Moscow is now trying to build on that success with a new diplomatic push, including a meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sochi next month.

Moscow is also an important ally for Iran in its confrontation with the Trump administration, which on Oct. 13 refused to certify Tehran’s two-year-old nuclear deal with six major powers that include Russia and the United States.

Russia has criticized Trump’s move, which has opened a 60-day window for Congress to act to reimpose economic sanctions on Iran. These were lifted under the 2015 accord in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear program.

“This is a very important visit (by Putin) ... It shows the determination of Tehran and Moscow to deepen their strategic alliance.... which will shape the future of the Middle East,” one Iranian official told Reuters, on condition of anonymity.

“Both Russia and Iran are under American pressure ... Tehran has no other choice but to rely on Moscow to ease the U.S. pressure,” said the official.

Another Iranian official said Trump’s aggressive Iran policy had united Iran’s faction-ridden leadership in alignment with Russia.

The Fed has raised rates twice since January and currently forecasts one more hike by the end of the year as part of a tightening cycle that began in late 2015.

Investors have all but ruled out a move at the end of this week’s two-day policy meeting. The Fed is due to issue its latest policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).

Markets will look to it for confirmation the central bank is on track for a December rate hike, though attention will quickly turn to who will be in charge of monetary policy at the end of Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s first term in February 2018.

President Donald Trump, who has interviewed Yellen, Fed Governor Jerome Powell and three others for the top Fed job, is likely to announce the nomination on Thursday.

Powell, a soft-spoken centrist who has supported Yellen’s gradual approach to raising rates, is seen as having a lock on the position.

“The bottom line is the meeting is probably going to be a somewhat boring event for markets, overshadowed by the expected Fed chair decision,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank.

INFLATION WORRIES

Fed policymakers have been buoyed in recent months by a strengthening U.S. economy and further tightening in the labor market, although inflation has continued to remain below the central bank’s 2 percent target.

The economy unexpectedly maintained a brisk pace of growth in the third quarter, increasing at a 3.0 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department reported last week.

A decline in hiring in September also has largely been dismissed as a blip caused by the temporary displacement of workers due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. That jobs report also showed wages growing at an encouraging pace and the unemployment rate falling to more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent.

A strong rebound in job gains is anticipated when the Labor Department releases its October nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.

Inflation is the main concern for Fed policymakers who are wondering about the causes and duration of the current weakness. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation sits at 1.3 percent after retreating further from target for much of the year.

Nevertheless, Yellen and other key policymakers have said the Fed, which unveiled a plan this year to cut its balance sheet starting in October, still expects to continue to gradually raise rates given the economy’s strength. That is not expected to change on Wednesday.

“If we get what we expect to get, which is basically more of the same of what we saw in the September statement,” said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo, “then yes, their gradual policy tightening plan is in place and all signs point to a December hike.”",Fed set to hold rates steady ahead of Trump's leadership decision,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed/fed-set-to-hold-rates-steady-ahead-of-trumps-leadership-decision-idINKBN1D13KB

Veselnitskaya represented Prevezon Holdings Ltd, a Russian-controlled company, which in May this year agreed to pay nearly $6 million to the U.S. government to settle a $230 million Russian tax fraud case related to Hermitage Capital, an American fund that invested in Russia.

In a court filing in federal court in Manhattan on Monday U.S. prosecutors said the settlement payment was due on Oct. 31, but in a letter on Tuesday filed in federal court in Manhattan lawyers for Prevezon disagreed.

About half of the settlement money was supposed to come from 3 million euros owed to Prevezon that the U.S. government had asked the Netherlands to freeze.

The Netherlands lifted the hold on the money on October 10, but the same day imposed a new freeze on the account based on a complaint by William Browder, chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management, the Prevezon letter said.

In Monday’s court filing, U.S. prosecutors said the $6 million payment was due regardless of the new freeze on the funds and they intended to file a motion to enforce the settlement.

In its letter, Prevezon asked the court to help obtain temporary U.S. immigration status for Veselnitskaya and its owner, Denis Katsyv, so she could attend upcoming hearings about the dispute.

Veselnitskaya met Donald Trump Jr in New York last year while she was in the United States to represent Prevezon in the money laundering case.

Trump Jr. said in a statement at the time that he and Veselnitskaya “primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children” after Russia in 2012 banned adoptions of Russian children by Americans in retaliation for sanctions imposed under the U.S. Magnitsky Act.

The Magnitsky Act was passed by Congress after Hermitage Capital’s Browder claimed that the tax fraud scheme involving Prevezon was uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky, an auditor for Hermitage Capital, who died in a Russian prison.

Trump Jr. has released emails related to the meeting during last year’s election that described Veselnitskaya as a Russian government attorney who could provide information that would “incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”",Russian lawyer who met Trump Jr. seeks return to U.S. to defend money laundering settlement,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-lawyer/russian-lawyer-who-met-trump-jr-seeks-return-to-u-s-to-defend-money-laundering-settlement-idUSKBN1D139W

The milestone confirms the renaissance of Sony, one a byword for technological innovation whose earnings peaked in the year ending March 1998 thanks to strong sales of its first PlayStation games console.

But it spent the next decade in price wars with emerging consumer electronics rivals from South Korea and China whilst being outclassed by Apple Inc’s game-changing iPod and iPhone portable devices.

Hirai’s ascent in 2012 sparked a restructuring drive that saw Sony streamline unprofitable electronics businesses and capitalize on the spread of smartphones with its image sensors whilst retaining a living-room presence with its consoles.

Setting a new record “means we have been unable to outgrow ourselves for 20 years,” Chief Financial Officer Kenichiro Yoshida said at an earnings briefing. “Our next challenge is how to maintain high profit levels, and that’s the biggest theme in the midterm business plan we are compiling.”

Sony raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 26 percent to 630 billion yen ($5.57 billion), citing strong sales of image sensors as well as high-end television sets. That compared with a Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate of 585.81 billion yen drawn from the views of 26 analysts.

The forecast is 20 percent above its current profit record, set when strong sales of consumer electronics coincided with the popularity of the first PlayStation and its entertainment business’ box-office hit “Men in Black”.

For July-September, profit jumped almost 350 percent to 204.2 billion yen, outstripping analyst estimates.

FUTURE GROWTH

Sony’s stock price has reached nine-year highs since Hirai embarked on the firm’s overhaul. But the price has plateaued in recent months due to scepticism about future growth, when the PlayStation 4 enters the late stages of its life and a profit boost thanks to recovery from earthquake damage disappears.

Damage to a sensor plant last year left the semiconductor division, which include sensors, reporting a loss. Sony expects profit of 150 billion yen this year, an increase of 15 percent from an earlier estimate due to a rise in its outlook for demand from Chinese smartphone manufacturers.

To develop new profit drivers, Sony has boosted investment in artificial intelligence to catch up with U.S. technology peers such as Amazon Inc and Alphabet Inc.

It unveiled its Xperia Hello! voice-activated communication robot this month and is widely expected to revive robotic pets, similar to its robotic dog AIBO that went on sale in 1999. It also aims to lead the budding virtual-reality market by drawing on the content portion of its business such as music and film.

In sensors, Sony is trying to grow in automotive, where demand is rising as vehicles increasingly feature functions based on sensing technologies such as autonomous driving.

Yoshida said Sony is also working to stabilize profit by expanding businesses that generate recurring revenue, citing as an example revenue from in-game purchases.

Instead, the struggle will, as it did during the fight against the Sunni extremists of Islamic State, involve shifting Sunni and Shi’ite allegiances.

For the moment, there seems to be an easing in the historic tensions between the two main – and often warring – branches of Islam. Religious differences are not the focus; this is a classic geopolitical power struggle for control of Iraq, Syria, and Kurdistan, and for expanding diplomatic and strategic reach throughout the region.

Iran is lined up to be the big winner in Syria. Islamic State's defeat will significantly lessen Sunni influence, and Tehran’s role as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's protector will only increase now that it appears Assad will remain in control of some portion of the country. Iran will have pieced together a land corridor to the Mediterranean. The Saudis will be left with little influence.

The same goes for the United States. American forces have been largely relegated to playing traffic cop among various on-again off-again allies such as the Turks and Kurds, each with its own agenda in Syria. Any influence Washington thinks it still has is further diluted by the presence of the Russians, who are there to support Assad while maintaining a permanent presence in the heart of the Middle East. American efforts may wind up as little more than fumbling around to keep Israel and Jordan from overreacting to the increased Iranian influence on their borders.

In Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, Riyadh appears to be pivoting towards warmer relations with the Shi’ite government in Baghdad. That a Saudi airline is announcing the first return of direct service between the two countries since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 is no coincidence, nor is it an isolated event.

The Saudis also appear ready to take advantage of a looming intra-Shi’ite power struggle in Baghdad among Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, and Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Sadr, the most religiously zealous of the group, has always been something of a nationalist and is wary of Iranian influence. It is thus not surprising he made friendly trips under official invitation to Sunni Riyadh, and the United Arab Emirates, in recent months.

Sadr is an interesting choice for the Saudis to use to gain influence in Baghdad. Real progress for Riyadh means untangling years of close Iranian cooperation in Iraq, to include limiting the power of the Iranian-backed militias. Sadr has significant influence in that respect, and can use his popularity and credibility to sell Saudi cooperation to his followers who remember Saudi funding of al Qaeda in Iraq and Islamic State over the years. Enhancing Sadr's Shi’ite religious status can further Sunni Saudi goals. During his visit, the Saudis gifted Sadr with $10 million for “rebuilding,” and also astutely threw in some visas for this year’s Hajj pilgrimage for Sadr to distribute.

The Saudis otherwise have little to work with in Iraq compared to Iran. Tehran’s ties to officials in Baghdad are just a tiny part of a deep relationship forged in the bloody fight against the American occupiers and the ousting of Islamic State. Iranian money continues to support Iraq, and the Shi’ite militias are still mostly under Iranian influence.

Iran is also probably the most stable Muslim nation in the Middle East. It has existed more or less within its current borders for thousands of years, and is largely religiously, culturally, and linguistically homogeneous (though keep an eye on the Kurdish minority.) While governed in significant part by its clerics, the country has held a series of increasingly democratic elections. And unlike the Saudi monarchs, Iran’s leaders do not rule in fear of an Islamic revolution. They already had one.

Power struggles create flashpoints, and the Saudi-Iranian fight post-Islamic State is no exception. The Saudi-Iranian proxy war in Yemen has settled into a version of World War One-style trench warfare, with neither side strong enough to win nor weak enough to lose. In an ugly form of stasis, the conflict seems likely to stay within its present borders.

The powder keg is Kurdistan. Though arguably a de facto state since 2003, after the Kurds voted formally voted for independence in a Sept. 25 referendum, Iran and the Iranian-backed government in Baghdad were pressed to make clear they will not tolerate an actual Kurdish nation. With Islamic State nearly defeated and combat-tested Shi’ite militias ready for their next tasks, Tehran and Baghdad no longer need to keep the Kurds on their side. Fighting has already broken out around Kirkuk, an oil-rich city in Iraqi Kurdistan, between forces supported by Baghdad/Tehran and Kurdish fighters – leaving a gap for the Saudis to offer financial or covert support to the Iraqi Kurds.

Saudi involvement could morph an Iraqi civil war into a new proxy struggle right on Iran’s own western border, with the possible complication of further unrest inside Iran by its Kurdish minority.

Nor are American troops likely to battle Iranian-led militias in support of Kurdish independence that Washington says it doesn’t really support right now.

That leaves the United States sidelined, with few options other than perhaps supporting the Saudis from afar in whatever anti-Iranian meddling they do in Iraq.

Using the so-called “New York channel,” Joseph Yun, U.S. negotiator with North Korea, has been in contact with diplomats at Pyongyang’s United Nations mission, the official said, at a time when an exchange of bellicose insults between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has fueled fears of military conflict.

While U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Oct. 17 said he would continue “diplomatic efforts ... until the first bomb drops,” the official’s comments were the clearest sign the United States was directly discussing issues beyond the release of American prisoners, despite Trump having dismissed direct talks as pointless.

There is no sign, however, that the behind-the-scenes communications have improved a relationship vexed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, the death of U.S. university student Otto Warmbier days after his release by Pyongyang in June and the detention of three other Americans.

Word of quiet engagement with Pyongyang comes despite Trump’s comments, North Korea’s weapons advances and suggestions by some U.S. and South Korean officials that Yun’s interactions with North Koreans had been reined in.

“It has not been limited at all, both (in) frequency and substance,” said the senior State Department official.

Among the points that Yun has made to his North Korean interlocutors is to “stop testing” nuclear bombs and missiles, the official said.

North Korea this year conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear detonation and has test-fired a volley of missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that, if perfected, could in theory reach the United States mainland.

The possibility that Pyongyang may be closer to attaching a nuclear warhead to an ICBM has alarmed the Trump administration, which in April unveiled a policy of “maximum pressure and engagement” that has so far failed to deter North Korea.

At the start of Trump’s presidency, Yun’s instructions were limited to seeking the release of U.S. prisoners.

“It is (now) a broader mandate than that,” said the State Department official, declining, however, to address whether authority had been given to discuss North Korea’s nuclear and missile program.

In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China welcomed any dialogue between the United States and North Korea.

“We encourage North Korea and the United States to carry out engagement and dialogue,” Hua told reporters, adding that she hoped talks could help return the issue to a diplomatic track for resolution.

SANCTIONS AND ENGAGEMENT

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has urged all United Nations members to fully and transparently implement sanctions against North Korea, which he said has emerged as a global threat.

Speaking at the United Nations on Sept. 19, Trump vowed to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened the United States or its allies, raising anxieties about the possibility of military conflict.

Twelve days later, after Tillerson said Washington was probing for a diplomatic opening, Trump said on Twitter that his chief diplomat was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man” - his mocking nickname for the North Korean leader.

Democratic U.S. senators introduced a bill on Tuesday they said would prevent Trump from launching a nuclear first strike on North Korea on his own, highlighting the issue days before the Republican’s first presidential trip to Asia.

A high-ranking North Korean defector said in Washington on Tuesday that he backed the Trump administration’s policy of pressuring Pyongyang through sanctions, coupled with “maximum engagement” with the leadership and increased efforts to get information into North Korea to educate its people.

“I strongly believe in the use of soft power before taking any military actions,” Thae Yong Ho, chief of mission at Pyongyang’s embassy in London until he defected in 2016, told the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

The New York channel is one of the few conduits the United States has for communicating with North Korea, which has itself made clear it has little interest in serious talks before it develops a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the continental United States.

The last high-level contact between Yun and the North Koreans was when he traveled to North Korea in June to secure the release of Warmbier, who died shortly after he returned home in a coma, the State Department official said.

The Trump administration has demanded North Korea release three other U.S. citizens: missionary Kim Dong Chul and academics Tony Kim and Kim Hak Song.

Warmbier’s death was a factor in the chilling of U.S.-North Korean contacts around that time but the biggest impact came from Pyongyang’s stepped-up testing, the official said.

The official said, however, that “the preferred endpoint is not a war but some kind of diplomatic settlement” and suggestions that Washington is setting up a binary choice for Pyongyang to capitulate diplomatically or military action were “misleading.”

Diplomacy, the official said, “has a lot more room to go.”

JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N) rose about 1 percent, while Goldman Sachs’ (GS.N) 1.5 percent increase gave the biggest boost to the Dow.

The rise was also supported by Facebook’s (FB.O) 1.4 percent gain ahead of its earnings report.

U.S. private employers hired 235,000 workers in October, the most since March and exceeding a median forecast of 200,000 among economists polled by Reuters, the ADP National Employment Report showed.

“We’re in a very positive environment,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey.

“Economic data and earnings continue to remain a reason for optimism. The market will look for signs of a robust economy, and I think the momentum is in place.”

Following the strong ADP data, focus shifts to Friday’s non-farm payrolls report for October. The data will reveal if the labor market has strengthened after a hurricane-ravaged September.

Third-quarter earnings have been largely positive, with 72.9 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported topping profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is above the 72 percent profit-beat rate in the past four quarters.

Estee Lauder (EL.N) jumped nearly 10 percent after the cosmetics maker reported better-than-expected sales and profit.

US Steel (X.N) surged 14 percent and Garmin (GRMN.O) climbed 3.7 percent after strong earnings.

The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the end of its two-day meeting later today as speculation swirls on who will be its next leader, but will likely point to a firming economy as it edges closer to a possible rate rise next month.

The White House has said President Donald Trump will announce his Fed pick on Thursday. Trump is expected to choose Fed Governor Jerome Powell, who is seen as more stock-market friendly, sources have told Reuters.

The court has been center stage since it annulled an Aug. 8 vote won by President Uhuru Kenyatta, citing procedural irregularities and ordering a repeat vote within 60 days.

The decision was the first of its kind in Africa, where governments often hold sway over judges. It angered some of Kenyatta’s supporters, who said the judges had thwarted the will of the people.

Kenyatta won 98 percent of the vote in the Oct. 26 re-run after opposition leader Raila Odinga boycotted it on the grounds it would not be fair because the election board had failed to implement reforms he sought after the court decision.

The Supreme Court had been due to meet on Oct. 25 to deliberate on an eleventh-hour request to delay the re-run. But the day before, the bodyguard of its deputy chief justice was shot as he bought pot plants beside a highway.

Only Chief Justice David Maraga turned up for the Oct. 25 hearing. Without a minimum quorum of five judges, Maraga said the court could not make a ruling on the petition, paving the way for the election re-run to go ahead.

Asked about the request by the judges, Interior ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said security for all judges was enhanced in the wake of the shooting. “If anybody is telling you to the contrary, they are not telling the truth,” he told Reuters.

The government said the bodyguard’s shooting was a robbery rather than an attempt to intimidate the judges, whom Kenyatta had branded as “crooks” after they voided the August election.

Treating the shooting as a regular crime angered the judges, who demanded they get extra security, the judicial source said.

“In Kenya, ordinary criminals don’t attack government vehicles driven by armed government agents who know how to shoot,” the source said.

The justices demanded that their security should be publicly guaranteed given the tensions over the election or else they would refuse to attend hearings, the source said. At least 55 people have died in political violence since the August vote.

The European Union monitoring mission raised the issue of intimidation after the Supreme Court hearing failed to go ahead on Oct. 25, saying it was vital that judges be allowed to work “in freedom and safety”.

“We aren’t satisfied with our top-line growth and we are addressing these issues by controlling everything that is within our control,” CEO Jim Smith told analysts on an earnings call.

Although earnings-per-share beat estimates in part due to cost controls, the revenue miss pushed shares down 6.5 percent to $43.81 on the New York Stock Exchange; they were at C$56.59 in Toronto.

The results highlight the need for Thomson Reuters to find ways to generate revenue outside of managing costs, said Doug Arthur, an analyst at Huber Research Partners.

“People understand the company is doing a great job on costs,” Arthur said. “But there has been a lot of anticipation that revenues are going to hit an inflection point, and it’s just not happening.”

In its Financial & Risk segment, the company’s biggest, sales outpaced cancellations, a key indicator of future growth. Overall revenue for the unit was up slightly, but was down one percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa.

Specifically, British and European financial services clients are concerned about upcoming EU securities rules, set to take effect in January, as well as Brexit, Smith said.

”The quarter was the tale of two cities, or more like the tale of two continents,“ as the company saw unexpected softness in the UK and Europe and strength in the Americas,” Smith told Reuters. “We heard from the market, that was largely because of upcoming regulatory changes.”

Thomson Reuters still expects year-over-year growth in its financial business in 2017 and 2018, but the extent of the improvement will depend on fourth-quarter net sales, executives said on the call.

The company sees a stronger pipeline of deals for its Financial & Risk unit, Smith said.

The news and information company said full-year profits will be at the high end of its earlier forecast.

Third-quarter net earnings rose to $348 million, or 46 cents per share, from $286 million, or 36 cents per share, a year ago.

Adjusted for special items, earnings were 68 cents per share.

Total revenue grew 1 percent excluding currency to $2.79 billion. Sales in its legal business rose 1 percent to $843 million.

Analysts on average, were looking for profit of 58 cents per share, and revenue of $2.82 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/.

On October 5, the militant group lost the northern town of Hawija – its last urban stronghold after Iraqi forces recaptured Mosul and Tal Afar earlier this year. The brutal battles for these cities have been well documented. Less noticed, however, has been how the near-total defeat of IS is reshaping political and sectarian alliances in the region.

The rise and fall of IS has had a sobering and unifying effect on relationships between Sunnis and Shi’ites. In Iraq, where thousands died in the vicious sectarian war that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein, residents of the mainly-Sunni cities of Mosul and Hawija nonetheless jubilantly welcomed the mostly-Shi’ite Iraqi forces who freed the cities from the Sunni extremists of IS. “They helped liberate us,” one Hawija Sunni leader told the New York Times of the fighters. Nor does a Shi’ite backlash against Sunnis seem imminent given Shi’ite recognition of Sunni suffering in the IS-occupied cities.

The IS experience has affected Iranian politics too. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei seemed to show a softer attitude toward Sunnis in a rare pronouncement – seen as carrying the weight of a fatwa – publicly prohibiting any discrimination against minorities. Sunnis have fewer rights than Shi’ites in Iran, and Khamenei’s August comment was made in response to an inquiry by Molavi Abdul Hamid, a prominent Sunni cleric from Iran's impoverished Sunni-dominated Sistan-Baluchistan province on the Pakistan border. In Syria too, IS's faster-than-expected battlefield defeats suggest that the group does not enjoy much local support among the Sunni tribes and populations it has been ruling for the past couple of years.

The biggest changes can be seen in Iraq, where Shi’ite leaders’ attempts to develop a post-IS foreign policy are driven in part by fear of Iran’s growing influence and in part by the IS-inflicted suffering in Iraq. Many observers believe that the pursuit of sectarian policies at the expense of Iraqi Sunnis – as systematically practiced under the former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki – expedited the rise of IS.

The result of the new dynamic is that Iraq’s main Shi’ite leaders are distancing themselves from Iran as they make once-unthinkable overtures to the region’s Sunni Arab bloc. In one of the latest signs of that shift, Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar Al-Abadi declined Tehran’s official invitation to take part in President Hassan Rouhani’s second-term inauguration ceremony on August 5. Such a refusal would have been unimaginable a few years ago.

Similarly, prominent Shi’ite leaders such as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and Moqtada al-Sadr snubbed Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, the newly-appointed chairman of Iran’s Expediency Council – a governing body set up to mediate disputes between Parliament and the Council of Guardians over whether planned legislation conforms with Islamic law – during an official visit to Iraq as the envoy of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.

Underscoring the point, Baghdad publicly slammed a deal made by Hezbollah, Iran’s chief proxy in the region, to evacuate a group of IS fighters from Lebanon to eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border. The Tehran-backed agreement was “unacceptable” and “an insult to the Iraqi people,” Prime Minister Abadi said in August.

Iranian influence on Iraq’s domestic politics is shrinking too. Ammar al-Hakim resigned as head of the Tehran-backed Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq – the country’s largest Shi’ite party – a month after a June meeting with Khalid al-Faisal, the governor of Mecca and an informal advisor to Saudi Arabia’s King Salman. Hakim promptly went on to form the National Wisdom Movement, a political party to “embrace” all Iraqis.

At the same time, Iran-funded, Shi’ite-dominated militias known as Popular Mobilization Forces are divided over whether they should be integrated into the regular Iraqi army – a measure that would loosen Iran’s foothold in Iraq’s security apparatus – or whether they should remain independent of the Iraqi government. Groups loyal to Sadr and Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani have started taking steps to register with the army; those led by Hadi al-Amiri of the Badr Organization and Qais al-Khazali of Asaib Ahl al-Haq remain in the pro-Iran camp.

Against this backdrop, Iraq is trying to improve its ties with Saudi Arabia. In addition to several recent diplomatic visits between the two countries, including one by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to Riyadh, Moqtada al-Sadr – an influential Shi’ite cleric with a large following among Iraq’s urban poor – made rare and well-received visits to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. After meeting with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, Sadr issued a statement saying that he was “very pleased with what we found to be a positive breakthrough in the Saudi-Iraqi relations,” and that he hoped it was “the beginning of the retreat of sectarian strife in the Arab-Islamic region."" Sadr’s Aug. 13 meeting with Emirati crown prince Zayed al-Nahayan appeared equally successful. “Experience has taught us to always call for what brings Arabs and Muslims together, and to reject the advocates of division,” Nahyan told Sadr, in a veiled reference to Iran as one of the dividers.

It is clearly in Iraq’s strategic interests to diversify its relationships beyond reflexive sectarian or ideological lines. Improved ties with Riyadh pave the way for Baghdad to receive much-needed financial aid from Saudi Arabia and establish an economic relationship that could help counter the political and military influence established when Iran cultivated Shi’ite proxies to fight U.S.-backed forces in Iraq. The outreach can also signal to Iraq’s Sunni minority that the Baghdad government is not an Iranian stooge.

Iraq’s post-IS foreign policy could have broader regional benefits too. For Riyadh, closer ties with Baghdad can help the Saudi leadership feel less threatened by Iran’s rising influence and the perception that Riyadh’s share of regional power has diminished as a result. That in turn may lead to a thaw in Iranian-Saudi ties and a broader contribution to regional security.

Nonetheless, the fact is that neither Riyadh nor Tehran can achieve sustainable hegemony in the region at the expense of the other. It’s ironic that it may be the routing of extremist IS that serves as the catalyst to ease the bitter sectarian rifts that have divided them for so long.",Commentary: The unlikely – and ironic – effects of Islamic State’s fall in Iraq,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-behravesh-afterislamicstate-commentar/commentary-the-unlikely-and-ironic-effects-of-islamic-states-fall-in-iraq-idUSKBN1CU2LW

The challenge for Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is to persuade her to actually buy one.

“I‘m definitely interested, but don’t currently plan to get one,” said Gu, whose monthly salary of a little over 6,000 yuan ($905.36) is less than the anniversary model’s starting price in China of 8,388 yuan.

For Apple, which is looking to rev up sales in China after several quarters of declining revenue there, the test is that Gu is not alone. While interest in the phone is high, that won’t necessarily translate into sales.

“Price appears to be a major constraint on iPhone X demand, particularly in China,” Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a recent report that showed three-quarters of Chinese respondents were excited by the upcoming launch, but only a quarter said they planned to buy one.

Investors are keen to gauge Chinese demand for the iPhone X, as it is key to reviving Apple’s fortunes in the world’s biggest smartphone market where it has lost some of its sparkle - and market share - as local phone makers have advanced.

The cheaper iPhone 8, which hit the market in September, has faced sluggish sales, but Apple has said that pre-orders for the iPhone X have been “off the charts”.

Apple, due to announce quarterly earnings on Thursday, said it had no immediate comment.

Chatter online on popular Chinese social media platform Weibo (WB.O) also signaled high levels of interest in the new model, though still generally behind levels around the 2014 launch of the very successful iPhone 6.

APPLE “GEEKS”

Xiao Ming, 32, who works for a blockchain start-up in Beijing, stayed up half the night when pre-sales of the iPhone X opened last week. He has also bought the iPhone 8.

“I always try to be one of the first to buy any new iPhone,” he said, adding he likes the new phone’s augmented reality and facial recognition features. “I’ll be very disappointed if I don’t get one on the first day.”

While he plans to buy the new phone, he noted many of his friends were less fussed. “Before, I think a lot of people would try to get it somehow, now it’s mostly the geeks,” he said.

“My friends don’t mind so much if they have an iPhone 8 or a 6, for example, because it looks similar and the price (of the iPhone X) makes you feel nervous.”

Re-sellers and iPhone accessory makers generally agreed there was a buzz about the iPhone X, Apple’s first phone to have a full-screen display and functions such as facial recognition security.

“People are really anticipating this phone because it’s the 10th anniversary version and it has more changes and modifications,” said Gary Yiu, manager of the iGeneration smartphone shop at one Hong Kong mall.

Yiu and three other phone re-sellers there said they had seen strong demand for the phone from mainland clients.

A merchant at the Huaqiangbei electronics hub in Shenzhen, who was offering an iPhone look-a-like called the “E-Feng X” from 1,599 yuan, said sales volumes were “very good”.

Some Chinese re-sellers, however, said they already canceled pre-orders for the iPhone X, concerned there wouldn’t be enough of a supply bottleneck to allow them to charge a steep premium - despite some worries about long waits.

“I saw many friends were posting pictures of themselves successfully ordering the iPhone X, so I canceled mine,” said Tony Tong, 29, a product manager at a tech firm in Beijing, who said he had ordered four phones in the hope of re-selling them for a profit. “The environment is bad for scalpers.”

Apple will hope payment plans and easy access to online credit in China will convince people to buy.

Wang Hao, a 24-year-old engineer in the northeastern port city of Dalian, said he ordered the new phone despite the high price tag. His last phone was an iPhone 6S.

“The cost is about a month’s salary for me,” he told Reuters. “But I‘m just used to it now, and there wasn’t really anything to make me choose another brand.”
