Back Story

Have you ever gotten a job without the qualifications?

It happened to Michelangelo, a sculptor by trade, who painted the ceiling in the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican, unveiled to the public on this day in 1512.

Photo

Commissioned by Pope Julius II, Michelangelo’s ceiling, about 130 feet long and 45 feet wide, took four years to paint. (You can take a virtual tour here.)

Believing he was being set up to fail, Michelangelo was paranoid at the beginning and a physical wreck by the end, writing a poem that began:

I’ve already grown a goiter from this torture

hunched up here like a cat in Lombardy

(or anywhere else where the stagnant water’s poison).

The centerpiece is the Creation of Adam, one of nine scenes from the biblical Book of Genesis.

The frescoes have required only one restoration in the modern era, in the 1980s and ’90s, but the effect of more than five million visitors a year is causing concern.

The work’s popularity is understandable. As the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe noted, “Without having seen the Sistine Chapel, one can form no appreciable idea of what one man is capable of achieving.”

1,"['graduation', 'measures', 'rates', 'revised', 'data', 'university', 'rate', 'community', 'forprofit', 'underappreciated', 'college', 'colleges', 'shows', 'students']","Most community college students are nontraditional — adults, parents, people with full-time jobs, people returning to school after years away.
Many community college students also transfer to four-year colleges before finishing a degree — a good result, but one that wasn’t counted for graduation rates.
The new measures suggest that community colleges are much more successful than for-profit colleges, not much less.
But the big picture shows that community colleges were unfairly tarred by the old graduation rates.
And lawmakers who have typically underfunded community colleges may want to direct more resources to institutions that are doing a difficult job better than we knew.","The old graduation measures date to the late 1980s, when Senator Bill Bradley championed legislation requiring colleges to report graduation rates for their basketball and football players — and, while they were at it, everyone else.

The measures were limited to students who enroll in college for the first time and take a full course load. This is a perfectly reasonable way to measure graduation rates at Mr. Bradley’s alma mater, Princeton, because nearly all undergraduates there start full-time, a few months after finishing high school.

The federal graduation rates also calculated the percentage of students who graduated within six years of enrollment. This made sense for four-year universities, where the vast majority of bachelor’s degrees are earned within six years.

The problem was that the graduation rate rules were then applied to the entire higher education system, including two-year community colleges, where nearly half of all undergraduates begin. The typical community college student isn’t a fresh-faced 18-year-old taking a full slate of courses.

Most community college students are nontraditional — adults, parents, people with full-time jobs, people returning to school after years away. They often enroll part-time, taking longer to graduate than the three years the Education Department used to gauge the success of people pursuing two-year degrees. Many community college students also transfer to four-year colleges before finishing a degree — a good result, but one that wasn’t counted for graduation rates.

So, following the committee’s lead, education officials made several changes. They included part-time and returning students in the calculation. They extended the time period to eight years. And they made separate calculations of how many students transferred before graduation, and how many were still in college.

The results paint a very different picture of community college success. The old measures, for example, captured about 620,000 students who began as first-time, full-time freshmen in 2008. Only 20 percent graduated from the community college they started at within three years. North Shore Community College was typical — its old graduation rate was 19 percent.

Such dire numbers became fodder for people defending for-profit colleges from heavy criticism of their high cost and poor outcomes. In 2014, Steve Gunderson, head of the main for-profit college trade association, wrote: “Our institutions have a 63% graduation rate in our two-year programs, while our colleagues at comparable public institutions — community colleges — have a graduation rate of 20%.”

The new graduation rates, by contrast, captured more than 1.5 million community college students. Even though that group included more than 710,000 part-time students, who are often less likely to graduate, extending the time frame to eight years increased the average graduation rate to 27 percent.

But transfers are where community colleges really shine. Some 510,000 students transferred before graduating, bringing the combined graduation and transfer rate up to 60 percent.

Including all of the part-time and returning students and looking over eight years boosted North Shore’s graduation rate to 35 percent. Another 19 percent transferred before graduation. Others were still working toward a degree. All told, more than half of Mr. Burton’s students had a successful outcome — not, as the old rates suggested, fewer than one in five.

The for-profit picture is not so rosy. The two-year programs Mr. Gunderson chose for comparison make up less than one-fifth of all for-profit enrollment. Four-year programs at for-profits have much lower graduation rates than those of comparable public institutions. Combined, they had a 34 percent graduation rate under the old measures. And in contrast with community colleges, the new measures make for-profits look worse, dropping their average graduation rate to 32 percent.

For-profit students seldom bring their credits elsewhere. Including transfer students increases the average for-profit success rate to just 39 percent, compared with 60 percent at community colleges.

In other words, Mr. Gunderson had it backward. The new measures suggest that community colleges are much more successful than for-profit colleges, not much less. They are also far cheaper and leave the average student with much less debt.

Some for-profit results are catastrophic. Take South University, a Savannah, Ga.-based for-profit college. In 2008, it enrolled 12,233 new students in its online degree programs — more than the University of Georgia and Georgia State University combined. The old measures show South University Online with a mind-boggling 2.4 percent graduation rate. But, as with community colleges, most South University Online students are nontraditional. What happens when all the students are counted over a full eight years?

Answer: The graduation rate increases to just 7.8 percent. Add in transfers? 8.1 percent. Include those still enrolled? 8.5 percent. Three years after leaving college, only 23 percent of South University Online students have paid back even a dollar on the principal of their student loans, probably because nearly all of them failed to earn a degree.

Despite these results, South University Online remains accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the same body whose response to a multidecade academic cheating scandal at the University of North Carolina was to put the campus on probation for a single year.

By comparison, the graduation rate of Georgia Northwestern Technical College, a public school, increases to 50 percent from 25 percent using the new measures. Preparing students to transfer falls to regional public universities in Georgia, instead of community colleges. Savannah State University has only a 33 percent eight-year graduation rate. But include transfer students, and its success rate rises to 81.2 percent.

Not all community colleges look better. San Jose City College in California, which graduates 19 percent of traditional students within three years, sees its graduation rate drop to 18 percent when part-time and returning students are included, even when the time frame is extended to eight years. Transfers improve the success rate only to 21 percent. Most students at San Jose City College are falling short. Many community colleges have room to improve.

But the big picture shows that community colleges were unfairly tarred by the old graduation rates. The results produced by including all students — and by looking over the right time frame and accounting for transfers — suggest that many prospective undergraduates may benefit from giving their local community college another look when searching for an affordable path to a degree. And lawmakers who have typically underfunded community colleges may want to direct more resources to institutions that are doing a difficult job better than we knew.",Revised Data Shows Community Colleges Have Been Underappreciated,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/upshot/revised-data-shows-community-colleges-have-been-underappreciated.html

The conversation we’re not having in this country is: How do we fund colleges and universities?”However the admissions process might evolve, it surely will continue to serve the interests of colleges first and foremost.","Whatever happens, age-old questions about fairness in admissions will surely endure. For one thing, the nation can’t come to terms with a tricky five-letter word: merit. Michael Young, a British sociologist, coined the pejorative term “meritocracy” over a half-century ago to describe a future in which standardized intelligence tests would crown a new elite. Yet as Rebecca Zwick explains in her new book “Who Gets In?” the meaning has shifted. The word “merit,” she writes, has come to mean “academic excellence, narrowly defined” as grades and test scores.

But that’s just one way to think of an applicant’s worthiness. Dr. Zwick, professor emeritus at the University of California at Santa Barbara, has long been a researcher at the Educational Testing Service, which develops and administers the SAT. She disputes the notion that testing prowess — or any other attribute, for that matter — entitles a student to a spot at his chosen college. “There is, in fact, no absolute definition of merit,” she writes.

That brings us to you, the anxious applicant, the frazzled parent, the confused citizen, all wondering what colleges want. It’s worth taking a deep breath and noting that only 13 percent of four-year colleges accept fewer than half of their applicants. That said, colleges where seats are scarce stir up the nation’s emotions. Each year, the world-famous institutions reject thousands and thousands of students who could thrive there.

Yes, rejection stings. But say these words aloud: The admissions process isn’t fair. Like it or not, colleges aren’t looking to reel in the greatest number of straight-A students who’ve taken seven or more Advanced Placement courses. A rejection isn’t really about you; it’s about a maddening mishmash of competing objectives.

Just as parents give teenagers a set of chores, colleges hand their admissions leaders a list of things to accomplish. When they fail, they often get fired.

“We don’t live in a cloud — the reality is, there’s a bottom line,” said Angel B. Pérez, vice president for enrollment and student success at Trinity College, in Hartford. “We’re an institution, but we’re also a business.”

On many campuses, financial concerns affect decisions about whom to admit. A recent report by the National Association for College Admission Counseling found that about half of institutions said an applicant’s “ability to pay” was of at least “some importance” in admissions decisions. Among other targets is geographic diversity, which is now seen as an indicator of institutional strength and popularity. (Some presidents have been known to gripe if the freshman class doesn’t represent all 50 states.) A campus might also need a particular number of engineering majors or goalies.

Indeed, a college could accept 33 percent of all applicants, but that doesn’t mean each applicant has a one-in-three chance. Success depends on what a student brings to the table.

Generally, nothing carries more weight in admissions than grades (plus strength of the high school curriculum) and ACT/SAT scores. With limited time and resources, those metrics offer a relatively quick way to predict who will succeed. But the measures have drawbacks. Grade inflation has complicated the task of evaluating achievements, and so has the variance in high school grading policies. Standardized test scores correlate with family income; white and Asian-American students fare better than black and Hispanic students do. Also, when colleges talk about predicting “success,” they usually mean first-year grades — a limited definition.

And so, many colleges rely on “holistic” evaluations, allowing colleges to contextualize applicants’ academic records and to identify disadvantaged students who might lack the sparkling credentials of their affluent peers. Did they attend low-performing high schools or well-resourced ones? Did they participate in extracurricular activities? Do they have leadership experience?

What colleges look for sends a powerful message about what matters, not just to admissions officers but in life, and students often respond accordingly.

Dr. Pérez, a first-generation college student who grew up in a low-income family, recently revamped Trinity’s process to better identify promising students, particularly the disadvantaged. While reading applications, its admissions officers now look for evidence of 13 characteristics — including curiosity, empathy, openness to change and ability to overcome adversity — that researchers associate with successful students. These are also qualities that the liberal-arts college values, inside and outside the classroom.

Trinity’s officers can check as many qualities as apply using a drop-down box labeled “Predictors of Success.” They must note where they saw evidence of each quality in the application. “It can’t be just a hint,” Dr. Pérez said. He recalls a teacher recommendation describing how an applicant had taken a stand on a controversial social issue in class, even though other students vocally disagreed with him. Impressed, Dr. Pérez checked the box for “Comfort in Minority of 1,” a sign, perhaps, that the student would contribute to campus dialogues. Also on the drop-down: “Delayed Gratification” and “Risk Taking.”

While Trinity still values conventional measures, the new model has expanded the staff’s understanding of merit. “We’re trying to give students more credit for these characteristics, especially those who’ve had some challenges,” Dr. Pérez said. The new approach, along with the college’s recent decision to stop requiring ACT/SAT scores, has helped it diversify its classes. Low-income and first-generation students represent 15 percent of this fall’s freshman class, up from 8 percent three years ago.

“I’m trying to increase the tools we have, and get beyond a system that is absolutely antiquated,” Dr. Pérez said. “As the country becomes more diverse, as we learn more about the correlation between standardized test scores and wealth, we have to be a lot more creative in predicting for success in college.”

What most colleges ask for from applicants doesn’t reveal much about the many skills and talents a student might possess. But what if colleges asked for more?

The admissions process at Olin College of Engineering includes a live audition. After completing a traditional application, selected students visit the campus, in Needham, Mass., for an intense two-day tryout. In addition to sitting for interviews, they work in small groups to complete a tabletop design challenge, such as building a tower that can hold a specific weight. On the second day, they are given another task, like designing a campus building. This time, evaluators observe each student, noting how well they communicate with others and adapt on the fly.

The experience is meant to help prospective students understand Olin’s collaborative culture, while giving the college a better glimpse of each applicant before finalizing acceptance. “It’s hard to nail down a student’s mind-set from the traditional elements of the application,” said Emily Roper-Doten, the dean of admission and financial aid. “This allows us to see them in motion, in an educational moment.”

A desire to see what students can do with their hands inspired a recent change at one of the world’s most renowned campuses. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (motto: “Mens et manus,” Latin for “Mind and hand”) now gives applicants the option of submitting a Maker Portfolio to show their “technical creativity.”

Applicants can send images, a short video and a PDF that shed light on a project they’ve undertaken — clothing they’ve made, apps they’ve designed, cakes they’ve baked, furniture they’ve built, chain mail they’ve woven. M.I.T. also asks students to explain what the project meant to them, as well as how much help they got. A panel of faculty members and alumni reviews the portfolios.

Last year, about 5 percent of applicants submitted a Makers Portfolio. “It gives us a fuller picture of the student,” said Stuart Schmill, dean of admissions and student financial services. “Without this, some applicants might not be able to fully get across how good a fit they are for us.”

M.I.T.’s experiment has sparked discussions among admissions deans, some of whom say they plan to offer similar opportunities for applicants to send evidence of project-based learning. They describe the Makers Portfolio as an intriguing glimpse of how a college might better align its process with its culture and values. The catch: Reviewing all those portfolios takes time, something admissions offices lack. Even a small college like Olin, which welcomed fewer than 100 new students this fall, must scramble to pull off its elaborate evaluations. Larger campuses couldn’t even consider such an approach.

Thorough review has become more challenging over the last decade, with waves of applicants overwhelming big-name colleges, victims of their own popularity. The University of California at Los Angeles received more than 100,000 applications for about 6,000 spots this fall. Stanford got 44,000 for just over 1,700 spots, and M.I.T. juggled more than 20,000 for 1,450 seats.

Most colleges are considering more incremental ways to enhance evaluations. The Coalition for Access, Affordability and Success, with more than 130 prominent campuses as members, recently established an application platform with a feature called a virtual college locker, a private space where students can upload materials, such as videos and written work, that they could later add to their applications. Among its stated goals: to make admissions more personal.

So far, most of its members aren’t asking applicants to send anything different than before. But that could change. A handful of colleges are planning experiments using alternative ways to measure student potential. One hopes to enable applicants to demonstrate their “emotional intelligence,” or E.Q., to showcase their ability to work with others, according to Annie Reznik, the coalition’s executive director. Another seeks a way for prospective students to display their “fire” for learning.

“We want better inputs,” said Jeremiah Quinlan, dean of undergraduate admissions and financial aid at Yale. “The inputs we have predict success academically. Now, we have the ability to get to know a student better, from a different type of submission.”

Like many deans, Mr. Quinlan has grown wary of polished personal essays in which applicants describe their achievements. “They feel like they have to show off, because we’re so selective,” he said, “and it’s completely understandable.” Technology, he believes, can help colleges get to know the student beneath the surface of a résumé, to gain a better sense of their passions, the kind of community member the applicant might be.

Last year, Yale allowed students using the coalition’s application to submit a document, image, audio file or video in response to a prompt (they also had to reflect, in 250 words or less, on their submission). When Justin Aubin heard about that option last fall, he thought, “Cool!”

Mr. Aubin, from Oak Lawn, Ill., was then a high school senior hoping to attend Yale. The following prompt caught his eye: “A community to which you belong and the footprint you have left.” He submitted a short video documenting his Eagle Scout project, for which he oversaw the construction of a monument honoring veterans. Even a well-written essay, he figured, couldn’t capture his experience as well as four minutes of footage, shot by his older brother.

The content of the video impressed Yale’s admissions committee. “People sat up in their chairs,” Mr. Quinlan said. “You could see how he handled his leadership role, and we felt like we got a good sense of him in a way that we didn’t get from recommendations.”

Mr. Aubin is now a freshman at Yale.

Did the video tip the scales? “That was a difference-maker,” Mr. Quinlan said.

•

Even as colleges consider innovation, it’s worth asking which fixtures of the admissions process, if any, they are willing to discard. Some prevalent practices seem to stand in the way of meaningful change.

Giving an advantage to the sons and daughters of alumni is one such practice. Some colleges admit legacies (and the children of potential donors) at a much greater rate than non-legacies. Legacies make up nearly a third of Harvard’s current freshman class, The Harvard Crimson has reported. Princeton’s class of 2021 is 13 percent legacy, according to the university’s website.

While a handful of prominent institutions, including the University of Georgia and Texas A&M University, stopped considering legacy status more than a decade ago, most colleges seem unlikely to remove that variable from the admissions equation anytime soon. “I don’t think an applicant’s legacy status is a crazy thing to look at, especially in the financial climate some colleges are in,” said Rick Clark, director of undergraduate admission at Georgia Tech, where nearly a fifth of freshmen are legacies. “Colleges have to think about their longevity.”

The benefits of legacies go beyond maintaining good will with alumni who might open their wallets, Mr. Clark said. In his experience, they tend to be enthusiastic students who help foster community on campus, the kind of relationships that help other students feel at home and succeed. “Multigenerational ties to a place add value, creating this passionate, magnetic source of energy,” he said.

The key, Mr. Clark believes, is not to lower standards, or to enroll so many legacies that other priorities, such as increasing racial and socioeconomic diversity, suffer as a result. “Those two goals aren’t mutually exclusive,” he said.

Other measurements used by selective colleges have nothing to do with a student’s accomplishments or attributes — and everything to do with a college’s agenda.

About one in five institutions allot “considerable importance” to “demonstrated interest,” the degree to which applicants convey their desire to enroll if accepted, according to a survey by the National Association for College Admission Counseling. The strongest expression of demonstrated interest is applying for binding early decision, a policy that favors affluent students who don’t need to compare financial aid offers and one that some colleges use to fill half their seats.

Beyond that, technology has made it easier to track the number of times an applicant engages with a college (by visiting the campus, contacting an admissions officer, responding to an email). This valuable information helps officers gauge who’s most likely to enroll, which can influence who gets admitted in the first place. A higher “yield,” the percentage of accepted students who actually enroll, is widely seen as a measure of status.

The problem is that savvy students who know colleges are watching them can tilt the odds in their favor, said Nancy Leopold, executive director of CollegeTracks, a Maryland nonprofit group that helps low-income and first-generation students get into college: “Demonstrated interest is biased against kids who don’t know the game exists, or who don’t have the time or money to play it.”

What do colleges really cherish? The answer is influenced greatly by the entities they seek to impress. U.S. News & World Report and other college guides, not to mention bond-rating agencies, rely heavily on conventional admissions metrics like ACT/SAT scores and acceptance rates to evaluate institutions. A college president might wish to attract more creative thinkers, but accomplishing that goal won’t help his college’s ranking.

Generally, colleges are risk-averse. Rocking the boat with a newfangled admissions process could hurt their reputations. “The challenge for many admissions offices is to make a change, but not so much change or innovation that you’re risking the position you’re in,” said Ms. Roper-Doten of Olin. Asking students to do more could scare off would-be applicants.

“Colleges seek validation,” said Lloyd Thacker, executive director of the Education Conservancy, a nonprofit group that has sought to reform college admissions. “Without a real external incentive for colleges to care about broadening their understanding of what makes an applicant promising, they don’t seem likely to change the definition on their own.”

A recent campaign called “Turning the Tide,” a project of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, is urging admissions deans to rethink the qualities they consider in applicants. In a report signed by representatives of about 200 campuses, colleges are asked to promote ethical character and service to others through the admissions process.

Although some deans say they have no business assessing the character of still-maturing teenagers, the push has prompted a handful of institutions to tweak their applications. The University of North Carolina now emphasizes contributions to others when asking about extracurricular activities. M.I.T. added an essay question asking students to describe how they’ve helped people.

Richard Weissbourd, a senior lecturer at Harvard, who leads the initiative, recommends that colleges define service in ways that might resonate with disadvantaged students. “Many students don’t have opportunities to do community service,” he said. “They’re taking care of their siblings, or they’re working part-time jobs to help their families. Colleges need to say, ‘That matters to us.’ ”

•

In the end, increasing racial and socioeconomic diversity in higher education is a matter of will. A college can prioritize it or not, said Shaun R. Harper, a professor at the University of Southern California’s Rossier School of Education who studies race and student success.

In September, Dr. Harper gave a keynote speech at the annual conference of the National Association for College Admission Counseling, in Boston. He urged his audience to think hard about racial inequality and “things you perhaps inadvertently and unknowingly do to support it.”

He cited as examples high school counselors who discourage promising minority students from applying to highly selective colleges; college leaders who say they “just can’t find enough” qualified black applicants even as their athletics coaches comb the nation for black students who excel at sports; admissions officers who recruit at the same high schools year after year, overlooking those full of underrepresented minorities.

As Dr. Harper spoke, many listeners applauded; a few scowled. He concluded his remarks by criticizing the lack of racial diversity among admissions deans themselves. He received a standing ovation.

In a subsequent interview, Dr. Harper elaborated on his concerns. “When the demographics of the profession have not changed, particularly at the senior level,” he said, “I don’t know that we can expect a major change, especially in terms of diversifying the class.”

Although Dr. Harper believes colleges rely too heavily on ACT/SAT scores, he says that the major barriers arise well before the application process even begins. Colleges, he said, must do more in terms of outreach to encourage underrepresented students to apply.

Dr. Pérez, at Trinity, has similar concerns. Although he is convinced that the selection process can be successfully revamped, he doesn’t think that will solve the No. 1 problem he sees in admissions. “The problem is money,” he said. “If I had more funding, my class would be more diverse. The conversation we’re not having in this country is: How do we fund colleges and universities?”

However the admissions process might evolve, it surely will continue to serve the interests of colleges first and foremost. Even if someone invents a better, more equitable way to gauge applicants’ potential, a college’s many wants and needs wouldn’t change. Deans would still seek to balance their classes by enrolling a diverse mix of majors from many states and countries. Colleges would still need enough oboe players and theater-arts majors.

“What compels institutions to change is deep discontent,” said Marie Bigham, director of college counseling at Isidore Newman School, in New Orleans. “If they’re only making changes on the margins, it indicates that they’re mostly content with the way things are.”

That leads to a big question in an age of widening social inequality. How unhappy are the wealthiest colleges, really, with the status quo? Some of the nation’s most selective institutions enroll more students from the top 1 percent of the income ladder than from the bottom 60 percent. Is that simply because of lack of preparation in the K-12 system? Flaws within the selection process? Or is it evidence, as Dr. Harper suggests, of a systemic lack of will to change those numbers?

Jon Boeckenstedt, associate vice president for enrollment management and marketing at DePaul University, says that it is the high-profile colleges that have the power to redefine the admissions process.

“Unless and until something changes at the top, nothing else is going to change,” he said. “That’s because, at a lot of colleges, people will go to their graves trying to imitate the Ivy League.”",What Colleges Want in an Applicant (Everything),https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/education/edlife/what-college-admissions-wants.html

Sony has also closed or sold off costly factories. It still sells televisions under its brand name, but — like Apple — its focus now is on design and marketing rather than production, which is increasingly left to contractors.

All of that added up to what Atul Goyal, an analyst at the securities firm Jefferies, called “blowout results” for Sony’s latest quarter.

The company said on Tuesday it had earned an operating profit — before taxes and other reductions — of 204 billion yen, or about $1.79 billion, in the three months through September. That was more than four times what it made in the same period last year.

Sony also upgraded its profit forecast for the full financial year, which ends in March, from ¥500 billion to ¥630 billion, which would be an all-time high if realized.

Investors piled into Sony’s shares on Wednesday in response. The stock closed up 11 percent at ¥4,918, the highest level since the start of the global financial crisis in 2008. Japanese share prices have been buoyant across the board lately, and the country’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index has reached multidecade highs while Wall Street and other markets have also surged. Still, Sony was Japan’s most sought-after stock on Wednesday.

Lovers of the Aibo might be tempted to see karma at work. Sony first introduced the dog in 1999, saying it hoped robotic animal companions would become as ubiquitous as the real thing. That never happened, and Sony stopped making the Aibo in 2006, as it struggled to rein in losses. The mechanical dog’s small but devoted fan base was crushed.

Sony hopes that the world is now ready for artificially intelligent consumer robots, and that it can be a leader in the quickly advancing technology. The new Aibo uses Sony’s image sensors to interact with the world around it, and the company says it will be capable of learning, to a limited degree — for instance by repeating behaviors that owners praise.

The dog goes on sale in Japan in January for ¥198,000, or about $1,750.

“Combining robotics and A.I. is a way for Sony to play on its strengths,” Sony’s chief executive, Kazuo Hirai, who has driven the company’s restructuring since taking over in 2012, said at a news conference. “We have multiple projects in development, and one of them is Aibo.”","Sony’s Fortunes Improve, From Rising Profit to a Return for Aibo",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/business/sony-stock-aibo.html

There was the wife and mother of grown children receiving ECT treatments that caused short term memory loss. A young woman who, after a psychotic episode involving the K.G.B. and aliens, spoke of her longtime boyfriend and all the support he provided when she was fired from her sales job. There was the man who came into the ward after a manic, knife-wielding episode in which he might have stabbed someone (I was very out of it and couldn’t get the whole story). He chatted amiably with his wife during visiting hours.

Over and over again, I encountered people with debilitating mental illness who were also part of a couple. They weren’t working, they needed care. They were a burden. And yet they were loved.

I started to think: That could be me. If I ever got better, maybe I would meet someone who could love me as I am. That maybe, work or no work, I’d no longer have to wait to be “lovable” (translation: “productive”) in order to be loved.

And I was right. A year and a half later, when my mood had stabilized (I still had a tremor and memory problems), I met a man named Scott through OkCupid. It was his second internet date; my 97th. It wasn’t particularly magical, just nice. We met for coffee, and he was easy to talk to. I love art, and that’s what he does; he thought I was funny and loves comedy. He really wanted to go out again, despite the fact that he had Googled me and knew about my perceived deal-breaker. On our second date — a hike with my dog in Griffith Park — he was eager to share his own perceived flaws ($52,000 in student loans! Arthritis! An overheating ’92 Saturn! Can’t travel by airplane! )

And then, on our fourth date, he said one of the most romantic things I’ve ever heard: “I know they don’t let you have sharp stuff in the psych ward. When my mom was in there, she grew a little beard. If that happens to you, I’ll come in and shave your beard!” His mother, Linda, has passed away, but I think she’d be proud that her son is ready with a Daisy razor. I’ve been stable for the past several years, but I am comforted by that promise of support.

Our mutual failure with long-term relationships (Scott had made it to three years) is weirdly what makes us both so committed and connected. As they say in 12-step recovery, it’s weakness, not strength, that binds us to each other. Scott and I have been moody in front of each other many times, most recently when we moved and he saw me scream for the first time. Over a television placement.

But we talked about what is now called The Regrettable Incident of the Television Placement with our couples therapist the next day and later laughed about it with friends. And Scott has had his own embarrassing emotional lows, too. It’s no secret who we are and what our flaws are. I think that’s what love is — not having to hide exactly who you are.

But again, they didn’t. The real issue here isn’t what the I.R.S. says is income. The real issue is how that code is enforced. And this is where things really break down.

There are a few ways that United States law seeks to make taxpayers declare company income in foreign bank accounts. This is where the indictment implicates both Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates and these techniques.

First, United States anti-money laundering laws require that citizens file a form, a Foreign Bank and Financials Account report, if they control (including through a company or other legal entity) foreign bank account worth over a total of $10,000.

Next, income tax Form 1040, Schedule B, Part III also requires taxpayers to check a box if they held a foreign account. According to the indictment, neither Mr. Manafort nor Mr. Gates did so. In other words, they refused to rat themselves out to the I.R.S. that they were engaging in tax evasion. What a surprise.

In addition, the United States has embarked on a policy in which it has enlisted (at the tip of a metaphorical bayonet) foreign banks to report to the United States government when its taxpayers control an account. However, the Manafort-Gates duo was allegedly careful to hide their control of their corporations and partnerships by having so-called nominee owners (the actual owner “nominates” someone else as owner). Presumably, they failed to inform those banks that they were the actual owners. In other words, once again, they refused to rat themselves out.

Of course, failure to file those forms or check those boxes is a crime in itself and punishable with a penalty. But it’s hard to imagine that additional penalties would sway the committed tax evader. It is, however, easy to see how honest people can be punished if they unintentionally fail to file forms or check boxes, exposing them to investigations and penalties that were never meant to apply to them.

Fortunately, there is a better way. Both United States law and global anti-money laundering standards require banks to report suspicious activity to government law enforcement agencies. Millions of dollars paid by dodgy Ukrainians to unknown companies in Cyprus and then to luxury car dealers in the United States for no known legal reason would certainly seem to qualify.

These enforcement mechanisms need to be strengthened, and vastly so. In the cases of Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates and no doubt many others with millions tucked away in offshore banks, they did not result — in the absence of a special counsel — in an investigation of years of possible crimes, or an indictment.

A driver plowed a pickup truck down a crowded bike path along the Hudson River in Manhattan on Tuesday, killing eight people and injuring 11 before being shot by a police officer in what officials are calling the deadliest terrorist attack on New York City since Sept. 11, 2001.

The rampage ended when the motorist — whom the police identified as Sayfullo Saipov, 29 — smashed into a school bus, jumped out of his truck and ran up and down the highway waving a pellet gun and paintball gun and shouting “Allahu akbar,” Arabic for “God is great,” before he was shot in the abdomen by the officer. He remained in critical condition on Tuesday evening.

Mayor Bill de Blasio declared the rampage a terrorist attack and federal law enforcement authorities were leading the investigation. Investigators discovered handwritten notes in Arabic near the truck that indicated allegiance to the Islamic State, two law enforcement officials said. But investigators had not uncovered evidence of any direct or enabling ties between Mr. Saipov and ISIS and were treating the episode as a case of an “inspired” attacker, two counterterrorism officials said.

Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference, “Based on information we have at this moment, this was an act of terror, and a particularly cowardly act of terror aimed at innocent civilians.”

Five of the people killed were Argentine tourists who traveled to New York for a 30-year high school reunion celebration, said a senior official in Santa Fe Province, where they were from. The Argentine authorities said they were Hernán Mendoza, Diego Angelini, Alejandro Pagnucco, Ariel Erlij and Hernán Ferruchi. Martín Ludovico Marro, a sixth member of the group, was wounded. Belgian officials said one of those killed and three of the injured were from Belgium.

Mr. Saipov came to the United States from Uzbekistan in 2010, and had a green card that allowed permanent legal residence. He had apparently lived in Paterson, N.J., and Tampa, Fla. An official said Mr. Saipov rented a truck from a Home Depot in Passaic, N.J., where a white Toyota minivan believed to be his was found parked.

The truck came crashing to a stop near the corner of Chambers and West Streets by Stuyvesant High School. Sirus Minovi, 14, a freshman there who was hanging out with friends, said people scattered.

“We heard people screaming, ‘gun’ ‘shooter’ and ‘run away,’” Sirus said. “We thought it was a Halloween prank.”

He realized it was not a joke when he saw the man staggering through the intersection, waving guns and screaming words he could not make out. A passer-by approached the attacker, apparently trying to calm him, Sirus said, until the man realized the attacker had a gun. The man “put his hands up and was backing away,” Sirus said.

Almost immediately, as investigators began to look into Mr. Saipov’s history, it became clear that he had been on the radar of federal authorities. Three officials said he had come to the federal authorities’ attention as a result of an unrelated investigation, but it was not clear whether that was because he was a friend, an associate or a family member of someone under scrutiny or because he himself had been the focus of an investigation.

Over the last two years, a terrorism investigation by the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security, the New York Police Department and federal prosecutors in Brooklyn resulted in charges against five men from Uzbekistan and one from Kazakhstan of providing material support to ISIS. Several of the men have pleaded guilty. It is unclear whether Mr. Saipov was connected with that investigation.

Martin Feely, a spokesman for the New York F.B.I. office, declined to comment on whether Mr. Saipov was known to the bureau.

F.B.I. agents were expected to search Mr. Saipov’s home in Paterson, N.J., and his car on Tuesday night, a law enforcement official said. A phone, which was recovered at the scene of the attack, also would be searched, another official said.

The attack unfolded as nearby schools were letting out on a Halloween afternoon. It ended five blocks north of the World Trade Center. The driver left a roughly mile-long crime scene: a tree-lined bike path strewn with bodies, mangled bicycles and bicycle parts, from wheels twisted like pretzels to a dislodged seat.

Mr. Saipov, a slim, bearded man, was seen in videos running through traffic after the attack with a paintball gun in one hand and a pellet gun in the other. Six people died at the scene and two others died at a hospital, officials said. The authorities credited the officer who shot him with saving lives.

“He was Johnny-on-the-spot and he takes the guy down,” a city official said.

Coming five months after a car rammed into pedestrians in Times Square, killing one, Tuesday’s attack again highlighted the danger of a vehicle attack on busy city streets. The Times Square attack was not an act of terrorism. But both events brought to mind the terrorist attack last year in Nice, France, in which a cargo truck killed scores of people celebrating Bastille Day.

The episodes also evoked calls from terrorist magazines, including in an edition of Rumiyah, a magazine used by ISIS, for attackers to mow down pedestrians with trucks, continue the attacks with a knife or a gun and claim responsibility by shouting or leaving leaflets.

Students in Halloween costumes streamed out of nearby schools after lockdowns were lifted and huddled with parents. Their faces, once painted for the holiday, were streaked with tears.

Emily, 12, a seventh-grader at I.S. 289 whose father asked that her last name not be used, had been walking on her usual route home when other students turned and ran in the other direction.

“All the kids were screaming, ‘Run!’, ‘Gun!’ ‘Run inside,’” she said, still wearing cat ears. She said mothers pushing strollers and children in costumes ran in a herd back toward the school.

President Trump responded to the attack on Twitter: “In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!”

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo cautioned at a news conference, “There’s no evidence that suggests a wider plot or a wider scheme.” In the aftermath, city and state law enforcement agencies increased security at high-profile locations.

Terrorism analysts noted that on Monday a French pro-ISIS media unit, known as the Centre Mediatique An-Nur, put out a specific threat for Halloween, mentioning the date on a banner spread on the encrypted app Telegram and on ISIS-affiliated Twitter accounts.

Mr. Saipov wove a deadly path on a stretch usually bustling with commuters, runners and cyclists, drawn by the downtown offices nearby or the shimmering river.

He turned onto the bike path alongside the West Side Highway at Houston Street just after 3 p.m. and sped south, striking numerous pedestrians and cyclists, many of them in the back, the authorities said. People scattered and dived to the asphalt.

The truck, labeled with a sign saying, “Rent me starting at $19,” rammed into the bus near Chambers Street. The bus serves two schools in Lower Manhattan and transports students with special needs. Two adults and two children on the bus were injured, the authorities said.",Manhattan Terror Attack Kills 8 and Injures 11,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/nyregion/police-shooting-lower-manhattan.html

When the fibers had not received any refueling after their exercise, they did not regain their original power, even after pleasant warming.
It cannot tell us whether warm baths might lessen muscle pain after long, hard exercise.","Faced with these largely disappointing experimental results, researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and other universities began to wonder recently about heat. Might warming muscles after hard exercise help them to regain strength and power?

To find out, they invited five fit, young men and women to a human performance lab and sat them in front of arm-pedaling machines. Then they asked each volunteer to spin the pedals through a series of brief but grueling intervals, followed by 20 minutes of easier but almost nonstop exercise, while the researchers tracked their heart rates and power output.

This routine was designed to exhaust the volunteers’ arm muscles. Many processes are involved in muscular exhaustion, but the one that is best understood is the depletion of the muscles’ glycogen, which is the name for their stored carbohydrates. Once the muscles burn through most of this fuel source, they become weak, tired and cranky, like toddlers in need of a snack.

The Swedish scientists suspected that finding ways to rapidly replenish these stores might help the muscles to recover relatively rapidly from their fatigue.

So they asked their volunteers to consume large amounts of carbohydrates in the two hours after their session of hard pedaling but not to otherwise coddle their muscles.

Then on subsequent visits to the lab, they had the young people repeat the pedaling workout twice more, and immediately afterward, slip long cuffs over their arms that could be heated or chilled with water coils. The cuffs were warmed during one session to about 100 degrees Fahrenheit and chilled during another to about 5 degrees. The volunteers wore the cuffs for two hours while also downing carbohydrates.

View all New York Times newsletters.

Finally, at the end of each session, the men and women repeated the interval portion of their original pedaling, since it was the most tiring.

And each of them could pedal hardest at that point if their arm muscles had been warmed beforehand. Their power output then was “markedly better” than after the other two sessions, the scientists write in their paper, suggesting that their muscles had better regained strength. Their power was worst after their muscles had been cooled.

But these results, while interesting, could not explain why heat might be goosing recovery, so the inquisitive scientists next turned to individual leg-muscle fibers obtained from mice. They attached the fibers to a mechanism that could record the strength of contractions and then zapped the fibers with electricity so that they contracted, over and over. The researchers noted when these contractions slowed, indicating the fibers had grown pooped.

They then tired other fibers before dousing some of them with glycogen and subsequently warming or cooling all of the fibers and restimulating them a final time.

They also examined whether warming or cooling had affected how much glycogen the muscle tissue absorbed.

As with the young men’s and women’s arms, the muscle fibers turned out to have recovered best after being heated — but only if they also had been exposed to glycogen. When the fibers had not received any refueling after their exercise, they did not regain their original power, even after pleasant warming.

The lesson of these findings, published in the Journal of Physiology, seems to be that “warming muscles probably aids in recovery by augmenting the muscles’ uptake of carbohydrates,” says Arthur Cheng, a researcher at the Karolinska Institute, who led the study.

This study looked only at one aspect of recovery after exercise, however, concentrating on how tired muscles might best regain their ability to generate power. It cannot tell us whether warm baths might lessen muscle pain after long, hard exercise. (Unfortunately, most recent studies suggest that nothing substantially reduces this soreness, except time.)

But the study does provide a rationale for filling your bathtub with warm water after a marathon or other hard exertion, grabbing a sports bar or chocolate milk to replace lost carbohydrates, and settling in for a long, revivifying soak.","Running a Marathon?

The former two have played softer schedules — although the Badgers are easily the team that the committee considered most differently than A.P. voters, who on Sunday ranked them 4th.

If either of the first two wins out, it will play tough competition in a major-conference championship game, where a win may assure a playoff slot. Central Florida, of the American Athletic Conference, has a narrower path to the bracket.

There is still time for seeming long shots to make it into the playoff, though. At this point in 2015, the eventual semifinalist Oklahoma was No. 15, while in the committee’s first rankings in 2014, Ohio State was 16th — and went on to win the title.",Georgia Tops First College Football Playoff Rankings,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/sports/ncaafootball/college-football-playoff-rankings-georgia.html

Mueller III bears down in his investigation of the alleged Russian efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election.

As Mr. Mueller and his team home in on people connected to President Trump, including his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, the president and his allies in the conservative media sphere are pointing at the Democrats and Hillary Clinton.

Adding to the problem is the recent behavior of the tech companies, which have not shown the same desire for accountability exhibited by Mr. Ailes and his fellow network chiefs all those years ago. On Tuesday, when Congress called Facebook, Twitter and Google to testify, the platforms sent their lawyers, not their top bosses.

Yes, the lawyers provided some details about how Russian operatives had reached scores of millions of Americans with divisive and misleading messages. But that was only after Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, insisted in November that it was a “pretty crazy idea” that Russian operatives had used Facebook to influence the election. (Facebook’s latest tally of Americans who were exposed to Russia’s divisive content: 126 million.)

The opacity of the tech companies was matched by the efforts of some conservative media outlets to confuse and distract.

In the days leading up to the indictment of Mr. Manafort and his lobbying partner Rick Gates, they saw fit to question Mr. Mueller’s legitimacy. They did so while arguing that the real focus should be on Mrs. Clinton, the Democrats and a political research firm that commissioned the gathering of information on Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia, Fusion GPS.

The counternarrative was particularly pronounced in the outlets controlled by Mr. Murdoch — who has close ties to the president’s family — and his news and entertainment companies, 21st Century Fox and News Corp.

On Saturday, the Fox News host Jeanine Pirro called for the jailing of Mrs. Clinton, saying, “It’s time to shut it down, turn the tables and lock her up.”

She alleged that “the Obamas and the Clintons” had “built the Trump-Russia connection,” pointing to a report in The Washington Post that the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee had helped finance research by Fusion GPS, which produced a dossier describing ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. She did not mention a report in The New York Times that a conservative media organization, The Free Beacon, hired Fusion GPS to research Mr. Trump and other Republicans.

The most salacious findings in the dossier, based on information collected from sources inside and outside the Kremlin by a Fusion GPS contractor, the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, remain uncorroborated.

Also on Saturday, The New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin called for Mr. Mueller’s resignation, citing Fusion GPS as well as Mr. Mueller’s previous job as an F.B.I. director under President Barack Obama, given that, in Mr. Goodwin’s view, so much of the investigative focus must now fall on Mr. Obama’s administration.

Foreshadowing Mr. Goodwin’s dubious argument was an editorial in the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal, which declared that Mr. Mueller “lacks the critical distance” to look into the allegation that “Democrats paid for Russians to compile wild allegations about a U.S. presidential candidate.” The editorial also questioned whether the dossier had triggered the F.B.I. inquiry into Mr. Trump’s campaign.

But the investigation began in July last year, James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director at the time, told Congress in March, not long after Fusion GPS’s financing passed from Republican to Democratic sources.

And while skepticism is a virtue in all journalistic endeavors, there is no evidence to support the assertion that the Democrats hired Fusion GPS with the purpose of getting Russians to spread “wild allegations” about Mr. Trump.

As John Sipher, a former Central Intelligence Agency chief of station, pointed out, intelligence tends to come from sources within foreign governments.

“Reaching out to Russians and Americans to try to collect information on what might have happened and then pass that information to sources in good faith, that’s different from trying to conspire with Russia to get stolen emails from the United States,” Mr. Sipher told me.

The collective coverage from The Journal editorial page, The New York Post and Fox News — not including the straight-ahead coverage by the likes of Shepard Smith and Bret Baier — was testament to the Murdoch empire’s ability to make its own journalistic weather.

Between the promotion of alternative narratives and the way the social media platforms have been so slow in describing their inadvertent hosting of the Russian effort, there’s a striking lack of national unity over what appears to have been a foreign incursion in an American election. So you have to wonder how the country will ever come together to do something about it.

“There’s this epic lack of consensus, or active dis-census,” said Shawn Powers, the executive director of the United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, who has spent years studying what he calls the “geopolitics of information.”

Mr. Powers was confident that, as the facts come out, the country will find a way to fend off similar attacks. For instance, he said, Facebook, Twitter and Google are adding new policies to combat false information, fake accounts and nefarious foreign political advertising.

But I can’t help thinking back to 2001.

On Tuesday, I called Tom Johnson, the former CNN chairman, who was one of the executives who appeared on Capitol Hill to testify in 2001. He said some colleagues had some qualms appearing before Congress, given the First Amendment implications. But he told me that he had felt it was the right thing to do.

“I still think we have the very highest public responsibility to make sure we get it right and, when we don’t get it right, that we try to determine what went wrong and what we can do about it,” he said. “It really gets down to operating in the public interest.”

Apple is selling the iPhone X with two options for storage capacity: 64 gigabytes for $999 and 256 gigabytes for $1,149.

There are various ways to pay that hefty price.

The simplest route is to pay for the device outright. This is the least confusing option because your wireless bill will contain charges only for your phone plan, and you can do whatever you want with the device — like sell it or switch to a different wireless carrier — whenever you want.

You can also opt to spread out the payments with a monthly installment plan. For example, if you are a Verizon customer, you can choose to pay off the $999 iPhone over 24 months for $41.62 a month. This is a nice option because spreading out the payments does not incur interest fees.

Another option is to go for an early upgrade plan, which lets you pay a flat monthly rate and upgrade to a new iPhone annually. It’s essentially leasing a new phone every year.

There are various early upgrade plans on the market. With Apple’s early upgrade program, you can pay $49.91 a month, and once you’ve made 12 payments, you can trade in your iPhone to upgrade to the next one and continue paying that monthly rate. (I’m not a fan of this path because I suggest cherishing your devices for as long as you can before upgrading.)

Similarities to the Cheaper iPhone 8

Before you splurge, consider your options. Apple’s iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which share many features of the iPhone X, have starting prices of $699 and $799. The cheaper iPhones have the same computing processor as the iPhone X, so they are just as fast, and their 12-megapixel rear cameras are on a par with the rear camera on the iPhone X.

So what’s the difference? Mainly, the screen.

■The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen that takes up the entire face of the device, with the exception of a notch at the top containing an infrared camera system.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

■The iPhone 8 has a 4.7-inch screen, and the iPhone 8 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen.

Both of the cheaper iPhones have bezels — the border surrounding the display — whereas the iPhone X has eliminated the bezel.

Other than screen size, the screen technologies differ. The iPhone X is the only Apple phone that uses OLED, a type of display that can be made thinner, lighter and brighter, and with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD. So the screen on the iPhone X looks more vibrant than the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8, which still use LCD.

Last but not least, the iPhone X has a unique infrared face scanner. The technology, called Face ID, uses the infrared camera system on the front of the phone to scan the contours and shape of a person’s head to unlock the device and authorize mobile payments. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus have normal front-facing cameras for snapping selfies.

How Face Recognition Replaces the Fingerprint Sensor

The primary way you can unlock an iPhone X is with the face scanner. The premium phone lacks Touch ID, the fingerprint sensor that has been a popular feature on iPhones for several years.

Face ID is brand new — there hasn’t been anything like it on a smartphone before. It works by spraying an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots. The imaging system can stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it. Because the shape of a person’s head is unique, the likelihood of bypassing facial recognition with someone else’s face is one in a million, according to Apple.

Older facial recognition systems worked by using the camera to take a photo of yourself and comparing that with an image that was stored on the device. All a thief would need to do to fool the system was hold a photo of your face in front of the camera — which some people already did with Samsung’s facial-recognition feature. The false acceptance rate of older face recognition systems was one in 100.

It will be interesting to see how early adopters react to Face ID, and whether it will work well with many different kinds of faces. If you’re skeptical or turned off by the idea of your phone constantly scanning your face to unlock your phone, you could always get an iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus, which still have Touch ID.",The iPhone X Arrives Friday.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Jeff Chen is back with a surprisingly straightforward puzzle, which made me wonder if he was secretly taking us for a ride. His puzzles have had some pretty neat gimmicks in them, so when I see a list theme from him, my first thought is that perhaps he is pulling the old bluff on us.

Today’s Theme

It’s actually a list theme, but it’s a tight one. A total of four, two-word phrases each have a synonym for “victim” as their first word, and the CON MEN who target them are hiding away at 43D. For example, at 30A, the answer to “A mere pittance” is CHUMP CHANGE and, at 40A, the answer to the clue “Unexpected hit” is SUCKER PUNCH.

Tricky Clues

21A: A “Person setting the stage?” could be a narrator, but today it’s a ROADIE setting up for a concert.

57A: This puzzle was one of the entries in the Westchester Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and quite a few of the solvers were bamboozled by the spelling of MARK ANTONY with a ‘K.’ Many contestants thought that his name was spelled with a ‘C,’ but it’s not. And you have that easy crossing of PORKY’S to confirm.

23D: My first reaction to IBANKER was “What? No!” but it’s a thing.

37D: UNDEROOS were haute couture when The Boy was a wee one. He preferred the Batman ones.

Constructor Notes

My mother-in-law’s name is Patsy and I’m a big fan of Patsy Cline — “Walkin’ After Midnight” is one of my favorites. Not hard to see where I got the idea for the puzzle. What is hard to see is PATSY CLINE in the grid. She could have gone where PIGEON COOP is, but my mother-in-law in a crossword where PATSY is associated with CHUMP, SUCKER, and MARK ... hmm.

“The foreign interference we saw was reprehensible,” Colin Stretch, Facebook’s general counsel, told senators.

The companies also acknowledged that they were struggling to keep up with the threat of foreign interference.

“The abuse of our platform to attempt state-sponsored manipulation of elections is a new challenge for us — and one that we are determined to meet,” said Twitter’s acting general counsel, Sean Edgett.

At the heart of the companies’ problems are business models that reward viral content — which can include misinformation — and an enormous advertising business that is automated and unable to easily spot ads purchased by foreign governments.

In a sign of the shifting political winds for tech giants, Republicans, who have been more restrained in their criticism of the companies, were more skeptical on Tuesday. In one contentious exchange, Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, pressed Mr. Stretch on whether Facebook could possibly police all of its advertisers.

“I’m trying to get us down from La-La Land here,” Mr. Kennedy said. “The truth of the matter is, you have five million advertisers that change every month. Every minute. Probably every second. You don’t have the ability to know who every one of those advertisers is, do you?”

Mr. Stretch acknowledged that Facebook could not track all those advertisers.

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, the chairman of the crime and terrorism subcommittee that held the hearing, said the risk went beyond Russia to other American adversaries. Talking to reporters afterward, he alluded to potential regulation of political advertising online.

“It’s Russia today; it could be Iran and North Korea tomorrow,” Mr. Graham said. “What we need to do is sit down and find ways to bring some of the controls we have on over-the-air broadcast to social media to protect the consumer.”

Facebook, Twitter and Google have not publicly opposed a bipartisan proposal to require reports on who funds political ads online, similar to rules for broadcast television. In private, their lobbyists have praised voluntary efforts to disclose political ad funding and have resisted many aspects of the bill.

Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said the legislation was essential before the midterm elections in 2018.

“Our midterms are 370 days away, and we don’t have time to mess around with dialogue anymore,” Ms. Klobuchar said in an interview after the hearing. Ms. Klobuchar introduced the bill with Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.

During the hearing, some Republicans also sought to play down the Russian effort to tip the election in favor of President Trump, stressing incorrectly that the Kremlin’s agents did not favor a particular presidential candidate in last year’s election.

“Russia does not have loyalty to a political party in the United States,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee. “Their goal is to divide us and discredit our democracy.”

That assertion was at odds with the conclusion of American intelligence agencies that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia tried to sway the election in favor of Mr. Trump, going beyond just posting disruptive content on social media. Russian operatives also hacked Democratic email accounts and released messages embarrassing to Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Mr. Graham asked Mr. Stretch of Facebook to confirm that the pattern of activity the site saw from Russia was more focused on sowing chaos in the United States than in bolstering Mr. Trump’s candidacy.

“During the election, they were trying to create discord between Americans, most of it directed against Clinton,” Mr. Graham said, addressing Mr. Stretch. “After the election, you saw Russian-tied groups and organizations trying to undermine President Trump’s legitimacy. Is that what you saw on Facebook?”

Mr. Stretch agreed. But the question was narrowly tailored, apparently intended to distance the broader Russian interference from the backing of Mr. Trump.

Though the companies promised to work with government officials, Mr. Stretch stopped short of agreeing to some suggestions.

In one heated exchange, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, asked him to reject political ad purchases in foreign currencies.

“How did Facebook, which prides itself on being able to process billions of data points and instantly transform them in the personal connections with its user, somehow not make the connection that electoral ads, paid for in rubles, were coming from Russia?” Mr. Franken said.

But Mr. Stretch hemmed, saying the rejection of a foreign currency to buy political ads would not solve the problem of foreign interference.

“The reason I’m hesitating on foreign currency is it’s relatively easy for bad actors to switch currencies,” Mr. Stretch said. “So it’s a signal, but not enough.”

That response failed to satisfy Mr. Franken, who interrupted with exasperation.

“My goal is for you to think through this stuff a little bit better,” Mr. Franken said, raising his voice.

This week, the companies admitted that the abuse of their platforms was much greater than previously acknowledged. In addition to Facebook’s admission, Google said that agents who were also from the Internet Research Agency uploaded more than 1,000 videos on its YouTube platform. Twitter said the agency published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter.

On Wednesday, the top lawyers for all three companies will appear before the House and Senate intelligence committees, which are conducting their own investigations into the Russian election meddling.

Tuesday’s hearing exposed a much deeper struggle for Facebook, which is trying to tread a delicate line as a technology platform while also fighting against hate speech, violence and misinformation on its site.

And that collapse is leading to a rising tide of “economic migrants, interethnic conflicts and extremism,” Monique Barbut, who heads the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and guided me in Niger, explained.

A few numbers: Niger, with rampant poverty and poor access to contraception, has one the highest birthrates in the world: 7.6 children per woman. I met a man there who boasted of 17 kids. Neighboring Nigeria is growing so fast it will replace the U.S. as the third-most-populous country in the world by 2050. Nigeria is a third bigger than Texas.

Meanwhile, climate change in the region is so severe that nearby Senegal’s national weather bureau says that from 1950 to 2015, the average temperature there rose two degrees Celsius and the average annual rainfall declined by about two inches. The Paris climate accord was designed to keep global average temperatures from rising two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by 2100.

In other words, parts of sub-Saharan Africa are already at heat levels that Paris was supposed to prevent by the end of the century — and the region is heading for a four-degree rise, which will lead to the collapse of even more small farms and lead to a mad scramble of refugees toward Europe, competition for food and more unemployed males ready to join ISIS for $50 a month.

Barbut, as I reported, reinforced her point by showing me three maps of Africa with dots concentrated in the middle of the continent. Map No. 1: the most vulnerable regions of desertification in 2008. Map No. 2: conflicts and food riots in 2007 and 2008. Map No. 3: terrorist attacks in 2012. All the dots of all three maps cluster around Niger and its neighbors. Hello?

And what is Trump’s response to this reality? It’s to focus solely on using the U.S. military to kill terrorists in Africa while offering a budget that eliminates U.S. support for global contraception programs; appointing climate-change deniers to all key environmental posts; pushing coal over clean energy; and curbing U.S. government climate research.

In short, he’s sending soldiers to fight a problem that is clearly being exacerbated by climate and population trends, while eliminating all our tools to mitigate these trends.

That’s just stupid, reckless and irresponsible — and it evinces no ability to connect the dots or think without a box.

But this is not only in Africa: Trump was obsessed with defeating ISIS in Syria and Iraq — but with as few U.S. troops as possible. The only way he could do that was by tacitly allying with Iran, Syria’s regime, Russia, pro-Iranian Shiite militias, and pro-U.S. Kurds, who were the main anti-ISIS forces on the ground. We could not defeat ISIS or stabilize Syria and Iraq without all of them.

And what is Trump’s strategy now? I have no clue. We’ve distanced ourselves from the Kurds, moved to tear up the nuclear deal with Iran and added U.S. troops in Afghanistan, a country we also can’t stabilize without the tacit help of Iran next door. If you know how these dots connect, please write.

Also: How do we stabilize our border with Mexico and maintain our neighbor’s cooperation in holding back the main source of illegal immigration today — refugees from Central America — while pursuing trade policies that have weakened the Mexican peso and the Mexican economy and could lead that country to elect its own anti-American populist-nationalist?

Nothing Trump ever says has a second paragraph. His whole shtick is just a first paragraph: Build a wall, tear up the Iran deal, tear up TPP, defeat ISIS, send troops to Niger and Afghanistan to kill terrorists, kill climate policy, kill family planning, cut taxes, raise military spending. Every box just marks an applause line he needed somewhere to get elected. Nothing connects — and we will pay for that.

Indeed, if you want to know what it looks like when a country follows a leader with no second paragraph and no ability to connect dots, visit London. I was there last week. Britain’s political system is in turmoil and its economy is facing declining growth prospects, because a bare majority voted to follow leaders with no second paragraph — we’ll just quit the European Union and everything will be fine, they said.

Well, now it’s a fine little mess they have. The ruling Conservatives have no clue how to quit the E.U. without doing even more damage to their country’s future. That’s what happens when you vote for “disrupters” who never spent a second thinking through how all of their disruptions connect the morning after the morning after.

For one thing, the nation can’t come to terms with a tricky five-letter word: merit. Michael Young, a British sociologist, coined the pejorative term “meritocracy” over a half-century ago to describe a future in which standardized intelligence tests would crown a new elite. Yet as Rebecca Zwick explains in her new book “Who Gets In?” the meaning has shifted. The word “merit,” she writes, has come to mean “academic excellence, narrowly defined” as grades and test scores.

But that’s just one way to think of an applicant’s worthiness. Dr. Zwick, professor emeritus at the University of California at Santa Barbara, has long been a researcher at the Educational Testing Service, which develops and administers the SAT. She disputes the notion that testing prowess — or any other attribute, for that matter — entitles a student to a spot at his chosen college. “There is, in fact, no absolute definition of merit,” she writes.

That brings us to you, the anxious applicant, the frazzled parent, the confused citizen, all wondering what colleges want. It’s worth taking a deep breath and noting that only 13 percent of four-year colleges accept fewer than half of their applicants. That said, colleges where seats are scarce stir up the nation’s emotions. Each year, the world-famous institutions reject thousands and thousands of students who could thrive there.

Yes, rejection stings. But say these words aloud: The admissions process isn’t fair. Like it or not, colleges aren’t looking to reel in the greatest number of straight-A students who’ve taken seven or more Advanced Placement courses. A rejection isn’t really about you; it’s about a maddening mishmash of competing objectives.

Just as parents give teenagers a set of chores, colleges hand their admissions leaders a list of things to accomplish. When they fail, they often get fired.

“We don’t live in a cloud — the reality is, there’s a bottom line,” said Angel B. Pérez, vice president for enrollment and student success at Trinity College, in Hartford. “We’re an institution, but we’re also a business.”

On many campuses, financial concerns affect decisions about whom to admit. A recent report by the National Association for College Admission Counseling found that about half of institutions said an applicant’s “ability to pay” was of at least “some importance” in admissions decisions. Among other targets is geographic diversity, which is now seen as an indicator of institutional strength and popularity. (Some presidents have been known to gripe if the freshman class doesn’t represent all 50 states.) A campus might also need a particular number of engineering majors or goalies.

Indeed, a college could accept 33 percent of all applicants, but that doesn’t mean each applicant has a one-in-three chance. Success depends on what a student brings to the table.

Generally, nothing carries more weight in admissions than grades (plus strength of the high school curriculum) and ACT/SAT scores. With limited time and resources, those metrics offer a relatively quick way to predict who will succeed. But the measures have drawbacks. Grade inflation has complicated the task of evaluating achievements, and so has the variance in high school grading policies. Standardized test scores correlate with family income; white and Asian-American students fare better than black and Hispanic students do. Also, when colleges talk about predicting “success,” they usually mean first-year grades — a limited definition.

And so, many colleges rely on “holistic” evaluations, allowing colleges to contextualize applicants’ academic records and to identify disadvantaged students who might lack the sparkling credentials of their affluent peers. Did they attend low-performing high schools or well-resourced ones? Did they participate in extracurricular activities? Do they have leadership experience?

What colleges look for sends a powerful message about what matters, not just to admissions officers but in life, and students often respond accordingly.

Dr. Pérez, a first-generation college student who grew up in a low-income family, recently revamped Trinity’s process to better identify promising students, particularly the disadvantaged. While reading applications, its admissions officers now look for evidence of 13 characteristics — including curiosity, empathy, openness to change and ability to overcome adversity — that researchers associate with successful students. These are also qualities that the liberal-arts college values, inside and outside the classroom.

Trinity’s officers can check as many qualities as apply using a drop-down box labeled “Predictors of Success.” They must note where they saw evidence of each quality in the application. “It can’t be just a hint,” Dr. Pérez said. He recalls a teacher recommendation describing how an applicant had taken a stand on a controversial social issue in class, even though other students vocally disagreed with him. Impressed, Dr. Pérez checked the box for “Comfort in Minority of 1,” a sign, perhaps, that the student would contribute to campus dialogues. Also on the drop-down: “Delayed Gratification” and “Risk Taking.”

While Trinity still values conventional measures, the new model has expanded the staff’s understanding of merit. “We’re trying to give students more credit for these characteristics, especially those who’ve had some challenges,” Dr. Pérez said. The new approach, along with the college’s recent decision to stop requiring ACT/SAT scores, has helped it diversify its classes. Low-income and first-generation students represent 15 percent of this fall’s freshman class, up from 8 percent three years ago.

“I’m trying to increase the tools we have, and get beyond a system that is absolutely antiquated,” Dr. Pérez said. “As the country becomes more diverse, as we learn more about the correlation between standardized test scores and wealth, we have to be a lot more creative in predicting for success in college.”

What most colleges ask for from applicants doesn’t reveal much about the many skills and talents a student might possess. But what if colleges asked for more?

The admissions process at Olin College of Engineering includes a live audition. After completing a traditional application, selected students visit the campus, in Needham, Mass., for an intense two-day tryout. In addition to sitting for interviews, they work in small groups to complete a tabletop design challenge, such as building a tower that can hold a specific weight. On the second day, they are given another task, like designing a campus building. This time, evaluators observe each student, noting how well they communicate with others and adapt on the fly.

The experience is meant to help prospective students understand Olin’s collaborative culture, while giving the college a better glimpse of each applicant before finalizing acceptance. “It’s hard to nail down a student’s mind-set from the traditional elements of the application,” said Emily Roper-Doten, the dean of admission and financial aid. “This allows us to see them in motion, in an educational moment.”

A desire to see what students can do with their hands inspired a recent change at one of the world’s most renowned campuses. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (motto: “Mens et manus,” Latin for “Mind and hand”) now gives applicants the option of submitting a Maker Portfolio to show their “technical creativity.”

Applicants can send images, a short video and a PDF that shed light on a project they’ve undertaken — clothing they’ve made, apps they’ve designed, cakes they’ve baked, furniture they’ve built, chain mail they’ve woven. M.I.T. also asks students to explain what the project meant to them, as well as how much help they got. A panel of faculty members and alumni reviews the portfolios.

Last year, about 5 percent of applicants submitted a Makers Portfolio. “It gives us a fuller picture of the student,” said Stuart Schmill, dean of admissions and student financial services. “Without this, some applicants might not be able to fully get across how good a fit they are for us.”

M.I.T.’s experiment has sparked discussions among admissions deans, some of whom say they plan to offer similar opportunities for applicants to send evidence of project-based learning. They describe the Makers Portfolio as an intriguing glimpse of how a college might better align its process with its culture and values. The catch: Reviewing all those portfolios takes time, something admissions offices lack. Even a small college like Olin, which welcomed fewer than 100 new students this fall, must scramble to pull off its elaborate evaluations. Larger campuses couldn’t even consider such an approach.

Thorough review has become more challenging over the last decade, with waves of applicants overwhelming big-name colleges, victims of their own popularity. The University of California at Los Angeles received more than 100,000 applications for about 6,000 spots this fall. Stanford got 44,000 for just over 1,700 spots, and M.I.T. juggled more than 20,000 for 1,450 seats.

Most colleges are considering more incremental ways to enhance evaluations. The Coalition for Access, Affordability and Success, with more than 130 prominent campuses as members, recently established an application platform with a feature called a virtual college locker, a private space where students can upload materials, such as videos and written work, that they could later add to their applications. Among its stated goals: to make admissions more personal.

So far, most of its members aren’t asking applicants to send anything different than before. But that could change. A handful of colleges are planning experiments using alternative ways to measure student potential. One hopes to enable applicants to demonstrate their “emotional intelligence,” or E.Q., to showcase their ability to work with others, according to Annie Reznik, the coalition’s executive director. Another seeks a way for prospective students to display their “fire” for learning.

“We want better inputs,” said Jeremiah Quinlan, dean of undergraduate admissions and financial aid at Yale. “The inputs we have predict success academically. Now, we have the ability to get to know a student better, from a different type of submission.”

Like many deans, Mr. Quinlan has grown wary of polished personal essays in which applicants describe their achievements. “They feel like they have to show off, because we’re so selective,” he said, “and it’s completely understandable.” Technology, he believes, can help colleges get to know the student beneath the surface of a résumé, to gain a better sense of their passions, the kind of community member the applicant might be.

Last year, Yale allowed students using the coalition’s application to submit a document, image, audio file or video in response to a prompt (they also had to reflect, in 250 words or less, on their submission). When Justin Aubin heard about that option last fall, he thought, “Cool!”

Mr. Aubin, from Oak Lawn, Ill., was then a high school senior hoping to attend Yale. The following prompt caught his eye: “A community to which you belong and the footprint you have left.” He submitted a short video documenting his Eagle Scout project, for which he oversaw the construction of a monument honoring veterans. Even a well-written essay, he figured, couldn’t capture his experience as well as four minutes of footage, shot by his older brother.

The content of the video impressed Yale’s admissions committee. “People sat up in their chairs,” Mr. Quinlan said. “You could see how he handled his leadership role, and we felt like we got a good sense of him in a way that we didn’t get from recommendations.”

Mr. Aubin is now a freshman at Yale.

Did the video tip the scales? “That was a difference-maker,” Mr. Quinlan said.

Even as colleges consider innovation, it’s worth asking which fixtures of the admissions process, if any, they are willing to discard. Some prevalent practices seem to stand in the way of meaningful change.

Giving an advantage to the sons and daughters of alumni is one such practice. Some colleges admit legacies (and the children of potential donors) at a much greater rate than non-legacies. Legacies make up nearly a third of Harvard’s current freshman class, The Harvard Crimson has reported. Princeton’s class of 2021 is 13 percent legacy, according to the university’s website.

While a handful of prominent institutions, including the University of Georgia and Texas A&M University, stopped considering legacy status more than a decade ago, most colleges seem unlikely to remove that variable from the admissions equation anytime soon. “I don’t think an applicant’s legacy status is a crazy thing to look at, especially in the financial climate some colleges are in,” said Rick Clark, director of undergraduate admission at Georgia Tech, where nearly a fifth of freshmen are legacies. “Colleges have to think about their longevity.”

The benefits of legacies go beyond maintaining good will with alumni who might open their wallets, Mr. Clark said. In his experience, they tend to be enthusiastic students who help foster community on campus, the kind of relationships that help other students feel at home and succeed. “Multigenerational ties to a place add value, creating this passionate, magnetic source of energy,” he said.

The key, Mr. Clark believes, is not to lower standards, or to enroll so many legacies that other priorities, such as increasing racial and socioeconomic diversity, suffer as a result. “Those two goals aren’t mutually exclusive,” he said.

Other measurements used by selective colleges have nothing to do with a student’s accomplishments or attributes — and everything to do with a college’s agenda.

About one in five institutions allot “considerable importance” to “demonstrated interest,” the degree to which applicants convey their desire to enroll if accepted, according to a survey by the National Association for College Admission Counseling. The strongest expression of demonstrated interest is applying for binding early decision, a policy that favors affluent students who don’t need to compare financial aid offers and one that some colleges use to fill half their seats.

Beyond that, technology has made it easier to track the number of times an applicant engages with a college (by visiting the campus, contacting an admissions officer, responding to an email). This valuable information helps officers gauge who’s most likely to enroll, which can influence who gets admitted in the first place. A higher “yield,” the percentage of accepted students who actually enroll, is widely seen as a measure of status.

The problem is that savvy students who know colleges are watching them can tilt the odds in their favor, said Nancy Leopold, executive director of CollegeTracks, a Maryland nonprofit group that helps low-income and first-generation students get into college: “Demonstrated interest is biased against kids who don’t know the game exists, or who don’t have the time or money to play it.”

What do colleges really cherish? The answer is influenced greatly by the entities they seek to impress. U.S. News & World Report and other college guides, not to mention bond-rating agencies, rely heavily on conventional admissions metrics like ACT/SAT scores and acceptance rates to evaluate institutions. A college president might wish to attract more creative thinkers, but accomplishing that goal won’t help his college’s ranking.

Generally, colleges are risk-averse. Rocking the boat with a newfangled admissions process could hurt their reputations. “The challenge for many admissions offices is to make a change, but not so much change or innovation that you’re risking the position you’re in,” said Ms. Roper-Doten of Olin. Asking students to do more could scare off would-be applicants.

“Colleges seek validation,” said Lloyd Thacker, executive director of the Education Conservancy, a nonprofit group that has sought to reform college admissions. “Without a real external incentive for colleges to care about broadening their understanding of what makes an applicant promising, they don’t seem likely to change the definition on their own.”

A recent campaign called “Turning the Tide,” a project of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, is urging admissions deans to rethink the qualities they consider in applicants. In a report signed by representatives of about 200 campuses, colleges are asked to promote ethical character and service to others through the admissions process.

Although some deans say they have no business assessing the character of still-maturing teenagers, the push has prompted a handful of institutions to tweak their applications. The University of North Carolina now emphasizes contributions to others when asking about extracurricular activities. M.I.T. added an essay question asking students to describe how they’ve helped people.

Richard Weissbourd, a senior lecturer at Harvard, who leads the initiative, recommends that colleges define service in ways that might resonate with disadvantaged students. “Many students don’t have opportunities to do community service,” he said. “They’re taking care of their siblings, or they’re working part-time jobs to help their families. Colleges need to say, ‘That matters to us.’ ”

•

In the end, increasing racial and socioeconomic diversity in higher education is a matter of will. A college can prioritize it or not, said Shaun R. Harper, a professor at the University of Southern California’s Rossier School of Education who studies race and student success.

In September, Dr. Harper gave a keynote speech at the annual conference of the National Association for College Admission Counseling, in Boston. He urged his audience to think hard about racial inequality and “things you perhaps inadvertently and unknowingly do to support it.”

He cited as examples high school counselors who discourage promising minority students from applying to highly selective colleges; college leaders who say they “just can’t find enough” qualified black applicants even as their athletics coaches comb the nation for black students who excel at sports; admissions officers who recruit at the same high schools year after year, overlooking those full of underrepresented minorities.

As Dr. Harper spoke, many listeners applauded; a few scowled. He concluded his remarks by criticizing the lack of racial diversity among admissions deans themselves. He received a standing ovation.

In a subsequent interview, Dr. Harper elaborated on his concerns. “When the demographics of the profession have not changed, particularly at the senior level,” he said, “I don’t know that we can expect a major change, especially in terms of diversifying the class.”

Although Dr. Harper believes colleges rely too heavily on ACT/SAT scores, he says that the major barriers arise well before the application process even begins. Colleges, he said, must do more in terms of outreach to encourage underrepresented students to apply.

Dr. Pérez, at Trinity, has similar concerns. Although he is convinced that the selection process can be successfully revamped, he doesn’t think that will solve the No. 1 problem he sees in admissions. “The problem is money,” he said. “If I had more funding, my class would be more diverse. The conversation we’re not having in this country is: How do we fund colleges and universities?”

However the admissions process might evolve, it surely will continue to serve the interests of colleges first and foremost. Even if someone invents a better, more equitable way to gauge applicants’ potential, a college’s many wants and needs wouldn’t change. Deans would still seek to balance their classes by enrolling a diverse mix of majors from many states and countries. Colleges would still need enough oboe players and theater-arts majors.

“What compels institutions to change is deep discontent,” said Marie Bigham, director of college counseling at Isidore Newman School, in New Orleans. “If they’re only making changes on the margins, it indicates that they’re mostly content with the way things are.”

That leads to a big question in an age of widening social inequality. How unhappy are the wealthiest colleges, really, with the status quo? Some of the nation’s most selective institutions enroll more students from the top 1 percent of the income ladder than from the bottom 60 percent. Is that simply because of lack of preparation in the K-12 system? Flaws within the selection process? Or is it evidence, as Dr. Harper suggests, of a systemic lack of will to change those numbers?

Jon Boeckenstedt, associate vice president for enrollment management and marketing at DePaul University, says that it is the high-profile colleges that have the power to redefine the admissions process.

“Unless and until something changes at the top, nothing else is going to change,” he said. “That’s because, at a lot of colleges, people will go to their graves trying to imitate the Ivy League.”",What Colleges Want in an Applicant (Everything),https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/education/edlife/what-college-admissions-wants.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The Reformation and its wars did indeed diminish religious authority, secularize politics and allow certain kinds of individualism to flourish. But they also empowered (and were exploited and worsened by) the great new gods of modernity, the almighty market and the centralizing state, which claimed their own kind of authority over everyday life, making the divided churches into handmaidens or scapegoats, and using Christianity as an excuse for plunder rather than a restraining counterforce to worldly lust.

This simultaneous expansion of commercial power and state power made the Western world more orderly and rationalized and much, much wealthier. It also licensed cruelty and repression on an often extraordinary scale. It produced some remarkable experiments in religious tolerance, our own Constitution among them. It also encouraged secular inquisitions that made the original look tame. It opened new opportunities for the rational and industrious. It also weakened or destroyed the places where one might retreat from commerce or refuse the world. It led to huge leaps forward in health and life expectancy for all. It also brutalized religious resisters, stacked non-European bodies like cordwood … and eventually revived the worst tendencies of the old Christendom, anti-Semitism and millenarianism, in fascist and Communist experiments that added the genocide of millions to the modern state’s list of crimes.

Even in our republic’s mother country, England, which escaped some of the worst horrors of the Continent, the Reformation’s religious conflict ended in victories for a brutal centralizing form of power. It was religious fanaticism that burned heretics and stripped altars and briefly raised up a Puritan theocracy. But the rapaciousness of Henry VIII and the police state of Elizabeth I, the evisceration of the old Catholic culture and the suppression of popular protest and dissent, the ethnic and religious cleansings carried out on England’s Celtic fringe — these were very modern projects, and their purpose wasn’t liberty but subjugation, not religious tolerance so much as the elimination of any religious challenge to the state.

In Hilary Mantel’s popular novels about Reformation England, “Wolf Hall” and “Bring Up the Bodies,” the figure of Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII’s enforcer, is presented as a sympathetic proto-modern alternative to the dueling zealotries of popery and Calvinism — more broad-minded and humane and secular, less bigoted and ascetic.

But Cromwell was also a ruthless killer who served a cruel tyrant. Which makes him an apt choice, even if Mantel does not intend it, to embody the secularizing forces that triumphed over Protestants as well as Catholics — because Cromwellism, mass murder in the service of secular power and commercial wealth, has just as strong a claim as liberty or individualism to define the world that succeeded Christendom’s collapse.

Here the objection will be that, yes, the road to modern liberalism was a bloody one, but it all could have been much worse. And indeed, worse could be imagined. It is possible to imagine a world where Western Christendom remained united but Europe refused the gifts of science and the church sank into permanent corruption, with Ottoman armies delivering a coup de grâce. It is also possible to imagine a world where an undivided Roman church harnessed science and technology to its own sort of religious-totalitarian ends, and became a theocratic boot stamping on a human face, forever.

So perhaps the modern world as we know it was the best we could do, the only path to liberty and pluralism and mass prosperity, however many Cromwells it required to get here.

But my own (biased, Catholic) guess is that given the technological and social changes already at work in early modern Europe, the great new modern powers, the state and the commercial interest, would have come to bestride the world no matter what happened to Christian unity. So a church that remained undivided probably wouldn’t have been able to strangle modern science or capitalism in the crib even had it wanted to. But it might have served as a stronger moral check on the new powers, a stronger countervailing force against greed and secular absolutism, than the divided churches that Europe had instead.

It is hard to read the history of Western colonial ventures, in which for hundreds of years it was mostly the intensely religious (as compromised and corrupted as their churches often were) that remonstrated against mass murder and enslavement, that sought to defend natives and establish norms for their protection, and not suspect that a still-united Western church would have found it easier to turn its moral critiques into more effective practical restraints. And it is harder still to read the history of the 20th century and have any kind of confidence that the world made by Thomas Cromwell and his successors was better than a world where Protestants and Catholics did not divide.

Indeed in secular liberalism there is an implicit tribute to this possibility, a kind of yearning for a vanished Christendom, that arose in part as a response to the horrifying place where secular politics ended up last century. What are our pan-national institutions, our United Nations and European Union, all our interlocking NGOs, if not an attempt to recreate a kind of ecclesiastical power, a churchlike form of sovereignty, on the basis of thinner, less dogmatic but still essentially metaphysical ideas — the belief in human dignity and human rights?

As the church did before its crackup, and might have done thereafter, these modern ecclesiastical agencies do have some gentling effect. But they are a made-up religion whose acolytes at some level know it — and the thinness of their metaphysics, their weak claim on human loyalties, makes them mostly just a pleasing cloak over the dark power that’s actually stabilized the modern world, the terrifying threat of nuclear war.

I’m being grim on purpose; more optimistic views than this are possible. But since the unity of Christendom isn’t coming back any time soon and our own society has a thousand incentives to lie to itself about how religious division was for the best, it’s worth considering the dark version of the long view.

The modern world offers many gifts, and the fact that Catholics and Protestants now dwell together without bloodshed is certainly one of them. But to assume that this division was a necessary means to a happy secular and liberal ending is to assume that we actually know the ending — even though the story so far has given us many novel forms of tyrannies as well as greater liberties, and the price of the modern experiment has been millions of unremembered dead.",Who Won the Reformation?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/opinion/protestant-reformation.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

They had their own place in soccer’s lexicon: the prosaic “utility player” in English, and the more poetic tuttofare (“does everything”) in Italian, or todoterreno (“all terrain”) in Spanish.

At Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United, the likes of Phil Neville, Park Ji-Sung and John O’Shea filled the role of utility players. Ferguson deemed the latter to be of such importance in the club’s 2008-09 season that at one point he anointed him a contender for player of the year in England. The great Liverpool side of the late 1980s boasted Steve Nicol; the Ajax team that swept through Europe in the 1990s could call on Ronald de Boer.

To a manager, versatility was an asset; to a player, it was an advantage. Steve Watson, who played in every outfield position for both Newcastle United and Everton, knew his flexibility made him “ideal cover” as a substitute, but always felt it gave him “a much better opportunity of getting into the team.”

In recent years, however, utility seemed to have fallen out of fashion. When clubs can name at least seven substitutes, rather than three, for every game, managers had no need to reserve a space on the bench for someone who could cover anywhere.

As squads grew, too, managers learned to favor expertise. Most elite teams employ two specialists for every position, with those positions ever more tightly defined. Few would expect an attacking midfielder to slot into a holding role, much less play at fullback.

In many ways, José Mourinho encapsulates this thinking. In the spring of 2016, when he agreed to replace Louis van Gaal at Manchester United, Mourinho commanded the club’s executive vice chairman, Ed Woodward, to sign four players, each of them designated a specific role: Paul Pogba, Eric Bailly, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

“As you know, especially the ones with more vision, I am a manager that likes specialists,” Mourinho explained at the time. “I am clear with my approach and model of players.” At most, he said, he likes “one or two multifunctional players,” because “you always need someone that can give you a hand.”

In such an environment, then, it should be no surprise that players are increasingly keen to define themselves as specialists. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, for example, cited a desire to play in his favored central midfield role when he joined Liverpool, and Aaron Ramsey made the same request to Arsène Wenger, the Arsenal manager, with more success.

“Some guys, they only want to play in one position,” Guardiola, now the Manchester City manager, said recently. “They say that they are not comfortable in another one.” Soccer, it seems, no longer has much room, or much appetite, for the jacks-of-all-trades.

Guardiola, however, was speaking immediately after his team had beaten Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, thanks in no small part to the performance of Fabian Delph — who has spent much of his career as a midfield player — at left back.

“He showed us,” Guardiola said. “It’s not easy when a manager gives you an opportunity to play in a position you’ve never played before, so it means a lot. I’m so happy for him.”

It is the same across Manchester at United, where Mourinho, for all his professed preference for specialists, is enjoying no little success with Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young, brought up as wingers, as his two fullbacks. At Liverpool, midfielder James Milner was deputized as a left back for much of last season.

It is not just fullbacks, though. At Barcelona, Javier Mascherano, a defensive midfielder for Argentina, plays in central defense, while Sergi Roberto has won praise for his ability to fill as many as eight positions.

Bayern Munich uses Javi Martínez as a defender and a midfielder, while Guardiola’s intervention ensured Philipp Lahm was reimagined as a midfielder rather than a defender in the final years before his retirement. David Alaba is most often used as a left back but can play across the midfield, too.

In attack, if anything, versatility is even more of a prerequisite, among both the elite and the lesser lights. When Stoke City signed Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting this summer, it was his ability to play across the front line that persuaded the Stoke manager, Mark Hughes, to make his move. He had specifically commissioned his scouting team to find a forward comfortable in several roles.

To some, in fact, soccer is moving beyond the traditional, tight definitions of positions. Modern systems and tactics demand that players fill any number of roles during any given game, shifting between duties as the situation demands. “Who even decides the positions?” Jurgen Klopp, the Liverpool manager, said. “If you are a left back, maybe you started as a left winger. A central defender might have started as a No. 6.

“We play sometimes with wingers, but really only when we defend. It is quite fluid. I am not interested in positions: only when we are defending, and in terms of the distances between players.”

It is much the same message many young players are given during their education. “There are different, and continually evolving, systems and styles at the highest level,” said Joel Waldron, the manager of Everton’s youth academy, among the most prolific in England. “We feel it is important that we develop players who are tactically flexible.”

That process involves playing young prospects in as many positions as possible: not just within games, Waldron said, but during coaching sessions designed to “expose them to a variety of selected positional roles and responsibilities,” and in the classroom, too. “As the boys get older, we supplement their learning with video sessions,” Waldron said.

There is an element of pragmatism behind all this; as Waldron noted, many of his graduates will make their debuts in “unfavored” and occasionally unfamiliar positions. But mostly it is a philosophical choice.

“It’s important we have a curriculum that is conducive to developing players who understand the breadth of roles they may be asked to fulfill at first-team level,” he said. “Though understanding a wide range of roles must not be to the detriment of being outstanding at some or all of them.”

That was Enrique’s secret, of course: He was a master of every position he played, not simply a place-filler. It is the model, more and more, that all teams are trying to follow in an age when fluidity is paramount, when managers require players who can adapt to any system they choose. They need players who can play anywhere, who can do anything.

But Mr. Xi’s lofty vision clashes with a harsh reality across much of rural China. In many villages, young people have gone, leaving older residents to fend for themselves. Disparities in education, health care and social services remain stark.

Even as Chinese cities have turned into playgrounds for the nouveau riche and the swelling ranks of the middle class, nearly 500 million people, or about 40 percent of China’s population, live on less than $5.50 per day, according to the World Bank.

“The whole idea of socialism was that all Chinese would have a reasonable living standard,” said Kerry Brown, a China scholar at King’s College London. “The nagging concern is that the Communist Party has created billionaires and a strong middle class, and yet there are still a lot of poor people. That seems to be a massive contradiction.”

As China works to modernize its economy, it faces the reality that the world’s newest superpower remains a developing nation with a huge poverty problem. Experts say that a slowing economy and loss of manufacturing jobs could add to strains on low-income families, undermining Mr. Xi’s vision.

Under Mr. Xi, who has played up an image as an Everyman, the fight against poverty has become a national mantra. The state-run news media routinely shows Mr. Xi visiting poor villages, sampling the food and water and checking on the health of residents. The evening news is filled with tales of rejuvenated communities, and villagers-turned-entrepreneurs heaping praise on Mr. Xi and the government for providing loans and new apartments.

On Wednesday, during a speech marking the beginning of his second five-year term as party leader, Mr. Xi described eradicating poverty by 2020 as one of his chief priorities, vowing to “leave no one behind in the march toward common prosperity.”

Mr. Xi has also used the fight against poverty to strengthen China’s global alliances, financing programs in Africa and Southeast Asia, and urging the world to learn from China’s experience.

Now Mr. Xi faces pressure to deliver.

“Xi Jinping is a prisoner of expectations,” Professor Brown said. “His problem is not the fears of Chinese people but the hopes of Chinese people.”

While international organizations like the United Nations and the World Bank have praised the government’s work in helping hundreds of millions of Chinese rise out of poverty in recent decades, some experts worry that Mr. Xi’s plan is more about making headlines than bringing lasting change to poor communities.

Some say the government’s focus on 43 million people is too narrow, noting that millions more live just above the official poverty line in conditions that are not much better. Others say that by concentrating on rural areas, Mr. Xi is neglecting the plight of the urban poor, many of whom are rural migrants.

“The government’s initiatives sound good,” said Qin Gao, a professor at Columbia University who studies Chinese social policy. “But the question is how to sustain poverty reduction. Some people may be looking to quick fixes rather than really addressing poverty.”

Mr. Xi has instructed officials to focus on alleviating poverty in rural places like Chashan, where farming conditions are poor, access to basic social services is limited and residents struggle with heart disease and other ailments without a clinic nearby.

Photo

For centuries, Chashan, nestled in the mountains about 6,400 feet above sea level, has been home to farmers who plant wheat and yams and raise pigs and sheep on dry terrain.

The government is trying to turn the village into a tourist destination, but so far only a trickle of visitors have come. The town is hard to reach and lacks modern facilities.

Many residents said they had virtually no income and that subsidies from the government were inadequate.

“There’s no way out,” said Li Chao, 70, a farmer who has struggled with blood clots in his legs. “I can’t earn any money.”

Li Zhi, the trash collector, relies on donations from the few tourists for food and clothing. A calligraphy banner reading “Wealth will come” hangs in his home. He said he remains dubious that he will ever be able to buy his own clothes.

“It’s impossible to eliminate poverty,” he said.

The government has used a variety of approaches to help bring people out of poverty, devoting tens of billions of dollars to the effort and more than $370 billion in loans. Local officials, who are judged partly on their success in improving living standards, are working feverishly to meet Mr. Xi’s deadline.

Some villages have experimented with rural cooperatives, allowing families to raise production by pooling labor and resources. State-owned banks have provided microloans to help villagers tap into China’s e-commerce boom by selling embroidered dresses and other goods online.

But the hardest work remains ahead. As many as half of the 43 million people who are officially classified as in poverty could be disabled, according to the government. The campaign must also move into areas that have been chronically poor for generations, including many that are home to ethnic minorities.

Officials in these areas are resettling villagers near cities in government-provided apartments, sometimes against their will. They are handing out cash subsidies to disabled residents. And they are following Mr. Xi’s call for a “targeted” approach, tracking the progress of individual residents on giant bulletin boards in town centers.

Corruption has emerged as a problem, with more than 1,800 people having been investigated last year for embezzling antipoverty funds and related crimes, according to official statistics. Scholars have also cast doubt on the reliability of some data, saying some local officials appear to be understating poverty rates amid intense pressure to meet Mr. Xi’s targets.

Then there is the fact that Mr. Xi’s campaign is not focused on urban areas. There are more than 200 million rural migrants in China’s cities, where many struggle to receive education, heath care and other benefits because the local government does not consider them residents. Some fall into unemployment or bad health and live in squalid conditions.

“This is a very big hole in the overall picture, which the government rarely addresses,” said Philip G. Alston, a scholar and adviser to the United Nations who issued a report this year on extreme poverty and human rights in China. “The reality is that many of them are living in extreme poverty.”

On a street corner in downtown Beijing, Gu Xin, 63, sat on a flattened cardboard box begging for money. Mr. Gu moved to the city from central China six months ago, only to find himself unable to get steady work after his back was injured in a construction accident.

As he bowed to passers-by, a propaganda sign flashed in the background: “Without the Communist Party, there is no new China.” Mr. Gu said he had no choice but to ask strangers for money so that he could pay medical bills and support his family.

It’s a musical chameleon’s curse, and maybe his protection, that people don’t have any idea, sonically or otherwise, who he really is. Those familiar with Mr. Yazbek as Broadway’s go-to songwriter for comedy film adaptations probably haven’t heard his solo work as frontman for a series of rock bands with names like Coke Machine, Moon Pudding, Barn and His Warmest Regards.

And vice versa: Those who groove to his sulfurous, often cheerfully pessimistic albums, with songs like “Monkey Baby Hanging on a Chicken Wire” and “Ultrasad,” would probably be surprised by brassy show tunes like “Here I Am” and unironic ballads like “Breeze Off the River.”

Which is why it’s understandable that the talk around Broadway about Mr. Yazbek and “The Band’s Visit,” which opens at the Ethel Barrymore Theater on Nov. 9 in a production directed by Mr. Cromer, is so wrong.

This delicate, contemplative and thoroughly gorgeous musical, first seen last winter at the Atlantic Theater Company, does not represent, as some say, Mr. Yazbek’s unlikeliest disguise to date. Quite the opposite. “The Band’s Visit” is the truest version of him Broadway has yet heard, or is ever likely to.

“All my life I’ve written songs, right?” he half-asks, half-demands, lying like an analysand on a couch in the studio he built a few yards from his house in Rockland County. Unlike most people in analysis, though, he noodles gently on a bass as he speaks.

“I’ve made five albums that have nothing to do with musical theater,” he continues. “And, like most singer-songwriters, my motive for writing them was to tell people what I was thinking and feeling. That usually has to do with human connection and death, in a good way: How life is ennobled by the fact of death, and is deeper than what we run around frittering about all day.”

He pauses and plinks. “But unlike my other shows, in which I had a real but superficial connection to the characters’ issues, almost every song in ‘The Band’s Visit’ gives me the feeling that I’ve expressed something I feel deeply about.”

Photo

Photo

If that’s a tall order for a musical, “The Band’s Visit” is unusually ambitious, its many comic moments woven like countermelodies into a story of “human beings crying from the heart in joy or pain,” as Mr. Yazbek puts it.

With a book by Itamar Moses, based on the screenplay by Eran Kolirin, it concerns a ragtag Egyptian police orchestra that gets stranded in the wrong Israeli town en route to a gig at an Arab cultural center. Instead of exciting Petah Tikvah, with a ‘P,’ they wind up in a stultifying Negev outpost called Bet Hatkivah, with a ‘B’ — “like in basically bleak and beige and blah blah blah,” as one of Mr. Yazbek’s dead-on lyrics puts it.

The theme is miscommunication, including the romantic kind: the terrible gap between what we feel and what we say. In “The Band’s Visit,” the only cure is music, and yet it isn’t enough.

The Egyptians and the Israelis reach out to one another on waves of melody, from ethereal Arab song to thumping klezmer. Two in particular — the band’s leader, Tewfiq (Tony Shalhoub), and Dina, who houses him (Katrina Lenk) — nearly find a common language. But even they eventually have to acknowledge the emptiness, if perhaps a slightly less empty emptiness, that seeps back when melody passes.

Video

This theme and setting made “The Band’s Visit” a natural playground for Mr. Yazbek, who grew up on Manhattan’s Upper West Side with a Maronite Arab father and a half Jewish, half Italian mother. For a song about the Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum, he could call on his own memory of her voice on the radio in a cab while visiting his grandfather in Lebanon. To shape the score’s swirling contours, he did not have to study Middle Eastern scales or Egyptian instrumentation; he was already handy on darbouka (a goblet-shaped drum) and oud (a short-necked lyre). He was also in a good position to translate what he calls “the sound of Israeli sarcasm.”

But he had a surfeit of other sounds as well. Growing up surrounded by every kind of music — “Kiss Me, Kate” and Miles Davis on the stereo, the polyrhythms of congas in Central Park — he developed an early and eclectic ear. He started his first band, whose name cannot be published here, when he was 12; played gigs for a thousand students at college block parties; landed a solo recording contract at 28.

Another lifetime later, at 57, though married (to Elizabeth Doberneck, a meditation teacher) and with a son, Omar, in college, Mr. Yazbek retains the slightly hassled aura of a man who has almost made peace with his work — or, maybe more accurately, a man who remakes that peace every day. (He, too, meditates.)

This is a vast improvement over the person who seemed to be jumping out of his skin when I first encountered him in the “Full Monty” era. Back then, he seemed embarrassed that, of all the roads open to him, he’d found his biggest success on the one that led to Broadway, with its corny philosophies and unprovoked belting.

Among the roads less taken was comedy. Directly out of Brown, he wrote for David Letterman, part of a “Late Show” team that won an Emmy Award in 1984. (His favorite bit was called “The Most Dangerous Game,” in which a pack of bloodhounds searched 30 Rock for the announcer Bill Wendell.) And his career as a solo musical artist never took off the way he had planned — though that was, he says, his own fault.

“I made my own bed when I decided not to tour all the time,” he explains. “There were guys like Ben Folds and Dave Matthews who started off at the same time, doing what I should have done: get in a van with a baby grand, go up and down the East Coast circuit and make a subsistence living while developing a fan base. But if I doomed myself by staying home, it turns out it was a great doom. Now all those guys are sick of touring and want to write musicals.”

Even so, for a long time the regret was easily read on his face. The “man-dudes” in his poker game, hoping to annoy him into making mistakes, insisted on calling him “Broadway’s David Yazbek.”

That taunt would have been incomprehensible during the so-called Golden Age of musicals. Loesser, Cole Porter and Stephen Sondheim, three of Mr. Yazbek’s idols, could aspire to nothing higher than Broadway success — though Mr. Sondheim, coming at the end of the line, eventually grew so disheartened that he threatened to give up musicals for murder mysteries or video games.

It’s worth noting that what toppled theater music from its position as the prime engine of popular culture was the same trend that Mr. Yazbek was hoping to ride: the rise of the rock singer-songwriter. Mr. Yazbek has played both sides of the fence, bringing to each discipline the skills and, well, the discipline of the other.

Thanks to rock, he writes musical theater lyrics that arise from their stories at unexpected angles and with a looser diction than most of the classics. The rhymes in “The Band’s Visit” are accurate enough to get laughs (awful/falafel; marrow/Pharaoh) but not obsessively mitered. Thanks to musical theater, his rock songs are tighter and better structured than almost anyone’s.

And after decades in which critics openly prayed for a savior to resuscitate theater music with the primal energies of pop, perhaps we can now see that Mr. Yazbek has been doing it, insufficiently heralded, for years. (He received Tony Award nominations for all three of his previous Broadway scores, but has never won.) In the shadow of “The Producers,” “The Full Monty” was a marginal hit; “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” recouped only on the road. “Women on the Verge,” through no fault of Mr. Yazbek’s, was a major flop (though a revised version met with more success in London). Even “The Band’s Visit,” despite its Off Broadway raves, is nobody’s idea of a sure thing.

Mr. Yazbek would, of course, love a hit, but his pleasure in the work itself acts as a kind of professional prophylaxis. He has nearly completed the score for a musical version of the 1982 hit film “Tootsie” — as flat-out a musical comedy as you could imagine — and is working on the lyrics to Henry Krieger’s music for a show about the evangelist Tammy Faye Bakker. The luxury of writing only what he wants, while recording the occasional solo album, is enough, he says, to “service my pretensions.”

Servicing his spiritual aspirations is a different matter. This used to require performing in public: “The connection you make while sharing in the creation of music with other people in real time,” he says, “is the closest metaphor for the actual connection that every sentient being has, way beneath the surface, at the root of truth.”

Photo

Now, he says, he can achieve that connection without so much performing. Still, after certain performances, when company members gather outside the Barrymore or beneath its stage for a jam session of Arabic music, Mr. Yazbek sometimes joins in. On a recent evening, after a two-show day, he grabbed a spare drum from the darbouka player Ossama Farouk, while George Abud, who plays Camal in the musical, improvised on his oud, with Ms. Lenk on violin. They fed one another melodies like canapés.

A few rugs and lanterns could not disguise the grimness of what was actually the musicians’ locker room, with costume racks pressing in. But as the four worked through “El Hayah Helwa” (“Life Is Beautiful”) by Farid al-Atrash, and an Umm Kulthum song called “Awedt Ainy,” which Mr. Abud translated as “I’m Addicted to You,” all the discomforts disappeared.

In an interview with Laura Ingraham on Fox News last night, the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, said “the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War,” a statement that would shock, among others, the founding fathers. After spirited debates at the 1787 Constitutional Convention, they included Article 1, Section 2, Paragraph 3 in our Constitution, which said each slave, for legislative representation and taxation purposes, counted as three-fifths of a person. That provision is known as the Three-Fifths Compromise, a term that clearly states that Northerners and Southerners were, in fact, quite able to reach weird compromises on slavery.

But our country’s tortured attempt to find some kind of balance on whether it was right to enslave African-Americans wasn’t limited to the Three-Fifths Compromise. To argue that the Civil War came about because Americans couldn’t compromise on whether black slaves were truly people or not would require us to ignore at least six other major compromises on slavery, from the first fugitive slave law in 1793, which said that escaped slaves in any state could be caught, tried and returned to their masters, to the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which allowed residents of the two territories to vote on whether to allow slavery. Slaveowners and abolitionists compromised on slavery over and over again, throwing black people’s rights onto the bargaining table like betting chips in a casino.

The Civil War ended slavery, but the legacy of all the prewar compromising on black people’s rights sparked new fights: the fleeting freedoms of Reconstruction; the punishing hand of Jim Crow; the limited triumphs of the civil rights movement; the quiet indignities of practices like racially restrictive covenants, which allowed homeowners to place terminology in property deeds to restrict ownership by race; and redlining, which reduced the value of homes in black neighborhoods compared with their white counterparts.

In the 1970s, President Richard M. Nixon opened a new front on the compromising with his war on drugs. One of his top advisers admitted to a reporter in 1994 that they had designed the war to target blacks and hippies, and it resulted in a large spike in the prison population, which took away many black people’s right to remain physically free.

And in 1973, the Supreme Court decided that school financing systems that relied on property taxes and therefore favored wealthy districts over poor ones weren’t unconstitutional.

What also troubled the Germans, according to former American diplomats, was Mr. Murphy’s lack of diplomatic experience, though he was familiar with the country because he had overseen Goldman Sachs’s office there from 1993 to 1997.

Mr. Murphy, however, was a fast study, according to Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, a former senior director for European affairs at the National Security Council, who communicated regularly with the American embassy in Berlin. He traveled around the country and used his affinity for soccer to bond with German officials, she said.

But about a year and a half into his tenure, Mr. Murphy was ensnared in a crisis that would embarrass American diplomatic missions around the world: the publication of a massive cache of State Department cables by WikiLeaks.

In the classified cables, Mr. Murphy was shown to be a shrewd operator within the German political system, having sources — one was called “the mole” by German news media — throughout the government. They provided the American embassy inside reports about German politics, including detailed accounts of negotiations to form a coalition government in 2009.

The cables also contained critical comments Mr. Murphy made about senior German officials. He called Chancellor Angela Merkel “insecure” and referred to her as “Teflon” because of her penchant for avoiding political controversy.

He described the foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, as “incompetent, vain and critical of the United States.”

The public embarrassment prompted questions from the media and some German politicians about whether Mr. Murphy should be recalled to the United States. Mr. Murphy expressed regret that the comments were made public, but refused to apologize and said, “I’m not going anywhere.”

Photo

“At the end of the day, the buck stops with me,” he told Der Spiegel, the most widely read magazine in Germany. “I worry about my people. They have done nothing wrong. I am not going to apologize for one speck of what they’ve done.’’

Within diplomatic circles, many saw Mr. Murphy’s remarks as common chatter in confidential cables. The German government, while publicly displaying irritation, never asked for another ambassador, according to former White House officials who would only discuss internal diplomatic matters on the condition of anonymity.

“The thing with cables, they all carry the ambassador’s name, but they aren’t necessarily things he wrote,” said Karen Donfried, a former official with the National Security Council. “I remember it being a kerfuffle at the time, but I don’t recall it as having lasting damage for him.”

In some ways, the WikiLeaks crisis may have helped elevate Mr. Murphy’s profile, making him a familiar face. Bild, Germany’s highest-circulation tabloid, began featuring him as a boldfaced name spotted at upscale, celebrity-stocked parties. Photos appeared of Mr. Murphy and his wife, Tammy, on the red carpet at film festivals.

Mr. Murphy dressed his children in local soccer jerseys and participated in a pickup soccer match with German politicians. He invited German reporters to the embassy to view the artwork he and his wife had selected. And he was instrumental in bringing Jon Bon Jovi — a friend for years — to perform at a festival commemorating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.

“It was not a cakewalk in his time as ambassador and I thought he handled it extremely well,” Ms. Donfried said.

If Mr. Murphy’s role as ambassador produced more public insights than he would have preferred, his long tenure at Goldman Sachs remains largely opaque. The investment firm’s culture of secrecy makes many current and former employees reticent to talk in depth about colleagues or the company’s inner workings.

Photo

Mr. Murphy, who received an undergraduate degree from Harvard and a master’s in business administration from the Wharton School of Business, began as an intern at Goldman Sachs in 1982, and was hired by the firm a year later. He rose quickly, eventually becoming head of Goldman Sachs Germany in Frankfurt, responsible for establishing a beachhead in a country that often preferred doing business with local banks.

Mr. Murphy assembled a team and demanded that they all learn to speak German, even though banking business was mostly conducted in English. He played a key role in signing a major German client, Deutsche Telekom, and his success earned him a spot on the bank’s lucrative managing committee.

It also led him to Hong Kong, as president of Goldman Sachs Asia, where he helped secure $4.2 billion in underwriting for an initial public offering of China Telecom, which was considered a landmark achievement in the privatization of a Chinese national company on the international market.

But deals made by Goldman Sachs under his watch in Asia also drew scrutiny. The firm had been working to take the state oil company, China National Petroleum Corp., public. But the oil company had international associations that ran afoul of American regulations, especially its dealing with the government of Sudan at the time of the genocide in Darfur.

As a solution, the bank worked with the oil company to spin off a domestic entity, PetroChina. But it remained dogged by ties to China National, attracting protests and scrutiny from members of Congress. When PetroChina finally went public in 2000, its initial public offering, promoted by many at Goldman Sachs as one of the biggest in history, fell short of projections.

Mr. Murphy had left his role in Asia before the PetroChina initial public offering was finalized and his part in the deal remains murky. Peter Rose, a former senior manager at Goldman Sachs, said that Mr. Murphy was instrumental in “starting the process,” but said he left his post in Asia before it moved forward.

Henry M. Paulson, who was Goldman’s chief operating officer at the time, also said “I don’t recall his involvement with the PetroChina I.P.O.”

As the campaign for governor nears its end, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, the Republican, has used the deal involving PetroChina, as well as others, to attack Mr. Murphy, demanding he release his “Goldman Sachs client list.”

Mr. Murphy’s campaign has declined to comment in any detail on his Goldman Sachs tenure. However, in a separate interview, he said his years at Goldman and as ambassador were assets.

“I see that this is a state in crisis and the economy is broken,” he said. “I think there are things that I learned while I was there that actually matter and are applicable to what we need to do in the state.”

Mr. Rose, Mr. Paulson and other senior managers at Goldman Sachs, described Mr. Murphy’s time at Goldman in the same way others described his performance as ambassador: highly energetic and engaged, skilled at leading conversation and public speaking.

At Goldman, he was known to hold “one conversation” dinner parties at his house, orchestrating the discussion and calling on people to answer questions.

Mr. Paulson recalled a time when he leaned on Mr. Murphy’s public speaking ability and it did not go as planned.

“Phil is a terrific public speaker so after I had become the head of the investment banking division in 1990, I had Phil giving me some tips on delivery at the banquet after the year end conference,” Mr. Paulson said. “I am a teetotaler and Phil, who is not, left his glass of vodka next to my glass of water on the podium. When I mistakenly grabbed his glass to chug some water I thought I was going to die. And when I next opened my mouth to speak nothing came out.”

Those who worked with Mr. Murphy in Germany and Asia said he enjoyed socializing.

“The holiday parties are legendary,” Mr. Rose said, citing a costume party where he mingled with senior Goldman managers while dressed as Buzz Lightyear of “Toy Story.”

He could not recall what Mr. Murphy wore.","For Philip Murphy, Key Résumé Entries Are Often Left Unspoken",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/nyregion/for-philip-murphy-key-resume-entries-are-often-left-unspoken.html

Apple is selling the iPhone X with two options for storage capacity: 64 gigabytes for $999 and 256 gigabytes for $1,149.

There are various ways to pay that hefty price.

The simplest route is to pay for the device outright. This is the least confusing option because your wireless bill will contain charges only for your phone plan, and you can do whatever you want with the device — like sell it or switch to a different wireless carrier — whenever you want.

You can also opt to spread out the payments with a monthly installment plan. For example, if you are a Verizon customer, you can choose to pay off the $999 iPhone over 24 months for $41.62 a month. This is a nice option because spreading out the payments does not incur interest fees.

Another option is to go for an early upgrade plan, which lets you pay a flat monthly rate and upgrade to a new iPhone annually. It’s essentially leasing a new phone every year.

There are various early upgrade plans on the market. With Apple’s early upgrade program, you can pay $49.91 a month, and once you’ve made 12 payments, you can trade in your iPhone to upgrade to the next one and continue paying that monthly rate. (I’m not a fan of this path because I suggest cherishing your devices for as long as you can before upgrading.)

Similarities to the Cheaper iPhone 8

Before you splurge, consider your options. Apple’s iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which share many features of the iPhone X, have starting prices of $699 and $799. The cheaper iPhones have the same computing processor as the iPhone X, so they are just as fast, and their 12-megapixel rear cameras are on a par with the rear camera on the iPhone X.

So what’s the difference? Mainly, the screen.

■The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen that takes up the entire face of the device, with the exception of a notch at the top containing an infrared camera system.

■The iPhone 8 has a 4.7-inch screen, and the iPhone 8 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen.

Both of the cheaper iPhones have bezels — the border surrounding the display — whereas the iPhone X has eliminated the bezel.

Other than screen size, the screen technologies differ. The iPhone X is the only Apple phone that uses OLED, a type of display that can be made thinner, lighter and brighter, and with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD. So the screen on the iPhone X looks more vibrant than the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8, which still use LCD.

Last but not least, the iPhone X has a unique infrared face scanner. The technology, called Face ID, uses the infrared camera system on the front of the phone to scan the contours and shape of a person’s head to unlock the device and authorize mobile payments. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus have normal front-facing cameras for snapping selfies.

How Face Recognition Replaces the Fingerprint Sensor

The primary way you can unlock an iPhone X is with the face scanner. The premium phone lacks Touch ID, the fingerprint sensor that has been a popular feature on iPhones for several years.

Face ID is brand new — there hasn’t been anything like it on a smartphone before. It works by spraying an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots. The imaging system can stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it. Because the shape of a person’s head is unique, the likelihood of bypassing facial recognition with someone else’s face is one in a million, according to Apple.

Older facial recognition systems worked by using the camera to take a photo of yourself and comparing that with an image that was stored on the device. All a thief would need to do to fool the system was hold a photo of your face in front of the camera — which some people already did with Samsung’s facial-recognition feature. The false acceptance rate of older face recognition systems was one in 100.

It will be interesting to see how early adopters react to Face ID, and whether it will work well with many different kinds of faces. If you’re skeptical or turned off by the idea of your phone constantly scanning your face to unlock your phone, you could always get an iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus, which still have Touch ID.",The iPhone X Arrives Friday.

But to the fraternity of climbing enthusiasts around the world, he was a phenomenon whose exploits above clouds and tree lines at 10,000 to 20,000 feet resounded in mountaineering lore and journals: the achievements of an eccentric daredevil who took on the continent’s last unclimbed peaks and uncharted routes, who probably took more risks than anyone in history.

He wrote guidebooks and lectured for the cognoscenti, Americans and Canadians who appreciated the history, topography and perilous beauty of their wilderness strongholds, and for those who hoped to test their mettle on glacial escarpments with rope, ice ax and aching limbs for the reward of standing on the crown of a mountain called Terror or Despair, overlooking a vast panorama of the world.

“If Thoreau and Emerson describe the transcendental American theme, then Beckey — after Ahab, akin to Kerouac — describes the oddly manic drive to scale and map and detail the wilderness in a modern way,” Steve Costie, executive director of the Mountaineers, a Seattle-based outdoor recreation group, told The New York Times in 2008, when Mr. Beckey was in his 72nd year of mountaineering.

He climbed Africa’s tallest peak, Mount Kilimanjaro (19,341 feet), and Switzerland’s highest massif, Monte Rosa (15,203). But he rarely ventured into the Himalayas, straddling the borders of China and India, where a dozen of the world’s greatest summits defied human intrusion for centuries, rising more than five miles above sea level into an otherworldly realm of yawning abysses, 100-mile-an-hour winds, perpetual cold, and air so thin that the human brain and lungs cannot function properly in it.

While other experienced mountaineers repeated ascents of Himalayan and Andean peaks for speed records, Mr. Beckey roamed North America in search of unconquered summits and routes considered too difficult to climb. He often climbed 40 or 50 different peaks a year.

He was not the first to climb Alaska’s Denali (20,310), North America’s highest peak (formerly known as Mount McKinley). A team did that in 1913. But in 1954 he and several friends achieved mountaineering’s Triple Crown by reaching the caps of the Alaska Range giants: Mounts Hunter (14,573) and Deborah (12,339) — both in virgin ascents — and Denali’s rarely climbed North Peak (19,470).

In a notoriously dangerous sport, Mr. Beckey sustained a crushed rib cage and another climber, Charles Shiverick, was killed when an avalanche carried them a quarter of a mile down Mount Serra in British Columbia in 1947. An ice pinnacle snared Mr. Beckey’s rope, saving him, but his companion struck a rock and died of internal injuries.

In an international expedition in 1955 to conquer the world’s fourth-highest peak, Lhotse (27,940) in the Himalayas, Mr. Beckey was denounced by colleagues for abandoning his tentmate with a cerebral edema at 23,000 feet in a howling blizzard the night before they were to attempt the summit. He descended alone, he said, to get help.

The stricken man, snow-blind and nearly frozen without a sleeping bag, was rescued by others, but it was a misadventure that Mr. Beckey never lived down. While he was a compelling choice for the first American team assault on Everest in 1963, he was not invited — a snub that ended his Himalayan forays and confirmed his preference for climbing alone or with a few companions.

Mr. Beckey was caught in shrieking gales, trapped on rock ledges and buried in avalanches. But he was rarely hurt seriously, a testament perhaps to fine judgments: How to cross a snowfield that might conceal a crevasse? Where to hammer a piton into rock or ice to secure a rope on which life might hang? Where to cling or step when hugging a sheer vertical rock face over an abyss?

“This man survived nearly 1,000 first ascents, where a climber doesn’t know where to go and often has to deal with loose rock,” Peter Green, director of the outdoor program at Portland’s Catlin Gabel School, told The Oregonian in 2012. “It’s amazing he’s still alive. His decision-making and judgment must be so good.”

Wolfgang Beckey was born on Jan. 14, 1923, near Düsseldorf, Germany, to Klaus and Marta Maria Beckey. His father was a surgeon and his mother an opera singer.

The family, including a brother, Helmut, emigrated to Seattle in 1925. The boy called himself Fred and learned climbing techniques as a Boy Scout and in a Mountaineers course.

He is survived by his brother, who Ms. Bond said lives in Germany.

At 13, Fred and two friends reached the top of Mount Despair, a rugged 7,292-foot peak in the North Cascades that mountaineers had considered unclimbable. He soon began making local history climbing summits in the Olympic and North Cascade ranges.

Photo

He loved skiing, and in 1942 he joined the wartime Army’s 10th Mountain Division, based in Colorado. After the war, he attended the University of Washington, but spent most of his time with his brother and friends scaling peaks in Washington, Wyoming, California and Oregon, the Bitterroots in Montana, the Bugaboos in British Columbia and desert rock formations in the Southwest.

After graduating in 1949 with a degree in business administration, he sold ads for The Seattle Post-Intelligencer and was a print shop sales representative. He also finished his first book, “Climber’s Guide to the Cascade and Olympic Mountains of Washington” (1949).

Later books included “Challenge of the North Cascades” (1969); “Cascade Alpine Guide,” a three-volume set with many editions (1973 to 2008); “Mountains of North America” (1982); “Mount McKinley: Icy Crown of North America” (1993); “Range of Glaciers: The Exploration and Survey of the Northern Cascade Range” (2003); and “Fred Beckey’s 100 Favorite North American Climbs” (2011).

His home was plastered with photos of his conquests, including two named for him: Beckey’s Spire, also known as Christianity Spire, in Sedona, Ariz., which he climbed in 1970, and Mount Beckey, an 8,500-foot Alaskan peak in the Cathedral Mountains, which he climbed in 1996.

Friends called him a cantankerous cuss who hated talk about himself. He sped long distances in his old pink Thunderbird, screaming all night to stay awake at the wheel, and howled at tourists who gawked at his camps. On a mountain, he amazed fellow climbers with his uphill speed and stamina, even in his 80s.

“I guess you have your choice of trying to make money or getting involved with adventure,” Mr. Beckey told Lincoln Stoller for the Learning Project in 2007. “Most people get married, and by the time they’re 30 they’ve got a couple of kids, and then they’re strapped down.

The release of the twin reports on the collisions came a day after the Navy held closed-door briefings for lawmakers on Capitol Hill on its findings and recommendations, and sent officers crisscrossing the country to brief family members of the sailors killed. A broader review of the Seventh Fleet’s pace of operations, training, equipment and maintenance is to be released on Thursday.

Senator Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi, attributed the two fatal collisions to dwindling Navy resources in the Pacific, combined with judgment and training errors — a sentiment echoed by lawmakers as they left Tuesday’s private hearing.

“In general, we’re asking too few ships to do too many things,” Mr. Wicker said.

Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Tuesday also pointed to the automatic budget cuts on the Pentagon since 2013, known as sequestration, as one of the primary culprits behind the combined 17 deaths aboard the two destroyers.

“We’ve deprived them of the funds to do it,” Mr. McCain said of the continuous operations in the Pacific. “We’re putting those men and women in harm’s way to be wounded or killed because we refuse to give them the sufficient training and equipment and readiness. It’s a failure of Congress. It’s on us.”

Already the fallout from the two fatal crashes as well as two others in the western Pacific this year, has been dramatic.

The commander of the Navy’s Pacific Fleet, Adm. Scott H. Swift, took early retirement after being notified that he was no longer in the running to take charge of the Pentagon’s overall Pacific Command, which would oversee any military operations against North Korea.

Vice Adm. Joseph P. Aucoin, the former head of the Seventh Fleet, based in Japan and the Navy’s largest overseas, was removed in connection with the accidents. The Navy’s top officer for ships worldwide, Vice Adm. Thomas S. Rowden, has also said he will retire early.

Several other senior officers in the Seventh Fleet chain of command, as well as the commanding officers of the Fitzgerald and John S. McCain, have also been relieved of their duties.

Even before the more comprehensive review was conducted by Adm. Phil Davidson, the head of the Fleet Forces Command in Norfolk, Va., urgent new orders went out in early September for United States Navy warships.

These directives included more sleep and no more 100-hour workweeks for sailors. Ships steaming in crowded waters like those near Singapore and Tokyo were ordered to broadcast their positions as do other vessels. And ships whose crews lack basic seamanship certification will probably stay in port until the problems are fixed.

These were all seemingly obvious standards, military officials said, except that the Navy rushed the remedies into effect only after the two deadly collisions in two months, despite repeated warnings about the looming problems from congressional watchdogs and the Navy’s own experts dating to 2010.","Navy Collisions That Killed 17 Sailors Were ‘Avoidable,’ Official Inquiry Reports",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/us/politics/navy-collisions-avoidable.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

This needs to change. Start with insurance: Hearing aids can be expensive, but employers need to know that people who can’t hear can’t do their jobs well. Education matters, too: People who thought it was dumb for Donald Trump to look directly at the sun during the solar eclipse might think nothing of slapping on a pair of headphones and cranking their music to 11.

The first thing you can do is to get your hearing tested; this is helpful even if you don’t think you have hearing loss, so that you have a baseline reference. There are several free tests online, sponsored by Phonak, Miracle-Ear, Beltone and others. They aren’t as good as the ones a doctor can give you, but it’s a start.

About 90 percent of hearing loss is “sensorineural,” usually caused by damage to hair cells in the inner ear. Sometimes it’s the result of exposure to loud sounds (like concerts at the Spectrum). That’s the kind of hearing loss I have; my inability to hear high-pitched sounds means that understanding a conversation in a crowded restaurant can be a challenge.

New technology enables wearers to focus their hearing on the person in front of them while canceling out all sound behind. You can control just how much of the world you want to amplify or cancel out by using a free app on your mobile device. And it looks good — I recently wore such a device at a party where, for the first time in years, I heard everything that everyone was saying. It completely changed the way I experienced the world.

When I first learned that I had serious hearing loss (after a lifetime of playing in super-loud bands), I called my wife on the phone, and as I told her of my diagnosis I started to cry. “I’m so sorry you have to be married to someone like me,” I sobbed.

My wife, a tolerant woman by any measure, laughed. “You really think I’d leave you because you have hearing aids?” she said.

Well, yeah, I sort of did. Because I thought it would make me seem old and undesirable. Because somehow I’d forgotten that the world has long been full of people just like me.

I always loved that song that Elton opened with at the Spectrum. I have a friend who loves it, too, although once, when we heard it come on the radio, she asked me: “Hey wait. Why is he singing, ‘Hold me closer, Tony Danza?’ ”

“It’s ‘Tiny Dancer,’ ” I explained. “Not Tony Danza. Tiny Dancer.”

“Duh, Jenny, like — I know, ” she said. “Did you really think I was deaf?”

The Grateful Dead had only one Top 10 song, “Touch of Grey,” and yet here is “Red Roses, Green Gold,” Off Broadway at the Minetta Lane Theater. Not only that, but this is the third show the writer Michael Norman Mann has created using the Dead’s catalog, after “Cumberland Blues” in 1998 and “Shakedown Street” in 2005.

The good news is that the songs, which lean heavily on a classic Americana sound, are effective in a sit-down, smoke-free theatrical context. The show, which is billed as “featuring the music of Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter” (Mr. Hunter was the Dead’s nonperforming lyricist), sometimes feels like a wacky relative of the Steve Martin and Edie Brickell Broadway bluegrass musical “Bright Star.”

The House bill will include a worldwide minimum tax on multinational corporations’ profits, two people with knowledge of the drafting said, in an effort to prevent companies from shifting money abroad as the United States transitions to a so-called territorial tax system, which would subject only income earned domestically to the American corporate tax rate. The tax would be on all global income, and not on a country-by-country basis, as some companies had feared.

Republican leaders also confirmed they would maintain a federal tax deduction for at least some state and local property taxes paid, while eliminating comparable deductions for income and sales taxes.

Other issues remained in flux or unknown outside of a select group of lawmakers and congressional staff. Those include the size of an expanded child tax credit; whether to phase in or sunset some rate cuts; and the specifics of how the plan might affect tax-free retirement savings.

Mr. Trump invited nearly two dozen leaders of major business groups — including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Petroleum Institute and the American Farm Bureau Federation — to the White House on Tuesday morning to discuss the bill. In the afternoon, Mr. Ryan met with Mr. Trump and then with more than a dozen conservative groups on the tax bill, including the Heritage Foundation and Americans for Prosperity.

Each of those groups — and in many cases, individual companies — will be watching for how lawmakers change tax breaks large and small in their overhaul of the tax code. Business leaders, in particular, are ready to applaud or attack the bill depending on how those changes affect their bottom lines.

“We’re trying to see, and evaluate with a calculator at the end of the day, are the incentives going to be right to help the economy to grow?” said David Stevens, the president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, whose industry has much at stake in the rewrite of the tax code.

A Halloween-themed news release from Mr. Ryan’s office on Tuesday suggested that Republicans are prepared for many business groups to oppose the bill when it is released. “The special interest ghouls will do anything to protect all their little tricks and treats,” the release said. “They will haunt the hallways and demonize our plan. They will conjure up new scare tactics and spread wicked tales.”

Party leaders are already struggling to kill off some tax breaks they had targeted for elimination. Republicans had proposed wiping out the entire deduction for state and local taxes, which is particularly valuable to high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California. After running into resistance from lawmakers, Mr. Brady said over the weekend that the coming tax plan would include “an itemized property tax deduction to help taxpayers with local tax burdens.”

In an interview on Tuesday with the radio host Hugh Hewitt, Mr. Brady said the tax bill would not include a deduction for state or local income taxes.

“Our lawmakers in those high-tax states really believe their families are being punished the most by property taxes,” Mr. Brady said, adding that those taxes “are not based on your ability to pay — they’re just painful.”

Mr. Brady also signaled the deduction for property taxes could be limited. Asked if there would be no cap on that deduction, Mr. Brady responded, “To be determined.”

Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, said on Tuesday it was clear that the original plan to fully eliminate the deduction for state and local taxes was “not going to occur.”

“I think that shows a demonstration by our leadership and by the powers to be that we recognize that this issue needs to be resolved,” Mr. Reed told reporters. He said that retaining a deduction for property taxes was “gaining traction as we get to the finish line here.”

It did not appear on Tuesday that the compromise was sufficient to win over all the blue-state House Republicans who had raised concerns.

Democrats criticized the compromise. “Go figure that high property-tax states like Texas, Chairman Brady’s state, would be better off under the proposal,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader. “Picking winners and losers like this doesn’t solve the problem. The new state and local compromise is still a nearly trillion-dollar tax hike on the middle class to pay for tax giveaways to big corporations and the very wealthy.”

Mr. Trump pushed back on Democratic criticism in his meeting with business leaders.

Herbert Diess, the head of the division that makes Volkswagen brand cars, has said that he sees Tesla as a more important competitor than traditional rivals like Toyota.

The German company aims to deploy its enormous manufacturing network to churn out battery-powered cars faster, and in greater volume, than Tesla, which has had trouble meeting demand. But those plans may be difficult to reconcile with cuts in the research and development budget.

The diesel scandal remains a dead weight on the company’s finances and reputation. Volkswagen said Friday that legal settlements and other costs related to the emissions cheating have drained €14.5 billion this year from company coffers. That is money that Volkswagen would certainly prefer to spend developing new products.

Volkswagen might be able to find savings in other areas, for example, by diverting money that could have been used to develop new diesel engines, said Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive Management at the Fachhochschule der Wirtschaft, a technical university in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.

Still, Mr. Bratzel said, “it really hurts that this money is gone and is not available for the future.”

The damage from the scandal, Volkswagen said in a statement, was “nowhere near an end and would continue to necessitate great efforts throughout the entire group.”

Andreas Hoffbauer, a Volkswagen spokesman, said the company was responding to investors who have long complained that the research and development budget was spent inefficiently and was too large compared with rivals’ budgets.

The good news for the carmaker was that sales in the third quarter rose 6 percent, to €55 billion, thanks in part to a new SUV model introduced in the United States and economic recovery in Latin America.

But there were also signs of trouble. In Germany, where Volkswagen has long dominated the market for affordable cars, sales fell 2 percent even as most competitors recorded sales gains. The company acknowledged that it has suffered from a buyer backlash against diesel, long one of its strongest selling points.

In a reflection of growing anger in Germany toward Volkswagen, despite its position as a pillar of the economy, the number of lawsuits by aggrieved diesel owners has almost tripled to 4,600, the company said. Unlike the United States, Germany does not allow class-action suits by owners, who take a considerable financial risk by suing Volkswagen as individuals.

Volkswagen sales in Western Europe, its core market, rose 1 percent. But the overall market in the region rose faster and the company’s share has slipped so far this year.

The company acknowledged in the earnings report that one reason for the mediocre performance in Europe was “the fact that customer confidence has not yet been fully restored following the diesel issue and to customer uncertainty generated by the public discussion on driving bans for diesel vehicles.”

London’s city government this week began imposing a daily charge of 10 pounds, or $13.20, on older diesel cars to drive in the city center, on top of the existing congestion charge of £11.50 per day. Other cities like Stuttgart and Munich are also considering restrictions on diesels, which are blamed for high levels of harmful nitrogen oxides.

In a positive development, Volkswagen made more money from its namesake brand than it did last year. Operating profit from cars with the VW logo doubled to €2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2017 compared with the same period a year earlier.

But the company remains dependent on its luxury brands Audi and Porsche, which generated more than twice as much profit, even though they sell fewer cars.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — I like to think of myself as a “word person” — someone who knows and loves words — but every once in a while, that perception gets jolted. As in most areas of life, we soon learn that no matter how smart we think we are, there are always those who are smarter.

Today, we get to experience that feeling nine times in one puzzle. Ten, actually, if we count the meta that Alan Arbesfeld has neatly tucked inside his grid. Mr. Arbesfeld debuts a puzzle called “Walls and Doors,” and the idea behind it is that we are given nine 5x5 “rooms” that need to be filled in. Each answer is five letters long and the clues are not hard to solve. The roadblock occurs because the clues are not given in any particular order, so it is up to us to figure out where each word goes.

For me, that was the hardest part of the puzzle. One letter in each grid is filled in (spelling out the phrase “floor plan”), but that was only of nominal help to me. After much erasing — you want to do this one in pencil — I was able to get the central grid No. 5. That was encouraging, but then I needed to start all over again and solve another grid. I knocked out No. 8. And so on, until I had experienced seven of the nine “Aha!” moments.

Ms. King was taking several dance classes a week and practicing yoga, and she thought the stress of these activities might be causing the pain in her tight, inflexible back. But after a number of Feldenkrais sessions, she told Ms. Ramin, “I realized that the pain had more to do with the way I carried myself every day.”

Even after just one session, I understood what she meant. When I make a point of walking upright and fluid, sitting straight, even cooking relaxed and unhurried, I have no pain. The slow, gentle, repetitive movements I practiced in a Feldenkrais group class helped foster an awareness of how I use my body in relation to my environment, and awareness is the first step to changing one’s behavior.

One common problem of which I’m often guilty is using small muscles to accomplish tasks meant for large, heavy-duty ones, resulting in undue fatigue and pain.

The group class, called Awareness Through Movement, was followed by an individual session called Functional Integration with a therapist that helped to free tight muscles and joints that were limiting my motion and increasing my discomfort. Using gentle manipulation and passive movements, the therapist individualized his approach to my particular needs.

The ultimate goal of both sessions is, in effect, to retrain the brain – to establish new neural pathways that result in easy, simple movements that are physiologically effective and comfortable. Although the Feldenkrais method was developed in the mid-20th century, neurophysiologists have since demonstrated the plasticity of the brain, its ability to form new cells, reorganize itself and, in effect, learn new ways to do things.

The beauty of Feldenkrais lessons is that they are both relatively low-cost (group classes average $15 to $25, individual sessions $100 to $200) and potentially accessible to nearly everyone. There are more than 7,000 teachers and practitioners working in 18 countries, including large numbers in the United States. You can be any age, strength, fitness level and state of well-being to participate. The exercises are slow, gentle and adjustable to whatever might ail you. Their calming effect counters the stress that results in contracted muscles, tightness and pain.

Many Feldenkrais practitioners, like Marek Wyszynski, director of the New York center, start professional life as physical therapists, although many other practitioners begin with no medical background. They then undergo three and a half years of training to become certified in the Feldenkrais method.

Mr. Wyszynski explained that he starts by observing how patients are using their skeletons – how they sit, stand and walk in ways that may cause or contribute to their pathology, be it spinal disc disease, arthritis, shoulder pain or damaged knee joints. In accordance with Dr. Feldenkrais’s astute observation, “If you don’t know what you are doing, you can’t do what you want,” patients are then given a clear sensory experience of how their posture and behavior contribute to their pain and physical limitations.

For example, some people may use excessive force, clench their teeth, hold their breath or rush, causing undue muscle tension and skeletal stress. Years ago, I realized that my frequent headaches resulted from an unconscious habit of clenching my jaw when I concentrated intently on a task like sewing or cooking. Feldenkrais teachers do not give formulas for a proper way of behaving; rather, they rely on their patients’ ability to self-discover and self-correct.

Once aware of their counterproductive habits, students are given the opportunity to experience alternative movements, postures and behaviors and, through practice, create new habits that are less likely to cause pain.

Mr. Wyszynski told me that there are more than 1,000 distinct Feldenkrais lessons currently available, most of which involve everyday actions like reaching, getting up from a chair, turning, bending and walking.

As a mechanical engineer and physicist, Dr. Feldenkrais understood that the job of the human skeleton was to accommodate the effects of gravity in order to remain upright. And he wanted people to achieve this in the most efficient way possible.

Using two tall foam cylinders, one perched on top of the other, Mr. Wyszynski demonstrated a guiding principle of the Feldenkrais method. When the top cylinder was centered on the bottom one, it stood in place without assistance. But when it was off center, perched near the edge of the bottom cylinder, it tipped over. If instead of cylinders these were someone’s skeletal parts that were askew, tightened muscles would have to keep the patient from falling over.

As Mr. Wyszynski explained, “Good posture allows the skeleton to hold up and support the body without expending unnecessary energy despite the pull of gravity. However, with poor posture, the muscles are doing part of the job of the bones, and with poor skeletal support, the muscles have to remain contracted to prevent the body from falling.”",Trying the Feldenkrais Method for Chronic Pain,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/well/trying-the-feldenkrais-method-for-chronic-pain.html

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Solvers are naturally curious when entries appear frequently or on the same day in different puzzles. Do constructors and editors really get together in secret, Oreo-fueled meetings to compare notes? Are repetitions committed deliberately, to send messages to puzzle solvers?

The answer is no, there aren’t enough Oreos in the world to make them do that. Any commonalities between puzzles, be they entries like OWIE or even an entire theme, are purely coincidental.

I bring this up because Damon Gulczynski, the constructor of today’s puzzle, explains in his notes below that a theme very similar to his own ran in The Wall Street Journal recently, and the truth is, these things happen all the time. It’s not because of laziness on the part of the constructor. More than one person can have the same great idea, and because editors work at different companies and don’t consult each other, sometimes identical entries or themes run close together.

Today’s puzzle by Mr. Gulczynski is a fresh, three dimensional take on an interesting topic.

Dear Sugars,

I’m stuck and I have no idea what to do. I’m 21 and I work as a waitress. I have no education past a high school diploma. I feel so trapped in my small town. I want my life to change. It’s like I can see it already playing out. I work seven days a week and still earn just enough to pay the bills. I want to go to school but have always had trouble in that area. I never had a chance to see the world. I can’t stand this routine.

I spend about twenty percent of my day picturing my life across the country. I know I’m going to get there one day, but it’s almost unbearable waiting because the money seems like it’s never going to be there. My question is how do I make the steps to get there? I’m so incredibly uninspired. I want to wake up and feel energy and love. I want to feel that I know I’m where I’m supposed to be. But I’m scared that I’ll be stuck waitressing forever.

Broke

Cheryl Strayed: You’ll only be stuck waitressing forever if you decide to be, Broke. Your life is up to you. You’re not trapped in anything but your own despair. You hold the key. Stop telling yourself you don’t have the power to open the door. Everything about the language you use in describing your circumstances tells me you’re not aware of that. You write: “I want my life to change” rather than “I’m going to change my life.” The former is a passive expression of a desire; the later is an active decision. You can’t do the things you hope to do until you believe you have the capacity to do them. So that’s where to begin: by having a word with the inner voices of doom in your head and telling them to hush up. I understand why you might have those voices in your head (as someone who grew up poor in a small town and worked as a waitress, I really do), but the story you’ve told yourself about being “stuck forever” isn’t true and it doesn’t serve you. It’s time to tell yourself a different story instead.

I’m going to be forming a team,” Mr. Trump said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on March 8, 2016.
At a March 31 meeting in a foreman’s lounge at the Trump Hotel in Washington, which was under construction, with Mr. Trump and the rest of the foreign policy team, Mr. Papadopoulos pitched the idea of a personal meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin.
But Mr. Trump listened with interest and asked questions of Mr. Papadopoulos.
In August 2016, Mr. Clovis wrote Mr. Papadopoulos encouraging him and another adviser to make the trip, “if it is feasible.” It never took place.","They have described Carter Page, an energy executive who F.B.I. agents suspected had once been marked for recruitment by Russian spies, as a gadfly who had been “put on notice” by the campaign and whom Mr. Trump “does not know.” Mr. Page’s trip to Moscow in July 2016 was one of the triggers leading the F.B.I. to open a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, and he has appeared before a grand jury in the investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel.

It is harder for the White House to distance itself from Michael T. Flynn, a retired military intelligence officer who was forced out in February after less than a month as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser. The White House has said Mr. Flynn resigned after it became clear he had not been forthright about conversations he had in late December with Sergey I. Kislyak, who was then the Russian ambassador.

The fact that so many of Mr. Trump’s foreign policy aides from that period have now acknowledged contacts with Russian officials or their intermediaries hints at Moscow’s eagerness to establish links to his campaign.

Mr. Flynn’s pro-Russian tilt was well established before he joined the Trump campaign. He had pushed for greater cooperation with Russia on counterterrorism issues while director of the Defense Intelligence Agency from 2012 to 2014. He became even more vocal after he was forced to retire by President Barack Obama, arguing that Russia was a necessary ally in a “world war” against Islamist militancy. Mr. Flynn even traveled to Russia in December 2015 for a paid speaking engagement with RT, the Kremlin-financed news network that American intelligence says is a propaganda operation. The trip also included an invitation to RT’s anniversary dinner, where he was photographed sitting at the elbow of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

It has since become clear that the White House knew before the inauguration that Mr. Flynn was already under federal investigation for secretly working as a paid agent of Turkey during the campaign. That investigation has widened to examine possible money laundering and failure to disclose payments from Russian companies, including RT.

Although as a candidate Mr. Trump touted the “many great national security people” at his side, he was reduced in large part to unknowns or carry-overs from other failed campaigns, even as late as March 2016, when he was the clear front-runner. More than 50 conservative foreign policy experts signed an open letter condemning his national security views.

And his own statements were confusing: “Yes, there is a team. There’s not a team. I’m going to be forming a team,” Mr. Trump said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on March 8, 2016.

Finally, in late March, Mr. Trump presented his team, led by Jeff Sessions, the Alabama senator and future attorney general. Among the other five he named were Mr. Page and Mr. Papadopoulos, whom he described as “an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy.”

Mr. Papadopoulos, then 28, had some minor campaign experience. After he promised to raise substantial sums from the Greek-American community, Ben Carson’s campaign hired him for $5,000 a month to serve on its national security and foreign policy advisory committee.

After Mr. Carson’s campaign collapsed, Mr. Papadopoulos moved into Mr. Trump’s orbit. According to interviews and the court papers released Monday, he discussed the campaign’s priorities with Sam Clovis, then a top policy adviser and campaign supervisor, and “understood that a principal foreign policy focus of the campaign was an improved U.S. relationship with Russia.”

In a statement from his lawyer, Victoria Toensing, Mr. Clovis denied that. “That was not Dr. Clovis’s view,” it said.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters during a news briefing on Tuesday that the Trump campaign had voluntarily given Mr. Papadopoulos’s emails to investigators.

“That is what led to the process and the place that we’re in,” Ms. Sanders said, adding that the campaign had been “fully cooperating and helping with that.”

In late March last year, Mr. Papadopoulos emailed Mr. Clovis and others that he had discussed with his contacts — a London-based professor with Moscow ties and a Russian woman whom he described as a relative of Mr. Putin’s — the possibility of a meeting between the Trump campaign and Russia’s leadership.

“Great work,” Mr. Clovis responded, according to the court documents and interviews.

At a March 31 meeting in a foreman’s lounge at the Trump Hotel in Washington, which was under construction, with Mr. Trump and the rest of the foreign policy team, Mr. Papadopoulos pitched the idea of a personal meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. Mr. Clovis and others immediately expressed doubts about the wisdom of the idea, noting that Russia was under United States sanctions and denouncing the “optics” of a meeting with Mr. Putin, according to a former campaign aide who attended the meeting.

But Mr. Trump listened with interest and asked questions of Mr. Papadopoulos. Mr. Trump “didn’t say yes, and he didn’t say no,” said the former aide, who agreed to describe the meeting on the condition of anonymity.

Finally, Mr. Sessions, as the campaign’s top national security official, spoke vehemently against the idea, asking others not to discuss it again. Mr. Trump did not challenge him, the former aide said.

Nonetheless, Mr. Papadopoulos continued to pursue the notion of some sort of meeting for several months, updating Trump campaign officials on his efforts, the court records showed.

He emailed one high-ranking campaign official saying that the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had asked if the campaign would send a representative to Russia, and he offered to go. In August 2016, Mr. Clovis wrote Mr. Papadopoulos encouraging him and another adviser to make the trip, “if it is feasible.” It never took place.

Ms. Toensing, Mr. Clovis’s lawyer, said that Mr. Clovis agreed that Mr. Papadopoulos should travel as a private individual, not as a campaign aide.

“He was hitting on everyone,” she said. “And they all ignore him and the trips didn’t occur.”

Former campaign officials say Mr. Papadopoulos peppered them with unwanted emails. After he criticized the British leadership on television, he wrote asking if he would be fired.

This generally means folded arms, and a sort-of smile. Occasionally, teeth are involved, but even then, the glee is measured.

The first official portrait of Barack Obama, for example, in 2009, featured the then-president looking seriously at the camera, the sides of his mouth just beginning to quirk upward — more of a suggestion of a smile than an actual one. In 2013, for his second term, his portrait showed him looking pretty cheerful, but posing in front of his desk with arms crossed.

His predecessor, George W. Bush, had his photo taken in the Roosevelt Room, and while his eyes were crinkled genially, his smile was contained.

The American artist Frank Stella, 81, best known for his Minimalist and abstract styles, will tell you that, without travel, he wouldn’t have been able to sustain his career as long as he has. “Seeing great art in different destinations gives me the motivation to keep going and holds me to a high standard professionally,” he said.

Mr. Stella lives in New York City and spends between 30 and 40 percent of his time on the road for work, traveling to his exhibitions and giving talks on his art.

Below are edited excerpts from a recent conversation with him.

Negative emotion, click bait and viral outrage are how the platform is “being used to divide.” Given this problem, Facebook needs to help us unite by building new sharing tools based on trust and respect.

Facebook should reduce anonymity by requiring real verification of real names for real people, with the aim of having 100 percent of individuals verified.

Companies would need additional levels of verification, and should have a label and scrutiny different from those of people. (Whistle-blowers and dissidents might need to use a different platform.)

Ultimately, whether from tech companies or Congress, what people want is more transparency.

Facebook should expand on its Hard Questions blog to explain how its news feed algorithms work, how it uses data in targeting and how it makes decisions about third-party verification and removing offensive content. It should make it simple for users to provide feedback and be responsive to their concerns.

The company also should make its executives readily available to the press, and they should spend time on Capitol Hill to explain their decision-making.

Everyone understands that new technology platforms are not perfect, and that bad actors find ways to abuse them. The key is for Facebook to be upfront about technical challenges, open about its mistakes and willing to answer the tough questions honestly. If it does that, it will continue to earn the public’s trust.

Facebook should open itself up for independent research. Right now, Facebook is a black box: It’s very difficult, and in many cases impossible, for researchers to independently look at behavior on the platform. While opening private data to research creates risks, there’s a ton of explicitly public data on the platform that Facebook makes difficult to query at scale. Facebook could also open up many of the tools advertisers currently use for free use by research scientists. It would be a bold move for transparency, and one that would help us understand much better what’s happening on the world’s most important social platform. And it’d be wise to do this before regulators forced them to.

The company should also optimize for “time well spent.” Facebook’s greatest superpower is figuring out how to eat as much of our attention as possible. But as Tristan Harris and others have pointed out, that attention often doesn’t yield much — leaving us poorly informed and feeling worse about ourselves. Instead of measuring clicks and likes, what if Facebook optimized for how much value an article or video or game gave us weeks or months afterward? The company could survey the kinds of content we’ve spent the most time on, and ask us which gave us the most and least value, as a way to balance our impulsive present selves with our greater aspirations.

It would be interesting if Facebook offered a “vintage Facebook” setting that users could toggle to, without News Feed ads and “like” buttons. (Before “likes,” users wrote comments, which made interactions more unique and memorable.)

A “vintage Facebook” setting not only would be less cluttered, it would refocus the experience of using Facebook on the people using it, and their intentions for communication and interaction.

Somehow, no matter how “smart” the Facebook algorithms and behind-the-scenes data processing get, the site felt more engaging as a tool for human communication when interaction was primarily driven by what users wanted to do and say, rather than where the algorithms want people to look.

Facebook should allow users to sort their news feed chronologically by default on all platforms, rather than rely on an algorithmically sorted News Feed. This would increase the diversity of items in the News Feed, and would make it more likely that users were exposed to people and information that didn’t support their own confirmation bias.

It should also greatly increase the human oversight of ad targeting systems — specifically, oversee algorithmically generated categories (rather than basing them solely on user-inputted interests). Political and interest-based advertising should be under much stricter scrutiny than, say, the advertising of T-shirts or hair products.

Facebook needs to replace its focus on engagement quantity with interaction quality. To really do that means replacing at least half of the leadership team and board with underrepresented people of color who are informed and value diversity and inclusion — and, as my colleague Freada Kapor Klein suggested, have journalistic principles. At Reddit, I was able to effect positive, lasting change (at least according to this research) to content quality and interaction quality by building a diverse executive team.

The single most important thing Facebook must do is come clean. Tell us what you know. Tell us what you know but can’t share. Tell us what you don’t know. And tell us what you don’t know that you don’t know. Stop hiding behind bromides like “we are not a media company.” That makes us think you don’t understand you have a serious set of problems that need fixing. Coming clean may not be the only thing, and may not be the main thing, but it’s the first thing.

Facebook should become a public benefit corporation.

Mark Zuckerberg has said that Facebook’s goals are “bringing us closer together” and “building a global community.” Worthy, beautiful goals, but easier said than done when Facebook is also stuck delivering ever-increasing profits and making its platform serve the needs of advertisers.

These efforts at obfuscation and misdirection would be laughable, but they are linked to a very real and dangerous move by Trump allies throughout right-wing media and the government to shut down the Russia investigation for good.

It’s no secret that Mr. Trump has been itching to get rid of Mr. Mueller since soon after his appointment as special counsel in May. Mr. Trump’s advisers have told him that would be a terrible idea and have reportedly talked him out of it more than once. But the calls for such a move are now coming from some of the most influential voices in conservative media, as are other equally bad proposals, like urging that Mr. Mueller resign and that Mr. Trump pardon anyone and everyone caught up in the Russia investigation — including himself.

Mr. Trump would be wise to continue to ignore these loony ideas and restrain his own authoritarian reflexes. The president of the United States, no less than any citizen, lives under the law, not above it; Mr. Mueller’s investigation is the embodiment of that fact. Removing him now, after he has already secured two indictments, including one for Mr. Trump’s former campaign chief, and a guilty plea by a foreign-policy adviser, would send the message that Mr. Trump and his aides are accountable to no one.

Over the last several weeks, a few top Republicans have found the courage to say out loud what a majority of Americans have known for a long time: With his erratic behavior and antidemocratic eruptions, Donald Trump is presenting a profound danger to security of the nation and the stability of the world order.

A driver plowed a pickup truck down a crowded bike path along the Hudson River in Manhattan on Tuesday, killing eight people and injuring 11 before being shot by a police officer in what officials are calling the deadliest terrorist attack on New York City since Sept. 11, 2001.

The rampage ended when the motorist — whom the police identified as Sayfullo Saipov, 29 — smashed into a school bus, jumped out of his truck and ran up and down the highway waving a pellet gun and paintball gun and shouting “Allahu akbar,” Arabic for “God is great,” before he was shot in the abdomen by the officer. He remained in critical condition on Tuesday evening.

Mayor Bill de Blasio declared the rampage a terrorist attack and federal law enforcement authorities were leading the investigation. Investigators discovered handwritten notes in Arabic near the truck that indicated allegiance to the Islamic State, two law enforcement officials said. But investigators had not uncovered evidence of any direct or enabling ties between Mr. Saipov and ISIS and were treating the episode as a case of an “inspired” attacker, two counterterrorism officials said.

Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference, “Based on information we have at this moment, this was an act of terror, and a particularly cowardly act of terror aimed at innocent civilians.”

Mr. Saipov came to the United States from Uzbekistan in 2010, and had a green card that allowed permanent legal residence. He had apparently lived in Paterson, N.J., and Tampa, Fla. An official said Mr. Saipov rented a truck from a Home Depot in Passaic, N.J., where a white Toyota minivan believed to be his was found parked.

The truck came crashing to a stop near the corner of Chambers and West Streets by Stuyvesant High School. Sirus Minovi, 14, a freshman there who was hanging out with friends, said people scattered.

“We heard people screaming, ‘gun’ ‘shooter’ and ‘run away,’” Sirus said. “We thought it was a Halloween prank.”

He realized it was not a joke when he saw the man staggering through the intersection, waving guns and screaming words he could not make out. A passer-by approached the attacker, apparently trying to calm him, Sirus said, until the man realized the attacker had a gun. The man “put his hands up and was backing away,” Sirus said.

Almost immediately, as investigators began to look into Mr. Saipov’s history, it became clear that he had been on the radar of federal authorities. Three officials said he had come to the federal authorities’ attention as a result of an unrelated investigation, but it was not clear whether that was because he was a friend, an associate or a family member of someone under scrutiny or because he himself had been the focus of an investigation.

Over the last two years, a terrorism investigation by the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security, the New York Police Department and federal prosecutors in Brooklyn resulted in charges against five men from Uzbekistan and one from Kazakhstan of providing material support to ISIS. Several of the men have pleaded guilty. It is unclear whether Mr. Saipov was connected with that investigation.

Martin Feely, a spokesman for the New York F.B.I. office, declined to comment on whether Mr. Saipov was known to the bureau.

F.B.I. agents were expected to search Mr. Saipov’s home in Paterson, N.J., and his car on Tuesday night, a law enforcement official said. A phone, which was recovered at the scene of the attack, also would be searched, another official said.

The attack unfolded as nearby schools were letting out on a Halloween afternoon. It ended five blocks north of the World Trade Center. The driver left a roughly mile-long crime scene: a tree-lined bike path strewn with bodies, mangled bicycles and bicycle parts, from wheels twisted like pretzels to a dislodged seat.

Mr. Saipov, a slim, bearded man, was seen in videos running through traffic after the attack with a paintball gun in one hand and a pellet gun in the other. Six people died at the scene and two others died at a hospital, officials said. The authorities credited the officer who shot him with saving lives.

“He was Johnny-on-the-spot and he takes the guy down,” a city official said.

Coming five months after a car rammed into pedestrians in Times Square, killing one, Tuesday’s attack again highlighted the danger of a vehicle attack on busy city streets. The Times Square attack was not an act of terrorism. But both events brought to mind the terrorist attack last year in Nice, France, in which a cargo truck killed scores of people celebrating Bastille Day.

The episodes also evoked calls from terrorist magazines, including in an edition of Rumiyah, a magazine used by ISIS, for attackers to mow down pedestrians with trucks, continue the attacks with a knife or a gun and claim responsibility by shouting or leaving leaflets.

Students in Halloween costumes streamed out of nearby schools after lockdowns were lifted and huddled with parents. Their faces, once painted for the holiday, were streaked with tears.

Emily, 12, a seventh-grader at I.S. 289 whose father asked that her last name not be used, had been walking on her usual route home when other students turned and ran in the other direction.

“All the kids were screaming, ‘Run!’, ‘Gun!’ ‘Run inside,’” she said, still wearing cat ears. She said mothers pushing strollers and children in costumes ran in a herd back toward the school.

President Trump responded to the attack on Twitter: “In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!”

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo cautioned at a news conference, “There’s no evidence that suggests a wider plot or a wider scheme.” In the aftermath, city and state law enforcement agencies increased security at high-profile locations.

Terrorism analysts noted that on Monday a French pro-ISIS media unit, known as the Centre Mediatique An-Nur, put out a specific threat for Halloween, mentioning the date on a banner spread on the encrypted app Telegram and on ISIS-affiliated Twitter accounts.

Mr. Saipov wove a deadly path on a stretch usually bustling with commuters, runners and cyclists, drawn by the downtown offices nearby or the shimmering river.

He turned onto the bike path alongside the West Side Highway at Houston Street just after 3 p.m. and sped south, striking numerous pedestrians and cyclists, many of them in the back, the authorities said. People scattered and dived to the asphalt.

The truck, labeled with a sign saying, “Rent me starting at $19,” rammed into the bus near Chambers Street. The bus serves two schools in Lower Manhattan and transports students with special needs. Two adults and two children on the bus were injured, the authorities said.",Manhattan Terror Attack Kills 8 and Injures 11,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/nyregion/police-shooting-lower-manhattan.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

I’ve lived in Paris part time for 20 years, but it took a while before I realized that I’d never heard a French friend say “dinner party.” When an invitation is offered, it goes something like: “Venez dîner à la maison.” And when my friends repeat it in English, they say, “Come home for dinner.” The warmth in these words struck me when I first heard them and set me at ease, dispelling whatever ideas I had about French dinners being stuffy — and I had been sure they would be. The phrase called to mind — of course, even the mundane can sound dramatic in French — lots of laughter, good wine, an evening that unfolds at a leisurely pace and ends late. It was what I wanted my own Parisian dinners at home to be.

Home has always been Saint-Germain-des-Prés, but I’m in a new apartment. We moved earlier this year, and while I’m still feeling my way around it, I already know it’s a wonderful place for entertaining friends. The living and dining areas are one slant-ceilinged space with three small balconies, each with geraniums, that double as wine coolers when the weather is right. In real estate speak, the kitchen is “charming”; in practical terms it’s small and demands neatness. It’s a narrow galley that ends in double doors to another balcony, this one with herbs I can snip.

Over the years, I’ve taken to making dinners on Mondays, the night most French hosts prefer to avoid, because all the outdoor markets and most of the best small food shops are closed that day — it’s impossible to get a morsel of fine cheese on Mondays. But because many restaurants are also closed, it’s a good night to feed the people who often cook for me, my friends who work in food.

I create a menu that can be prepared entirely ahead of time — usually the main course will need to be reheated, and everything will need to be plated, but nothing will keep me in the kitchen long. And while I don’t love the constraint, I love the three or four hours I spend the day before gathering provisions at my neighborhood markets. I know I could buy everything at a supermarket, but there would be no pleasure in it, no chance to chat with Twiggy, the cheesemonger, and catch up on the neighborhood news, and no opportunity to discuss with Serge, the butcher, how I was going to cook my osso buco. Each ingredient has its own story by the time I get it home.

A month or so ago, I made a Monday-night dinner for food-world friends, delighting in discovering that, while they knew of one another, not all of them had met. In addition to my husband, Michael, and me, there were two restaurateurs, Bertrand Auboyneau and Juan Sanchez; one cooking-school owner, Jane Bertch; and one baker, Apollonia Poilâne, who brought loaves of dark bread.

People in the food business are easy to feed: They’re grateful to have someone else in the kitchen and forgiving if things aren’t just so. But even if they’re quick to ignore whatever faux pas I, an American, might make, it’s because I’m an American in their country that I want to get it right. With the exception of the cheese plate, which slips in between the main course and dessert in France (and for which I early on bought a book to teach myself how to cut cheeses into their proper shapes), dinner runs pretty much the same way in both countries. Yet it can be like those cognates you learn in a foreign language — the words sound similar to those we know, but they turn out to have different meanings.

There was the time I served fried chicken and couldn’t get anyone to pick it up with their hands — for the most part, the French are not finger-lickers. The time all the cheese I served with drinks was left uneaten — cheese is for the cheese course, not for a nibble. The time I put everything out on the table at once, calling it an indoor picnic, and my guests, although urged to mix and match, reorganized my mishmash into a well-ordered traditional French meal and ate one dish at a time, leaving the salad for last, as is done.

Although I now know what’s accepted and acceptable, I occasionally veer off course and always stray at the beginning of the evening. On this Monday, friends began arriving at about 8, late-ish by American standards and just a bit on the early side by French ones. Dinner always starts in the living room and usually at least a quarter-hour after the time you’ve asked people to come (it’s considered impolite to arrive on time, as it’s assumed that the host always needs a few more minutes). I had everything for l’heure de l’apéro, or cocktail hour, set out on the small table in front of the sofa, and I opened the first bottle of white wine as people got settled. Bertrand took off his jacket — dinner at our home is never dressy — Jane found an armchair and was talking bread with Michael, a home baker, and Juan began pouring. Apollonia arrived a little later, and I put her rye bread next to the gravlax and dill yogurt I had made a few days before. The evening had begun and, within minutes, I heard my favorite sound: the chime of glasses touching in a toast.

Custom would have had me serving the wine with insubstantial tidbits — usually nuts, olives, salty crackers and, inexplicably, cherry tomatoes in any season. But because dinner starts late, and this introductory moment lasts one hour — you can set your clock by it — I’d made the gravlax, passing the first round and then encouraging everyone to help themselves.

We eventually drifted to the table, set with wine- and water glasses, carafes, colorful pottery plates Michael and I carried back from a vacation in the South of France and odd dishes and silver we found at flea markets. I had flowers and candles, but no tablecloth or bread plates — I love the way the French put their bread directly on the table, the inevitable crumbs forming hieroglyphs of collective celebration.

The appearance of the roasted peppers, brushed with oil and sherry vinegar and sitting on ricotta mixed with lemon and herbs, sparked a conversation about gardens. Bertrand had planted a vegetable garden, a potager, in Normandy to supply his Paris restaurants, and Juan had plans to plant one in Champagne. Once the dish was finished, Bertrand briefly turned on his phone (sheepishly asking permission first), and pictures of tomatoes and peppers and chard, leeks, potatoes, eggplants and small zucchini with beautiful oversize yellow blossoms were passed around.

Then came the osso buco, which I arranged in shallow bowls in the kitchen, placing each round of meat over a squash purée and putting only the gremolata on the table (to ensure that I wouldn’t have a repeat of the picnic experience). For a few moments there was silence punctuated by mmmms, the best compliment in any language. Then there were questions about how long I cooked the meat (about 90 minutes), comments about the addition of orange in the sauce (noticeable, but not overly so) and praise for the unusual addition of olives (and the fact that they were oil-cured). The cheese plate, always appreciated but not usually talked about (praise is reserved only for things homemade), followed and was talked about, as the Lou Poutou, a soft cow’s-milk cheese from southwestern France, was new to Jane and Bertrand. As I was clearing the dishes, Michael noticed that it was 11 o’clock, and so we refilled our wineglasses and went onto the balcony to see the Eiffel Tower sparkle — an interlude that might just become a ritual.

Table Talk Asking questions can get a guest to reveal something fascinating about herself. But a quick way to prevent that is to give her possible answers. “Why did you quit law school — was it too boring?” Leave out the guess. A short question is more likely to provoke details.

These dinners at home are not really about the food. They’re about friendship and the conversation that goes on around the table, often late into the night. Yet so much of the talk is about food — the food we’re sharing, the meals we remember, the ones we’ll soon eat, the food we’ve cooked and what we want to cook. New restaurants. New chefs. Has anyone tried the Italian stall at the market? Is bread getting better or worse in the city? Of course, there’s also talk of politics: Will Paris’s mayor really ban cars? What will Macron do? And Trump? “Oh, let’s talk about dessert,” someone says, and we do.

I had made wine-poached pears spiced with cinnamon, cloves and star anise and a cookie with Italian roots, called a torta sbrisolona. The cookie, an eight-inch square, is a communal offering — each person reaches in and breaks off a piece. It was past midnight when I noticed that the candles had burned to stubs. I didn’t turn up the lights — the coziness was too nice. We all had our elbows on the table amid the scattering of crumbs. We bent in, listening closely, and poured one another more wine.

“The foreign interference we saw was reprehensible,” Colin Stretch, Facebook’s general counsel, told senators.

The companies also acknowledged that they were struggling to keep up with the threat of foreign interference.

“The abuse of our platform to attempt state-sponsored manipulation of elections is a new challenge for us — and one that we are determined to meet,” said Twitter’s acting general counsel, Sean Edgett.

At the heart of the companies’ problems are business models that reward viral content — which can include misinformation — and an enormous advertising business that is automated and unable to easily spot ads purchased by foreign governments.

In a sign of the shifting political winds for tech giants, Republicans, who have been more restrained in their criticism of the companies, were more skeptical on Tuesday. In one contentious exchange, Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, pressed Mr. Stretch on whether Facebook could possibly police all of its advertisers.

“I’m trying to get us down from La-La Land here,” Mr. Kennedy said. “The truth of the matter is, you have five million advertisers that change every month. Every minute. Probably every second. You don’t have the ability to know who every one of those advertisers is, do you?”

Mr. Stretch acknowledged that Facebook could not track all those advertisers.

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, the chairman of the crime and terrorism subcommittee that held the hearing, said the risk went beyond Russia to other American adversaries. Talking to reporters afterward, he alluded to potential regulation of political advertising online.

“It’s Russia today; it could be Iran and North Korea tomorrow,” Mr. Graham said. “What we need to do is sit down and find ways to bring some of the controls we have on over-the-air broadcast to social media to protect the consumer.”

Facebook, Twitter and Google have not publicly opposed a bipartisan proposal to require reports on who funds political ads online, similar to rules for broadcast television. In private, their lobbyists have praised voluntary efforts to disclose political ad funding and have resisted many aspects of the bill.

Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said the legislation was essential before the midterm elections in 2018.

“Our midterms are 370 days away, and we don’t have time to mess around with dialogue anymore,” Ms. Klobuchar said in an interview after the hearing. Ms. Klobuchar introduced the bill with Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.

During the hearing, some Republicans also sought to play down the Russian effort to tip the election in favor of President Trump, stressing incorrectly that the Kremlin’s agents did not favor a particular presidential candidate in last year’s election.

“Russia does not have loyalty to a political party in the United States,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee. “Their goal is to divide us and discredit our democracy.”

That assertion was at odds with the conclusion of American intelligence agencies that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia tried to sway the election in favor of Mr. Trump, going beyond just posting disruptive content on social media. Russian operatives also hacked Democratic email accounts and released messages embarrassing to Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Mr. Graham asked Mr. Stretch of Facebook to confirm that the pattern of activity the site saw from Russia was more focused on sowing chaos in the United States than in bolstering Mr. Trump’s candidacy.

“During the election, they were trying to create discord between Americans, most of it directed against Clinton,” Mr. Graham said, addressing Mr. Stretch. “After the election, you saw Russian-tied groups and organizations trying to undermine President Trump’s legitimacy. Is that what you saw on Facebook?”

Mr. Stretch agreed. But the question was narrowly tailored, apparently intended to distance the broader Russian interference from the backing of Mr. Trump.

Though the companies promised to work with government officials, Mr. Stretch stopped short of agreeing to some suggestions.

In one heated exchange, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, asked him to reject political ad purchases in foreign currencies.

“How did Facebook, which prides itself on being able to process billions of data points and instantly transform them in the personal connections with its user, somehow not make the connection that electoral ads, paid for in rubles, were coming from Russia?” Mr. Franken said.

But Mr. Stretch hemmed, saying the rejection of a foreign currency to buy political ads would not solve the problem of foreign interference.

“The reason I’m hesitating on foreign currency is it’s relatively easy for bad actors to switch currencies,” Mr. Stretch said. “So it’s a signal, but not enough.”

That response failed to satisfy Mr. Franken, who interrupted with exasperation.

“My goal is for you to think through this stuff a little bit better,” Mr. Franken said, raising his voice.

This week, the companies admitted that the abuse of their platforms was much greater than previously acknowledged. In addition to Facebook’s admission, Google said that agents who were also from the Internet Research Agency uploaded more than 1,000 videos on its YouTube platform. Twitter said the agency published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter.

On Wednesday, the top lawyers for all three companies will appear before the House and Senate intelligence committees, which are conducting their own investigations into the Russian election meddling.

Tuesday’s hearing exposed a much deeper struggle for Facebook, which is trying to tread a delicate line as a technology platform while also fighting against hate speech, violence and misinformation on its site.

Now, a World Series that seemingly has had everything — scintillating comebacks, mind-numbing heat, an offensive gesture and a record number of home runs — will have a seventh game. The Dodgers will pitch Yu Darvish, and the Astros will go with Lance McCullers Jr. on the mound.

“Knowing it’s going to seven games is appropriate,” said Justin Turner, the Dodgers third baseman with a red gorse bush of a beard.

If the Astros are away from the comforts of home for the decisive game, they can at least draw confidence from their postseason experience: They clinched the division series at Fenway Park in Boston and defeated the Yankees in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series.

“You dream about these moments as a kid,” Astros third baseman Alex Bregman said. “I know everyone in here is super excited to be part of it. We’re going to go out there and empty the tank.”

For a good portion of Tuesday night, it didn’t seem like such high drama would be required.

George Springer quieted the crowd with a solo homer to right field with two out in the third inning, which seemed as if it might be enough for Verlander, who was at his big-game best, keeping the Dodgers scoreless for five innings.

It was the type of performance the Astros had in mind when they acquired him from the Detroit Tigers just before midnight on Aug. 31 — the deadline for playoff eligibility.

Verlander had twice pitched a shutout in a decisive Game 5 in a division series (both times against the Oakland Athletics), and he kept the Astros alive in the A.L.C.S. last month with a dominant performance against the Yankees in Game 6. He was 9-0 in an Astros uniform entering Tuesday, and the team had won all 10 games in which he had pitched.

“There’s something different when you put a major piece like that in your clubhouse,” Astros Manager A. J. Hinch said before the game. “And I think his presence alone gave guys hope and belief that things were going to be good for us.”

By the time the Dodgers came to bat in the bottom of the sixth, still trailing by 1-0, they had struck out eight times, often overmatched by upper-90s fastballs at the top of the strike zone. But Austin Barnes led off with a single and Chase Utley — who was 0 for 14 in the postseason entering Tuesday — was hit on the foot by a slider that bounced.

Photo

After the game, Verlander reiterated comments that have been made by several pitchers in this series, saying that the baseballs were particularly slick.

“That was in the back of my mind — I’m not gonna lie,” said Verlander, who added that when he picked up a ball he felt like he was going to throw it to the backstop. “I’m not going to throw a slider that’s just kind of spinning in the middle of the plate for him to hit a double on. I just kind of yanked it in.”

With two runners on, Chris Taylor then fought off a 1-2 fastball that was in on his hands and swatted the 97 miles-per-hour pitch over the head of Houston first baseman Yuli Gurriel, who was booed lustily every time he came to the plate over his racist gesture in Game 3.

The flare double tied the score at 1-1 and sent Utley to third. And there was still no one out. Corey Seager followed with a deep drive to right field that brought the crowd to its feet, but the cool air — the first-pitch temperature was 36 degrees colder than it was in Game 1 — held the ball up enough for Josh Reddick to catch it near the wall.

Still, it was a sacrifice fly that gave the Dodgers a 2-1 lead and moved Taylor to third.

Verlander gathered himself and retired Turner on a pop-up, then struck out Cody Bellinger to keep the Astros within a run.

The Astros, who squandered good chances in the fifth and sixth — Brandon Morrow retired Bregman on a grounder with the bases loaded in the fifth and Utley leapt near second base to snag Marwin Gonzalez’s liner with two on to end the sixth — could not deliver in the seventh either.

With Kenta Maeda facing Jose Altuve — who had greeted him with a three-run home run in Game 5 — with runners at first and third, Altuve grounded to Turner, who rushed his throw as the speedy Altuve tore down the line. But Bellinger stretched and dug out the throw on one hop an instant before Altuve reached the bag.

“In my mind, I think every ball is going to go in the dirt until it’s not,” Bellinger said. “So when the ball is in the dirt, it doesn’t catch me by surprise and I’m ready for it.”

The Dodgers could breathe a sigh of relief, and an inning later they could exhale — and laugh — as Pederson gave them a 3-1 lead and embarked on his giddy romp around the bases.

“That’s just Joc,” Bellinger said. “He does the craziest stuff on his home runs and that was a huge one. If he hits big home runs like that, he can do whatever he wants.”

Pederson waved his arms to the right-field pavilion as he reached second, pounded his chest as he approached third, jumped and tried to high five the third-base coach Chris Woodward and then turned toward the third-base dugout and rubbed his fingers together in a “money” gesture.

It seemed Pederson had remembered a bet with someone in the dugout before he went up to hit.

“I was curious who it was,” Seager said.

Was it Turner?

“Maybe,” Turner said with a smile.

For Pederson, there was something more to his trot than a cash reward. Demoted to the minor leagues in August and left off the division series playoff roster, Pederson has made the most of his opportunity. It was his third home run in the World Series.

“Emotions run high,” Pederson said in the interview room alongside his older brother Champ, who has Down syndrome. “You kind of black out in a situation like that, so I’m going to have to rewatch it to see what I did.”

What he did was leave another indelible moment on a series that will have to make room for at least one more on Wednesday night.","With a Rally and a Romp, Dodgers Top Astros and Force Game 7",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/sports/dodgers-win-game-6.html

Amazon showed on Thursday how it continues to play by rules that cause fits of despair among conventional retailers. For a company its size and age, it reports meager profits, choosing to plow the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.

Amazon said its net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $256 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $252 million, also 52 cents a share, during the same period last year.

But Amazon also gave investors the numbers they love to see, a 34 percent jump to $43.7 billion in revenue, as it continued to nibble away at the pocketbooks of customers. The company’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, jumped 30 percent to $4.58 billion in revenue, which Wall Street loves because it accounts for most of what little profit the company reports.

Amazon’s recent acquisition of Whole Foods Markets has sparked concerns from rivals that the company could become a terrifying new force in the huge category of grocery retailing. During the quarter, Amazon said, Whole Foods added $1.3 billion to its overall revenue.

The most remarkable sign of Amazon’s growth may be its rise in head count, most of which occurs in its warehouses. At the end of September, Amazon had 541,900 employees, up 77 percent from a year earlier.

The average earnings estimate compiled from analysts by Thomson Reuters was 3 cents a share, and the average revenue estimate was $42.14 billion.

On a conference call with financial analysts, Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, and Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive officer, were not asked about Google’s pending appearance before Congress.

Unlike Amazon, Alphabet gushed profits. Alphabet reported net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share — surpassing Wall Street’s earnings forecasts by more than a dollar. The company is bringing in more revenue — up 24 percent — while squeezing more profit from every dollar it brings in.

In July, when Alphabet previously reported quarterly results, investors shrugged off a $2.7 billion fine from the European Commission, the European Union’s administrative arm. The fine temporarily hit the company’s bottom line but did little to slow revenue growth or demand for its advertising.

Alphabet accounts for about 32 percent of all global digital advertising spending, according to research firm eMarketer. When it is combined with Facebook, the pair account for roughly half of all internet ad spending in the world.

With earnings showing no signs of slowing, Alphabet continues to amass a cash war chest. The company’s stockpile of cash and marketable securities topped $100 billion — or roughly the market value of Goldman Sachs.

Microsoft is mentioned less frequently as a potential target for regulators, in part because it already went through an agonizing antitrust saga in the 1990s and 2000s, one that hobbled it when big shifts in technology were looming.

But in the past several years, Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has revived the company, in part by redoubling its focus on cloud computing, where it has emerged as a credible No. 2 competitor to Amazon.

While Microsoft is not the fearsome leviathan it once was, it is still a moneymaking machine. On Thursday, the Redmond, Wash., company reported net income of $6.58 billion, or 85 cents a share, up from $5.67 billion, or 73 cents a share, the previous year. Revenue was up 12 percent to $24.54 billion.

The average earnings estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters was 72 cents a share, with revenue of $23.56 billion. Its shares jumped 3 percent.

Microsoft executives credited much of the company’s success in the quarter to growth in its cloud computing business, which encompasses everything from online storage to internet-based versions of Microsoft’s Office applications that customers subscribe to rather than purchase.

The company said its commercial cloud business had brought in $5 billion in revenue, up 56 percent from the previous year.

In the end, her only opponent was Tim Ryan, a young congressman and former high school quarterback star from Ohio’s 13th District, the ailing industrial region surrounding Youngstown and Akron. Ryan offered a splash-of-cold-water speech just before the vote: “We got wiped out,” he said, according to a recording of his remarks. “We’re toxic in the Midwest, and we’re toxic in the South.”

Pelosi won easily, but fully a third of the Democratic caucus voted against their leader, and Ryan’s insurrection seemed to have left a mark: After the election, three well-liked and nonrebellious members — Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Hakeem Jeffries of New York and David Cicilline of Rhode Island — were chosen by the caucus to help manage the rebranding of the party. The three of them spent the first half of 2017 dutifully interviewing nearly every member of the caucus and conducting more than a dozen listening sessions with authors, pollsters and former Obama cabinet secretaries. They hosted a dinner at which the party’s various factions — the Progressive Caucus, the Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, the conservative Blue Dogs and the New Democrats, among others — mingled as if meeting for the first time.

In late July, Pelosi, Bustos, Jeffries and Cicilline stood on a stage with six other Democrats under a wiltingly hot summer sky in the city park of Berryville, Va. — a town of 4,306 residents in a purple district within easy driving distance of Washington — and unveiled their new agenda, titled “A Better Deal: Better Jobs, Better Wages, Better Future.” The phrase, which had been poll-tested by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was an intentional echo of F.D.R.’s New Deal — and, less intentionally, of a Papa John’s pizza slogan. But its biggest debt was to the author of “The Art of the Deal,” and to his crimson-jowled populism.

“A Better Deal” called for retraining in America’s fading manufacturing sector, renegotiating trade deals, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and fighting the corporate consolidation that had affected the prices of everything from eyeglasses to beer. None of the 10 speakers invoked President Barack Obama. In fact, one of the key provisions in “A Better Deal” — renegotiating drug prices for Medicare recipients — was an implicit rebuke of the former president, who had agreed with the pharmaceutical industry to freeze Medicare drug prices in exchange for its support of the Affordable Care Act.

But even before the rollout, Pelosi diminished the substance of “A Better Deal” in an interview with The Washington Post, clarifying that it was not “a course correction, but it’s a presentation correction.” A Quinnipiac poll in August found that only 33 percent of Democrats and 12 percent of independents had a favorable opinion of the new Democratic agenda. The self-consciousness of the rebranding, one congressman mused to me at the time, “seems like what you would do in a different era.”

There was a stiff-jointedness to the whole spectacle, a sense of the Democrats’ trying to regain the use of muscles they had let atrophy over the previous eight years. Obama, after all, used to make this sort of thing look easy. Conflating the American story with his own — “This is who we are” — the president conveyed, even in policy irresolution, an unshakable sense of his and America’s place in the world. “I love the guy, I miss him,” Scott Peters said of Obama. “But organizationally, the party is in disarray. We’re at the lowest level of elected officeholders since Hoover. We got a bit lazy and found ourselves relying on Barack Obama’s charisma, and it left us in bad shape.”

Barring seismic developments, the G.O.P. is still likely to control both the White House and the Senate until at least January 2021. But nine months into Trump’s presidency, the chances of the Democrats’ retaking the House are much better. Multiple polls in recent months have shown generic Democratic candidates beating generic Republicans by as many as 15 points — a spread that, in past elections, correlated with winning more than enough seats for the Democrats to gain a House majority next year. And if they do, the consequences will be enormous. A Democrat-controlled House in 2019 would very likely derail the Republican legislative agenda. It could also conceivably set the stage for impeachment proceedings against the president — a move that many Democrats have openly proposed for months now.

But the Democrats’ path back from the wilderness is not a short one. No president since Ronald Reagan has won the presidency as convincingly, twice over, as Obama did — but those victories papered over an extraordinary decline in his party that became suddenly unignorable on Nov. 9, 2016. The Democratic National Committee today is an understaffed, demoralized bureaucracy. It has raised less than half of what its Republican counterpart has taken in so far this year. (Other party organizations — the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee — are faring better.)

Democratic presidents have generally been less than attentive to the financial and electoral health of their party, during and after their presidencies. The Northwestern political-science professor Daniel J. Galvin writes in his 2010 book, “Presidential Party Building,” that since John F. Kennedy, each of them “neglected, exploited or undercut his party’s organizational capacities.” Galvin found that this maltreatment was because such presidents had operated with “deep and durable majorities” in Congress. After the Democrats lost theirs in 1994, President Bill Clinton awakened to the virtues of party-building. Galvin predicted that Obama would most likely have sufficient reason to do the same.

Instead, Obama was every bit as indifferent as his predecessors. After he took office, his campaign’s formidable grass-roots organization, rechristened Organizing for America, became what some party leaders complained was a “shadow organization” that drained resources from the D.N.C. while championing the president rather than the Democratic Party as a whole. The president did not have anywhere near the kind of close relationship with the last D.N.C. chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, that George W. Bush had with the Republican National Committee chairmen Ed Gillespie and Ken Mehlman.

In 2012, Obama’s campaign chose not to contribute any money to the D.S.C.C. during that cycle — and then, emerging from its victory that year with a $20 million debt, the campaign promptly offloaded it onto the D.N.C. In early 2014, Obama assured Senate Democrats that keeping the Senate majority was his “No. 1 priority.” Months passed without any further action. Finally, two months before the midterms, Obama informed Harry Reid by phone that he was authorizing a $5 million transfer of D.N.C. funds to Senate election efforts. Reid tersely replied, “It shouldn’t have been this hard.”

Few of the Obama campaigns’ innovations have meaningfully outlasted his presidency. Their once-pioneering digital-organizing operation, for example, went largely to ground in 2016, while the party failed to fully grasp even the basics, like the usefulness of digital advertising. “What I can tell you,” says Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, who oversaw an analysis of the party’s shortcomings in the last election cycle, “is that our candidates and their staff told us that the Republicans did much better digitally than we did. And they spent more than us on digital.” (Teddy Goff, Obama’s former digital director, says: “I sincerely wish the technology built in the two Obama campaigns had been put to better use for 2016 and races down the ballot.”)

State Democratic Party leaders complain about O.F.A. — rebranded again recently as Organizing for Action — hoarding campaign resources to little end. And Priorities USA, the extravagantly funded super PAC that was started to support Obama’s 2012 campaign, never built the kind of entrenched ground-level presence maintained by its analogues on the right. In contrast, Americans for Prosperity, the conservative network financed by David and Charles Koch, spent the Obama years establishing a network of more than three million activists in 36 states and mobilizing them to protest against Obamacare, environmental regulations and tax increases — becoming what the group’s president, Tim Phillips, described to me as “a state-based long-game organization that would always be there.” The current chairman of Priorities USA, Guy Cecil, acknowledges the disparity: “Most of our activities, most of our structures, are built around individual fights, or individual candidates, or individual organizations, and I think that’s put us at a disadvantage.”

Organizational and technological lapses do not fully account for the Democratic Party’s travails. “All that stuff is like the field-goal team,” the Obama strategist David Axelrod told me. “None of it will help you if you haven’t already moved 80 yards down the field. Being technologically proficient wouldn’t have saved Obama if he didn’t also have a consistent, compelling message.”

But that message had grown threadbare by 2016. No longer was it sufficient to campaign on hope and change, or even on the president’s successful efforts in 2009 to stave off a deep recession. The uneven economic recovery raised questions about the party’s obliviousness to the impunity of Wall Street and the gap between the megawealthy and everyone else. Hakeem Jeffries, the New York congressman who was an author of “A Better Deal,” admits, “We developed a blind spot for the economic challenges that still remained unmet.”

By the end of Obama’s presidency, the Democratic Party had lost nearly a thousand seats in state legislatures across America. It had forfeited its majority in both the House and the Senate. A mere 16 of the nation’s 50 governors were Democrats — and that number dwindled to 15 in August, when Jim Justice of West Virginia announced with a grinning Donald Trump at his side that he, too, had decided to become a Republican.

A few days after the election, Ian Russell quit his job as the deputy executive director of the D.C.C.C. and cashed in his frequent-flier miles on a trip to Ireland. He watched Trump’s swearing-in on his phone in a Dublin pub over a pint of Guinness, and then a few more. The following morning, he threw his bags in a rental car and began a sort of weeklong post-traumatic odyssey, rambling westward to the coast.

Russell, now 33, had spent the past six years at the D.C.C.C. trying to help the Democrats regain the House majority that they lost to the Republicans in the 2010 midterm election. During every election cycle, political journalists and donors would file into one of the drab conference rooms inside the D.N.C. headquarters near the Capitol and watch as D.C.C.C. officials like Russell unveiled maps and polling data in support of the claim that this election cycle — unlike the last one — was going to break for the Democrats. Each time, Russell maybe half-believed it.

But election night left him reeling. It wasn’t just that Trump had upset Clinton — including in Russell’s home state, Michigan — or that the Democrats emerged 24 seats short of a House majority. What gnawed at him was a fear that Trump might actually win over Democratic voters more lastingly. Benton Harbor, a few miles down the road from Russell’s hometown in the western part of the state, lost its last Whirlpool manufacturing facility years ago. The childhood friends of his who remained in the area had renounced the Democrats and were now Trump voters. “Trump could transform American politics,” he remembers thinking at the time. “He could truly scramble things.”

But Russell’s fears of a unifying, postpartisan pragmatist in chief swiftly proved unjustified. Rather than focusing on jobs and infrastructure projects, Trump immediately set in motion an attempt to repeal Obamacare and ordered a travel ban on citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, which was met with demonstrations at airports across the country. On Jan. 30, the nonpartisan Hill analyst Stuart Rothenberg published a column headlined “Trump’s Fast Start Likely Puts the House in Play in 2018.” Rothenberg reasoned that overly aggressive new presidents tended to be judged harshly by the electorate in the middle of their first term. “The House map favors Republicans, but the midterm dynamic could well prove more powerful,” he wrote, listing 20 Republican seats — out of 24 the Democrats would need to flip the House — that, if typical midterm election patterns held, would most likely be imperiled. “Nothing is yet guaranteed, but don’t be surprised if the House is up for grabs in the fall of 2018.”

Late on his last evening in Ireland, Russell was drinking a final Guinness and listening to a passable folk band at the Palace Bar in Dublin while halfheartedly scrolling through the news back home on his phone when he came across Rothenberg’s column. He read through to the end with an accelerating heartbeat. It seemed big news to him that Rothenberg, a dispassionate prognosticator, had confidently issued such a prediction just 10 days into Trump’s presidency.

Back in Washington, Russell joined a relatively new political media consulting firm, Beacon Media, and started hunting for prospective 2018 House candidates. In early March, he traveled to California’s Orange County — historically a G.O.P. stronghold, though its wealthy population included growing numbers of Asian-Americans who tended to vote Democratic. In Irvine he met with Dave Min, a wry 41-year-old law professor who had worked on the Hill as a senior policy adviser to Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, and at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress.

Min, the father of three young children, had never considered running for political office before. But he was also a son of Korean immigrants and was appalled by the Trump administration’s attempts to ban Muslims from entering the United States. The incumbent congresswoman of California’s 45th District, Mimi Walters, was a little-known two-term Republican who had never faced serious opposition. She had won by nearly 18 points in 2016, but Clinton beat Trump in the district by more than five points. A strong anti-Trump sentiment in 2018 could work to Min’s benefit. In April, he told Russell that he was in.

Russell then traveled to the Illinois suburbs just west of Chicago. Like California’s 45th District, the Sixth District of Illinois had been reliably Republican for decades. But Clinton beat Trump there by seven points, and already its six-term congressman, Peter Roskam, was avoiding public appearances lest he be called upon to answer for the president. The progressive women’s group Emily’s List had referred Russell to Kelly Mazeski, a longtime public servant on local boards and commissions who had already decided to challenge Roskam. Mazeski was a breast-cancer survivor whose platform, she told me recently, was “health care, health care, health care.” Russell helped Mazeski time her announcement for May 4, the day Roskam and his fellow House Republicans voted for a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Scores of candidates were announcing their intentions in terrain recently considered inhospitable to Democrats: West Virginia, Texas, Kansas. Some aspirants Russell met lacked the talent to match their enthusiasm. Others were hot property and elected to go with one of Beacon Media’s competitors. But by Labor Day, Russell and his firm had picked up 10 Democratic challengers. Among them were a few beguiling dark horses, like a 46-year-old physician and former Y.M.C.A. national health officer from Portage, Mich., named Matt Longjohn. Undeterred by his lack of political experience, Longjohn was challenging Fred Upton, a Republican who had represented Michigan’s Sixth District for three decades.

Russell himself grew up in the Sixth District and cast his first ballot as a registered voter against Upton in 2002. Back then, the incumbent seemed invincible. But now, after leading the committee that wrote the legislation seeking to eviscerate Obamacare, Upton was avoiding town halls and any other public events.

Still, when I met Russell recently, his optimism was tempered by previous electoral disappointments. The Democratic Party now has more candidates than it can support, and next spring is likely to be a season of what national Democratic officials tactfully refer to as “messy primaries.” And even with Trump as a foil, Russell’s candidates were struggling to make a case for themselves. “Right now it’s such a target-rich environment for us,” he told me. But “we’re having trouble explaining why we’re the heroes and the Republicans are the villains. At some point, our narrative will have to become more coherent than it is now.”

In pursuit of the 24 seats Democrats need to win the House, the D.C.C.C. intends to target 80 Republican-held districts — a dozen more than the party went after in its 2006 bonanza year, when it captured a majority after gaining 31 seats. Many of next year’s seem to be fanciful propositions, or strategic plays designed to force the G.O.P. to spend resources where it would rather not. In other cases, the D.C.C.C. is counting districts held by controversial Republicans — Chris Collins of New York, with his aggressive advocacy of a biotech firm in which he held substantial investments; Duncan D. Hunter of California, with the possibility of a federal indictment for supposed campaign fund malfeasances hanging over his head — who nonetheless appear safe, at least for the moment. But four Republican representatives in potential swing districts — Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Dave Reichert, Charlie Dent and Pat Tiberi — have already announced their retirement in advance of 2018, and more are expected to follow before the end of the year.

Only three times in the last century (during the Great Depression, after Bill Clinton’s impeachment and after the Sept. 11 attacks) has a president’s party not suffered electoral losses midway into his first term. Those losses — an average of 32 House seats in each such midterm since 1862 — increase to 36 when the president’s approval rating is under 50. President Trump’s polling average has never once exceeded a favorability rating of 48 percent, and it now hovers at about 37 percent.

“I think the best thing the Democrats can do,” Zac Petkanas, formerly the director of rapid response for the Clinton campaign, told me, “is find as many people with a pulse, with a D next to their names, in as many districts as possible, and run on Obamacare and standing up to Trump.” But so much of the politics, and political mood, of Trump’s presidency is off the map of previous experience that other Democrats have seemed at times at a loss for how to respond. What to make of the late August NBC poll, for instance, that showed Democrats being viewed unfavorably by 54 percent of those surveyed, which was better than Republicans (61) and Trump (61), but also Pelosi (64)? Was that good news or bad news? And what about the D.C.C.C. focus groups and polls yielding the conclusion that voters broadly dislike Trump but are also put off by candidates who profess to be “standing up to Trump,” on the grounds that such resistance will only guarantee more dysfunction in Washington?

Republicans are hopeful that, Trump being the exception to almost every political rule, the historical trends of wave elections will also not apply to him. “Clinton came up against a wave in 1994 because he had campaigned as a centrist but then led with gays in the military and Hillarycare,” Karl Rove, the former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, told me. “The 2006 election was a wave because Republicans were defending the Iraq war and crippled by a late-breaking ethics scandal. Democrats faced a wave in 2010 because of Obamacare. So it’s been issues that have driven wave elections. This time around, I think it’s more a personal antagonism to Trump. And the question is, how critical will that be in shaping the attitudes of swing voters?”

But by Rove’s own analysis, two of the last three wave elections were triggered by health care policies that did not approach the deep unpopularity of the G.O.P.’s attempts this year to repeal or otherwise roll back Obamacare. And Trump’s base cannot be counted on to prevent a wave in 2018, because a key constituency — less-educated white voters — is a group that tends not to show up during midterms. They may have even less motivation to do so next year, considering Trump’s periodic denunciations of the Republican lawmakers who will need their votes.

But in four special elections to fill seats vacated by House Republican incumbents this year, the Democrats fell short — and in the case of Georgia’s Jon Ossoff, lost by four points even after raising an unheard-of $23 million. His was the most expensive House race ever, and the fact that Democratic donors spent so heavily on a loss may help explain why the party’s fund-raising has diminished since then. The Democrats’ base — young and nonwhite voters — is no better than Trump’s at showing up for midterm elections and is unhelpfully clustered in urban districts. Many suburban and rural districts were artfully gerrymandered by Republican state legislators after the 2010 census and have proved impenetrable since then; they aren’t likely to change hands without a healthy number of recent Republican voters being persuaded to vote Democratic.

There is also a less quantifiable problem, the one that vexed Pelosi’s team in the months after the election: the Democratic Party’s chronic difficulty explaining just what it stands for. “There’s a deep worldview among conservative intellectuals that moved its way through a fear of fascism in the 1940s, through think tanks and campaigns and the California tax revolt of the 1970s,” Felicia Wong, president of the progressive Roosevelt Institute, says. “And basically the Democrats don’t have that. The New Deal was one thing, and the Great Society was another thing. The party never fully recognized that Jim Crow and segregation were economic decisions. That left Democrats with an incoherent economic argument. The result is that they lack a historical vocabulary.”

Questions about the interplay of race and economics, of course, aren’t just historical after the 2016 election — as much as politicians and operatives might want them to be. Plenty of progressives hold the view, as the MSNBC host Joy Ann Reid has argued on Twitter, that white working-class voters “resent the changes that racial and religious multiculturalism have brought to societies where people like them have been the majority.” But a former colleague of Reid’s at MSNBC, Krystal Ball, now president of the People’s House Project — which seeks to elect Democratic congressional candidates in G.O.P. districts — insists that the primary motivation of these voters is economic. “People who are holding onto their livelihoods by their fingernails thought that at least Trump gave a crap,” she says. “Maybe it was a pack of lies he was selling them, but at least he didn’t hold them in contempt. And frankly there’s a lot of contempt from certain corners of our party. And a billion dollars’ worth of ads saying we’re not elitists won’t change that.”

Early on the morning of July 27, a group of House Democrats held a private gathering in the Capitol basement with a special guest: Rahm Emanuel, the Chicago mayor and former Obama chief of staff, who over a decade ago, when he was an Illinois congressman, served as chairman of the D.C.C.C. Looking ahead to 2018, Emanuel offered a broad-brushstroke plan of attack: “Find the specific issues that resonate in your district,” he said, according to one meeting participant’s notes. “We want to appeal to Trump voters who are already pulling away from him.” In particular, “Suburbs are our best opportunities.” On the matter of ideological purity, he was blunt: “It’s not a question of left versus center — it’s forward versus backward.”

If this advice sounded familiar, it was because Emanuel advocated the same strategy a dozen years earlier, when he was trying to lift his party out of the trough it had occupied since the Newt Gingrich-led takeover of the House by the Republicans in 1994. Emanuel focused on recruiting more centrist candidates who were well liked in their districts rather than on ideological darlings of the national party. “The people who criticized me back in 2006 were from my own party,” he told me recently. “When I was recruiting candidates, I’d get yelled at: ‘Why is he getting all these sheriffs and military guys?’ It’s because they were running in red districts!”

The election cemented Emanuel’s legend as a tactician — none of the Democrats attending the July 27 meeting expressed skepticism about his advice — but his strategy has never sat well with the party’s progressive activists. “I would just point to the fact that Rahm Emanuel’s Democrats who won in 2006 couldn’t hold those seats,” Stephanie Taylor, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (P.C.C.C.), which supports, trains and funds candidates, told me.

She was referring to the nearly a dozen Democrats who rode the 2006 wave into Congress, only to wash back out of it with the Tea Party wave four years later. (Three more had lost in 2008.) “I would suggest a counterfactual,” she went on: “If we had true economic populist champions who made the case to the American people about fighting for a strong economic agenda, we might have had more lasting success.” Or as the P.C.C.C.’s other founder, Adam Green, put it to me: “If there’s a Democratic wave in 2018, progressives won’t just ride that wave — we will cause that wave.”

Of course, activists like Green and Taylor also vowed to be the tip of the party’s spear in the previous cycle, with not much to show for it. Indeed, the Breitbart chairman and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon scornfully likens the Democrats’ ideological tussles to a “pillow fight,” further charging that progressives will never accomplish their goals “until they have a Breitbart on the left,” he told me. “Our stock in trade is going after the Republican establishment. There’s no one like that on the other side.”

Most if not all Democrats are more than happy to watch Bannon’s kamikaze antics wreak havoc on the opposition. Still, some in the party rue the lack of pugnacity on their own side. “There are two types of Democrats,” David Krone, Harry Reid’s former chief of staff, told me one afternoon this summer in the Midtown Manhattan office where he now works as a consultant for an investment firm. “There are killers, and there are whiners. Unfortunately, we have too many of the latter and not enough of the former.”

Krone considers piety an obstacle to progressive policies. “Democrats are not that pure,” he told me, with a biting smile. “All those guys have a transactional component to them.” Under Reid’s leadership, the Democrats managed to pass important legislation like the Affordable Care Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act while also thwarting a stream of conservative bills generated by the Republican-controlled House. But it was also Reid who held his colleagues to the deal that garnered the pharmaceutical industry’s support for Obamacare by agreeing to take Medicare drug prices off the table. When the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision in 2010 opened the floodgates for outside-group contributions, Reid did not join the chorus of bemoaners. Instead, he ordered up a super PAC, called the Senate Majority PAC, to help keep the Senate in Democratic hands during the 2010 and 2012 cycles. “Reid just never pretended to be something he wasn’t,” Krone said. “You don’t want to pass health care? Fine. Don’t make deals. Keep losing.”

In the Democratic Killers Hall of Fame, Krone places Emanuel and Pelosi. But lately, Krone observed, the party seemed to be tilting toward the whiners — beginning with the excuses offered for Hillary Clinton’s defeat. “It’s insane,” he said. “They freaking lost! They can blame anyone they want to, but they fail to look in the mirror.”

The 2018 cycle, Krone argued, was no time for squeamishness. Again he cited the example of his former boss Reid, who, like many Democrats in 2010, was a heavy underdog going into his final Senate race. Rather than be cowed by a Republican field that, at the peak of the Tea Party movement, had been infiltrated by the party’s fringe, Reid turned that to his advantage. His campaign waded into the Republican primary, targeting the most formidable G.O.P. opponents one by one until the only one left standing was Sharron Angle: a Tea Party favorite who once crusaded against water fluoridation and claimed multiple American cities were under the rule of Shariah law. Reid beat her easily.

By way of contrast, Krone pointed to Russ Feingold, the Wisconsin senator who, with John McCain, was a standard-bearer for campaign-finance reform, as well as a crusader for civil liberties during the Bush years. Feingold lacked Reid’s appetite for the jugular, losing to Ron Johnson in 2010 and then again in 2016. “He had his foot on Johnson’s neck, and then he let up, because he was up in the polls,” Krone lamented. “They don’t hand out participation trophies in politics.” If the party limited itself to high-minded campaigning and legislating, “We’ll lose again, and Kennedy” — the Supreme Court justice — “will retire, and Trump will get to appoint another conservative crazy, and the Democrats will wonder how things got to be so horrible.”

Still, the party faces a conundrum in its pursuit of Trump voters whose anxieties aren’t just economic but cultural as well. Prevailing in some red districts may require, at minimum, tempering the party’s progressivism on social issues. “When anybody talks about a so-called litmus test for candidates, that upsets me,” Representative Cheri Bustos told me. “I’m from Illinois, where I’m the only downstate Democrat in our entire delegation. I’ve been a Democrat my whole life, and my core values are very much in line with what hard-core Democrats believe. I don’t ever lie about my views. However, I also don’t talk about issues that are by their very nature divisive. If asked, I’ll answer I’m pro-choice. But then I’ll get back to the economy.”

But a week after Bustos and I spoke, the D.C.C.C.’s chairman, Ben Ray Luján, enraged liberal groups by saying that his organization would not oppose House candidates in favor of restricting abortion. Seeking to douse the fire, Meredith Kelly, the D.C.C.C. communications director, released a statement clarifying that the D.C.C.C. listed abortion rights as among the “fundamental tenets of the Democratic Party” and that the recruits it was backing “represent the values of the party.”

Adam Green of the P.C.C.C. was adamant on the prospect of anti-abortion recruits: “We wouldn’t welcome candidates who are pushing anti-choice policies into the big tent any more than we would welcome racists and people who want to deregulate Wall Street.” Green wasn’t buying the implication by Bustos and other moderates that the Democratic Party will regain a majority only if it backs away from progressive ideals. He urged me to talk to Rick Nolan, a progressive rural Minnesota congressman who, he said, “wins the right way.”

Nolan is a folksy 73-year-old journeyman politician and businessman who has long advocated a single-payer health system. He also hunts, fishes, makes his own maple syrup and in other ways stays attuned to the culture of Minnesota’s Eighth District. Taking Green’s advice, I asked Nolan whether he would welcome an anti-abortion candidate into the Democratic caucus. “Wholeheartedly,” he said. “If there’s a fault today among Democrats, it’s that they’ve got the worst litmus test known to humankind. If we want to achieve the goals progressives want, we’ve got to get back into the majority. Democrats are damned fools if they don’t see that.”

There was one thing on which the Democrats I interviewed, across the spectrum — Adam Green, David Krone, Krystal Ball, Meredith Kelly — agreed: that I should watch a YouTube ad that was posted in June on behalf of a 52-year-old Wisconsin ironworker named Randy Bryce. Bryce, whose prodigious mustache has earned him the nickname Ironstache, is aiming to unseat the current officeholder of Wisconsin’s First District, Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House. The emotionally charged ad announcing his campaign culminates in a challenge: “Let’s trade places. Paul Ryan, you can come work the iron, and I’ll go to D.C.”

One rainy late summer afternoon, I met up with the ad’s creator, a 42-year-old Army veteran named Bill Hyers, in a Washington hotel bar overcrowded with well-dressed young professionals. Hyers was sipping an old-fashioned when I arrived. He was dressed in a T-shirt and khaki shorts, his preferred business attire. Hyers has successfully managed the campaigns of well-established Democratic politicians like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, and his own politics are straightforwardly liberal. At the same time, he harbors a Holden Caulfield-esque disdain of insincerity and believes that this quality, more than whining or ideological perfectionism, explains his party’s state of decline.

“What’s terrible about Democrats like Rahm Emanuel,” Hyers said, “is that it matters more to them if you’re a candidate who can raise money from very wealthy people than if you have an argument to make. They look at everything through the old Clinton triangulation strategy. Put out very carefully prepared statements. Don’t let anyone get to your right. Deny and ignore. Never have an honest dialogue. It was a bad strategy back in the ’90s. But it’s even worse today, because we can now have 24-7 access to candidates, and people can see when they’re not being authentic. Everything Hillary Clinton did was carefully scripted — they could see that.”

Hyers’s client Bryce has been the undisputed breakout star of the 2018 cycle so far; the announcement ad has attracted millions of views. (Such enthusiasm, it should be said, does not yet make Bryce any less of a long shot: The D.C.C.C. does not currently include Wisconsin’s First District among its 80 targeted seats.) The afternoon we met, Hyers showed me a rough cut of an ad for his newest client, a former Army champion boxer and ex-opioid addict from Staten Island named Boyd Melson — known in the ring as the Rainmaker — who is running for New York’s 11th District. Melson’s YouTube rollout, like Bryce’s, is replete with stirring proletarian imagery: neighborhoods festooned with American flags, an aloof Republican incumbent dodging town halls, Melson alone in the ring pummeling the air with slow-motion jabs. It suggests a trailer for “Rocky Goes to Washington.”

“I can only take a little credit for them,” Hyers admitted after the two-and-a-half-minute ad came to an end. Bryce’s and Melson’s ads, he told me, had a co-producer: Matt McLaughlin, a veteran of TV advertising who “didn’t know campaigns and politics, but he knows art.” Hyers did not think the party’s need for “authentic candidates” and a little theatrical verve were incompatible. If anything, the role the confluence of those two perceived assets played in Trump’s victory is one of the few inarguable lessons of the 2016 election.

This lesson, however unacknowledged, is playing out across the 2018 electoral landscape. In Kentucky, a former Marine fighter pilot named Amy McGrath appears in a bomber jacket, declaring that her “new mission” is to “take on a Congress full of career politicians.” Assessing her candidacy’s apparent long odds, she says, with a cockeyed grin, “We’ll see about that.” Another web ad shows a dashing scientist in a white lab coat: Hans Keirstead, a pioneering stem-cell researcher now running to represent California’s 48th District and billing himself as the very definition of a “problem solver.”

In mid-August, I spoke to Ian Russell’s latest client, a telegenic Marine veteran and two-term state representative from Lewiston, Me., named Jared Golden. Lewiston today is a hollowed-out exoskeleton of a textile mill town. “Our way of life is under attack here,” Golden said. “We’re a classic case of the America that’s being left behind. The social-identity issues that have been emphasized in Portland don’t resonate in rural Maine. It’s damaged the Democratic brand here, to be honest. We’re a community of hard-working people who may not be highly educated, but that doesn’t mean we’re not intelligent. The majority of the folks here voted for Donald Trump, and I can tell you that the description of them as a basket of deplorables is just dead wrong.”

Golden told me that his neighbors had until recently thought of themselves as Democrats. Golden himself still is. When we spoke, he had just decided to run in Maine’s Second District against the Republican incumbent, Bruce Poliquin. Golden would be the fifth Democrat to enter the race. He seemed to have little use for the national party’s “A Better Deal” pitch, telling me, “It’s going to take more than a glossy new policy document to take back the U.S. House.”

What, then, would it take? A few days after I spoke with Golden, Ian Russell traveled to Lewiston and shot his candidate’s announcement ad. It mixes twilit images of small-town Maine with footage of the candidate in combat fatigues; later, he jogs down a country road wearing a T-shirt that says, “Pain Is Weakness Leaving the Body.” The ad excoriates the Republican incumbent but also bipartisan trade deals and unnamed political leaders who push “issues that don’t impact your life.”

Video

“But what if this is the best version?” Lady Bird responds. It’s a sharp, sardonic line (one of many) and also an anguished existential question.

Christine (to use the name Marion gave her) wants to satisfy her mother, which is a difficult task because the standards seem impossibly high and subject to change without notice. She also wants to be true to her own desires and convictions, which is difficult for other reasons.

While “Lady Bird” honors the gravity of Christine’s struggle, it hardly neglects the everyday absurdity of her plight. The very first scene begins in tears. Mother and daughter, listening to an audiobook of “The Grapes of Wrath” while driving home from a college tour, cry over the novel’s moving final sentences. Their shared moment of literary catharsis quickly devolves into an argument, which is punctuated by a startling and hilarious jolt of physical comedy (one of many).

In tone and structure, after all, this is a teenage comedy. It finds humor in the eternally renewable cycle of senior year: homecoming and prom; math tests and school plays; the agonizing stages of the “admissions process.” Along the way, Christine undergoes other, extracurricular rites of passage. She falls in love for the first time and has sex for the first time. She trades in her loyal, longtime best friend (Beanie Feldstein) for a richer, more popular girl (Odeya Rush). She fights with her mother and her older brother, Miguel (Jordan Rodrigues), and leans on her father, Larry (Tracy Letts), an affable fellow with troubles of his own.

You might think you’ve seen this all before. You probably have, but never quite like this. What Ms. Gerwig has done — and it’s by no means a small accomplishment — is to infuse one of the most convention-bound, rose-colored genres in American cinema with freshness and surprise. The characters can look like familiar figures: the sad dad and the disapproving mom; the sullen brother and his goth girlfriend (Marielle Scott); the mean girls and the cool teachers; the too-perfect boyfriend (Lucas Hedges) and the dirtbag boyfriend (Timothée Chalamet). None of them are caricatures, though, and while everyone is mocked, nobody is treated with cruelty or contempt, at least by Ms. Gerwig. (Lady Bird is not always so kind.)

The script is exceptionally well-written, full of wordplay and lively argument. Every line sounds like something a person might actually say, which means that the movie is also exceptionally well acted. It is not too quick to soothe the abrasions of class and family. The McPhersons are hardly poor, but the daily toll of holding onto the ragged middle of the middle class is evident in Larry’s melancholy and Marion’s ill humor. They are a loving family, but their steadfast devotion to one another doesn’t always express itself as kindness. They are real people, honestly portrayed.

That might make “Lady Bird” sound drab and dutiful, but it’s the opposite. I wish I could convey to you just how thrilling this movie is. I wish I could quote all of the jokes and recount the best offbeat bits. I’d tell you about the sad priest and the football coach, about the communion wafers and the Sacramento real estate, about the sly, jaunty editing rhythms, the oddly apt music choices and the way Ms. Ronan drops down on the grass in front of her house when she receives an important piece of mail. I’m tempted to catalog the six different ways the ending can make you cry.

There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

There’s no magic formula for getting into a selective college, but over a decade covering admissions for The Chronicle of Higher Education, I’ve picked up a thing or two. These takeaways, based on hundreds of interviews with admissions deans over the years, may help you navigate the process.

Admissions decisions aren’t all about you.

When colleges choose applicants, they’re juggling competing goals, like increasing diversity and bringing in more revenue. Admissions officers aren’t looking for students who fit just one description — say, those who’ve earned all A’s or won the most awards. So don’t take rejection personally.

Grades and test scores still carry the most weight.

Colleges often say they want to get to know the real you, but that’s probably true only if your academic accomplishments (and the rigor of courses you’ve taken) pass muster.

You’re more than a number.

After colleges identify a big batch of students with outstanding credentials, differences among them become more important, admissions deans say. Among some of the attributes they tell me they would like to see evidence of (in essays, extracurricular activities, recommendations) are: leadership, risk taking, emotional intelligence, fire for learning, critical thinking, curiosity, empathy, optimism, grit, perseverance and the ability to overcome obstacles.

Express your authentic self.

Overwhelmed by slick, boastful essays, colleges are eager for what they call “authentic” glimpses of applicants — their experiences, passions and goals. Some deans believe they’ll get deeper insight through alternative formats like videos, pictures, audio files or documents (an Advanced Placement English paper, maybe). A handful of prestigious schools, including Yale, the University of Chicago, Pomona College, Reed College and the University of Rochester, recently introduced this option. As with essays, too much polish is no good, deans say, so you might think twice about hiring a professional videographer. At Yale, about 400 applicants (out of nearly 33,000) for this year’s freshman class sent in something in an alternative format. In at least one case, the submission — a video showing leadership and impact on others — was, the dean told me, a “difference maker.”",10 Things to Know About Getting Into Your Dream College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/education/edlife/admissions-tips-on-getting-into-dream-college.html

Finding that inner peace took Mr. Hamill several months of frustration and self-pity — not to mention a Lucasfilm-mandated regimen of dieting and exercise, during which he thought to himself: “Why are they training me to turn and remove a hood? I could be the size of Marlon Brando in ‘Apocalypse Now,’ who’s going to know?”

You would understand if Mr. Hamill, now 66, had a conflicted relationship with “Star Wars,” which put him on a pop-cultural pedestal. The series defined and dominated his career, even as he took on other film, television and theater roles; the franchise went into periods of hibernation, then came roaring back and restored him to relevance when he least expected it.

But Mr. Hamill isn’t bitter or jaded, and he isn’t Luke, though he has retained some of that character’s incorruptibility. He’s gone from a new hope to an old hand, with a lined, expressive face and a gray beard, beneath which lurks a mischievous sense of humor, a yearning to perform and a joy in sharing “Star Wars” war stories.

At heart, he is as much of an unapologetic geek as any of his admirers, as astonished by the circumstances that brought “Star Wars” into his life as he is grateful that he gets to return to its galaxy of long ago and far, far away.

“I’m such a fraud,” he said with a theatrical air. “But I’m enjoying all the residual attention that the movie’s getting. I should be, by all rights, puttering in my garden with a metal detector, telling kids to get off my lawn. What’s not to love?”

On this October afternoon, he was at home with his wife, Marilou, and their daughter, Chelsea; the couple also has two sons, Nathan and Griffin. The spacious dwelling is hardly a shrine to “Star Wars” — it’s mostly decorated with artwork of cherubs and the Beatles, Mr. Hamill’s own cultural obsession, though you might spot a photo of the 2-year-old Nathan frolicking with Yoda on the set of “Return of the Jedi.”

Mr. Hamill is not unduly nostalgic, but he conducts himself with an impish refusal to grow up. In conversation, he will sometimes stretch on the floor in yoga poses; he’ll slip into the exaggerated voices of famous colleagues — the adenoidal clip of the “Star Wars” creator George Lucas or the disaffected monotone of Mr. Ford.

In many ways, he is still the boy who was fascinated with cartoon voice actors, musical theater, stage magicians and ventriloquists, and whose favorite film was “King Kong.”

Proudly recalling a fight scene from “Return of the Jedi,” Mr. Hamill said, “For me, sitting in the rancor’s hand, I was going all Fay Wray — it’s like a major accomplishment to me. But it was always that way. I’d say ‘Hey, you guys, my face is on the back of a box of C-3PO’s cereal!’”

The son of a Navy officer, Mr. Hamill was the middle child of seven siblings. He had an itinerant upbringing, living in California, Virginia and Japan, attending nine schools in 12 years and perpetually feeling like the new kid.

When he arrived in Los Angeles in 1969, Mr. Hamill was interested in acting, but really wanted to be involved in show business however he could. “If I didn’t get a part, no problem,” he said. “Then where do I go? I sell tickets. I make props. I make posters. I don’t have to be in the show – I want to be near the show.”

He landed early roles on “General Hospital” and “The Partridge Family.” And then, of course, came “Star Wars”: a strange screenplay, still in flux when he read it, with sentient robots, laser swords and a supernatural spirituality bound up in a fable about good and evil.

Mr. Lucas said he chose Mr. Hamill from a pool of young actors because he brought a measure of humanity to a film full of space vehicles and special effects. “I needed a protagonist who was comfortable treating these things both casually and seriously in order to give that world an air of authenticity,” Mr. Lucas said. He added that Mr. Hamill “brought a boyish enthusiasm and exuberance that really defined the character,” and that “made Luke accessible and relatable to people in the first ‘Star Wars’” and its sequels.

Mr. Hamill committed fully to the material, but was unsure it would find a wider audience. “I thought, even if this thing doesn’t slay at the box office, it’s got midnight cult movie written all over it,” he said. “Move over, ‘Rocky Horror,’ ‘Star Wars’ is here!”

Instead, “Star Wars” became an international phenomenon, tying Mr. Hamill to his character and to Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford — even now, he sometimes accidentally calls them “Harry and Carrison” — as they promoted the movie together.

When the critic John Simon wrote in New York magazine that Mr. Ford had performed “adequately,” Mr. Hamill “uninspiredly” and Ms. Fisher “wretchedly,” Mr. Hamill said, “We had T-shirts made: ‘adequate, uninspired and wretched.’ I said, ‘Harrison, adequate’s practically a rave compared to what we got.’”

Mr. Ford said that during this time, “the three of us were like a very small tribe in the wilderness. We really were figuring this out as we went along.” Mr. Hamill struck him as “a very bright, sincere young actor,” who Mr. Ford said “seemed probably the most clear on what he was doing.”

Mr. Hamill, who receives a percentage of the “Star Wars” royalties, did not go onto a mainstream career, but he is hardly rueful now. Of his cohort, Mr. Hamill said Mr. Ford was the one meant for matinee idol status: “He’s a brilliant actor — that’s a given,” he said. “He’s also a leading man. When I tested for this thing, I assumed he was the protagonist and I was his annoying sidekick.” Mr. Hamill believed he’d find his destiny on a different path — one that was less glamorous, but that fully embraced his affection for the esoteric, the offbeat and the weird.

After two blockbuster sequels, “The Empire Strikes Back” in 1980 and “Return of the Jedi” in 1983, Mr. Hamill believed the “Star Wars” story was complete. With newfound visibility, he decided to pursue a lifelong dream of performing on Broadway, where he had played John Merrick in “The Elephant Man.” “I wasn’t getting character parts in movies and television,” he explained. “Unless you’re Meryl Streep, they don’t let you do accents.”

He starred in the Broadway production of “Amadeus” while “Return of the Jedi” was still in theaters. But his 1985 musical “Harrigan ’n Hart,” about a pair of 19th-century variety-theater stars, was a notorious dud, running less than a week of regular performances.

Over the next 30 years, Mr. Hamill was cast in cult films and TV shows, often poking fun at his inability to shed his “Star Wars” legacy. He played an interstellar fighter pilot in the Wing Commander video games, and on “The Simpsons,” he portrayed himself playing Nathan Detroit as Luke Skywalker in a mediocre dinner-theater production of “Guys and Dolls.” Perhaps his best-known work from this era was providing the voice of the malevolent Joker in several animated Batman TV shows, movies and video games.

He was always comfortable being part of the “Star Wars” subculture, gladly attending conventions and engaging with the people he calls U.P.F.s (for “ultra-passionate fans”).

“It’s clearly not for everyone — I get that,” Mr. Hamill said. “But the passion of it all is just astonishing. The way it’s become part of the fabric of their lives — ‘I met my wife at this movie, we named our child Leia’ — it’s moving.”

He was not involved in the much-maligned “Star Wars” prequels from 1999 to 2005. And when Mr. Lucas invited him and Ms. Fisher to a lunch in 2012, to tell them he was giving control of Lucasfilm to Kathleen Kennedy and that a new “Star Wars” trilogy was being planned, Mr. Hamill had no expectation of being asked to participate. “We figured we had the middle three,” he said. “It was over.”

When Mr. Lucas said their characters would be included in these new films if they wanted to play them, Mr. Hamill said, “I was completely stunned. Carrie, not a minute went by — she slapped the table and goes, ‘I’m in!’ I said, ‘Carrie, poker face!’”

Mr. Hamill needed more time to think. “I was just really scared,” he said. “I thought, why mess with it? The idea of catching lightning in a bottle twice was ridiculously remote.”

He also feared that audiences would reject him and his veteran co-stars, all these years after their “Star Wars” heyday. “No one wants to see the 50-, 60-, 70-year-old versions of us, running around, bumping heads on the Death Star,” he said. “It’s sad.”

Mr. Hamill thought he would have some cover to refuse “The Force Awakens,” expecting that Mr. Ford would not return.

“He’s too old and too rich and too cranky,” Mr. Hamill said. “He’s not going to do this.” But when Mr. Ford said yes, Mr. Hamill realized he had to agree, too: “Can you imagine if I was the only one to say no? I’d be the most hated man in nerd-dom.”

Soon after accepting, Mr. Hamill got to bask in the adulation of “Star Wars” fans eager to see him on new adventures with the young novices Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega). He trained to get into shape and met with Lucasfilm artists. But deeper behind the scenes, J.J. Abrams, the director of “The Force Awakens,” and his co-writer, Lawrence Kasdan, a writer of “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi,” were realizing their ever-expanding script could not accommodate Luke’s story line. (The screenplay was credited to Mr. Abrams, Mr. Kasdan and Michael Arndt.)

“The idea of it was so enormous,” Mr. Abrams said. “It became clear that there was no way that that movie could also include those chapters. That had to be the next movie.”

Eventually Mr. Abrams had to tell Mr. Hamill that Luke would not be a significant character in “The Force Awakens.” “I let him know before he read the script that his role was minimal,” Mr. Abrams said. “I don’t think he knew just how minimal until he read it.”

In their next conversation, Mr. Abrams acknowledged, Mr. Hamill was “not particularly happy with how little he was in it.”

Mr. Hamill does not deny his initial disappointment, though he said he was mostly afraid that Luke’s big reveal at the end would fall flat. “If it smacks the audience as a cheat or a gimmick, if there’s a big groan in the house, the egg’s on my face, not J.J.’s,” he said.

Amid lingering feelings of petulance, Mr. Hamill traveled to London in 2014 for a table read — he jokingly calls it a “table listen” — of the “Force Awakens” script. He had no dialogue, so Mr. Abrams instead asked him to read the narration. (“I think he wanted to break me, like you break a racehorse,” Mr. Hamill said.) Still, he was excited to meet Ms. Ridley and Mr. Boyega, and to reunite with Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford.

Mr. Ford, who had not seen Mr. Hamill in many years and shared no scenes with him in “The Force Awakens,” lamented that they had worked together on the early “Star Wars” movies far less than viewers realize.

“The number of onscreen days that I spent with Mark were very, very few,” he said. “I knew Chewbacca better.”

Yet as soon as he spotted Mr. Hamill there, Mr. Ford said, “aside from the obvious passage of time, which had happened to both of us, he was very much the same guy, albeit bearded.”

“He’s very centered in his own experience and his own life,” Mr. Ford said. “He’s not a grandstander. He’s a quiet, sincere, workmanlike presence, and that’s what we’re there for.”

Mr. Hamill has come to appreciate his extended cameo in “The Force Awakens” — “when they talk about you that much in a movie before you even show up, that’s fabulous,” he said.

But now he and the “The Last Jedi” creators understand how much is riding on them with this film.

“I told him, everyone is going to be leaning forward for your first words in this,” said Rian Johnson, the “Last Jedi” writer and director. “Obviously, Mark came into this one with higher expectations for what we do with the character.”

Mr. Johnson said “The Last Jedi” also treated Mr. Hamill as an actor who has lived a whole life since he first played Luke. “In the same way that as a young man, he embodied the characteristics we all connected with — the youthfulness and innocence — he now embodies a person full of soul and experience,” Mr. Johnson said.

While Mr. Hamill tries not to dispute the “Star Wars” filmmakers on big plot points — he’s still not sure whether Mr. Lucas always intended for Luke and Leia to be brother and sister — he found himself full of strong opinions about how the character he has been associated with for 40 years should be presented in “The Last Jedi.”

“That’s the hard part,” Mr. Hamill said. “You don’t want to admit how possessive you’ve become. There are times where you go, ‘Really? That’s what they think of Luke? I’m not only in disagreement – I’m insulted.’ But that’s the process and you thrash it all out.”

The film has become an unexpectedly poignant document since Ms. Fisher died in December. Though their contact was fitful in her final years, Mr. Hamill said that Ms. Fisher was a reliably caustic companion and correspondent — someone who brought a wicked sense of humor to the occasionally onerous media events they attended together and offered him a constant reminder of his obligation to “Star Wars.”

Several years ago, when Ms. Fisher noticed in a theater program that Mr. Hamill had referred only elliptically to his “Star Wars” work, he said, “She goes, ‘What’s your problem?’ I said, ‘Well, it’s theater, I want it to be more focused on theater.’ She goes, ‘I am Princess Leia. You’re Luke Skywalker. Get used to it.’”

More remorsefully, Mr. Hamill spoke of his frustration that Ms. Fisher would not get to complete this trilogy of films.

“She deserved that second act,” he said. “Harrison was more prominent in VII, I’m more prominent in this one, and she was meant to be more prominent in the last one. Her timing was perfect, except in this case.”

His “Star Wars” colleagues say that there is something fitting about the fact that the devoted, less heralded Mr. Hamill is the only lead actor from the original films presently involved with the franchise — “He’s the last man standing,” said Mr. Ford, whose character met his demise in “The Force Awakens.”

But Mr. Ford was reluctant to speculate what this distinction might mean to Mr. Hamill.

“It means what it means to him, and that’s all that matters,” he said. “I’m sure what he represents in the story is something worthy of attainment by those younger characters, and” — his voice took on an uncharacteristically whimsical tone — “that it’s all linked together in some cosmically glorious way that will assure Mark work for years to come.”

Mr. Hamill prefers not to scrutinize this too closely either. Pleading self-consciousness, he said he has not watched the original “Star Wars” movies outside of theaters and has seen “The Force Awakens” only twice.

“All I notice are flaws,” he explained. “‘Oh, why did I do that?’ ‘Look at my hair.’ ‘What was I thinking?’”

During production of “The Force Awakens,” he allowed himself to watch the audition reels of actors who were also considered for Luke Skywalker — Will Seltzer, Robby Benson, William Katt — and was struck by what he saw. “They were all great,” Mr. Hamill said. “They all could have been really good Luke Skywalkers, which really makes me appreciate the arbitrariness.”

One film Mr. Hamill goes back to frequently is “A Hard Day’s Night,” Richard Lester’s madcap comedy about the Beatles happily enduring the hardships of celebrity as they are pursued by fans.

As a teenager, Mr. Hamill said, “I saw it originally going, ‘Oh, can you imagine it? Girls chasing me down the street! It looks like so much fun.’” But when he viewed it again recently, he saw it in another light. “It’s like a horror movie,” he said. “They’re trapped. They can’t go anywhere.”

One scene that stuck in Mr. Hamill’s mind was the “Can’t Buy Me Love” sequence, when the Fab Four are running through a field, clowning around, blissfully free of the gravitational forces awaiting them in the outside world.

“It’s the one time they spontaneously feel exuberance and joy,” Mr. Hamill said. “It plays so differently now, when you’re on the other end of it.”",Luke Skywalker Speaks,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/movies/star-wars-the-last-jedi-luke-skywalker-mark-hamill.html

Mueller III bears down in his investigation of the alleged Russian efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election.

As Mr. Mueller and his team home in on people connected to President Trump, including his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, the president and his allies in the conservative media sphere are pointing at the Democrats and Hillary Clinton.

Adding to the problem is the recent behavior of the tech companies, which have not shown the same desire for accountability exhibited by Mr. Ailes and his fellow network chiefs all those years ago. On Tuesday, when Congress called Facebook, Twitter and Google to testify, the platforms sent their lawyers, not their top bosses.

Yes, the lawyers provided some details about how Russian operatives had reached scores of millions of Americans with divisive and misleading messages. But that was only after Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, insisted in November that it was a “pretty crazy idea” that Russian operatives had used Facebook to influence the election. (Facebook’s latest tally of Americans who were exposed to Russia’s divisive content: 126 million.)

The opacity of the tech companies was matched by the efforts of some conservative media outlets to confuse and distract.

In the days leading up to the indictment of Mr. Manafort and his lobbying partner Rick Gates, they saw fit to question Mr. Mueller’s legitimacy. They did so while arguing that the real focus should be on Mrs. Clinton, the Democrats and a political research firm that commissioned the gathering of information on Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia, Fusion GPS.

The counternarrative was particularly pronounced in the outlets controlled by Mr. Murdoch — who has close ties to the president’s family — and his news and entertainment companies, 21st Century Fox and News Corp.

On Saturday, the Fox News host Jeanine Pirro called for the jailing of Mrs. Clinton, saying, “It’s time to shut it down, turn the tables and lock her up.”

She alleged that “the Obamas and the Clintons” had “built the Trump-Russia connection,” pointing to a report in The Washington Post that the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee had helped finance research by Fusion GPS, which produced a dossier describing ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. She did not mention a report in The New York Times that a conservative media organization, The Free Beacon, hired Fusion GPS to research Mr. Trump and other Republicans.

The most salacious findings in the dossier, based on information collected from sources inside and outside the Kremlin by a Fusion GPS contractor, the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, remain uncorroborated.

Also on Saturday, The New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin called for Mr. Mueller’s resignation, citing Fusion GPS as well as Mr. Mueller’s previous job as an F.B.I. director under President Barack Obama, given that, in Mr. Goodwin’s view, so much of the investigative focus must now fall on Mr. Obama’s administration.

Foreshadowing Mr. Goodwin’s dubious argument was an editorial in the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal, which declared that Mr. Mueller “lacks the critical distance” to look into the allegation that “Democrats paid for Russians to compile wild allegations about a U.S. presidential candidate.” The editorial also questioned whether the dossier had triggered the F.B.I. inquiry into Mr. Trump’s campaign.

But the investigation began in July last year, James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director at the time, told Congress in March, not long after Fusion GPS’s financing passed from Republican to Democratic sources.

And while skepticism is a virtue in all journalistic endeavors, there is no evidence to support the assertion that the Democrats hired Fusion GPS with the purpose of getting Russians to spread “wild allegations” about Mr. Trump.

As John Sipher, a former Central Intelligence Agency chief of station, pointed out, intelligence tends to come from sources within foreign governments.

“Reaching out to Russians and Americans to try to collect information on what might have happened and then pass that information to sources in good faith, that’s different from trying to conspire with Russia to get stolen emails from the United States,” Mr. Sipher told me.

The collective coverage from The Journal editorial page, The New York Post and Fox News — not including the straight-ahead coverage by the likes of Shepard Smith and Bret Baier — was testament to the Murdoch empire’s ability to make its own journalistic weather.

Between the promotion of alternative narratives and the way the social media platforms have been so slow in describing their inadvertent hosting of the Russian effort, there’s a striking lack of national unity over what appears to have been a foreign incursion in an American election. So you have to wonder how the country will ever come together to do something about it.

“There’s this epic lack of consensus, or active dis-census,” said Shawn Powers, the executive director of the United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, who has spent years studying what he calls the “geopolitics of information.”

Mr. Powers was confident that, as the facts come out, the country will find a way to fend off similar attacks. For instance, he said, Facebook, Twitter and Google are adding new policies to combat false information, fake accounts and nefarious foreign political advertising.

But I can’t help thinking back to 2001.

On Tuesday, I called Tom Johnson, the former CNN chairman, who was one of the executives who appeared on Capitol Hill to testify in 2001. He said some colleagues had some qualms appearing before Congress, given the First Amendment implications. But he told me that he had felt it was the right thing to do.

“I still think we have the very highest public responsibility to make sure we get it right and, when we don’t get it right, that we try to determine what went wrong and what we can do about it,” he said. “It really gets down to operating in the public interest.”

What also troubled the Germans, according to former American diplomats, was Mr. Murphy’s lack of diplomatic experience, though he was familiar with the country because he had overseen Goldman Sachs’s office there from 1993 to 1997.

Mr. Murphy, however, was a fast study, according to Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, a former senior director for European affairs at the National Security Council, who communicated regularly with the American embassy in Berlin. He traveled around the country and used his affinity for soccer to bond with German officials, she said.

But about a year and a half into his tenure, Mr. Murphy was ensnared in a crisis that would embarrass American diplomatic missions around the world: the publication of a massive cache of State Department cables by WikiLeaks.

In the classified cables, Mr. Murphy was shown to be a shrewd operator within the German political system, having sources — one was called “the mole” by German news media — throughout the government. They provided the American embassy inside reports about German politics, including detailed accounts of negotiations to form a coalition government in 2009.

The cables also contained critical comments Mr. Murphy made about senior German officials. He called Chancellor Angela Merkel “insecure” and referred to her as “Teflon” because of her penchant for avoiding political controversy.

He described the foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, as “incompetent, vain and critical of the United States.”

The public embarrassment prompted questions from the media and some German politicians about whether Mr. Murphy should be recalled to the United States. Mr. Murphy expressed regret that the comments were made public, but refused to apologize and said, “I’m not going anywhere.”

“At the end of the day, the buck stops with me,” he told Der Spiegel, the most widely read magazine in Germany. “I worry about my people. They have done nothing wrong. I am not going to apologize for one speck of what they’ve done.’’

Within diplomatic circles, many saw Mr. Murphy’s remarks as common chatter in confidential cables. The German government, while publicly displaying irritation, never asked for another ambassador, according to former White House officials who would only discuss internal diplomatic matters on the condition of anonymity.

“The thing with cables, they all carry the ambassador’s name, but they aren’t necessarily things he wrote,” said Karen Donfried, a former official with the National Security Council. “I remember it being a kerfuffle at the time, but I don’t recall it as having lasting damage for him.”

In some ways, the WikiLeaks crisis may have helped elevate Mr. Murphy’s profile, making him a familiar face. Bild, Germany’s highest-circulation tabloid, began featuring him as a boldfaced name spotted at upscale, celebrity-stocked parties. Photos appeared of Mr. Murphy and his wife, Tammy, on the red carpet at film festivals.

Mr. Murphy dressed his children in local soccer jerseys and participated in a pickup soccer match with German politicians. He invited German reporters to the embassy to view the artwork he and his wife had selected. And he was instrumental in bringing Jon Bon Jovi — a friend for years — to perform at a festival commemorating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.

“It was not a cakewalk in his time as ambassador and I thought he handled it extremely well,” Ms. Donfried said.

If Mr. Murphy’s role as ambassador produced more public insights than he would have preferred, his long tenure at Goldman Sachs remains largely opaque. The investment firm’s culture of secrecy makes many current and former employees reticent to talk in depth about colleagues or the company’s inner workings.

Mr. Murphy, who received an undergraduate degree from Harvard and a master’s in business administration from the Wharton School of Business, began as an intern at Goldman Sachs in 1982, and was hired by the firm a year later. He rose quickly, eventually becoming head of Goldman Sachs Germany in Frankfurt, responsible for establishing a beachhead in a country that often preferred doing business with local banks.

Mr. Murphy assembled a team and demanded that they all learn to speak German, even though banking business was mostly conducted in English. He played a key role in signing a major German client, Deutsche Telekom, and his success earned him a spot on the bank’s lucrative managing committee.

It also led him to Hong Kong, as president of Goldman Sachs Asia, where he helped secure $4.2 billion in underwriting for an initial public offering of China Telecom, which was considered a landmark achievement in the privatization of a Chinese national company on the international market.

But deals made by Goldman Sachs under his watch in Asia also drew scrutiny. The firm had been working to take the state oil company, China National Petroleum Corp., public. But the oil company had international associations that ran afoul of American regulations, especially its dealing with the government of Sudan at the time of the genocide in Darfur.

As a solution, the bank worked with the oil company to spin off a domestic entity, PetroChina. But it remained dogged by ties to China National, attracting protests and scrutiny from members of Congress. When PetroChina finally went public in 2000, its initial public offering, promoted by many at Goldman Sachs as one of the biggest in history, fell short of projections.

Mr. Murphy had left his role in Asia before the PetroChina initial public offering was finalized and his part in the deal remains murky. Peter Rose, a former senior manager at Goldman Sachs, said that Mr. Murphy was instrumental in “starting the process,” but said he left his post in Asia before it moved forward.

Henry M. Paulson, who was Goldman’s chief operating officer at the time, also said “I don’t recall his involvement with the PetroChina I.P.O.”

As the campaign for governor nears its end, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, the Republican, has used the deal involving PetroChina, as well as others, to attack Mr. Murphy, demanding he release his “Goldman Sachs client list.”

Mr. Murphy’s campaign has declined to comment in any detail on his Goldman Sachs tenure. However, in a separate interview, he said his years at Goldman and as ambassador were assets.

“I see that this is a state in crisis and the economy is broken,” he said. “I think there are things that I learned while I was there that actually matter and are applicable to what we need to do in the state.”

Mr. Rose, Mr. Paulson and other senior managers at Goldman Sachs, described Mr. Murphy’s time at Goldman in the same way others described his performance as ambassador: highly energetic and engaged, skilled at leading conversation and public speaking.

At Goldman, he was known to hold “one conversation” dinner parties at his house, orchestrating the discussion and calling on people to answer questions.

Mr. Paulson recalled a time when he leaned on Mr. Murphy’s public speaking ability and it did not go as planned.

“Phil is a terrific public speaker so after I had become the head of the investment banking division in 1990, I had Phil giving me some tips on delivery at the banquet after the year end conference,” Mr. Paulson said. “I am a teetotaler and Phil, who is not, left his glass of vodka next to my glass of water on the podium. When I mistakenly grabbed his glass to chug some water I thought I was going to die. And when I next opened my mouth to speak nothing came out.”

Those who worked with Mr. Murphy in Germany and Asia said he enjoyed socializing.

“The holiday parties are legendary,” Mr. Rose said, citing a costume party where he mingled with senior Goldman managers while dressed as Buzz Lightyear of “Toy Story.”

In an interview with Laura Ingraham on Fox News last night, the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, said “the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War,” a statement that would shock, among others, the founding fathers. After spirited debates at the 1787 Constitutional Convention, they included Article 1, Section 2, Paragraph 3 in our Constitution, which said each slave, for legislative representation and taxation purposes, counted as three-fifths of a person. That provision is known as the Three-Fifths Compromise, a term that clearly states that Northerners and Southerners were, in fact, quite able to reach weird compromises on slavery.

But our country’s tortured attempt to find some kind of balance on whether it was right to enslave African-Americans wasn’t limited to the Three-Fifths Compromise. To argue that the Civil War came about because Americans couldn’t compromise on whether black slaves were truly people or not would require us to ignore at least six other major compromises on slavery, from the first fugitive slave law in 1793, which said that escaped slaves in any state could be caught, tried and returned to their masters, to the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which allowed residents of the two territories to vote on whether to allow slavery. Slaveowners and abolitionists compromised on slavery over and over again, throwing black people’s rights onto the bargaining table like betting chips in a casino.

The Civil War ended slavery, but the legacy of all the prewar compromising on black people’s rights sparked new fights: the fleeting freedoms of Reconstruction; the punishing hand of Jim Crow; the limited triumphs of the civil rights movement; the quiet indignities of practices like racially restrictive covenants, which allowed homeowners to place terminology in property deeds to restrict ownership by race; and redlining, which reduced the value of homes in black neighborhoods compared with their white counterparts.

In the 1970s, President Richard M. Nixon opened a new front on the compromising with his war on drugs. One of his top advisers admitted to a reporter in 1994 that they had designed the war to target blacks and hippies, and it resulted in a large spike in the prison population, which took away many black people’s right to remain physically free.

And in 1973, the Supreme Court decided that school financing systems that relied on property taxes and therefore favored wealthy districts over poor ones weren’t unconstitutional. This decision, in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, allowed districts to refuse to fix the continuing financial effects of housing segregation.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

Photo

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

Ferguson deemed the latter to be of such importance in the club’s 2008-09 season that at one point he anointed him a contender for player of the year in England. The great Liverpool side of the late 1980s boasted Steve Nicol; the Ajax team that swept through Europe in the 1990s could call on Ronald de Boer.

To a manager, versatility was an asset; to a player, it was an advantage. Steve Watson, who played in every outfield position for both Newcastle United and Everton, knew his flexibility made him “ideal cover” as a substitute, but always felt it gave him “a much better opportunity of getting into the team.”

In recent years, however, utility seemed to have fallen out of fashion. When clubs can name at least seven substitutes, rather than three, for every game, managers had no need to reserve a space on the bench for someone who could cover anywhere.

As squads grew, too, managers learned to favor expertise. Most elite teams employ two specialists for every position, with those positions ever more tightly defined. Few would expect an attacking midfielder to slot into a holding role, much less play at fullback.

In many ways, José Mourinho encapsulates this thinking. In the spring of 2016, when he agreed to replace Louis van Gaal at Manchester United, Mourinho commanded the club’s executive vice chairman, Ed Woodward, to sign four players, each of them designated a specific role: Paul Pogba, Eric Bailly, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

“As you know, especially the ones with more vision, I am a manager that likes specialists,” Mourinho explained at the time. “I am clear with my approach and model of players.” At most, he said, he likes “one or two multifunctional players,” because “you always need someone that can give you a hand.”

In such an environment, then, it should be no surprise that players are increasingly keen to define themselves as specialists. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, for example, cited a desire to play in his favored central midfield role when he joined Liverpool, and Aaron Ramsey made the same request to Arsène Wenger, the Arsenal manager, with more success.

“Some guys, they only want to play in one position,” Guardiola, now the Manchester City manager, said recently. “They say that they are not comfortable in another one.” Soccer, it seems, no longer has much room, or much appetite, for the jacks-of-all-trades.

Guardiola, however, was speaking immediately after his team had beaten Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, thanks in no small part to the performance of Fabian Delph — who has spent much of his career as a midfield player — at left back.

“He showed us,” Guardiola said. “It’s not easy when a manager gives you an opportunity to play in a position you’ve never played before, so it means a lot. I’m so happy for him.”

It is the same across Manchester at United, where Mourinho, for all his professed preference for specialists, is enjoying no little success with Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young, brought up as wingers, as his two fullbacks. At Liverpool, midfielder James Milner was deputized as a left back for much of last season.

It is not just fullbacks, though. At Barcelona, Javier Mascherano, a defensive midfielder for Argentina, plays in central defense, while Sergi Roberto has won praise for his ability to fill as many as eight positions.

Bayern Munich uses Javi Martínez as a defender and a midfielder, while Guardiola’s intervention ensured Philipp Lahm was reimagined as a midfielder rather than a defender in the final years before his retirement. David Alaba is most often used as a left back but can play across the midfield, too.

In attack, if anything, versatility is even more of a prerequisite, among both the elite and the lesser lights. When Stoke City signed Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting this summer, it was his ability to play across the front line that persuaded the Stoke manager, Mark Hughes, to make his move. He had specifically commissioned his scouting team to find a forward comfortable in several roles.

To some, in fact, soccer is moving beyond the traditional, tight definitions of positions. Modern systems and tactics demand that players fill any number of roles during any given game, shifting between duties as the situation demands. “Who even decides the positions?” Jurgen Klopp, the Liverpool manager, said. “If you are a left back, maybe you started as a left winger. A central defender might have started as a No. 6.

“We play sometimes with wingers, but really only when we defend. It is quite fluid. I am not interested in positions: only when we are defending, and in terms of the distances between players.”

It is much the same message many young players are given during their education. “There are different, and continually evolving, systems and styles at the highest level,” said Joel Waldron, the manager of Everton’s youth academy, among the most prolific in England. “We feel it is important that we develop players who are tactically flexible.”

That process involves playing young prospects in as many positions as possible: not just within games, Waldron said, but during coaching sessions designed to “expose them to a variety of selected positional roles and responsibilities,” and in the classroom, too. “As the boys get older, we supplement their learning with video sessions,” Waldron said.

There is an element of pragmatism behind all this; as Waldron noted, many of his graduates will make their debuts in “unfavored” and occasionally unfamiliar positions. But mostly it is a philosophical choice.

“It’s important we have a curriculum that is conducive to developing players who understand the breadth of roles they may be asked to fulfill at first-team level,” he said. “Though understanding a wide range of roles must not be to the detriment of being outstanding at some or all of them.”

That was Enrique’s secret, of course: He was a master of every position he played, not simply a place-filler. It is the model, more and more, that all teams are trying to follow in an age when fluidity is paramount, when managers require players who can adapt to any system they choose. They need players who can play anywhere, who can do anything.

But Mr. Xi’s lofty vision clashes with a harsh reality across much of rural China. In many villages, young people have gone, leaving older residents to fend for themselves. Disparities in education, health care and social services remain stark.

Even as Chinese cities have turned into playgrounds for the nouveau riche and the swelling ranks of the middle class, nearly 500 million people, or about 40 percent of China’s population, live on less than $5.50 per day, according to the World Bank.

“The whole idea of socialism was that all Chinese would have a reasonable living standard,” said Kerry Brown, a China scholar at King’s College London. “The nagging concern is that the Communist Party has created billionaires and a strong middle class, and yet there are still a lot of poor people. That seems to be a massive contradiction.”

As China works to modernize its economy, it faces the reality that the world’s newest superpower remains a developing nation with a huge poverty problem. Experts say that a slowing economy and loss of manufacturing jobs could add to strains on low-income families, undermining Mr. Xi’s vision.

Under Mr. Xi, who has played up an image as an Everyman, the fight against poverty has become a national mantra. The state-run news media routinely shows Mr. Xi visiting poor villages, sampling the food and water and checking on the health of residents. The evening news is filled with tales of rejuvenated communities, and villagers-turned-entrepreneurs heaping praise on Mr. Xi and the government for providing loans and new apartments.

On Wednesday, during a speech marking the beginning of his second five-year term as party leader, Mr. Xi described eradicating poverty by 2020 as one of his chief priorities, vowing to “leave no one behind in the march toward common prosperity.”

Mr. Xi has also used the fight against poverty to strengthen China’s global alliances, financing programs in Africa and Southeast Asia, and urging the world to learn from China’s experience.

Now Mr. Xi faces pressure to deliver.

“Xi Jinping is a prisoner of expectations,” Professor Brown said. “His problem is not the fears of Chinese people but the hopes of Chinese people.”

While international organizations like the United Nations and the World Bank have praised the government’s work in helping hundreds of millions of Chinese rise out of poverty in recent decades, some experts worry that Mr. Xi’s plan is more about making headlines than bringing lasting change to poor communities.

Some say the government’s focus on 43 million people is too narrow, noting that millions more live just above the official poverty line in conditions that are not much better. Others say that by concentrating on rural areas, Mr. Xi is neglecting the plight of the urban poor, many of whom are rural migrants.

“The government’s initiatives sound good,” said Qin Gao, a professor at Columbia University who studies Chinese social policy. “But the question is how to sustain poverty reduction. Some people may be looking to quick fixes rather than really addressing poverty.”

Mr. Xi has instructed officials to focus on alleviating poverty in rural places like Chashan, where farming conditions are poor, access to basic social services is limited and residents struggle with heart disease and other ailments without a clinic nearby.

Photo

For centuries, Chashan, nestled in the mountains about 6,400 feet above sea level, has been home to farmers who plant wheat and yams and raise pigs and sheep on dry terrain.

The government is trying to turn the village into a tourist destination, but so far only a trickle of visitors have come. The town is hard to reach and lacks modern facilities.

Many residents said they had virtually no income and that subsidies from the government were inadequate.

“There’s no way out,” said Li Chao, 70, a farmer who has struggled with blood clots in his legs. “I can’t earn any money.”

Li Zhi, the trash collector, relies on donations from the few tourists for food and clothing. A calligraphy banner reading “Wealth will come” hangs in his home. He said he remains dubious that he will ever be able to buy his own clothes.

“It’s impossible to eliminate poverty,” he said.

The government has used a variety of approaches to help bring people out of poverty, devoting tens of billions of dollars to the effort and more than $370 billion in loans. Local officials, who are judged partly on their success in improving living standards, are working feverishly to meet Mr. Xi’s deadline.

Some villages have experimented with rural cooperatives, allowing families to raise production by pooling labor and resources. State-owned banks have provided microloans to help villagers tap into China’s e-commerce boom by selling embroidered dresses and other goods online.

But the hardest work remains ahead. As many as half of the 43 million people who are officially classified as in poverty could be disabled, according to the government. The campaign must also move into areas that have been chronically poor for generations, including many that are home to ethnic minorities.

Officials in these areas are resettling villagers near cities in government-provided apartments, sometimes against their will. They are handing out cash subsidies to disabled residents. And they are following Mr. Xi’s call for a “targeted” approach, tracking the progress of individual residents on giant bulletin boards in town centers.

Corruption has emerged as a problem, with more than 1,800 people having been investigated last year for embezzling antipoverty funds and related crimes, according to official statistics. Scholars have also cast doubt on the reliability of some data, saying some local officials appear to be understating poverty rates amid intense pressure to meet Mr. Xi’s targets.

Then there is the fact that Mr. Xi’s campaign is not focused on urban areas. There are more than 200 million rural migrants in China’s cities, where many struggle to receive education, heath care and other benefits because the local government does not consider them residents. Some fall into unemployment or bad health and live in squalid conditions.

“This is a very big hole in the overall picture, which the government rarely addresses,” said Philip G. Alston, a scholar and adviser to the United Nations who issued a report this year on extreme poverty and human rights in China. “The reality is that many of them are living in extreme poverty.”

On a street corner in downtown Beijing, Gu Xin, 63, sat on a flattened cardboard box begging for money. Mr. Gu moved to the city from central China six months ago, only to find himself unable to get steady work after his back was injured in a construction accident.

As he bowed to passers-by, a propaganda sign flashed in the background: “Without the Communist Party, there is no new China.” Mr. Gu said he had no choice but to ask strangers for money so that he could pay medical bills and support his family.

Shepherds tend their flock while young men hunt wild game, fish along ancient tributaries or kayak over rapids. This pleated landscape of rolling hills and jagged mountains is most verdant in spring, when the junipers are full, the grass a vibrant emerald.

These quiet moments and images are not often associated with Iraq. But the Kurdish region, in the country’s northern reaches, is home to such reprieves. Beyond the oil fields of Taqtaq and Kirkuk, far east of Mosul and many miles north of Baghdad, the semiautonomous region often feels timeless and progressive, restive and at peace.

What the Vietnamese photographer Lam Duc-Hien first imagined of Iraq before traveling there on assignment were the usual media tropes from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq — tanks and violence, surges and refugees. Mr. Lam, who was working for nongovernment organizations and a French newspaper, said he had never heard of the Kurdish people, who by then were fleeing Saddam’s oppressive and violent Baath Party. But after he settled down in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a region he documented for more than two decades, he found the country to be vastly different than what he had expected.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.

Over the years he has lived and worked there, he often traveled with the peshmerga, the Kurdish military, while on duty and off. “When I spend time with them, we always go to the mountains,” he said. “For me, it is like coming back to the 19th-century, because we are fishing with Kalashnikovs. For me, it’s incredible.”

Often referred to as a people without a country, the Kurds have for many years sought refuge in the mountains that abut Turkey and Iran. “I focused specifically on different ethnic groups and different religions in Kurdistan,” he said. “It’s small place, but it is very diverse.”

The robust culture of daily Kurdish life is captured in Mr. Lam’s photographs, a collection that stretches from the 1990s through to the war against the Islamic State. The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said. “I spend more time with them than taking pictures of them.”

A child leans in for a kiss from his little companion beneath a tree in the village of Badawan; a group of women in traditional Kurdish dresses dance atop a mountain plateau; families gather on the first day of Eid al-Adha to break the Ramadan feast at the grave of a loved one. “Each time I get back here,” Mr. Lam said, “I feel like I have a link with the people.”

Photo

Though Mr. Lam’s images sometimes show refugees and internally-displaced persons living in camps within the Kurdish region, he often shied away from the violence that has wracked the region and nearly divided the country, choosing instead to focus on the vitality of the people, not their blemishes.

Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq. He has heard whispers of secession since 1991. “One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.

But that dream has become a nightmare for many following an independence referendum in September. Disputed areas controlled by Kurdish forces were reclaimed by the Iraqi army. Flights were suspended to and from the region. A number of Kurds have since been killed or maimed in clashes with federal forces.

Photo

The recent infighting reminded Mr. Lam of a time when, during travels in the areas outside the Kurdish region, he lost that sense of fellowship — and safety — he had felt among the Kurdish people. After two bombs exploded in Baghdad’s Sadr City in 2013, with corpses littering the streets as he worked, Mr. Lam reluctantly fled the country.

“When you get involved with the Kurdish soul or friendship,” Mr. Lam said, “it’s very difficult to get out.”

He returned to Erbil soon after.

Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

In declaring the opioid epidemic a public health emergency last week, President Trump promised that the federal government would start “a massive advertising campaign to get people, especially children, not to want to take drugs in the first place.” But past efforts to prevent substance abuse through advertising have often been ineffective or even harmful.

Perhaps the most famous American antidrug advertisement featured a sizzling egg in a frying pan to the sound of ominous music and a stern voice-over warning, “This is your brain on drugs.” A sequel to this ad featured Rachael Leigh Cook smashing an egg and the better part of a kitchen to dramatize the impact of heroin.

Many other ads denouncing drugs and emphasizing their destructive effects — as in the “Just Say No” campaign — appeared regularly on television and in print beginning in the 1980s. Most of them were funded by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which received hundreds of millions of dollars a year from Congress for such campaigns.

Visually dramatic though the ads were, evaluations of them were deeply discouraging. The billions spent from the late 1980s through the mid-2000s at best had no effect on drug use, research shows. At worst, exposure to the campaign might have actually increased the likelihood of adolescent marijuana use. A study of over 20,000 youths 9 to 18 found that those who had been exposed to more antidrug ads expressed weaker intentions to avoid marijuana and more doubts that marijuana was harmful.

Why was the original campaign such a failure? In part it suffered from perverse incentives. Congress provided substantial money for the ads and was intensely interested in them at the height of the so-called war on drugs, creating internal pressure to make the ads appealing to members of Congress. But while ads that lectured or scared people about drugs might have seemed compelling to the modal member of Congress (a 60-year-old white male), they did not necessarily dissuade drug use by adolescents.

“The biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm,” Mr. Trump wrote.
Much of the talk on Capitol Hill centered on whether Congress needed to prevent Mr. Trump from firing Mr. Mueller.
Senator Lindsey Graham was one of two Republicans who hastily introduced bills aimed at adding a layer of job security for Mr. Mueller in August.
“I don’t feel a sense of urgency, no, I don’t,” Mr. Graham said on Tuesday.","Most unnerving for many here was the realization that Mr. Papadopoulos had been secretly arrested three months ago and cooperating with prosecutors ever since. Former colleagues sought to remember contacts they had with him, either last year when he was reaching out to the Russians or in recent weeks when he was working for the authorities.

“Is there a darker cloud over the Trump presidency? The answer is yes,” said Ed Rogers, a prominent lobbyist and White House veteran of two Republican presidencies. “Is it a thundershower or a hurricane setting in? Nobody knows.”

Mr. Trump argued for drizzle, dismissing Mr. Manafort’s indictment on charges of money laundering and foreign lobbying as unrelated to the campaign and belittling Mr. Papadopoulos as a nobody. “Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday in his first comment on the foreign policy adviser he once called an “excellent guy.”

Instead, as he has done repeatedly in recent days, Mr. Trump sought to turn attention to Democrats, pointing to the resignation of Tony Podesta, the powerhouse Democratic lobbyist who also faces scrutiny by Mr. Mueller and whose brother, John D. Podesta, was Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman.

“The biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm,” Mr. Trump wrote. “What he know about Crooked Dems is earth shattering. He and his brother could Drain The Swamp, which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled. Fake News weak!”

In a city where everything seems to break down along party lines, reaction to the indictments was no different. “If you’re a never Trumper, or if you’re with the media or a Democrat, this just confirms your wildest fears that Vladimir Putin is now running the White House,” said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. “But if you’re a Republican, you don’t see that this advances the narrative at all.”

Senator John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, sounded ho-hum, saying the charges claimed tax fraud and lying to F.B.I. agents. “If those allegations are true, you’ve got to wonder how those individuals made it through the birth canal, because it was bone-deep stupid,” he said. “But I don’t know what they have to do with President Trump’s campaign.”

Other Republicans appeared eager to skirt the issue. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, shut down questions related to the case at a news conference on Tuesday. “The special counsel has his job to do, and we’re going to concentrate on what we’re doing here in the Senate,” Mr. McConnell said.

Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Judiciary Committee chairman, slipped past a stand of flags to leave a news conference Monday through the back door rather than take questions about the investigation, although he later spoke with reporters about the case.

Much of the talk on Capitol Hill centered on whether Congress needed to prevent Mr. Trump from firing Mr. Mueller. Senator Lindsey Graham was one of two Republicans who hastily introduced bills aimed at adding a layer of job security for Mr. Mueller in August. In the months since, the legislation has stalled, despite Democratic prodding.

“I don’t feel a sense of urgency, no, I don’t,” Mr. Graham said on Tuesday. “This is something manufactured by the people in your business. I haven’t seen anybody in the White House say anything to suggest there is a reason Mr. Mueller needs to be dismissed.”

Mr. Grassley was indignant at the question. “It’s ridiculous for anybody to be asking me about firing,” he said. “That’s not an issue in the White House.”

The administration acknowledged that the investigation was disrupting its agenda. “It is very distracting to the president, as it would be to any citizen, to be investigated for something, while at the same time trying to carry the weight of what being president of the United States means on his shoulder,” John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, told Laura Ingraham on Fox News on Monday night.

He suggested the investigation might wind down. “It should wrap up soon,” Mr. Kelly said. “I mean, it would seem that they’re toward the end of the witness pile and I don’t know how much longer it could possibly go on, but we’re in great hopes that it wraps up.”

That seemed to rank optimism over experience, given past investigations involving other presidents. Veteran lawyers said Mr. Mueller’s inquiry could last for months if not years.

After venting on Twitter in the morning, the president tried to refocus attention on his tax-cutting package set to be released this week. Hosting business leaders at the White House, Mr. Trump said he wanted the House to pass the bill by Thanksgiving and the Senate by Christmas, a blindingly quick schedule for such major legislation even without the shadow of scandal.

“Every president, Republican or Democrat, always has distractions,” Jay Timmons, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers and one of Mr. Trump’s guests, said afterward. “That’s where leadership really counts. Leaders are able to focus on more than one thing and this president is focused — I think rightly so — on what it takes to grow this economy and create more jobs.”

But the investigation, coupled with the dysfunction and polarization in Washington, makes the chances of passing major tax legislation by the end of the year problematic. “No one on Capitol Hill expects that to occur anytime soon,” said Jim Manley, a longtime Senate Democratic aide. “And in the meantime, they’re once again in a position where all these things are going to pile up.”

The president and Congress have until Dec. 8 to agree on spending bills to keep the federal government from closing down and have a limited window beyond that to raise the national debt ceiling to avoid a default. Mr. Trump and lawmakers are also at odds over legislation to prevent the potential deportation of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.

“The partisan in me wants to get another tub of popcorn and another glass of wine and watch how it all plays out,” Mr. Manley said. “But the former staffer in me is anxious to see this darkness leave so we can get back to legislating. I see nothing but chaos from here on out.”",A Capital Consumed by Talk of Scandal and Suspicion,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/us/politics/trump-russia-inquiry.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

As Christmas approached that year, the family didn’t have the heart to celebrate.

The Genzolis went out to the orchard soon to discover that somebody had decorated the tree with homemade Christmas ornaments.

“We don’t know who it was,” said Ms. Genzoli, “but it kind of started from there.”

One February, Danielle’s first grade teacher had her students create laminated hearts that they hung from the tree for Valentine’s Day. It was festooned for St. Patrick’s Day and Easter.

At some point, Danielle’s grandfather and great-uncle began running electricity out to the tree so they could add lights. People sometimes left notes with remembrances of Danielle.

Right now the tree is decorated for Halloween.

David Genzoli said he was driving a tractor in the orchard last Saturday, when he saw an older woman hanging a small cellophane pumpkin on the tree. He wandered over.

The woman told him she had been touched by the story in the Bee and that in February she had lost her son, a father of two girls aged 3 and 5.

Inside the pumpkin were notes written by the girls to their father.

It’s gas tax hike day.

After much wrangling and debate, the price of a gallon of gas is rising 12 cents.

For a typical car, that could mean roughly $2 extra per fill-up. But don’t expect to notice the difference right away.

As it happens, the tax increase is happening on Nov. 1, the same day that California gas stations switch each year to a cheaper winter blend of gas.

The cost of a gallon of gas typically drops as much as 10 cents with the changeover, said Jeffrey Spring, a spokesman for the Automobile Club of Southern California, which opposed the gas tax.

From the consumer’s point of view then, the tax hike may appear to be canceled out.

“I don’t know if they timed it this way,” Mr. Spring said. “But it’s smart.”

The tax increase is part of legislation intended to raise more than $5 billion a year over the next decade to help fix the state’s roads and bridges.

Gov. Jerry Brown signed it in April.

But the wrangling may not be over. Republican leaders are fighting hard to dismantle the law.

He was not going to leave the question of his sexuality to guesswork or rumor. He thought this was very enlightened, a gay pop singer just integrated into stardom without the waves and the hand-wringing and the controversy. The handful of out gay pop stars before him — including his idol, George Michael — mostly endured lengthy “are they or aren’t they?” periods before they publicly acknowledged that they were gay. Banking on pop stardom as your whole and complete admitted self wasn’t something that happened every day.

“IN THE LONELY HOUR” was a little more than a half-hour crying jag about longing for a man — a straight, married one he was in love with whom he never so much as kissed. Nearly every song was about this: “Stay With Me,” the sad song about wanting a man to stay even when it’s clear he’s not in love; “Good Thing,” the sad song about deciding that he’s stayed too long waiting around — that one begins with a vision of him getting mugged outside the man’s door and dying in his arms like Éponine. And, on the deluxe edition of the album, a cover of Whitney Houston’s “How Will I Know?” which was not a sad song until he sang it.

He told Rolling Stone that he “had to be careful” so that straight people could sing along with his music, too. “I am not Sam Smith, the gay singer,” he said at the time. “I am Sam Smith, the singer who happens to be gay.” He gave an interview where he talked about Grindr and Tinder, the hookup apps, and how sad it was that all the possibility behind love and serendipity came down to a swiping culture, and saying this offended some in the gay community too. He accepted the Oscar for best original song for “Writing’s on the Wall,” from “Spectre,” the James Bond movie, referring to an article he’d read in which Ian McKellen had “said that no openly gay man had ever won an Oscar. If this is the case — even if it isn’t the case — I want to dedicate this to the L.G.B.T. community all around the world.”

Well, he woke up the morning after the Oscars to an assassination’s worth of ridicule, including from an openly gay man who had won an Oscar. The Verge called Mr. Smith’s statement “vague” and “inaccurate,” saying, “If you’re going to stump for a cause on stage, you need to come correct.” Gawker, in an essay about Mr. Smith’s “gay conservatism,” wrote, “His philosophy is, in short, to be gay, but not too gay.” Sure, he quickly realized, the Oscar thing was wrong — he’d meant to say that there’d never been an openly gay lead actor winner — but the other stuff: why was it taken so badly? So what if he didn’t like hookup apps? Why was that surprising? Hadn’t people seen him, dressed like a 1950s lounge act, complete with a pompadour? Hadn’t they heard his retro soul? What exactly about him seemed modern? So what that he wanted his music to be a universal experience? He never said he was the spokesman for gay people.

The vitriol of the Oscar incident surprised him. His heart was clearly in the right place. He was a proud gay man. How could that not mean anything? “I’m not the most eloquent person,” Mr. Smith says now. “I didn’t get the best grades in school. I mean, I’m just good at singing.”

It felt like he was getting hammered every time he opened his mouth. All he wanted was to remind people that love is love is love, particularly his brand of young adult love: heart-eye emoji love, cupid-arrow love, the love from “The Notebook” and “Titanic.” That’s how big love is. Once again, on his favorite subject, he pretend-faints on the couch in swoon and desire. He clutches his heart and makes his eyebrows almost touching a near-steeple of longing. This was the thing we all had in common. Why talk about the things that make us different?

YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND what it was like for him. Mr. Smith was raised in Great Chishill, a village an hour and a half from London with a population of less than 700. He wore a full face of makeup to school — to Catholic school — and fake eyelashes, too, and elaborate arrangements of flowers pinned to his lapel, along with the occasional all-over sprinkling of glitter. Some kids were mean to him about his sexuality, but it was the making fun of his weight that bothered him. His sexuality was not a negotiation; his weight was.

He grew up with two younger sisters in a pink house; there’s a tattoo of its address around the C6 vertebra of his cervical spine. His bedroom walls were painted a shiny gold and his bed had a red silk duvet. He applied cheap, clumpy mascara each morning and on the gold wall next to his mirror, he dabbed his mascara wand to rid it of excess. One day, in detention, someone told him about dream boards, and so he spent the hour making one to put up on his bedroom wall. There was a sketch of a Grammy there. He drew the back of his head performing to an arena.

He came out when he was 10. Literally someone at school said, “Are you gay?” and he said, “I am!” His mother said she’d known since he was 3. He’d always had very short hair, but when he was young, he used to make the gesture of pushing strands behind his ears, like it was long, or flicking imaginary hair off his shoulder. In the car, when the windows were open, he would pretend he’d gotten a hair stuck to his lips and pick it away.

And it was all totally fine, even when it wasn’t, even when the first boy he had a crush on said nasty, homophobic things to him that still make him cry. But he had a lot of friends. There were no other (openly) gay boys. He fell in love with straight boys. He could barely picture a future when one of them would look back at him with lust or sexual curiosity, let alone love. And still he was happy. He grew comfortable in his longing. People sometimes made fun of him, but so what? He understood who he was. He thought that if you know who you are, and if you’re confident in that and you don’t make a big deal of it, people will accept you.

His parents signed him up for voice lessons when he wouldn’t stop crooning throughout the house. He had a manager from the age of 11, then another, then another, each promising him that he would become very famous very soon. It didn’t happen. He moved to London, where he tended bar. One day, he met Jimmy Napes, who introduced him to his eventual managers, who in turn introduced him to the electronic duo Disclosure, with whom he recorded the vocals for “Latch,” Disclosure’s single — and his breakout — in 2012.

The rest — the album, the tour — it all happened fast. He woke up the day after the Oscars, saw the chaos online, apologized, and slunk off. Why wasn’t this working? People loved his music, but they were turning on him. He couldn’t bear being thought of as a traitor to his people — he was so open about everything! Sure, he didn’t like Tinder, and it’s mostly true that he didn’t like it because it isn’t romantic, but it is maybe truer that he was afraid he would be swiped away. Believe it or not, he did use Grindr, but he didn’t want random hookups so he arranged dinner dates with several very confused men.

Then, one day, he went to Australia for a show, and afterward had a talk with his publicist there, a gay man who lives with his partner of 18 years. The publicist took Mr. Smith to the Stonewall, a gay bar in Sydney, for a drink one afternoon. He decided to help educate him, taking him to a gay bookshop. “My mind just went,” Mr. Smith said. He read the memoir “Holding the Man,” which blew his mind. He watched “Paris Is Burning.” He still has “Tales of the City” on his night table. Next, the Australians introduced him to drag. They crammed his feet into thigh-high, high-heeled boots. They draped a red sequin dress over his 6’2” body. They had barbecues and played Madonna and danced.

“I lived in a village in the middle of nowhere as an openly gay man from the age of 10 years old,” Mr. Smith said. “I didn’t meet another gay man until I was 19 when I moved to London. I just went gay clubbing a few times with some straight friends and with some girlfriends of mine, and then I became famous. I never got an opportunity to find my people in the gay community and find my friends.”

He decided not to drink or smoke or be with a man, even just kissing, for a long time, while he was figuring all this stuff out. He was trying to understand how he fit into the gay community at large. “I just really sat with myself and got to know myself and started to just like my stretch marks and not be so hard on myself and stop watching perfection everywhere.”

He began seeking out the art that struck him as truest. He stopped watching “Titanic” and “The Notebook.” O.K., he watched “The Notebook” again last week but he also watched “Weekend,” the gay indie film, so it balanced out.

Then he found George Michael. He had always been a fan of his music. He was 15 when he saw him in concert. But now, reading and watching interviews with him in his last years, after Mr. Michael came out, Mr. Smith found him to be a great mentor. “I just feel like I’m going to offend someone every time I open my mouth,” he said. “I feel like George Michael had a way of being authentic to himself and honest in a way that was warm.”

Back at the interview in West Hollywood, he leaned back on the couch, looked up at the ceiling and blew a stream of breath out through pursed lips. “People forget but no one learns about gay history in school. Nothing. So I didn’t know anything about my history as a gay man and then words like ‘spokesperson’ are being thrown at me when I’ve just brought out my first album,” he said. “It scared me because I was like, I don’t know anything about being gay, really.”

He realized two things. One was that he was ready to make a second album. The other thing was that coming out as gay wasn’t enough. He now understood that every visible gay person still had a leadership role. He now understood that he wasn’t operating on his own, but that he lived in context to a community whether he’d realized it or not. No, having come out as a gay singer, he realized it was now time to come out as a gay man.

Photo

THE NEXT AFTERNOON, Saturday, he rode to the Hollywood Bowl, where he was performing at a breast cancer benefit that included Lorde and Kesha and Harry Styles. He was wearing a pastel, airbrushed silk, short-sleeve button-down shirt and olive silk pleated pants. “I can tuck them in now,” he said proudly. “I’m a tucker.”

Since he left the public eye for the studio, which is where he’d been since the end of his last tour, in 2015, he’d lost a ton of weight by doing something called “intermittent fasting,” meaning he waits five hours after eating to eat again (and which is also called not eating between meals). A trainer. A nutritionist. He stopped eating bread. Probably being a man in his 20s helped.

His transformation was sparked by seeing a tabloid picture of himself on the beach without a shirt, and that was not the self he wanted to be. He was also concerned about his health. He gets acid reflux, and it’s bad for his voice. He knows other stars “mime,” as he puts it, but he doesn’t want to. His voice is his whole thing, his whole bag of tricks.

Mr. Smith had also cut off his pompadour, which he called his “quiff,” his short hair now reminiscent of George Michael’s on his 2011 Symphonica tour. His hair was thicker than it’s been recently. After the Oscars, it had started falling out from stress, he thought. He began to use Rogaine and take Propecia, and it worked. Men need to talk about hair loss, he thinks.

If “In the Lonely Hour” was the myopic look into the heart of a boy helplessly in love, then the new album, “The Thrill of It All,” is about a man who turns his gaze outward. “Midnight Train” is a sad song about ending a relationship that was inspired by friends; “Palace,” a sad song about whether or not love is worth it if it ends; “HIM,” a sad story of an imagined boy in Mississippi coming out to his father. Some of the tracks are about Mr. Smith himself, including “Burning,” a sad song about pining for a man who has left; and “One Last Song,” a sad final ode to the man who was the subject of “In the Lonely Hour.” The new album won’t be a surprise to anyone familiar with the first one: The old-timey soul is still there. Mr. Smith decided long ago that his voice was the instrument: melisma, whispered baritones, surprise out-of-nowhere ultra-high falsetto, even a haunting, beautiful croak of longing sprinkled here and there. It is still prime music for “having sex with your sadness,” as Mr. Smith said.

But he can now recount actual relationships in his songs. He’s still never been in the kind of magical “Notebook” love he longs for, he said, but about a year ago, he had a five-month relationship that took three breakups before the breakup took and which is the subject of “Too Good at Goodbyes,” the first single off the new album, which is in the Billboard Top 10 as of this writing. He’s been dating the actor Brandon Flynn, from Netflix’s “13 Reasons Why,” seeing where that goes.

Backstage at the Hollywood Bowl, Mr. Smith drank a cup of Throat Coat, and then took a Gaviscon for acid reflux. He sang through a cocktail straw while holding up a tissue to make it move with his breath to strengthen his throat muscles, something he learned from an opera singer. He motor-boated his lips. He was ready for the show.

The next day, the news media would pick up a statement he made about feeling as much like a woman as a man, and social media would get on him for being too casual about gender fluidity when he identifies as a gay man. One day he will get it right, he said, his eyes shiny with big, sad Sam Smith tears,

“The only thing I’d like everyone to know is I’m really sorry if I say the wrong things,” he said. “I don’t want to offend anyone and my intentions are genuinely pure and good. I’m still trying to figure [expletive] out and I’d like to be treated like a human. If I make mistakes don’t kill me.”

Yes, one day. One day when he’s old, he said, he’s going to know what to say. He’s going to be someone who can figure out how to think his words through before he says them. He’ll get older, and as he does, he’s going to stop using his falsetto so much, he said. It’s a sound that can’t age with you, and even on the new album, he’s started to sing more in his regular voice. Eventually, he’s going to be like Joni Mitchell and just use the lowest registers. He’s going to come out on stage like Joni on the cover of “Both Sides Now,” with a glass of wine and a cigarette (yes, by then he’ll be drinking and smoking again). He’s looking forward to that, when his voice starts to get breathy and broken like Judy Garland’s when she sings “Over the Rainbow” at Carnegie Hall. Eventually he’ll retire and open up a flower shop in the English countryside, he said. He’ll get really into cooking, he’ll have a pet pig named Kong or maybe Flo, and he’ll live forever happily, surrounded by his husband and children and his closet full of drag. His funeral will call for fancy dress, and the men will have to dress like women and the women will have to dress like men. Drag queens wearing big black hats with veils and high heels will carry his coffin out. Then disco music will play. That’s nice, isn’t it? Yes, it’s nice to think of a time when he’ll know for sure just how to be.",The Tear-Stained Confessions of Sam Smith,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/arts/music/05sam-smith-new-album-the-thrill-of-it-all.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle.
PhotoFew have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said.
A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.
“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Photo

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

Photo

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Photo

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

A woman stands inside a subway car, her face bisected by a pole. Commuters at Grand Central are rendered as dreamlike silhouettes. Cars, pedestrians and buildings come at you at crazy angles. A man stepping into a Checker cab pauses to look at a dog, which stares back.

The city he chronicled between 1977 and 2001 explored neighborhoods that held steady when the city’s future looked grim. Over that period, his work became more political — as in the 1982 photo of four black nannies pushing white toddlers in strollers. But there is also a crazy, funny beauty too, which is no accident.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

THURSDAY PUZZLE — I will not hold a grudge against the constructor Jacob Stulberg just because he made a puzzle that was bound to make me remember how bad I am at this particular kind of theme. The reason I will not hold a grudge is because the theme itself is very clever and almost a parody of the form. And I can appreciate a good parody.

But if I were going to hold a grudge, this would be the perfect puzzle over which to do it.

Today’s Theme

Because rebuses. I just don’t see them. It’s a flaw in my brain. My best piece of advice to anyone who asks how to recognize whether there is a rebus element in their crossword is to say that if you find yourself cursing at the puzzle because none of your expected answers fit, it is more than likely that it’s a rebus theme. And even with that bit of knowledge in my brain, I still miss them.

The trick today is to make your way down to the revealer at 59A as early as possible, and hope to high heaven that you know your active volcanos. MT. EREBUS is the southernmost active volcano (You’re welcome) and if you break the name up, you might get MTE REBUS.

The screams seemed too vivid from the start, too visceral to belong to crowds celebrating a crisp and sunny Halloween in Lower Manhattan. The tragedy had unfolded in just minutes, and for hours and hours it remained too senseless to believe.

Sirens and police tape surrounded the white pickup truck that a 29-year-old assailant transformed into an instrument of terror when he began hitting cyclists and joggers along the West Side Highway bike path. A mangled school bus sat next to it.

Bodies lay strewn along the way. For those who encountered the scene on Tuesday, the aftermath was as confusing as it was gruesome.

Tom Kendrick, 36, a lawyer from the West Village, said he was jogging uptown just north of Chambers Street when he began noticing the mayhem on the bike path. He saw a battered body and bicycle in the bushes alongside the path. Farther along he found three bodies close together, also battered cyclists.

Photo

“I approached to see if I could help and they did not need help — they appeared to be dead,” Mr. Kendrick said. “They were bloody and unconscious, with some limbs hanging,” he added. “It was gruesome. It was grisly. It was surreal.”

“These people were gone,” he said. “I’m in shock. I’m looking at dead bodies.”

At least eight people lost their lives in what was the deadliest terrorist attack to strike New York City since Sept. 11, and about a dozen more were injured.

Hiro Kimura, 15, a sophomore at Stuyvesant High School, said that he and his friends first heard “a big car crash.” Then they heard shooting.

“We saw flocks of children running” from the scene, Hiro said.

The New York City police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, detailed a preliminary timeline of the violence, which he called an “act of terror,” in a news conference Tuesday evening that shed light on the scene.

The white truck entered the bicycle path alongside West Street by Houston Street at 3:05 p.m. and drove south, hitting pedestrians and cyclists along the way. The runaway truck, labeled with Home Depot logos, drove 20 blocks before ramming into a school bus at Chambers Street. Two adults and two children who were on the bus were reportedly injured in the crash.

Photo

The 29-year-old man driving the truck exited the vehicle with what appeared to be two handguns, Mr. O’Neill said, at which point a uniformed police officer approached the man and shot him in the abdomen. Early reports suggested that the assailant may have yelled “Allahu akbar,” Arabic for “God is great,” at some point after exiting his vehicle. A paintball gun and a pellet gun were recovered from the scene later.

Many of the children attending schools in the area were horror-struck.

The mother of a 13-year-old girl who came face to face with the suspect said her daughter was “too traumatized” to talk. The woman, her daughter and two other children were being escorted from the scene by a police officer. She did not want to give her name or her child’s name for security reasons, she said. The girl’s face was red and tear-streaked, and she had curled her hands into the sleeves of her blue hooded sweatshirt. Her mother said she was a student at Intermediate School 289 on Warren Street, yards from where the truck came to a rest after crashing into the school bus.

“She was right in front of the shooter. He had two guns,” the woman said of her daughter. She said she did not remember much else.

Olivia Raykhman, 14, glimpsed the wrecked school bus in the immediate aftermath of the episode. “They were sawing through a school bus window. They broke all of the windows and were trying to pull kids out. There was a man covering a child with a blanket. There was one kid who was stuck,” she said.

“We ran into the building and they told us to hide,” said Olivia, a freshman.

She took shelter in what she called a “cellar” with a group that was at first just 15 people. Around 50 more soon joined.

As Olivia and her friends ran inside, students on the upper floors of Stuyvesant had been shooting video of what happened in the street. Videos posted on Facebook and then circulated over Snapchat showed what appeared to be the suspect, a bearded man in dark clothing heading down the street with his weapons in his hands, next to a white pickup truck.

Adria Menezes, 45, said she saw the suspect firing one of his weapons at cars on West Street.

Ms. Menezes had just arrived at Public School 89, which shares space with I.S. 289 on Warren Street, at 3:03 p.m. to pick up the two children she babysits for, when she suddenly heard cars crashing on West Street and saw a yellow school bus “drive like crazy.”

Then roughly 15 feet away, she saw a tall man with dark hair and wearing a hat. He was walking quickly, screaming something indiscernible, and shooting at the cars, causing further mayhem.

“When I saw the man shooting at all the cars, we threw ourselves to the ground,” she said in Spanish by phone from inside the school, which remained locked down.

Marie Hui was visiting New York City with several friends from Vancouver, and had been in SoHo shopping before the attack. Several of her friends were at the 9/11 Memorial at the time, where they sheltered in place.

“We’re from Vancouver,” she said. “This doesn’t happen over there.”","A Mangled School Bus, Bodies Everywhere; ‘It Was Surreal’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/nyregion/nyc-scene-terror-attack-truck-witnesses.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

FRIDAY PUZZLE — There are two kinds of people: Those who like their crosswords knotty and difficult, and those who pray for mercy just so they can make some headway. Eventually, and with enough practice, the mercy-seekers become the challenge-seekers. And then they claim that they have given up on doing the early week puzzles, because those are way too easy.

It’s a fair point. For some solvers, the Monday and Tuesday puzzles don’t present much of a challenge, but those puzzles are not really for them. They are for the people still getting the hang of solving, and for the ones who can appreciate a good, straightforward theme. They are for those who like to start their week on a positive note, with a win.

So the solvers who crave more of a challenge wait all week for the Friday and Saturday puzzles — they might even indulge themselves in a Thursday, with its gimmicky themes — and claim to be disappointed if the Friday is “too easy” for them. Don’t say “No, I would never do that”: I’ve seen you on Twitter.

I have news for those solvers: Today’s puzzle is not that hard, which, of course, is a totally subjective call. I didn’t find it hard. But I’ve also been solving every single day for a very long time. Maybe I’m just on the wavelength of the constructor, Peter Wentz. But it’s easy to make this puzzle fall. Sorry. Maybe Saturday will be harder.

SPECIAL POST — A team from Japan won the 26th World Puzzle Championship, which ended Saturday in Bangalore, India. The U.S.A. and Germany finished second and third.

The three-day competition — a companion to the World Sudoku Championship, held earlier in the week — drew 169 contestants from 27 countries. Over three days, the competitors tackled more than 300 pencil-and-paper puzzles involving logic, numbers and pictures. There were no crosswords or other puzzles testing vocabulary or knowledge, so everyone could compete on an equal basis irrespective of language or nationality.

In some rounds, lasting up to 60 minutes, the puzzles were so challenging that many contestants scored zero points. Three example puzzles from the competition, not the hardest ones, appear below.

MONDAY PUZZLE — Jay Kaskel takes us another step closer to the most boo-tiful day of the year with a puzzle about a stereotypical witch.

First Witch: When shall we three meet again

In thunder, lightning, or in rain? Second Witch: When the hurly-burly’s done,

When the battle’s lost and won. — Macbeth, Act I, Scene 1

Today’s Theme

Four phrases are reinterpreted as things that might be in the life of a witch. For example, witches cast spells, so “Computer help for a witch?” would be SPELL CHECK. Similarly, WARTS AND ALL at 41A is “How one might be forced to accept a witch?” because a witch has at least one wart. (Practitioners of witchcraft, please do not write to me objecting to this. I know you do not have warts. We’re talking about the cartoon stereotype.)

Tricky Clues

61A: If you are knowledgeable about poetry, KEATS might have been a gimme. I had John DONNE at first, but I know enough about cooking to know that a “Stir-fry vessel” is not a WOD, it’s a WOK.

19D: We’re talking about slang for money here. “Bill worth 100 smackers” is a C SPOT, which must be very rare, since multitudes of relationship experts have written about trying to find it.

Constructor Notes

I originally set out to create a Halloween-themed puzzle that incorporated all the familiar characters associated with Halloween: witches, ghosts, skeletons, vampires and zombies. But the theme never felt tight enough. After a while, I settled on a witch/BROOM HILDA-themed puzzle and sent it off. While Will liked the idea, he felt young solvers might not be familiar with the character. So not only did I have to replace BROOM HILDA at 58-Across, I had to do some serious re-cluing (CHARM SCHOOL, for example, was clued as “Educational institution attended by 58-Across?”) Here’s where things got tricky. One of the original theme entries was WITCH HUNT, which meant I couldn’t use the word “witch” in the clues. “Educational institution attended by a Halloween broom-rider” just didn’t do the trick. It felt too forced. In the end, I simply dropped WITCH HUNT as an answer, and thankfully Will was O.K. with the puzzle having just four main fills. As always, I can’t tell you how much of a treat it is to see one of my puzzles in The New York Times.

Mohammed Fairouz, Psalm 14

At its heart, Mr. Fairouz said, this psalm is about “believing in something bigger than yourself,” even while living in divisive times.

In writing his setting, “Diversions,” he felt the psalm’s message was ultimately one of hope. The piece unfolds in three parts: a poem by Michael Bembenek Jr. that opens darkly (“Fresh corpses line the boulevard”); text by Isaac Newton, including his famous phrase “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants”; and Psalm 14, which ends with the feeling, Mr. Fairouz said, that “if you look at the world we’re living in today, the opportunities are tremendous.”

William Knight, Psalm 21

Mr. Knight, a British tenor who grew up singing sacred music, is familiar with this psalm. Still, he said, “it was interesting to read it and interpret it in a new way.”

He found himself drawn to the psalm’s message about eternal life — something that “can be achieved through remembrance,” he said — and the concept of divine right. He thought of world leaders using religion to justify their actions, but pointed to the second half of the text, which depicts a wrathful God who has more power than any king.

Zad Moultaka, Psalm 60

Reading this psalm for the first time was difficult for Mr. Moultaka, a composer from Lebanon now based in Paris. “There is a lot of violence in it,” he said, pointing to moments in the text where, for example, God tramples down enemies.

Mr. Moultaka said that while revisiting this psalm for his piece, “Sakata” (its text in Aramaic), he interpreted it as: “We are lost, and we have to find a new way, maybe, to relate and find a new space together.”

Nico Muhly, Psalm 63

Choral music, especially sacred music, is Mr. Muhly’s home base. “It’s the first music that I loved and the first music that I made,” he said, adding that he enjoys setting psalm text “because it can bear the weight of a variety of musical interpretations.”

His setting, “Marrow,” takes its title from the line “My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and fatness.” Anchoring the piece is a musical texture in three-quarter time — “a kind of wet aquatic idée fixe,” as Mr. Muhly called it.

Isidora Zebeljan, Psalm 78

Ms. Zebeljan, a Serbian composer, translated her psalm into Portuguese because “there is a very special melody in this language,” she said. The words fit naturally into the tone of her piece, which she described as a slow dance.

Even though the psalm deals in holy fury, Ms. Zebeljan said she wanted the music to reflect the line in which God remembers that people are “but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.” She said she tried to capture that breeze as “a brief dance of changing and passing,” like the danse macabre that closes Ingmar Bergman’s film “The Seventh Seal.”

Caroline Shaw, Psalm 84

This psalm opens with one of the most memorable lines in Brahms’s “A German Requiem”: “How beloved is your dwelling place.” Ms. Shaw, who wrote the beginning of her setting like an Anglican chant, made sure to preserve that line while treating the rest of the text more liberally.

Ms. Shaw said the psalm made her think of the immigration crisis, which she alludes to her repeated use of the phrase “the sparrow found a house.” She added that she wanted to set that phrase “in a way that feels urgent and not calm.”

David Lang, Psalm 101

Mr. Lang, who describes himself as religious, rewrote the psalm for his setting, “if i sing.” The piece straddles the line between sacred and secular, as does “the little match girl passion,” his Pulitzer-winning oratorio inspired by Hans Christian Andersen and Bach’s “St. Matthew Passion.”

The psalm “is really like a bargain,” Mr. Lang said. “It’s like, ‘If I do this, will that work? Will you come to me?’” That question is present in nearly every line. By the end, it appears as a plea: “Come to me.”

Evelin Seppar, Psalm 129

“This is about overcoming difficulty,” Ms. Seppar, an Estonian composer, said of her psalm setting. “Something horrible has been done to you for a long time, but you haven’t given up.”

She aimed to create a dense, sea-like structure “with lots of voices, so that you can’t really tell what exactly is the harmony. I wanted this almost drowning feeling, that you’re in the water and it’s pulling you.”

Yet Ms. Seppar’s message is ultimately one of perseverance. “It ends in unison,” she said. “I don’t normally finish pieces like this, but after this turmoil it felt like clarity was necessary.”",Hear 9 New Psalm Settings for Challenging Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/arts/music/psalms-white-light-festival-lincoln-center.html

Julia Child’s time in France inspired her to capture the country through its cuisine, introducing French cooking to kitchens around the world. But it was that same French magic — and Ms. Child herself — that inspired her husband, Paul, to also capture the country, albeit through a different medium, photography. A new book lets him offer a personal glimpse into the world beyond the kitchen.

“There is this combination of intimacy and formal, rigorous design,” said Alex Prud’Homme, the couple’s grandnephew and a co-author of “France Is a Feast: The Photographic Journey of Paul and Julia Child.”

The Childs met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, leading them to various postings around Europe. But it was Paris, where they arrived in 1948, that captured their hearts.

“Apart from our official lives — cooking and government — the other things we do fall into fairly repetitive categories whose two main divisions are, being entertained and entertaining others,” Mr. Child wrote to his twin brother, Charlie. “Sometimes when we’re being entertained it isn’t people, but just Paris herself who acts as hostess.”

While Ms. Child took French cooking classes, and eventually began work on “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck, Mr. Child was engaged in diplomatic duties as a cultural attaché for the United States government. And he was rarely without a camera.

The photographs, taken between 1948 and 1954, focus on the beauty of postwar France. The perfectly-landscaped parks, the bustling waterfront in Marseille, the glow of Place de la Concorde at night, a cold fog settling over the Sacré-Coeur basilica. The shadow play on the grand entryways and the underpasses along the Seine.

But Mr. Child’s main subject was always his wife. Ms. Child in the kitchen; changing her clothes on the side of the road; legs propped up in a telephone booth; sunbathing in Cassis.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’Homme said.

The detail and expansive catalog of Mr. Child’s work raise the question: Did he have a sense that their lives would have a bigger impact than their immediate Parisian universe?

“He was an obsessive photographer and note taker, it’s almost like he knew back then that their lives were worth preserving for posterity,” Mr. Prud’Homme said. “It’s like they were leaving breadcrumbs.”

Mr. Prud’Homme helped Ms. Child write her memoir, “My Life in France” (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006), but he felt it wasn’t complete. That’s when Katie Pratt, a longtime family friend of the Childs and the book’s co-author, discovered a “Pandora’s box” of hundreds of black and white and color photographs, everything from surrealistic street documentary to formal portraits and landscapes.

Negatives were clearly labeled. Log books and letters provided a time frame, and were often accompanied by long letters detailing their routine: embassy comings and goings during the Cold War, their meals, the price of wine or the performance they saw the evening before. Everything was for the taking.

Mr. Child had a “distinct style,” Ms. Pratt said.

“His style as a visual artist, whether it was photography or other mediums, it was very important for him to have strong, well-organized, well-balanced compositions, often with perspective and depth,” she said. “There’s often a story going on.”

Mr. Child’s style was heavily influenced by artists living in France at the time. And as a cultural attaché, he quickly gravitated to the top artists of the day: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Edward Steichen were all friends of his. They even shared the same printer, using Pictorial Service owned by Pierre Gassmann in Paris.

“My interpretation was that Paul was a very independent-minded guy who really developed his own aesthetic, but he was swimming in the waters of these masters of 20th-century photography,” Mr. Prud’Homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off. But he always remained behind the camera.

“Paul and Julia, in their own ways, were really good teachers,” Ms. Pratt said. “They really cared about not only perfecting their craft and communicating it clearly with others. They put it to operational proof and shared it with others.”

“That’s something they learned while in the O.S.S.,” Mr. Prud’Homme said. “Don’t trust common wisdom, find out for yourself whether something works or doesn’t. That’s something they both did in their art, and cooking.”

But her father notes that she was exposed to serious reporting early on. They spent a month in Florida after Trayvon Martin was shot and killed by George Zimmerman and went to South Carolina after the massacre at a church in Charleston.

“We would have conversations, but I wish I could tell you I said, ‘Well, in journalism, here’s what we do,’” Mr. Lysiak said. Instead, Ms. Lysiak learned through exposure.

The family moved from New York City to Pennsylvania when she was 6, and soon after she started covering minor family events — she broke the news to her father, for instance, that her mother planned to buy a new car — writing the articles on notecards in crayon. But she quickly realized it “wasn’t getting me anywhere” and asked her dad if he could help her start a “real” newspaper. He agreed to handle the printing and the layout if she did all the writing and reporting.

She began by covering her block, then broadened to the neighborhood. Sometimes she gets stories from emailed tips, but mostly she rides around on her bike, asking people if they’ve heard of anything strange going on.

Ms. Lysiak started out charging $1 for a year’s subscription and had a few dozen subscribers; now her print circulation is close to 600 — $20 for a yearlong subscription — with hundreds of thousands of online views.

Ms. Lysiak is home-schooled and used to spend all her time reporting. “She’d leave in the morning, and we wouldn’t see her until the afternoon,” said Mr. Lysiak.

“Hilde Cracks the Case” is part of the Branches line at Scholastic, a group of early chapter books geared toward children 5 to 8 years old who are newly independent readers but not yet ready for conventional chapter books. It’s the brainchild of Katie Carella, a senior editor at Scholastic; before getting into publishing, she was a teacher, and she noticed a gap in the books available to her students who were burgeoning readers.

“I want to have a series that can reach every reader,” Ms. Carella said. “Kids at this level need to build their reading stamina and fluency,” and it’s important that they be allowed to “make their own reading choices.” The Branches line was first introduced in 2013, and now it includes 18 series (the 19th will be published in January), with 12 million books in circulation. “Hilde Cracks the Case” is its first mystery series.

When the real Hilde’s parents left New York, they thought they were putting journalism behind them. Mr. Lysiak had become disenchanted with the industry, so he left his job at The Daily News.

“When I saw her real passion, it brought my passion back,” he said, “because she does it so simply — it’s like who, what. The things that I used to go do before it got complicated.”

Despite earlier criticism, people in the town definitely take her seriously now.

“There are a lot of people in town that don’t like her,” Mr. Lysiak said. “ They want her writing stories about parades and promoting the town. But no, Hilde wants to report crime and scandal when she finds it.”

When new owners bought her Crown Heights apartment building a few years ago, Lisa Mathis feared that she might be pushed out of not only her eight-unit rental building, but also the neighborhood.

But even as Crown Heights — and her building — has become a destination for New Yorkers priced out of trendier parts of Brooklyn, Ms. Mathis has found a surprising kinship with her new neighbors, rather than a clash between old and new.

Ms. Mathis, 57, grew up at 80 New York Avenue. She went to P.S. 138, played handball across the street and got her first library card at the Brower Park Library. And some years later, after her marriage broke up, it was to 80 New York Avenue that she returned.

At first, she and her two children lived with her mother. Then the three-bedroom, one-bath apartment across the hall opened up. That was 12 years ago.

“I was so happy,” Ms. Mathis said. “It’s homey, peaceful, and my mother was across the hall. The kids were small then, and there were lots of meals that I didn’t have to cook.”

Rent was $1,200, which was “a lot,” said Ms. Mathis, a court clerk specialist at New York State Surrogate’s Court, but “you sacrifice.” When they moved in, she could afford only beds and curtains at first.

“In my family, you have to get the curtains right away. You can’t have people looking in at you. Maybe it’s a Southern thing,” said Ms. Mathis, whose mother was raised in North Carolina.

Several months later, she bought a dining set. Several months after that, they got a couch. But if the rent was a stretch, it was worthwhile. She loved the hardwood floors and the dining room, which is divided from the living room by pocket doors. And the building felt like home, with her mother across the hall and her aunt living upstairs.

So did the neighborhood. “I see faces that I grew up around,” Ms. Mathis said.

The only thing she lacked was a lease, but over the next decade the rent never went up. Then, in late 2014, the building sold to new owners, Mendel and Chananya Gold, who offered tenants buyouts to get them to leave. Those who stayed endured months of construction as the other apartments were renovated.

Reached on the phone, Chananya Gold said, “No comment. No comment at all.”

Ms. Mathis didn’t want to move. Her son, Derek, a graphic designer who is now 26, was living with her, and she suspected that her daughter, a college student, might need to move back in when she graduated. She also knew that her aunt, who intended to stay in the building, had a rent-stabilized unit, so she went to see a lawyer. (Her mother had since retired to North Carolina.)

The lawyer discovered that not only was Ms. Mathis a rent-stabilized tenant as well — lease or no — but she had been charged more than the legally allowable rent all those years. It felt like a victory. But before long, she realized that fighting for her right to stay was only the first of many skirmishes.

In the fall of 2015, the heat never came on. The landlord told tenants the heating system needed to be replaced, but the winter passed without heat — at least for the rent-stabilized units: The five market-rate units were renovated with working heat that was billed to those tenants.

Image Pocket doors separate her living and dining rooms. Credit Robert Wright for The New York Times

The heat didn’t come on in Ms. Mathis’s apartment the following year either, and a solution that involved installing furnaces in the rent-stabilized apartments didn’t pass muster with city inspectors. By now, Ms. Mathis has spent two winters in an unheated apartment, huddled under electric blankets.

“The first year without heat, my aunt was 79. To do that to someone of that age — I might have considered leaving if she wasn’t in the building,” Ms. Mathis said. “But she’s on fixed income and wouldn’t be able to stay in the neighborhood if she left. She and my mom were really close, so I felt like I have no choice but to stay and fight.”

She continued: “It really affects the quality of life not to have heat: It’s hard to clean. It’s hard to do anything. I like to cook and have family over, and I lost two Thanksgivings and two Christmases.”

Image The kitchen in Ms. Mathis’s three-bedroom apartment. Credit Robert Wright for The New York Times

There have also been frequent gas leaks, Ms. Mathis said, one of which revealed that one of the five market-rate apartments in the building had been paying for the cooking gas of the three rent-stabilized units. Another leak caused the building’s hot water and cooking gas to be shut off for a month last spring.

As a result of the shared hardships, the tenants — old and new — have banded together to file several lawsuits against the landlord, including for the illegal destabilization of the renovated apartments, which have been carved into four- and five-bedrooms that rent, per room, for nearly as much as Ms. Mathis pays for her entire apartment. And last spring, they organized a rent strike.

“God has been very benevolent in putting the people in this building together,” Ms. Mathis said. “Some are good at social media, some are good at writing, a few people are union organizers and some are arts-inclined — they made the signs that we put up in the window.”

Ms. Mathis is optimistic that she’ll finally have heat this winter, after reaching a housing court settlement with the landlord. Large metal heating ducts, installed the previous winter, hang from her hall ceiling, and the furnace that was once mounted inside her front door has been moved to the basement.

The yearslong ordeal has had one unexpected benefit. “We’re a very tight-knit building now,” Ms. Mathis said. “I don’t know if we’d have this kind of connection otherwise.”

Organizers are expecting a sizable contingent from Houston’s large Indian community to travel more than 200 miles to Dallas, in part because Houston’s Diwali celebration on Oct. 7 was smaller this year in the wake of the floods.

“We have so many friends there,” said Satish Gupta, who founded the Dallas mela. (Its supporting organization, the DFW Indian Cultural Society, is aiding hurricane relief efforts.) “It’s not even a question. Whatever help we can provide.”

This means, too, that the coming event could be the largest in the history of the city’s festival.

One of its central components — and the backdrop to every other activity at the mela — is the dizzying array of foods, with special care taken to make sure that every region’s Diwali-specific treats are represented. This multicultural spirit is what sets the Dallas mela apart from those in other cities.

“In a single festival, you can eat Gujarati snacks while listening to performances in Tamil, and watching South Indian dance,” said Kalpana Fruitwala, an organizer.

For the event, Subash Chander, the owner of the popular Bombay Sweets & Snacks in suburban Irving, creates a pack of Bengali mithai, milk- and nut-based sweets. It includes neon-pink chum chum (coconut-coated milk solids), and gulab jamun (syrup-soaked balls of deep-fried batter) filled with a silky mixture of cream and ground almonds.

On a recent afternoon, Mr. Chander was deeply concentrating on an enormous mixing bowl heated to exactly 450 degrees, making sure the milk and shredded coconut for the chum chum were being churned to the ideal softness. If the temperature rises even a few degrees, or the mixture is stirred for too long, he said, the treat loses its luxurious, slightly bouncy texture.

“You have to be very patient,” Mr. Chander said. “Only after 18 years have I figured out the secret to making chum chum this soft.”

The response at the festival makes all the care worthwhile. “All night, we have this big line that wraps around many times,” he said. “It got so long that the organizers had to install stands for people to wait.”

Lalith Thota, who is busy preparing to open the restaurant India 101, also in Irving, will make jangiri, a thick, patterned fritter soaked in sugar syrup (with a shape not unlike that State Fair of Texas staple, funnel cake) that is eaten widely in Andhra Pradesh.

Nearby, at the restaurant Bawarchi Biryanis, Anil Sukkagopal said his Diwali booth will serve Mysore pak, a rich, crumbly pastry made of ghee and chickpea flour that has its origins in Karnataka.

“We want to create an environment like the street markets in Bombay,” Mr. Sukkagopal said. “We’ll be yelling and shouting about our food. People will be crowding around. It’s a sensory experience.”

At his booth, Naga Kolli, the owner of the South Indian restaurant Saravanaa Bhavan, in nearby Plano, will supplement a menu of dosas and idlis with payasam, a comforting, saffron-stained milk pudding popular in Tamil Nadu, where the dish is often consumed first thing in the morning on Diwali, right after prayers.

Testing the recipe in the restaurant’s kitchen, a cook tossed in just-fried cashews and raisins into a bubbling stainless steel vat filled with milk and vermicelli noodles, to add richness and crunch.

“We make it because it is made especially for Diwali in certain places,” Mr. Naga said, adding with a laugh, “The only disadvantage of payasam is that because it’s more of a liquid, people have a hard time walking around the festival with it.”

The Dallas celebration has come a long way since 1994, when it began as a house party with about 50 guests, bootleg fireworks and catered food at Mr. Gupta’s home in North Dallas.

Photo

When the party started to outgrow his backyard, Mr. Gupta came up with the idea to turn it into a public, community-run mela, a type of traditional festival with food and music that occurs in every village throughout India during Diwali. “We wanted to bring that flavor of home to Dallas, to give our children a closer connection to Indian culture,” he said.

For the inaugural mela in 2006, Mr. Gupta ambitiously decided to book Texas Stadium in Irving. “Everyone was making fun of us,” said R.K. Panditi, a festival organizer who oversees the food vendors. “We knew we wouldn’t fill it, but I thought maybe we’ll get 15,000.”

More than 38,000 people showed up, creating a major traffic jam on the freeway, and an hourlong wait just to enter the stadium. The food ran out within the first hour, so Mr. Panditi had to ask two nearby Indian restaurants to stay open until 4 a.m. to feed the crowds.

Since 2011, the festival has taken place in the Cotton Bowl, which has a capacity of nearly 100,000, and the added allure of being a citywide landmark and the site of the state fair.

Photo

The festival has played an enormous role in expanding the impact of the Indian community, whose population in the Dallas area alone more than doubled between 2000 and 2010. There is now a petition going around the Coppell Independent School District to make Diwali an official school holiday, and last year a seasonal Diwali postage stamp had its Texas debut at the mela here.

On Saturday, vendors will arrive at the Cotton Bowl at 10 a.m. and not leave until well after midnight, when stalls once loaded with chum chum and biryani have been completely emptied of their goods.

Staying until the very end is well worth it, though, as the closing event of the mela is an impressive display of fireworks shaped like diyas (lamps, a symbol of Diwali), synchronized to a colorful laser show and Bollywood music — a favorite tradition of Mr. Gupta’s ever since that first house party.

“Without the fireworks,” he said, a sparkle in his eye, “there is no Diwali.”

For people who cannot fathom sitting out a haunted house, it’s important not to coerce your more cautious friends into doing something they do not want to, Dr. Kerr said.","When you go to a haunted house, you’re grappling with a conflict, Dr. Zald said: The experience could either be fun or terrifying, and how you weigh that balance could depend in part on dopamine levels. “Having a greater amount of dopamine pushes someone to pursue the goal of excitement,” he said, “whereas someone who basically has less dopamine is more likely to hold back and say, ‘No, this isn’t worth it to me.’”

Socially, we get cues about how to respond to fear from those around us, said Margee Kerr, a sociologist and author of the book “Scream: Chilling Adventures in the Science of Fear.” Early on, that’s taking notes from our parents about how to deal with distress. Later, experiencing stressful situations with others can cultivate social bonds.

Part of that has to do with emotional contagion, or a communal response to shared experiences, Dr. Kerr said. If your friend is captivated by the horror movie you are watching together, you process that by recreating the same feeling in your own mind, and that can bring you closer together. People also tend to hold onto memories of fear more intensely, she said, so if you have positive associations with a scary situation, like going to a haunted house, you’ll likely want to do it again.

Fear-seeking can also be a way of testing oneself. Josh Randall and Kristjan Thor, creators of Blackout, a haunted house experience that consistently tops rankings of “Most Extreme Haunted Houses,” said they see many people coming to their events with a goal of self-fortification. “It’s almost like a dare to themselves,” Mr. Thor said. “People want to be able to conquer something.”

For many, being scared is a jolting escape from daily life. When immersed in a scary situation, you can suspend your disbelief and live in the moment — and that loss of control can feel really good. This is key for Blackout, Mr. Randall said: “For a finite period of time, that audience member can turn off the real world, and live in a fantasy world.”

After talking with the experts, I was starting to see why some friends love getting spooked. But why do I hate being scared so much?

It could be because I was never exposed to horror movies or haunted houses growing up, so by the time I did experience these things, I was ill-prepared. It could be that the regions in my brain involved in coding fear and anxiety are more sensitive. Most likely, it is a mix of many different factors. Regardless of the reason though, “it’s perfectly O.K. not to like scary things,” Dr. Kerr said.

For people who cannot fathom sitting out a haunted house, it’s important not to coerce your more cautious friends into doing something they do not want to, Dr. Kerr said. “That can compound the fear, and make it even worse.” So, for any friends who were thinking of inviting me to the haunted house this weekend, save your breath — I have a doctor’s note.",A Scaredy-Cat’s Investigation Into Why People Enjoy Fear,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/science/why-do-people-liked-being-scared.html

WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, stripped a half-dozen scientists and academics of advisory positions Tuesday and issued new rules barring anyone who receives E.P.A. grant money from serving on panels that counsel the agency on scientific decisions.

The move will effectively bar a large number of academic researchers, many of them experts in fields ranging from toxicology to epidemiology, from advising the E.P.A. on scientific matters, since the agency is one of the largest funders of environmental research.

Mr. Pruitt was expected to appoint several industry representatives to the panels. He did not impose any new restrictions to prevent them from offering advice on environmental regulations that may affect their businesses.

In an announcement at agency headquarters surrounded by conservative activists and Republican lawmakers who have long called for an overhaul of the advisory boards, Mr. Pruitt said he made the decision to ensure the agency would receive data and advice free from conflicts of interest or any appearance of a conflict. He said that people currently serving on E.P.A. advisory boards had received $77 million in grant money over the past three years as they were issuing advice on policy.

On Monday morning, after America learned that Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and Manafort’s lobbying partner, Rick Gates, had been indicted and turned themselves in to federal authorities, the president tried to distance himself from the unfolding scandal. “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign,” the president wrote in one tweet. A few minutes later, he added, in another, “Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”

At almost the exact same time, news broke suggesting that the F.B.I. has evidence of collusion. We learned that one of the Trump campaign’s foreign policy aides, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his attempts to solicit compromising information on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. Despite Trump’s hysterical denials and attempts at diversion, the question is no longer whether there was cooperation between Trump’s campaign and Russia, but how extensive it was.

In truth, that’s been clear for a while. If it’s sometimes hard to grasp the Trump campaign’s conspiracy against our democracy, it’s due less to lack of proof than to the impudent improbability of its B-movie plotline. Monday’s indictments offer evidence of things that Washington already knows but pretends to forget. Trump, more gangster than entrepreneur, has long surrounded himself with bottom-feeding scum, and for all his nationalist bluster, his campaign was a vehicle for Russian subversion.

We already knew that Manafort offered private briefings about the campaign to Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The indictment accuses him of having been an unregistered foreign agent for another Putin-aligned oligarch, the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Trump wasn’t paying Manafort, who reportedly sold himself to the candidate by offering to work free.

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at the Leica store in New York. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

The city he chronicled between 1977 and 2001 explored neighborhoods that held steady when the city’s future looked grim. Over that period, his work became more political — as in the 1982 photo of four black nannies pushing white toddlers in strollers. But there is also a crazy, funny beauty too, which is no accident.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — If you were not aware what a Wall Street reformer might want, you will learn it today in Jules Markey’s puzzle. This was a nice midweek theme that kept its secret until the very end for me.

Today’s Theme

Mr. Markey offers us a list theme of phrases that feel fresh: Three of the four make their New York Times Crossword debuts today, as does the revealer. Hidden in each phrase is a word that can be used before the word “BANKS,” and solvers are directed to those words by the circled/shaded squares.

For example, at 17A, the answer to the clue “Weave or tailgate, say” is DRIVE RECKLESSLY. The revealer at 62A, BREAK UP THE BANKS, is a hint that the ultimate answer to 17A is RIVER BANKS.

Tricky Clues

1A/1D: Were you flummoxed by the “Drug referenced in ‘The Joyous Cosmology’ ”? Here’s how to solve that one: First, it’s only three letters, so that narrows things down quite a bit. Second, 1A is fairly easy: The famous LOCH Lomond is in Scotland. With the L in the first square, the answer has to be LSD.

18D: R.V. TRIP is a bit random to my ears, but I know people vacation in Winnebagos.

50D: I didn’t know the director Hal ASHBY, although I know the film “Shampoo” that he directed. I guessed at ASHER, realized it was wrong when I solved 70A’s YMCAS, and guessed again at ASHBY.

Constructor Notes

The idea for this puzzle came during the election season of 2016. The revealer was heard and seen quite often at many campaign rallies, and it’s 15 letters long! It was quite natural then to try to turn it into a puzzle theme. I first thought to use the names of some banks in phrases but found that really wasn’t working, so i quickly settled on types of banks instead. What you see are the theme entries I first came up with, I’m pretty happy with the 4-1; 1-2-1; 1-4; 1-2-1 break patterns. After acceptance, I sent Will a version with all the theme entries spanning the grid, but he felt the fill had been too compromised, so he stayed with this version. Thanks to Will, Joel and team for polishing it up. I hope it was a pleasurable solve.

Mr. Warner hammered his point with blown-up prints of some of the Facebook posts that circulated. One featured an illustration of Hillary Clinton in a fistfight with a picture of Jesus, an inflammatory ad aimed at riling up conservative Americans.

Several senators trained their attacks on Facebook on Wednesday for its inadvertent role in the Russian influence campaign, a repeat of Tuesday’s Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing.

“I must say, I don’t think you get it,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who was also at Tuesday’s hearing. “I went home last night disappointed. I asked specific questions, I got vague answers.”

Republican defense: Russians didn’t elect Trump.

Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Senate Intelligence Committee’s Republican chairman, began the social media hearing with what amounted to an extraordinary defense of the legitimacy of President Trump’s election, pushing back on a narrative he said had been propagated by the media that Russia’s efforts had delivered victory.

“A lot of folks, including many in the media, have tried to reduce this entire conversation down to one premise: foreign actors conducted a surgically executed covert operation to help elect a United States president,” Mr. Burr said. “I’m here to tell you this story does not simplify that easily.”

Mr. Burr noted that five times more ads were targeted to Maryland, a safely Democratic state, than Wisconsin, a swing state that Mr. Trump narrowly carried. He said that more ads were targeted to Washington, D.C., an overwhelmingly Democratic area, than Pennsylvania. And he said that of the $1,979 spent ads in Wisconsin, all but $54 was spent before the primary.

He went on, but the message was clear.

“This isn’t about relitigating the 2016 presidential election. This isn’t about who one and who lost,” Mr. Burr said. “This is about national security. This is about corporate responsibility. And this is about the deliberate and multifaceted manipulation of the American people by agents of a hostile foreign power.”

Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho, picked up the line of questioning, as he pressed social media executives on the content of Russian advertising.

“My view of this is this is a whole lot broader than simply the 2016 election,” he said.

The executives agreed that Russian efforts were geared more toward sowing social discord that advocating directly for Mr. Trump or against Hillary Clinton.

But as Democrats noted, discord helped Mr. Trump’s grievance-based campaign.

“What we’re talking about is the beginning of cyber warfare. What we’re talking about is a major foreign power with the sophistication and ability to involve themselves in a presidential election and sow conflict and discontent all over this country,” said Ms. Feinstein.

Facebook defends reasons for taking down ads.

As senators pressed Facebook’s general counsel, Colin Stretch, on Facebook’s role in the election, one of the hallmarks of Facebook’s explanation has been the issue of “authentic accounts.”

Since Facebook went public with its findings, the company’s reasoning for taking down more than 80,000 fake, Russian-linked ads, was not the type of content they posted, but because those responsible for them had misrepresented who they were when creating the accounts.

That distinction is key for Facebook. Outside of some parameters like nudity or incitement to violence, executives at the company are wary of becoming the arbiters of what content is or is not allowed on Facebook, fearing accusations of censorship.

“We don’t take for granted that each one of you uses Facebook to connect with your constituents, and that the people you represent expect authentic experiences when they come to our platform to share,” Mr. Stretch said in his opening remarks on Tuesday.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Burr asked if Facebook would have shut down the 470 Russian-linked accounts if they weren’t fake.

“Does it trouble you it took this committee to look at the authentic nature of the users and the content?” Mr. Burr asked Facebook’s general counsel.

Mr. Stretch didn’t directly answer. “The authenticity issue is the key,” Mr. Stretch said, noting that many of those accounts would have been shut down anyway because they violated other terms of service.

But ads were only one way Russia influenced the election.

Political ads are just part of the problem, Mr. Warner said at Wednesday’s first hearing.

Russian agents spread nonpaid content through the creation of pages on Facebook dedicated to hot-button issues like race. On Twitter, the Kremlin-connected internet Research Agency used automatic messaging tools known as bots that could quickly spread tweets through multiple accounts.

“For Facebook, much of the attention has been focused on the paid ads Russian trolls targeted to Americans. However, these ads are just the tip of a very large iceberg,” Mr. Warner said. “The real story is the amount of misinformation and divisive content that was pushed for free on Russian-backed pages, which then spread widely on the news feeds of tens of millions of Americans.”

Twitter is still lowballing Russian intrusion.

Earlier this week, Twitter, Facebook and Google revealed new information and numbers showing that foreign interference on their site was worse than they first reported. But the companies all stressed that the amount of Russian propaganda that reached users was just a sliver of the total amount of content their platforms produce every day.

But some lawmakers think the companies are holding back information.

Twitter said it identified 2,752 accounts controlled by Russian operatives and more than 36,000 “bots” that tweeted 1.4 million times during the election. The company had previously told lawmakers it found only 201 accounts linked to Russia.

The new numbers still seem low, according to Mr. Warner.

“I’m concerned that Twitter seems to be vastly underestimating the number of fake accounts and bots pushing disinformation. Independent researchers have estimated that up to 15 percent of Twitter accounts – or potentially 48 million accounts – are fake or automated,” Mr. Warner said in his opening statement.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Burr also noted the slow reaction by internet companies.

With Facebook’s acknowledgment that 126 million people were exposed to Russia-linked content instead of the 10 million people they originally estimated, “tells me that your companies are just beginning to come grips with the scale and the depth of the problem,” Mr. Burr said.

“Your actions need to catch up to your responsibilities,” he added.

Google defends its stance on RT.

For a second straight day, Ms. Feinstein asked Google why it continues to allow RT to continue to publish videos on YouTube even though a report from the American intelligence community has described RT, formerly known as Russia Today, as the Kremlin’s “principal international propaganda outlet.”

Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel, walked a fine line, saying that RT’s influence goes beyond merely YouTube; he noted that RT is available on cable and satellite television packages. It advertises in newspapers and can be found on hotel television channels.

Google has reviewed RT’s content and found that no violations to YouTube’s community guidelines, Mr. Walker said. He said that the company provides information about the “government-funded nature” of RT on Google — presumably on search results — and said it is considering expanding that to YouTube. He didn’t elaborate how Google plans to do so.

On Tuesday in a separate hearing, Richard Salgado, Google’s director of law enforcement and information security, said Google dropped RT from its top advertising tier because of “a drop in viewership” — not because of its content.

Ms. Feinstein said Google’s answers were unsatisfactory. She repeated an earlier admonition of the tech companies: “We’re in a different day now.”

The executives left a judiciary subcommittee wanting.

Top executives for the three companies appeared before a judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday armed with regrets and pledges to do better. The lawmakers appeared to be unimpressed.

Facebook came under particularly heavy fire, as senators from both parties pressed the companies on their sluggish responses.

“Why has it taken Facebook 11 months to come forward and help us understand the scope of this problem, see it clearly for the problem it is, and begin to work in a responsible way to address it?” Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, asked in one pointed exchange.

The senators also raised doubts that efforts outlined by the companies — Facebook, for instance, said that it would hire more than 1,000 people to review political ad purchases — would protect the United States from outside influence.

“I’m trying to get us down from La-La Land here,” said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. “The truth of the matter is, you have five million advertisers that change every month. Every minute. Probably every second. You don’t have the ability to know who every one of those advertisers is, do you?”

Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, pushed the executives to weigh in on legislation that would require the companies to report who funds political ads online. In response, they suggested voluntary efforts already underway but said they hoped to work with lawmakers on such requirements.

The House committee will release copies of the Russian ads.

The House intelligence committee is expected on Wednesday to publicly release much-anticipated copies of Facebook ads purchased by Russian-linked accounts.

The top Republican and Democrat leading the investigation, Representatives Mike Conaway of Texas and Adam Schiff of California, pledged to do so this month after a meeting with Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer.

A few of the ads have leaked out, and others have been described by people who have viewed them, but the release should help cast new light on the Russian efforts.

Facebook’s bullish posture to Wall Street.

Wednesday will be a particularly busy day for Facebook, which will also report its third-quarter earnings at 4 p.m. Eastern, around the middle of the day’s second hearing.

The company, which is used by more than 2 billion people worldwide, is expected to post stellar results, with revenues from advertising jumping 41 percent from the same quarter last year to $9.88 billion.

With its stock trading at a record high and the company’s market capitalization over $500 billion — more than the gross domestic product of countries like Columbia and Taiwan — Facebook’s business success clashes with the posture it will present to lawmakers.

To members of Congress, Facebook will be contrite and stress the challenges of fixing its technology to prevent abuse of its site by foreign governments. But to investors, the message this afternoon will be decidedly bullish.

That contradiction is at the heart of the problem Facebook is confronting. Its business model, all based on advertising, is largely automated and reward the most viral content, even at the sake of the public interest.

The problem is worse than originally thought.

Facebook, Twitter and Google said on Monday, before their testimony, that the problems on the platforms were much worse than initially disclosed, illustrating the breadth and complexity of Russian efforts.

According to testimony by the companies, Russian agents spread inflammatory posts that reached 126 million Facebook users, published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded more than 1,000 videos to Google’s YouTube service.

The latest disclosure will most likely serve to underline complaints among lawmakers that the tech giants have been slow to recognize and react to the significance of the Russian campaign.

Mr. Warner has been sharply critical of Twitter, in particular, telling reporters in September that the company’s initial efforts “showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is.”

On Wednesday, Mr. Warner and others are likely to bore into the details of the companies’ internal investigations, questioning their rigor, as well remedies the companies have already volunteered.

They will also want to hear about solutions to issues beyond the disclosure of paid political advertising, like the influence of bots and “organic posts” harnessed by foreign powers.

A broader review of the Seventh Fleet’s pace of operations, training, equipment and maintenance is to be released on Thursday.

Senator Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi, attributed the two fatal collisions to dwindling Navy resources in the Pacific, combined with judgment and training errors — a sentiment echoed by lawmakers as they left Tuesday’s private hearing.

“In general, we’re asking too few ships to do too many things,” Mr. Wicker said.

“We’ve deprived them of the funds to do it,” Mr. McCain said of the continuous operations in the Pacific. “We’re putting those men and women in harm’s way to be wounded or killed because we refuse to give them the sufficient training and equipment and readiness. It’s a failure of Congress. It’s on us.”

Already the fallout from the two fatal crashes as well as two others in the western Pacific this year, has been dramatic.

The commander of the Navy’s Pacific Fleet, Adm. Scott H. Swift, took early retirement after being notified that he was no longer in the running to take charge of the Pentagon’s overall Pacific Command, which would oversee any military operations against North Korea.

Vice Adm. Joseph P. Aucoin, the former head of the Seventh Fleet, based in Japan and the Navy’s largest overseas, was removed in connection with the accidents. The Navy’s top officer for ships worldwide, Vice Adm. Thomas S. Rowden, has also said he will retire early.

Several other senior officers in the Seventh Fleet chain of command, as well as the commanding officers of the Fitzgerald and John S. McCain, have also been relieved of their duties.

Even before the more comprehensive review was conducted by Adm. Phil Davidson, the head of the Fleet Forces Command in Norfolk, Va., urgent new orders went out in early September for United States Navy warships.

These directives included more sleep and no more 100-hour workweeks for sailors. Ships steaming in crowded waters like those near Singapore and Tokyo were ordered to broadcast their positions as do other vessels. And ships whose crews lack basic seamanship certification will probably stay in port until the problems are fixed.

These were all seemingly obvious standards, military officials said, except that the Navy rushed the remedies into effect only after the two deadly collisions in two months, despite repeated warnings about the looming problems from congressional watchdogs and the Navy’s own experts dating to 2010.","Navy Collisions That Killed 17 Sailors Were ‘Avoidable,’ Official Inquiry Reports",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/us/politics/navy-collisions-avoidable.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

June Robles’s disappearance was never solved, and as decades and generations came and went, the case became a mostly forgotten footnote in the annals of crime. The headlines disappeared, and so, too, did June Robles — at least from public view. For the next 80 years she led a reticent if not obscure life, never leaving the city where she was born.

She died in Tucson on Sept. 2, 2014, apparently of complications of Parkinson’s disease. She was 87.

At the time, her family placed a paid death notice in The Arizona Daily Star under her married name, June Birt, but apparently no news obituary — no coda to a spectacular case — was ever written.

The New York Times learned of her death late last month in an emailed inquiry from a writer who was researching another child abduction for a book.

“Little June” Robles, as she was invariably called, spoke to news reporters immediately after her rescue, but in subsequent years she never sat for a full-fledged interview. She wrote no memoirs. On anniversaries of the kidnapping, the case might be reprised in newspapers and magazines and on television news programs, but there was scant information about what had happened to her since. A lengthy wedding announcement in 1950 made no mention of her ordeal in the national spotlight 16 years earlier.

Photo

What had happened, according to a forthcoming book by Paul Cool for the Arizona Historical Society, was that after the tumult of her brief national celebrity, Ms. Robles was determined to remain inconspicuous from then on.

“That was the way she wanted it,” her son James Robles said in a telephone interview this week. “That was the way she wished it. That was the way it was meant to be.”

He added: “Most of the people who know about this are all dead, and I don’t know why it’s even news now. Most everyone connected with the case just wanted it to go away.”

June Cecilia Robles was born in Tucson on June 11, 1927. Her mother was the former Helen Mauler, from Kansas. Her father, Fernando Robles, was a former railway clerk who owned an electrical supply store. He was the son and a presumptive heir of Bernabe Robles, a Mexican-born descendant of Spanish conquistadors. Bernabe was 7 when he immigrated to the United States with his mother on a burro in 1864.

By 1934 Bernabe Robles had amassed a fortune as a cattle baron and entrepreneur. He had acquired vast tracts of Arizona real estate, initially to provide scarce water for the horses that powered a stagecoach line he also owned. As Tucson developed beyond its original borders, the value of his property had multiplied. That led some Tucsonians to speculate that the kidnappers had been enticed by his wealth.

The abduction occurred on the afternoon of April 25 as June was walking alone from the Roskruge public school to visit an aunt, according to court testimony. She was trailing behind her 6-year-old cousin, who had gone on ahead.

A man approached her. He said her father had asked him to give her a lift to his store. After some cajoling, she got into his car, a black Ford sedan.

Later that day, a local boy handed her father a ransom note. The boy said an unidentified man had given him 25 cents to deliver it. The note demanded $15,000 (about $300,000 in today’s money). Mr. Robles scribbled a reply — its text was not reported — and gave it to the boy to carry back to the kidnapper. According to the testimony, however, when the boy looked for the man, he was gone.

The next day, a second ransom note, signed “Z,” was delivered to June’s grandfather. The ransom demand had been reduced to $10,000. Fernando Robles and his twin brother, Carlos, the assistant Pima County prosecutor, scraped together the money, apparently after their father, Bernabe, had declined to contribute.

Meanwhile, a posse of hundreds of gun-toting cowboys, ranchers and Apache scouts scoured the rugged terrain on horseback. Bernabe Robles secretly consulted a psychic in Mexico. A plane scouted the 70 miles to the border and beyond.

“We have run down clue after clue, which has faded into nothing,” Tucson’s police chief, Gus Wollard, said.

Fernando Robles asked law-enforcement officials to suspend their search and to cancel a $1,500 reward so that he could deal with the kidnapper directly.

“Only one thing now is left,” he said in an appeal published on April 30. “I must get in touch with these people. I want my baby back.”

To prove that June was still alive, Fernando Robles urged her captors to send him the answers to four questions addressed to his daughter. One question was “What do you do with your bunnies in the morning?”

On Monday night, May 7, a third ransom note was slipped under the door of the county prosecutor’s office in the Pima County Courthouse.

“If you had listened to us, your child would be with you,” the note said. It was signed “XYZ.”

A week later, Gov. B. B. Moeur received an airmail letter postmarked Chicago. Inside was a crude map and directions to a site in the remote desert, about nine miles from downtown Tucson, where the sender said the Robles girl’s “body” could be found.

That prompted a search by June’s uncle Carlos Robles and his boss, Clarence Houston, the county attorney. It was Mr. Houston who, after more than three fruitless hours, stumbled over a mound of dirt covered with sagebrush, mesquite and cholla cactus. Beneath it, he discovered a perforated sheet of metal, which proved to be the top of a narrow, coffinlike underground cage.

“I was sure June was dead,” Carlos Robles told The New York Times. Inside, Little June looked up, dazed by the sudden sunlight and by her surprise liberator.

“Hello, June, do you know me?” Mr. Houston asked. “Are you afraid of me?”

“No, I’m not afraid of you,” she replied. “I want my mama.”

The girl was filthy, blistered by prickly heat and bitten by ants, her ankles chafed by chains attached to an iron stake. She said she had subsisted on fruit, bread and jam, potato chips and graham crackers that the kidnappers had left. She had made do with a ceramic pot for a toilet.

Immediately after her rescue, as she was escorted away, all she seemed concerned about was her report card, which she had left behind in her underground cell. “I went back and got it,” she told The Tucson Daily Citizen. “I wanted my mama to see it.”

Describing her abduction to British Pathé News, June said one kidnapper had threatened her. “He was going to spank me if I was going to cry,” she said. Her grandmother was quoted as saying, “The kidnappers said they would put a knife in her back if she cried.”

June’s rescue was trumpeted around the world. The New York Times reported the story as its lead article on the front page under a three-line headline stretched across four columns.

The kidnappers were never found. A local dance-hall operator, a friend of June’s father, was charged after his handwriting was found to be similar to that used in one of the ransom notes, but the case against him collapsed.

Tucsonians were filled with questions: Why had a ransom note been delivered to the prosecutor? Could June really have survived 19 days underground? Why didn’t her wealthy grandfather front the ransom? What was the Chicago connection?

In December 1936, after several suspects had been interrogated, a federal grand jury concluded that there was not enough evidence to accuse anyone. It described June’s baffling disappearance as an “alleged kidnapping.”

J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the F.B.I., apparently shared the grand jury’s skepticism. “We have had 36 kidnappings listed, and all of them are solved on our records,” he said.

Seeking to capitalize on the publicity, June’s parents hoped to send the girl on a vaudeville tour to raise $1,500 in reward money for the arrest of the kidnappers. But when they sought more, to pay for her education, Hollywood promoters balked.

June was enrolled in a Roman Catholic school, where she was escorted daily under guard. “I simply cannot bear to leave my children alone for a minute,” Helen Robles told The Tucson Daily Citizen.

June earned a degree in business administration from the University of Arizona in 1948 and, after graduation, worked for the school’s registrar.

The last time Little June was interviewed, in 1936, she said that all she had wanted was “to be a mother like my mother.” And that was what she became.

Her marriage in 1950 was to Dancey Birt, an aircraft factory supervisor at the time. He survives her. Besides her son James, she is also survived by three other children, Thomas, Bruce and Barbara; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.","June Robles Birt, Whose Abduction at 6 Gripped the Nation, Is Dead at 87",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/obituaries/june-robles-birt-whose-abduction-gripped-the-nation-is-dead-at-87.html

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

Rich Hill was cruising, having retired seven consecutive batters. But with two outs in the third, he made a mistake on a pitch to George Springer, and the poorly-located fastball was deposited into the stands in right to give the Astros a 1-0 lead. Hill got out of the inning when Alex Bregman grounded out to short, but Hill has made the mistake of giving Justin Verlander a run to work with.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Waldstein: With Springer’s home run, these teams have now hit 23, extending the World Series record. It was also the 16th to either break a tie or give the team a lead.

Here’s an interesting tidbit about all the home runs in Game 5. The Astros had 5. The only other teams to do that in the World Series were the 1989 Athletics and the 1928 Yankees. Babe Ruth hit 3 in Game 4 of ’28 and Lou Gehrig and Cedric Durst each hit one. (The Big Three, right?)

Bottom 3rd: Verlander notches his fifth strikeout.

It was a remarkably quiet inning for Justin Verlander. Austin Barnes grounded out to second, Rich Hill struck out on a foul-tip into Brian McCann’s mitt, and Chris Taylor watched strike three sail right by him to end the inning. Verlander now has five strikeouts, but has seen his pitch-count creep up to 43.

Waldstein: Justin Verlander is looking good so far, especially with that called third strike breaking ball to Joc Pederson in the second inning. If he is getting that pitch over for strikes, he will be hard to beat. Incredible to believe, but Verlander is searching for his first World Series win. He is 0-3 in three World Series appearances, two for the Tigers. His earned run average in those games is 6.43. He looks better than that tonight.

Top 4th: Hill settles in after giving up home run.

With the exception of the solo homer he allowed in the third inning, Rich Hill has matched Justin Verlander. It was more of the same in the fourth. He retired Jose Altuve on a grounder to short, got Carlos Correa to fly out to center, and after Yulieski Gurriel was once again greeted with heavy booing, Hill got him to fly out to right to end the inning.

Photo

Bottom 4th: Verlander mows down Dodgers’ big hitters.

Through four innings it is almost surprising that the Dodgers have a hit. Justin Verlander continued to dominate, retiring Corey Seager on a fly to left and then fooling Justin Turner on a cutter for strike three. With two outs, Verlander got his seventh strikeout of the game when Cody Bellinger swung right through a fastball to end the inning.

Waldstein: Verlander looks really sharp, as expected. He gets Justin Turner on a 92 miles-per-hour cutter and then gets Cody Bellinger on a 97 miles-per-hour fastball perfectly located up and in. He is pitching without the same kind of safety net that Rich Hill is. That is because the Astros are really out of good options in the bullpen. Everyone is either worn out or ineffective, or both. The supposed closer, Ken Giles, may not even pitch any more because he has been so bad. Keep in mind that before the game, Astros manager A.J. Hinch said that he would do whatever is necessary to win tonight, including possibly using Lance McCullers to close it out. “I think if you complicate it and try to manage two games at once, you’ll find yourself having two games,” he said.

Photo

Top 5th: Dodgers go to bullpen early ... again.

Brandon Morrow, who has pitched in each game of the World Series, was called on once again because Rich Hill had loaded the bases with two outs. The Dodgers’ setup man, who faltered badly in Game 5, got out of the inning when Alex Bregman grounded out to short to end what looked like a Houston rally.

Brian McCann led off the inning with a single to right and went to third when Marwin Gonzalez doubled past a diving Alex Bregman. Hill chose to pitch to Josh Reddick despite first base being open and the pitcher being on deck, and was rewarded for it when Reddick struck out. Justin Verlander also struck out, and after George Springer was intentionally walked to load the bases, Hill’s night was over.

With Los Angeles into its bullpen for the remainder of the game, Hill’s final line was 4 2/3 innings, four hits and one run. He struck out five and walked one. He threw just 58 pitches.

Waldstein: Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts did what he has been consistently doing with Rich Hill, pulling him before the third time through the Dodgers’ batting order. Hill did his job, keeping the Dodgers in the game.

The fans did not like it when Hill came out, but it worked to perfection. Brandon Morrow, who looked completely gassed in Game 5, came in with the bases loaded and got the Astros out of the jam.

Bottom 5th: Verlander gets eighth strikeout.

Justin Verlander is still working with a one-run lead, but he continues to cruise. In the fifth he needed just one pitch to retire Yasiel Puig on a fly ball to right, threw three pitches to Joc Pederson, getting him to fly out to left, and then battled a bit with Logan Forsythe before striking him out on seven pitches to end the inning. Verlander has eight strikeouts on 69 pitches. He has the endurance to throw 120 or more if the Astros can avoid a situation where they need to pinch-hit for him.

Photo

Top 6th: Dodgers’ bullpen gets out of another jam.

Brandon Morrow has been almost comically overused, with tonight representing the reliever’s 13th postseason appearance this year — the record is 14, which was set by Paul Assenmacher of the Cleveland Indians in 1997. He was not perfect, allowing a two-out single to Yulieski Gurriel, but pressed into duty for his sixth World Series game this year, he got three critical outs for Los Angeles. Tony Watson took over for him after Gurriel’s hit, and immediately hit Brian McCann with a pitch. But he finished off the inning without allowing a run, getting Marwin Gonzalez to line out to second, erasing the two base runners.

Photo

Bottom 6th: Dodgers find Verlander’s number.

Justin Verlander got himself into trouble and the Astros are now trailing 2-1. Austin Barnes stroked a leadoff single into left, which brought up pinch-hitter Chase Utley. Despite Utley being 0 for 14 in this year’s postseason, Verlander pitched him very carefully before hitting him with a pitch. That brought up Chris Taylor, who lined a double into to right, bringing Barnes home and tying the game 1-1.

With runners on second and third, Corey Seager hit a long fly to right that seemed as if it might leave the park, but eventually ended up as a sacrifice fly when the ball landed in Josh Reddick’s glove and Utley scored.

Verlander stopped the bleeding by getting a foul-out from Justin Turner and a strikeout from Cody Bellinger, but he will be done with six innings of work because he is due up second in the next inning.

Photo

Waldstein: Justin Verlander will not do a Josh Beckett in Game 6. He is out of the game for pinch-hitter Evan Gattis in the top of the 7th. What an interesting inning. Verlander certainly looked like he had reached his limit. Even the first out — Corey Seager’s sacrifice fly ball to right — was hit hard enough to have been a home run in Yankee Stadium, anyway. Although Verlander walked off without the chance to get his first World Series win in three separate trips to the Fall Classic, he did well to limit the damage when the Astros had already evened the score and had runners at second and third with no out.

Now this game is all about the bullpens, and the Dodgers have the marginal advantage.

Photo

Top 7th: Astros threaten, but come up short.

The Astros got the situation they wanted, with Jose Altuve at the plate with a runner in scoring position, but the Dodgers got out of the inning unscathed, maintaining their 2-1 lead.

Josh Reddick walked to lead things off, which brought up the pitcher’s spot, and Justin Verlander was removed for a pinch-hitter. Kenta Maeda came on in relief to face Evan Gattis, and induced a force-out at second. George Springer singled, at which point Houston replaced Gattis on the bases with Derek Fisher, and the speedy pinch-runner advanced to third on a flyout to center by Alex Bregman.

With runners on the corners and two outs, Altuve came up, and was hacking away from the first pitch, but he ended up grounding out to third to end the inning, with the throw just barely beating him at first.

Walstein: The Dodgers are doing a great job on Jose Altuve and Calros Correa, who are a combined 0 for 7. Astros manager A.J. Hinch waited to pinch run for Evan Gattis until Gattis reached second base, which is often done by managers. But if he had immediately sent Derek Fisher in to run after Gattis reached first on a fielder’s choice, he might have made it to third base on George Springer’s single, which got past Corey Seager at shortstop and dribbled into left field. It would have been close, but if a runner did make it there, he definitely would have scored on Bregman’s deep fly ball out. Would have, could have.

Photo

Bottom 7th: Pederson goes deep.

Joe Musgrove was given the unenviable task of coming in for Justin Verlander. The right-hander retired Yasiel Puig on a pop-out to short, but Joc Pederson, who has been on fire recently, crushed a 1-2 fastball for an opposite-field home run that increased the Dodgers’ lead to 3-1. Musgrove recovered to retire pinch-hitter Andre Ethier on a fly to left and he struck out Austin Barnes to end the inning, but the Dodgers will be handing the game over to Kenley Jansen for a six-out save, and he has a two-run cushion to work with.

Waldstein: Wow, that was some home run trot by Joc Pederson. I don’t recall seeing a player skip down the third base line pointing to his dugout in the 7th inning. It looked like something out of the movie “Major League.” More important, his home run gives Kenley Jansen a cushion. Remember, Jansen blew the save in Game 2 in his second inning of work and took the loss in Game 5 when he gave up a run, also in his second inning of work. And the Astros don’t ever concede. Then again, neither do the Dodgers.

Top 8th: Jansen gets three easy outs.

Kenley Jansen is halfway through a six-out save. He got Carlos Correa to fly out to left, got Yulieski Gurriel to pop out to first and then struck out Brian McCann to end the inning. Los Angeles will now try to add some insurance to their two-run lead.

Bottom 8th: No more insurance runs for the Dodgers.

A two-run lead will have to suffice for the Dodgers. Charlie Culberson led off the inning against Luke Gregerson with a single to left, and he advanced to second on a groundout by Chris Taylor. Corey Seager worked a full-count, but struck out on a slider that cut in on him. With a man on base, Justin Turner walked, which ended Gregerson’s day. Francisco Liriano came in to face Cody Bellinger, and the 12-year veteran, who was making his first career World Series appearance, struck out the rookie slugger in a grueling 9-pitch at-bat.

The Dodgers are three outs from forcing a Game 7.

Top 9th: Jansen closes the door on Astros.

Kenley Jansen had a long wait between innings, but the Dodgers’ closer was just as dominant in the ninth, shutting the door on the Astros and securing a six-out save. He started things off by getting Marwin Gonzalez to pop out to first. He then took care of things himself, striking out Josh Reddick and pinch-hitter Carlos Beltran to end the game, needing just 19 pitches to complete two innings of work.","World Series 2017: How the Dodgers Won Game 6, Inning by Inning",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/sports/world-series-dodgers-astros.html

Advertisement Continue reading the main storyNOW, 50 YEARS after these women began making work, the culture has finally caught up to them.
At a notorious 1975 performance at a women’s art festival in East Hampton, Schneemann unrolled a scroll from her vagina and read from it.
These women’s work might be as uncompromising as it ever was, but age, they know, has also neutralized them in men’s eyes, removed some of their sting and danger.","Part of what makes Tompkins’s work so enduringly potent today, and what made it too shocking for its time, is not just its frank sexuality: It’s that the art of Tompkins, Bernstein and their peers seethes with lust, ego, wisecracks and profanity. While other feminists of their era were embracing “central core” imagery related to the womb or vulva and reclaiming traditionally female crafts like needlepoint, these artists demanded attention the way men did — through shock and awe.

Bernstein’s colossal drawings of screws, which unambiguously resemble erect penises, provoked a kind of castration anxiety. “One dealer told me that my work made men of his age feel uncomfortable,” she says. One of her works was censored from a show of women’s art at the Museum of the Philadelphia Civic Center in 1974 after its director, John Pierron, claimed that it “offends me on behalf of the children of this city.” In the late 1960s, a male dealer at Knoedler gallery, then the oldest commercial gallery in New York, told Juanita McNeely that the slides of her work she’d shown him — violent paintings of nude women bleeding — couldn’t have been made by a woman. At another gallery, she brought the canvases to prove it, but as she unrolled them onto the floor the dealer kicked them out of his path and walked away. These artists’ work, at the time and ever since, has been an act of announcement, of provocation by existence. They threatened to take up male territory, which museums and galleries then almost exclusively were.

Although most of these women identified (and still do) as feminists, their work was too outré even for the radical feminism of the 1960s and ’70s, which found its focus in the politics of sexual oppression, and its voice in people like the lawyer and activist Catharine MacKinnon, who argued that “all pornography is made under conditions of inequality.” The artists of this generation didn’t quite fit in with anyone — not women (MacKinnon’s stance meant a brief, uneasy alliance between feminism and right-wing censors), not critics and not other artists: At the time that these so-called blood-and-guts artists were first appearing, minimalism, a nearly asexual style that championed form over feeling, was the dominant trend — leagues away from these women’s lusty, leaky, fleshy aesthetic. Feminists criticized Tompkins for cutting and cropping images from her husband’s pornographic magazines and thus perpetuating male sexist fantasies. (“I was not active in the feminist art movement,” she says. “I couldn’t find it. Nobody told me where the meetings were.”) Bernstein, now 75, was a member of the all-woman cooperative gallery A.I.R., which was founded in 1972 and is still active, but she too never felt the movement embraced her. “I observed men and their behavior. A lot of feminists didn’t take that as being feminism.”

Especially scandalizing was the fact that many of the women — who are almost exclusively heterosexual — made men the objects of desire. When Sylvia Sleigh’s 1975 portrait of a young nude man went on view at the Bronx Museum, then housed in a room of a courthouse, a judge complained about the “explicit male nudity in the corridor of a public courthouse.” The curator wondered in response why he had never complained before about the “coyly draped, bare-breasted females” that adorned the elevators of the same building.

The arrival of queer art in the early ’70s forced the discussion of art and sex — who got to depict it; what it should look like — into the culture at large. Conservatives and the Christian right turned their attention toward gay male artists like Robert Mapplethorpe and David Wojnarowicz, both of whom depicted male desire in their work, and both of whom had been censored by museums. There was a philosophical kinship between these phallic feminists and this first major generation of queer artists, who were all representing anatomy in abrasive ways.

Photo

But while queer art became a cause for museums and galleries — Mapplethorpe and Wojnarowicz were anointed figureheads in a battle between progressive and conservative values, which ultimately exposed their work to wider audiences — these women artists remained obscure. Mapplethorpe’s solo show featuring photographs of male nudes at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., was canceled in 1989 after pressure from members of Congress, but the exhibition was quickly moved to the Washington Project for the Arts. Crowds lined up to see it, and America’s near-return to the 1950s seemed to have been at least temporarily thwarted. And yet the female artists received no new recognition, no new regard. The third wave of feminists that emerged in the ’90s allied with queer theorists and activists of color — and dismissed the previous generation’s feminism as too straight, white and privileged.

NOW, 50 YEARS after these women began making work, the culture has finally caught up to them. These days, pornography streams on phones; many curators determining museum programming came of age reading feminist theory; and there is a diversity, and plurality, of young women artists who have made sex, and the female body, their primary subject, and who have found recognition doing so: 27-year-old Darja Bajagic, who collages hardcore porn with images of murdered women, or 28-year-old Amalia Ulman, whose fictional Instagram personas post selfies in bras and thongs, or 25-year-old Emma Sulkowicz, whose 2014 performance, in which she marched around the campus of Columbia University lugging the mattress on which she was allegedly raped by a fellow student, quickly became an emblem of the current debate surrounding campus sexual assault.

But the sudden popularity of Tompkins and Bernstein is not just about the abundance and easy accessibility of explicit material to which we have all become desensitized. Young women today face some of the same battles that were fought by their mothers and grandmothers at a time when these artists were just beginning their careers. January’s Women’s March was a kind of communion of the previous generations of feminism, a present-tense call to action, but it was also an acknowledgment of the past. The signs carried by protesters contained all the iconography that these artists once traded in and still do — all the explicit depictions of male and female anatomy and bodily functions that had once alienated them had become, over time, the symbols of an age of resistance.

And while these artists’ shamelessness as young women was outrageous, their shamelessness as old women is revolutionary. What’s perhaps most astonishing is that they never stopped making their work, despite years of disregard: There is something radical about their very stubbornness, their dogged persistence. “In the 1960s and early ’70s, every gallery rejected my work,” says the 78-year-old Carolee Schneemann, who won a lifetime achievement award at this year’s Venice Biennale and is the subject of a retrospective currently on view at PS1. The show was a long time coming. At a notorious 1975 performance at a women’s art festival in East Hampton, Schneemann unrolled a scroll from her vagina and read from it. (The text was about a male “structuralist filmmaker” who criticized the “diaristic indulgence” of her art.) She, like her peers, has bittersweet feelings about their recent recognition. On the one hand, they’re enjoying the success — “Oh my god, it’s fabulous,” Bernstein says. “I take cabs everywhere” — but they’re skeptical of the forces that enabled it. There is a perpetual cycle in the art world of women not being taken seriously until they are old or dead: This was the case with Louise Bourgeois, who only had her first retrospective in 1982, after she turned 70, or the painter Carmen Herrera, who recently had her retrospective at the Whitney ... at the age of 101. These women’s work might be as uncompromising as it ever was, but age, they know, has also neutralized them in men’s eyes, removed some of their sting and danger. Now that they’re postmenopausal, their sexual disobedience doesn’t matter as much to men, who “don’t want to sleep with us anymore,” Schneemann says. “We’re not as threatening as younger women,” says Bernstein.

Other things, though, haven’t changed. Bernstein still lives and works in the same Chinatown studio she’s had since 1967, cluttered with a collection of stuffed animals and toys for her two Persian cats. It used to be crammed with decades of unsold paintings, but now that she can finally afford storage space, the only work present on a recent visit was her new series of fluorescent black-light paintings of testicle-headed Donald Trumps and vagina-faced Hillary Clintons, which are now on view at the Drawing Center in downtown Manhattan. Her signature, prominently scrawled in black cursive letters, appears throughout these works. “I want to make sure they know who did it,” she says.",The Feminist Pioneers Making Provocative Art About Sex,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/t-magazine/feminist-artists-judith-bernstein-betty-tompkins.html

KimberMills taps a forge in Eastern Europe to produce large parts that are beyond its works in England. If Britain fails to strike a trade deal with Europe, these parts could face tariffs. The company has already begun seeking out alternative suppliers in Britain.

But on a recent afternoon at the Great Western pub, a cozy, beer-scented den in Wolverhampton, people worried that such sentiments were being overwhelmed by the economic realities of Brexit.

The pub has been doing a brisk business, owing to the success of the local soccer team, the Wolverhampton Wanderers, whose stadium is within walking distance. But customers were nursing woes.

“Brexit is a disaster,” said Richard Lloyd, 48, the proprietor of a local construction company, as he hoisted a pint of Guinness. “It’s thrown a lot of people into uncertainty. Companies are certainly delaying investment. They are being very cautious.”

Two years ago, Mr. Lloyd employed as many as 20 people. These days, he has only four. “If things were going really swimmingly, I’d hire more,” he said.

A local taxi driver, B. Maan, recalled how he used to take home 200 pounds, or about $266, in the course of a Saturday night, ferrying revelers to pubs. These days, he is fortunate to secure 120 pounds.

“People are spending less,” he said.

Time itself has become a threat. As negotiations yield headlines about sniping within Britain’s governing Conservative party, each week that passes absent clarity amplifies pressure on companies to shift people and operations to Europe.

“We can’t see how investment particularly, but also consumption, will not be affected,” said Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB Markets, an investment bank in Norway. “How can you go ahead with big investments when you don’t know what framework will result?”

For Nim’s Fruit Crisps, the variables of Brexit have advanced British self-sufficiency.

Previously reliant on a supplier in Belgium for most of its fruits and vegetables, the company has in recent months found domestic suppliers for every needed variety except pineapple, limiting its exposure to the vagaries of exchange rates. Today, Nim’s buys apples, parsnips, cucumbers and a range of other crops from British farmers.

The fall in the pound has also made Nim’s products cheaper outside Britain, bolstering its exports, which now make up more than half of total sales. Nim’s snacks are sold in Germany, France, Italy, India, Israel and — soon — Saudi Arabia.

“What I’ve learned is that Europe isn’t the only market for us,” said Ms. Raja, whose Nim’s business card identifies her as TheBoss.

Yet as she seeks to complete a deal putting her crisps on the shelves of a major British supermarket chain, Ms. Raja worries that the needed volumes will exceed the capacities of Britain.

“I suddenly have to find 100 tons of apples,” she said.

A school like Golden Gate should be a model for how other institutions can adapt to the newer, older face of American college students. The problem for for-profits is that doing the job right just isn’t very profitable, while elite nonprofit colleges face little pressure to recruit adult students. Schools like Stanford and Yale could fill each freshman class exclusively with upper-middle-class 18-year-olds if they wanted (and they basically do).

Compounding the problem is that the best-known arbiters of college quality, like U.S. News & World Report, reward schools for prestige and selectivity, not for serving the needs of adults and all the other students who actually make up most of America’s college classrooms.

That’s a shame. Elite universities pride themselves on creating diverse learning environments, but by ignoring adult students, they’re missing out on a tremendous opportunity to bring different perspectives into the classroom. Schools like Princeton and the University of Chicago train a disproportionate share of future leaders in government and business. Shouldn’t those groups include students who have, say, worked as a nurse in an I.C.U., or supervised a factory floor, or trained combat troops as an noncommissioned officer? And shouldn’t the 18-year-old future leaders of America interact with and learn from people with those experiences?

One might object that seats at highly selective universities are so rare and valuable that they should be reserved strictly for the young, whose whole lives are ahead of them. But if elite universities expanded the size of their incoming classes — something few of them have done in decades despite soaring demand — adult students could be accommodated without younger ones being displaced.

In our reporting on adult learners, we found schools around the country — ones with far fewer resources than most elite private universities — that are developing innovative ways to make college work better for the grown-ups they serve. Broward College, in Florida, for instance, now has courses in which students earn not only college credit but industry certifications to guarantee that they are job-ready, while Southern New Hampshire University offers fully online bachelor’s degrees that adults can earn quickly by demonstrating mastery of knowledge and skills that they picked up on the job.

It wouldn’t be hard for prestigious universities to adapt themselves for prospective adult students — and there are plenty — who could compete in and benefit from attending those schools. With their multibillion-dollar endowments, they have the resources they need to expand class sizes, offer credit for prior learning, and aggressively recruit enough qualified adult students to at least match the 30 percent figure of adult college students nationwide.

Doing so might also help these elite schools diversify racially and geographically, since many standout adult students come from underrepresented urban and rural backgrounds. But before the problem of too few adult students on elite campuses can be fixed, first we have to admit that we have a problem at all.",Let’s Waste College on the Old,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/opinion/adult-learners-college.html

“Downtown is bursting at the seams,” said Mr. Momo, a partner in the Terra Momo restaurant group, which owns the nearby Terra Momo Bread Company, Teresa Caffe and Mediterra restaurant. “This is right on the seam, so I said, ‘Let’s do something here.’”

The lot already had “a 100-plus-year-old” dilapidated house on it, Ms. Dowling said, which had been abandoned for many years.

“We bought it thinking we were going to save the front half,” she continued, while extending the house with an addition on the back. “But it was so rotted and poorly cared for that we couldn’t salvage it.”

So they gave the porch to an architect working on the renovation of a house down the street, where the singer, actor, athlete and civil rights activist Paul Robeson was born in 1898, and slated the rest for demolition.

Ms. Dowling drew up plans for a new building using existing setback requirements as her guide, while looking to maximize space. The house had to be 10 feet from either side of the 40-foot-wide lot, and 35 feet from the rear lot line. The height was limited to 30 feet.

She started with a two-story box that precisely traced those limits, and then carved out space for the carport and a double-height kitchen to get the total indoor area down to 2,298 square feet — just two square feet shy of the maximum 2,300 allowed.

She submitted her plans to Princeton’s building department and received a construction permit before whispers about the movement to create a historic district reached her. “I started hearing from neighbors saying, ‘Can you show us what you’re doing? We’d like to be included,’” she said.

Hoping to demonstrate that she and Mr. Momo had every intention of being good neighbors, she organized a community meeting at the local library to share her design, and went door to door distributing fliers. “I built a model. I made poundcake. It was a real good-will effort,” she said. “Three people showed up.”

Demolition began in April 2015, without incident. Fifteen months and about $1 million later, Ms. Dowling, Mr. Momo and their 14-year-old daughter, Anna, moved into the completed three-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom house, built by R. Faucett Construction.

Ms. Dowling and Mr. Momo now spend much of their time in the airy kitchen, where soaring walls of operable windows bring in abundant natural light and breezes. “I’m the cook; she’s the baker,” Mr. Momo said.

The living room has large sliding glass doors opening onto steps that lead down to the grassy backyard designed by Peter Soderman, where their dog, Pepper, goes to play. In the basement, a home office serves as the East Coast outpost of Dowling Studios.

“Could I have come in and done some quasi-colonial thing, as other builders around town are doing? Sure,” Ms. Dowling said. “But what’s the better response: to build something that looked like what was here or something that is designed for today?”

The couple’s feelings on the subject are clear — and at least some of their neighbors seem sympathetic. Shortly after the house was completed, representatives of the historic district contacted Mr. Momo.

I shadowed the production for almost a month in the fall of last year, while the Duffers were shooting their first two episodes and Shawn was prepping his, and the thing that didn’t surprise me at all was that crew was having such fun.

I was basically allowed to run free, to get my Spielberg on and my Cameron on. You try not to be gratuitous.

What about the cultural references? In one of your episodes, Dacre Montgomery’s bad boy character Billy is listening to Ratt. In the other episode, someone’s watching “Family Feud” on TV. Were any of those touches up to you?

“Family Feud” was mine. The songs are a separate thing. But really, the Duffers trust their art department and props department and set-dressing department and costume department to go on little archaeological digs. I haven’t talked about this with the Duffers or with Shawn but I have to believe that half the fun of directing an episode of “Stranger Things” for them is walking onto the set and suddenly seeing the extras wearing those clothes and seeing all the vintage props and getting inspired by what’s in front of you. That surprise is really useful.

I remember in one of my episodes, Billy’s working out with weights and smoking, and he has a sleeveless shirt on. The minute I saw it, I thought, “Oh my god, I wore so many of those.” And Dacre said, “I think my character would work without a shirt on.” I told him, “We’ll do a take without it, but just for this rehearsal, can you try it with the shirt?” This is a scene where the shot is of him coming outside the house, so I was all the way across the street with the camera crew. The second he stepped out of the house, I heard about four guys behind I camera go, “Oh man, I totally had that shirt.” I was like, “O.K., we’re keeping it.”

You have a sequence where Sean Astin walks through the Byers house and realizes that what Will’s strange drawings are actually a map. Why did you do it mostly as a series of long tracking shots?

Not only was it hard to shoot in that house, but also I knew that Shawn had already shot some of the drawing and piecing-together of the maps. I didn’t want my scenes to feel the same. What can I do differently that feels supportive of the narrative, and which captures this slow build of Bob going, “I get it, I get it, I got it?” I wanted to do one well-choreographed take. We ultimately ended up cutting it into three shots, because we got some other coverage. But it was mostly one long master shot, so you could feel Bob’s mood. And we could feed off Sean’s acting, to have like a musical build to the “Aha!”

Dana Bowen, writing for The Times’s cheap-eats column, called them “enjoyable enough,” then spent the rest of her space on the after-hours experiments that Mr. Chang and three other cooks were serving late at night, like a whole roasted pork butt, to be pulled apart with tongs that quickly become as joyously greasy as everything and everybody else at the table.

By early 2007, when Frank Bruni weighed in, the after-hours experiments had taken over the menu, which offered previously unimagined combinations of kimchi, country ham, hamachi, rice sticks, fish sauce and organ meats. Ssam Bar had become “a nearly full-fledged restaurant in near-perfect sync with the times,” Mr. Bruni wrote. Apparently it wasn’t done fledging yet; he returned in 2008 to promote it from two stars to three.

Review overkill? No. Ssam Bar wasn’t just changing its menu. It rewrote the rules by which critically acclaimed restaurants were supposed to operate, stripping away comforts (chairs with backs, sound systems with a “low” setting) and amenities (reservations, unshared tables), and gambling that everybody would be too stunned by the food to complain.

It worked. Ssam Bar mounted a guerrilla attack on the dining establishment, and it won before anybody quite knew what was going on, Mr. Chang included.

There followed a long period of refinement and maturation, which is more than some guerrilla outfits can say. The wine list now takes more than 20 seconds to read, and is especially worth exploring for fans of gamay and sparkling wine. (Or both — there’s a sparkling gamay.) Under Matthew Rudofker, the executive chef from 2010 until May, Ssam Bar expanded beyond pork shoulder to other sizable cuts of meat: rib-eyes, briskets, whole ducks.

Over the years, like many of Mr. Chang’s restaurants, Ssam Bar was increasingly infiltrated by modern techniques, fermentation, cutting-edge plating styles and umami-building tricks. The kitchen worked at a very high level, but at times it felt slightly deracinated, as if it drew much of its inspiration from other islands in the Momofuku archipelago.

Carefully but confidently, Mr. Ng is moving away from that style and toward one of his own. He has gone back to the traditions of Asia, particularly street food and Singaporean cuisine. Like the char on that smoldering banana leaf, his techniques tend to be premodern, even though he has worked for nobody but Mr. Chang since moving to the United States in 2011, starting with an externship at Ssam Bar during culinary school and rising to chef de cuisine at Momofuku Ko.

Mr. Ng has been trying his hand at the fish-shaped cakes from Japan known as taiyaki. He has a terrific idea for what to do with them: stuff them with foie gras. In his hands they’re almost French, because he fills the molds with croissant dough rather than pancake batter and glazes the crust with honey and white port. Over the top he strews some candied puffed rice that would make a fine breakfast; the whole dish would make a fine breakfast, come to think of it, although you’d stand up afterward knowing your day had already peaked.

Sizzling eggs arrive not quite set in a cast-iron pan hot enough to finish cooking them at the table. The heat also softens a slice of pork terrine, which melts to coat the eggs. When I first tried this open-faced omelet, the eggs had been poured around a handful of chanterelles. Now they’ve been replaced by smoked bluefish.

To make one of the most original corn dishes I’ve seen in a long time, Mr. Ng cleaves the cobs lengthwise into quarters and fries them until they curl. They are dusted with spice. You pick one up with your fingers and swipe it through a black aioli of squid ink or a white streak of whipped ricotta, which will melt like butter. Then you eat the kernels from the cob as if you were gnawing the meat off a baby back rib.

These new dishes live alongside some legacies of Mr. Rudofker’s regime. There are cured sardines on long fingers of toast spread with hozon, the fermented chickpea paste that in this case plays the role of butter very well.

Big cuts of meat are still offered. They have to be ordered ahead, but a variation of the rotisserie duck can sometimes be had on the spur of the moment. The breast is rubbed heartily with five-spice powder and fanned out over rice, the idea being to wrap it in lettuce with fried shallots and gochujang, without getting too distracted when the duck’s fried bones show up about 15 minutes later.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Most of us solve crossword puzzles in our SPARE TIME, but I’ve gotten mail from people who have told me that they solved under their desks during classes to make a boring lecture go faster. In another lifetime, I raced my boss to see who could finish fastest when we should have been working. So clearly, spare time is the not the same as down time. Spare time is all in the eye of the solver.

Roland Huget returns with a wide open grid that has only 60 words in it. The pinwheel design intrigued me, although I felt a bit boxed in by the long, black square “arms” that made, as he admits, the puzzle feel like four mini-crosswords. If I’m going to be boxed in, so to speak, I like to see each sector really shine, and I’m not sure this one did it for me. As always, your mileage may vary, but there are more “RE-” words in here than I like to see (RELET, REVOICE, REBOX, REAWAKENS) and each section has some gluey bits that made me feel as if the majority of the puzzle had been filled using the autofill option in a puzzle constructing software program.

Yes, I know it’s Saturday. There is some nice fill in here (I liked SEAFARERS, GO IT ALONE, SPARE TIME, LOSE A STEP). And PAPETERIE might just become the ETUI of stationery products one day. But I really like some knotty wordplay in my late week cluing, and this seemed mostly definitional. Combine that with the lack of real sparklers in the fill, and the puzzle as a whole feels vaguely disappointing. To me. You might feel otherwise, and that’s perfectly O.K.

Tricky Clues

The Tricky Clues section is generally limited to clues that involve some sort of wordplay, and there wasn’t much of it in today’s puzzle. Even so, here is a selection of clues that might have been speed bumps for some solvers.

41A: Foreign language in the clue = foreign language answer. “Un examen” is “a test” in French, so the answer would be ELEVE, or French for “student.”

36D: “It’s not the main story” is a SUBPLOT.

43D: Now we’re talking, sort of. “It can get the blood flowing” could be anything exciting, but today it’s a STENT.

Constructor Notes

This puzzle was constructed in October 2016 and accepted for publication in February of this year. It is one of a series of open grids that I constructed in the late summer and fall of 2016. This grid has the largest open square count of any I have constructed to date. The layout of the blocks was designed for that purpose. It is as close to being four independent mini-puzzles as you can get, and this fact needs to be taken into account in the cluing so that solvers can gain a foothold. This grid took longer than most to construct, and in the end required compromises, as has been my experience with many puzzles. The Scrabble average often suffers in grids like this because the friendliest letters in the open areas tend to be the ones with the lowest scores. I hope solvers enjoy this one.

SPECIAL POST — The 12th World Sudoku Championship, which I’ve attended in Bangalore, India, has just ended. It was the largest WSC to date — 206 competitors from 32 countries. Most countries were represented by four-person teams, although individual solvers could take part as well.

The contestants tackled almost 150 tough sudoku and sudoku variations over two days, scoring points for correct solutions. Point values varied according to the difficulty of the puzzles.

When it was over, the top five teams were China, Japan, France, USA and Czech Republic. China and Japan towered over everyone else.

The top individual solvers were Kota Morinishi of Japan (4,890 points) and Tiit Vunk of Estonia (4,887), with only 3 points separating them.

“The biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm,” Mr. Trump wrote.
Much of the talk on Capitol Hill centered on whether Congress needed to prevent Mr. Trump from firing Mr. Mueller.
Senator Lindsey Graham was one of two Republicans who hastily introduced bills aimed at adding a layer of job security for Mr. Mueller in August.
“I don’t feel a sense of urgency, no, I don’t,” Mr. Graham said on Tuesday.","Most unnerving for many here was the realization that Mr. Papadopoulos had been secretly arrested three months ago and cooperating with prosecutors ever since. Former colleagues sought to remember contacts they had with him, either last year when he was reaching out to the Russians or in recent weeks when he was working for the authorities.

“Is there a darker cloud over the Trump presidency? The answer is yes,” said Ed Rogers, a prominent lobbyist and White House veteran of two Republican presidencies. “Is it a thundershower or a hurricane setting in? Nobody knows.”

Mr. Trump argued for drizzle, dismissing Mr. Manafort’s indictment on charges of money laundering and foreign lobbying as unrelated to the campaign and belittling Mr. Papadopoulos as a nobody. “Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday in his first comment on the foreign policy adviser he once called an “excellent guy.”

Instead, as he has done repeatedly in recent days, Mr. Trump sought to turn attention to Democrats, pointing to the resignation of Tony Podesta, the powerhouse Democratic lobbyist who also faces scrutiny by Mr. Mueller and whose brother, John D. Podesta, was Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman.

“The biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm,” Mr. Trump wrote. “What he know about Crooked Dems is earth shattering. He and his brother could Drain The Swamp, which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled. Fake News weak!”

In a city where everything seems to break down along party lines, reaction to the indictments was no different. “If you’re a never Trumper, or if you’re with the media or a Democrat, this just confirms your wildest fears that Vladimir Putin is now running the White House,” said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. “But if you’re a Republican, you don’t see that this advances the narrative at all.”

Senator John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, sounded ho-hum, saying the charges claimed tax fraud and lying to F.B.I. agents. “If those allegations are true, you’ve got to wonder how those individuals made it through the birth canal, because it was bone-deep stupid,” he said. “But I don’t know what they have to do with President Trump’s campaign.”

Other Republicans appeared eager to skirt the issue. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, shut down questions related to the case at a news conference on Tuesday. “The special counsel has his job to do, and we’re going to concentrate on what we’re doing here in the Senate,” Mr. McConnell said.

Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Judiciary Committee chairman, slipped past a stand of flags to leave a news conference Monday through the back door rather than take questions about the investigation, although he later spoke with reporters about the case.

Much of the talk on Capitol Hill centered on whether Congress needed to prevent Mr. Trump from firing Mr. Mueller. Senator Lindsey Graham was one of two Republicans who hastily introduced bills aimed at adding a layer of job security for Mr. Mueller in August. In the months since, the legislation has stalled, despite Democratic prodding.

“I don’t feel a sense of urgency, no, I don’t,” Mr. Graham said on Tuesday. “This is something manufactured by the people in your business. I haven’t seen anybody in the White House say anything to suggest there is a reason Mr. Mueller needs to be dismissed.”

Mr. Grassley was indignant at the question. “It’s ridiculous for anybody to be asking me about firing,” he said. “That’s not an issue in the White House.”

The administration acknowledged that the investigation was disrupting its agenda. “It is very distracting to the president, as it would be to any citizen, to be investigated for something, while at the same time trying to carry the weight of what being president of the United States means on his shoulder,” John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, told Laura Ingraham on Fox News on Monday night.

He suggested the investigation might wind down. “It should wrap up soon,” Mr. Kelly said. “I mean, it would seem that they’re toward the end of the witness pile and I don’t know how much longer it could possibly go on, but we’re in great hopes that it wraps up.”

That seemed to rank optimism over experience, given past investigations involving other presidents. Veteran lawyers said Mr. Mueller’s inquiry could last for months if not years.

After venting on Twitter in the morning, the president tried to refocus attention on his tax-cutting package set to be released this week. Hosting business leaders at the White House, Mr. Trump said he wanted the House to pass the bill by Thanksgiving and the Senate by Christmas, a blindingly quick schedule for such major legislation even without the shadow of scandal.

“Every president, Republican or Democrat, always has distractions,” Jay Timmons, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers and one of Mr. Trump’s guests, said afterward. “That’s where leadership really counts. Leaders are able to focus on more than one thing and this president is focused — I think rightly so — on what it takes to grow this economy and create more jobs.”

But the investigation, coupled with the dysfunction and polarization in Washington, makes the chances of passing major tax legislation by the end of the year problematic. “No one on Capitol Hill expects that to occur anytime soon,” said Jim Manley, a longtime Senate Democratic aide. “And in the meantime, they’re once again in a position where all these things are going to pile up.”

The president and Congress have until Dec. 8 to agree on spending bills to keep the federal government from closing down and have a limited window beyond that to raise the national debt ceiling to avoid a default. Mr. Trump and lawmakers are also at odds over legislation to prevent the potential deportation of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.

“The partisan in me wants to get another tub of popcorn and another glass of wine and watch how it all plays out,” Mr. Manley said. “But the former staffer in me is anxious to see this darkness leave so we can get back to legislating.

The New York Times Company continued its march toward a digital future in the third quarter of 2017, as strong growth in digital advertising and new online subscriptions helped counteract a further collapse in print advertising.

The company said on Wednesday that digital advertising revenue in the quarter rose 11 percent, to $49 million. The company also added 105,000 net digital-only subscriptions for its news product, helping to push digital subscription revenue to $86 million, a 46 percent increase compared with the same period a year ago. Over all, the company said, total revenue increased 6 percent in the quarter, to $386 million.

Including subscriptions for its crossword and cooking products, The Times now has nearly 2.5 million digital-only subscribers.

The Times, however, has not been immune to the punishing, industrywide downturn in print. Print advertising revenue fell 20 percent in the quarter, fueling a 9 percent decrease in total advertising revenue.

“We had a strong quarter once again, with solid growth in digital subscriptions, digital advertising and subscription revenue and overall profitability,” Mark Thompson, the chief executive of The Times, said in a statement.

The sound, if not earth-shattering, financial results were announced as The Times fundamentally reshapes itself into a business no longer rooted in newsprint. In the past several months, it has eliminated its copy desk, offered buyouts to employees and reorganized the structure of its newsroom.

But from a financial perspective, The Times appears to be moving in a positive direction.

Operating profit for the quarter increased to $33 million, from $9 million in the same period last year. Adjusted operating profit rose to $57 million, from $39 million.

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

Photo

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

It was not clear whether that was a good thing or a bad one.

• Your turn: Did “Stranger Things 2” recapture the magic of the first season?","Watching is The New York Times’s TV and film recommendation newsletter and website.

In the first episode of the new season of “Stranger Things,” we saw a mysterious, inflamed storm bearing down on Hawkins. By the end of the nine-episode run its identity had been revealed: Puberty.

That strangest thing of all shared screen time, of course, with the latest disaster to emerge out of the Hawkins Lab, which loosed malevolent vines and “Demodogs” upon the luckless town and again made poor Will Byers, who really has had a terrible year, captive to an otherworldly demon. Hopper almost died at least once, and Joyce was again pushed to the brink by both her boyfriend Bob’s brutal Demomauling and her son’s tribulations.

via Giphy

But the success of the very good second season of “Stranger Things” is largely thanks to the equal tribute it paid to the often scary convulsions of adolescence, whether it was a heartbroken Mike being a pill to everyone or an equally despondent Eleven shattering windows with her angst.

The nerds left the basement and looked for love amid the monsters, dividing Dustin and Lucas as each pined after the new girl Max. Nancy and Jonathan took their relationship to the next level, with the help of a vodka-swilling conspiracy cupid. Eleven went through a rebellious phase, running away and dabbling in shoplifting as she questioned her own identity, before returning with a moody new “MTV punk” look.

The attention given to their growth and struggles elevated a season that, while suspenseful, was pretty repetitive from a plot standpoint — the lab screwed up, Will was victimized, monsters escaped, Eleven saved the day. For all of the 1980s blockbuster references and “Stranger Things 2” Hollywood sequel marketing, the creators Matt and Ross Duffer clearly get that in TV, investing in your characters is what makes viewers invest in your show.

As with last season, the story got going efficiently. Will beheld a tentacled shadow monster in the Upside Down and Dustin took in a slimy creature whose true nature wasn’t revealed until it feasted on the family pet. (“I’m sorry,” Dustin told Dart as he locked it in the cellar. “You ate my cat.”)

Nancy mourned Barb, getting smashed on Halloween party punch and setting out with Jonathan to get proof of the lab’s complicity in her death. At the rustic Chez Hopper, the chief and Eleven ate TV dinners and had fights fueled by past traumas: She chafed at her captivity by a domineering father figure, shades of Papa Modine, while he fretted about losing another little girl.

Things intensified after Will got terrible advice from Bob about how to deal with monster — basically, face it and tell it to go away — which resulted in the boy becoming part of it instead. The show cleverly played with Will’s connection to the menace, revealing him to be not a “spying” asset but rather a double-agent liability, a threat to manage with tricks and a series of hypodermic needles. (Again: Will’s had a tough time.)

The monster lacked the horrifying, Gothic edge of last year’s Demogorgon. So it was a big spidery storm beast that controlled wicked vines and devil dogs? Or what? And aren’t we full up on smoke/shadow monsters after “Lost,” “Game of Thrones” and probably others I’m forgetting? But its amorphousness did make for some of the season’s most terrifying scenes, such as the moment at the end of the third episode when it invaded Will’s body.

Noah Schnapp in “Stranger Things 2.” Netflix

As Will, Noah Schnapp was the linchpin of the season after being offscreen for most of the first one. He was a marvel, by turns heartbreaking, explaining to Joyce the hold the monster had on him, and creepy. (“He likes it cold.”) With his sensitive, soulful eyes and bowl-cutted fragility, Will looks like the result of someone at the Hawkins lab splicing D.N.A. of Elliott from “E.T.” and Danny Torrance from “The Shining.” But by the end he was in full Linda Blair mode, raging convincingly against the space-heater exorcism that eventually set him free (for now, at least).

The rest of the kids retained their power to charm even as the show asked more of them, too, this time around, splitting them into subplots that were more emotionally demanding than last year’s bike-bound adventures.

Finn Wolfhard was prickly and tender as Mike, a boy who didn’t know what do to with all of his feelings, culminating in his meltdown with Hopper. Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas) gave a fine portrayal of a fraught rite of passage: The first time your loyalties are torn between your pals and your crush. As Dustin, Gaten Matarazzo carried entire stretches of the show by himself. His fraternal bond with Steve (Joe Keery) — whose redemption was as delightful as it was unexpected — was maybe the most touching love story of the season.

Millie Bobbie Brown proved that she wasn’t a one-season wonder, telegraphing Eleven’s varying shades of pain with great nuance and holding her own with David Harbour through the push-and-pull of their complex, evolving relationship. (Will someone please wipe her bloody nose though?) And while the kids get most of the attention, the show simply doesn’t work without Mr. Harbour’s and Winona Ryder’s deeply felt performances.

The newcomers were more of a mixed bag. Sadie Sink (Max) was a spirited addition to the “party” (the term refers to a team of players collaborating within a role-playing game like Dungeons & Dragons). Brett Gelman was sublimely obnoxious as the investigator Murray Bauman. Sean Astin’s flair for openhearted, St. Bernard-like devotion was ideal for Bob the sacrificial galoot.

Dacre Montgomery in “Stranger Things 2.” Netflix

But after Billy’s (Dacre Montgomery) strong Scorpions-fueled arrival, the show seemed to lose sight of what to do with him. By the end he was an unfocused denim-wrapped bundle of rage and tire squeals. (I did enjoy his final episode moment with Mrs. Wheeler, though.)

Then there was the ill-advised detour into a Pat Benatar video. After Eleven went down the mental misery hole with her addled mother, she was moved to seek out the other lab refugee she saw in the flashbacks, and who we saw, in the season-opening scene, using telepathy to thwart the Pittsburgh police. This was Kali, and it turns out she was not part of a robber gang, as it initially seemed, but was leading a crew of misfits on a revenge quest against those who had persecuted her at the lab.

Kali was the Darth Vader to Eleven’s Luke Skywalker, urging her to give in to her hate and draw her power from the dark side of the Upside Down force. While Eleven flirted with the notion, she ultimately realized that revenge meant orphaning others, the way she had been, and decided to head home and save her friends instead.

A scene from “Stranger Things 2.” Netflix

It was perhaps worthwhile, from a character development standpoint, to have Eleven confront and make uneasy peace with her anger, and see what she might have become had she not found such loving support in Hawkins. But from the on-the-nose opening musical cue — Bon Jovi’s “Runaway” as she was literally running away — the episode was a mishmash of bad barrel-fire ’80s urban cliché and overwrought conflict. It didn’t help that the vengeful and manipulative Kali, with her sinister eyeliner, was a clear callback to “Temple of Doom” (Kali ma!), which took heat even in 1984 for its ghoulish depiction of Indian culture. (Tone-deaf exoticism is one reference the Duffer Brothers should have left in the ’80s.)

Eleven got a sweet makeover out of it, at any rate, returning to Hawkins looking like Trinity from the “Matrix.” She arrived just in time to close the interdimensional gate — did we really need Will to give us this obvious bit of strategy? — and get a birth certificate of her very own, completing her transformation from a gifted but tormented science project to Jane Hopper, a real-live girl with a mother and father. Whatever transpires in future “Stranger Things” installments, she’ll have that going for her.



One surprise was how long it took Eleven to rejoin her crew from the first season. They didn’t get together until the very end and even then, spent only minutes in each other’s company. It was an audacious and unexpected choice, as well as a slightly disappointing one given their shared chemistry. (There’s always next year, I guess, as promised by the final shot of a still-raging Upside Down.)

But it was of a piece with a season that throughout poignantly gestured at that fraught time when we all leave the basement and face life’s terrors and thrills on our own, as glimpsed in the culminating sequence at the Snow Ball ’84. After the four boys assembled on the fringes, one by one they left for new frontiers on the dance floor, with mixed results. (Oh Dustin, your time will come.)

It was a remarkable little scene and the perfect ending, capturing the anxiety, excitement, terror and occasional heartbreak that follows when you leave the cocoon of your party and enter a world that only gets stranger.

A Few Thoughts While We Enjoy a Baby Ruth

Before he knew it, he was giving food to the Salvation Army to deliver and dispatching food trucks to neighborhoods no aid agency had reached. I saw children ride their bikes behind his food trucks, happy to get their only hot meal of the day. I sat with him in a rural church and watched him cry as people prayed for him because no one else was sending food.

The story of emergency food relief in Puerto Rico shed light on the desperation across the island and underscored the lack of government aid, especially in the days immediately following the storm.

Weeks earlier, when hurricanes hit Texas and Florida, I saw a food story there, too. Never before had so many American kitchens been taken out of commission at once. So I spent time with cooks in Houston who were trying to regain a sense of normalcy by making kitchens out of gas grills, borrowed microwaves and coolers full of ice.

Similarly, after Hurricane Katrina, I traveled to New Orleans several times to report on how its food culture was recovering. Just three weeks after the flood, we found only one restaurant open, but cooks were making red beans and rice on the street. For a city that rises and falls on what’s for dinner, taking inventory of its restaurants was one way to measure both devastation and resilience.

A food story also can bring a fresh look to other types of news stories. The standoff between an oil company and protesters at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation over a new pipeline in North Dakota had dragged on for months. With winter approaching and the crowds of protesters growing, I wondered how they were going to feed everyone.

I bundled up and headed to the protest camp, where I found an odd mix of vegans in Ugg boots drinking yerba mate inside a donated Army mess tent, and Lakota and Pueblo cooks making buffalo soup and red chili stew in a string of makeshift cafes.

Even Trayvon Martin’s death in 2012 brought an unexpected food angle. He was killed on his way home from a store, a packet of Skittles in his pocket. The candy soon became a symbol of racial injustice and underscored his youth and the circumstances surrounding his death.

Don’t worry. Those of us who work in the Food section will continue to write restaurant reviews, recipe features and profiles that tell stories about culture, family and commerce. We will continue to help people buy and cook good food. That’s our bread and butter, as it were.

But when news breaks, you’ll find me at the table.","From Hurricanes to Protest Movements, Food Is a Way In",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/insider/hurricanes-protest-movements-food-news-events.html

In the end, her only opponent was Tim Ryan, a young congressman and former high school quarterback star from Ohio’s 13th District, the ailing industrial region surrounding Youngstown and Akron. Ryan offered a splash-of-cold-water speech just before the vote: “We got wiped out,” he said, according to a recording of his remarks. “We’re toxic in the Midwest, and we’re toxic in the South.”

Pelosi won easily, but fully a third of the Democratic caucus voted against their leader, and Ryan’s insurrection seemed to have left a mark: After the election, three well-liked and nonrebellious members — Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Hakeem Jeffries of New York and David Cicilline of Rhode Island — were chosen by the caucus to help manage the rebranding of the party. The three of them spent the first half of 2017 dutifully interviewing nearly every member of the caucus and conducting more than a dozen listening sessions with authors, pollsters and former Obama cabinet secretaries. They hosted a dinner at which the party’s various factions — the Progressive Caucus, the Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, the conservative Blue Dogs and the New Democrats, among others — mingled as if meeting for the first time.

In late July, Pelosi, Bustos, Jeffries and Cicilline stood on a stage with six other Democrats under a wiltingly hot summer sky in the city park of Berryville, Va. — a town of 4,306 residents in a purple district within easy driving distance of Washington — and unveiled their new agenda, titled “A Better Deal: Better Jobs, Better Wages, Better Future.” The phrase, which had been poll-tested by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was an intentional echo of F.D.R.’s New Deal — and, less intentionally, of a Papa John’s pizza slogan. But its biggest debt was to the author of “The Art of the Deal,” and to his crimson-jowled populism.

“A Better Deal” called for retraining in America’s fading manufacturing sector, renegotiating trade deals, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and fighting the corporate consolidation that had affected the prices of everything from eyeglasses to beer. None of the 10 speakers invoked President Barack Obama. In fact, one of the key provisions in “A Better Deal” — renegotiating drug prices for Medicare recipients — was an implicit rebuke of the former president, who had agreed with the pharmaceutical industry to freeze Medicare drug prices in exchange for its support of the Affordable Care Act.

But even before the rollout, Pelosi diminished the substance of “A Better Deal” in an interview with The Washington Post, clarifying that it was not “a course correction, but it’s a presentation correction.” A Quinnipiac poll in August found that only 33 percent of Democrats and 12 percent of independents had a favorable opinion of the new Democratic agenda. The self-consciousness of the rebranding, one congressman mused to me at the time, “seems like what you would do in a different era.”

There was a stiff-jointedness to the whole spectacle, a sense of the Democrats’ trying to regain the use of muscles they had let atrophy over the previous eight years. Obama, after all, used to make this sort of thing look easy. Conflating the American story with his own — “This is who we are” — the president conveyed, even in policy irresolution, an unshakable sense of his and America’s place in the world. “I love the guy, I miss him,” Scott Peters said of Obama. “But organizationally, the party is in disarray. We’re at the lowest level of elected officeholders since Hoover. We got a bit lazy and found ourselves relying on Barack Obama’s charisma, and it left us in bad shape.”

Barring seismic developments, the G.O.P. is still likely to control both the White House and the Senate until at least January 2021. But nine months into Trump’s presidency, the chances of the Democrats’ retaking the House are much better. Multiple polls in recent months have shown generic Democratic candidates beating generic Republicans by as many as 15 points — a spread that, in past elections, correlated with winning more than enough seats for the Democrats to gain a House majority next year. And if they do, the consequences will be enormous. A Democrat-controlled House in 2019 would very likely derail the Republican legislative agenda. It could also conceivably set the stage for impeachment proceedings against the president — a move that many Democrats have openly proposed for months now.

But the Democrats’ path back from the wilderness is not a short one. No president since Ronald Reagan has won the presidency as convincingly, twice over, as Obama did — but those victories papered over an extraordinary decline in his party that became suddenly unignorable on Nov. 9, 2016. The Democratic National Committee today is an understaffed, demoralized bureaucracy. It has raised less than half of what its Republican counterpart has taken in so far this year. (Other party organizations — the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee — are faring better.)

Democratic presidents have generally been less than attentive to the financial and electoral health of their party, during and after their presidencies. The Northwestern political-science professor Daniel J. Galvin writes in his 2010 book, “Presidential Party Building,” that since John F. Kennedy, each of them “neglected, exploited or undercut his party’s organizational capacities.” Galvin found that this maltreatment was because such presidents had operated with “deep and durable majorities” in Congress. After the Democrats lost theirs in 1994, President Bill Clinton awakened to the virtues of party-building. Galvin predicted that Obama would most likely have sufficient reason to do the same.

Instead, Obama was every bit as indifferent as his predecessors. After he took office, his campaign’s formidable grass-roots organization, rechristened Organizing for America, became what some party leaders complained was a “shadow organization” that drained resources from the D.N.C. while championing the president rather than the Democratic Party as a whole. The president did not have anywhere near the kind of close relationship with the last D.N.C. chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, that George W. Bush had with the Republican National Committee chairmen Ed Gillespie and Ken Mehlman.

In 2012, Obama’s campaign chose not to contribute any money to the D.S.C.C. during that cycle — and then, emerging from its victory that year with a $20 million debt, the campaign promptly offloaded it onto the D.N.C. In early 2014, Obama assured Senate Democrats that keeping the Senate majority was his “No. 1 priority.” Months passed without any further action. Finally, two months before the midterms, Obama informed Harry Reid by phone that he was authorizing a $5 million transfer of D.N.C. funds to Senate election efforts. Reid tersely replied, “It shouldn’t have been this hard.”

Few of the Obama campaigns’ innovations have meaningfully outlasted his presidency. Their once-pioneering digital-organizing operation, for example, went largely to ground in 2016, while the party failed to fully grasp even the basics, like the usefulness of digital advertising. “What I can tell you,” says Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, who oversaw an analysis of the party’s shortcomings in the last election cycle, “is that our candidates and their staff told us that the Republicans did much better digitally than we did. And they spent more than us on digital.” (Teddy Goff, Obama’s former digital director, says: “I sincerely wish the technology built in the two Obama campaigns had been put to better use for 2016 and races down the ballot.”)

State Democratic Party leaders complain about O.F.A. — rebranded again recently as Organizing for Action — hoarding campaign resources to little end. And Priorities USA, the extravagantly funded super PAC that was started to support Obama’s 2012 campaign, never built the kind of entrenched ground-level presence maintained by its analogues on the right. In contrast, Americans for Prosperity, the conservative network financed by David and Charles Koch, spent the Obama years establishing a network of more than three million activists in 36 states and mobilizing them to protest against Obamacare, environmental regulations and tax increases — becoming what the group’s president, Tim Phillips, described to me as “a state-based long-game organization that would always be there.” The current chairman of Priorities USA, Guy Cecil, acknowledges the disparity: “Most of our activities, most of our structures, are built around individual fights, or individual candidates, or individual organizations, and I think that’s put us at a disadvantage.”

Organizational and technological lapses do not fully account for the Democratic Party’s travails. “All that stuff is like the field-goal team,” the Obama strategist David Axelrod told me. “None of it will help you if you haven’t already moved 80 yards down the field. Being technologically proficient wouldn’t have saved Obama if he didn’t also have a consistent, compelling message.”

But that message had grown threadbare by 2016. No longer was it sufficient to campaign on hope and change, or even on the president’s successful efforts in 2009 to stave off a deep recession. The uneven economic recovery raised questions about the party’s obliviousness to the impunity of Wall Street and the gap between the megawealthy and everyone else. Hakeem Jeffries, the New York congressman who was an author of “A Better Deal,” admits, “We developed a blind spot for the economic challenges that still remained unmet.”

By the end of Obama’s presidency, the Democratic Party had lost nearly a thousand seats in state legislatures across America. It had forfeited its majority in both the House and the Senate. A mere 16 of the nation’s 50 governors were Democrats — and that number dwindled to 15 in August, when Jim Justice of West Virginia announced with a grinning Donald Trump at his side that he, too, had decided to become a Republican.

A few days after the election, Ian Russell quit his job as the deputy executive director of the D.C.C.C. and cashed in his frequent-flier miles on a trip to Ireland. He watched Trump’s swearing-in on his phone in a Dublin pub over a pint of Guinness, and then a few more. The following morning, he threw his bags in a rental car and began a sort of weeklong post-traumatic odyssey, rambling westward to the coast.

Russell, now 33, had spent the past six years at the D.C.C.C. trying to help the Democrats regain the House majority that they lost to the Republicans in the 2010 midterm election. During every election cycle, political journalists and donors would file into one of the drab conference rooms inside the D.N.C. headquarters near the Capitol and watch as D.C.C.C. officials like Russell unveiled maps and polling data in support of the claim that this election cycle — unlike the last one — was going to break for the Democrats. Each time, Russell maybe half-believed it.

But election night left him reeling. It wasn’t just that Trump had upset Clinton — including in Russell’s home state, Michigan — or that the Democrats emerged 24 seats short of a House majority. What gnawed at him was a fear that Trump might actually win over Democratic voters more lastingly. Benton Harbor, a few miles down the road from Russell’s hometown in the western part of the state, lost its last Whirlpool manufacturing facility years ago. The childhood friends of his who remained in the area had renounced the Democrats and were now Trump voters. “Trump could transform American politics,” he remembers thinking at the time. “He could truly scramble things.”

But Russell’s fears of a unifying, postpartisan pragmatist in chief swiftly proved unjustified. Rather than focusing on jobs and infrastructure projects, Trump immediately set in motion an attempt to repeal Obamacare and ordered a travel ban on citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, which was met with demonstrations at airports across the country. On Jan. 30, the nonpartisan Hill analyst Stuart Rothenberg published a column headlined “Trump’s Fast Start Likely Puts the House in Play in 2018.” Rothenberg reasoned that overly aggressive new presidents tended to be judged harshly by the electorate in the middle of their first term. “The House map favors Republicans, but the midterm dynamic could well prove more powerful,” he wrote, listing 20 Republican seats — out of 24 the Democrats would need to flip the House — that, if typical midterm election patterns held, would most likely be imperiled. “Nothing is yet guaranteed, but don’t be surprised if the House is up for grabs in the fall of 2018.”

Late on his last evening in Ireland, Russell was drinking a final Guinness and listening to a passable folk band at the Palace Bar in Dublin while halfheartedly scrolling through the news back home on his phone when he came across Rothenberg’s column. He read through to the end with an accelerating heartbeat. It seemed big news to him that Rothenberg, a dispassionate prognosticator, had confidently issued such a prediction just 10 days into Trump’s presidency.

Back in Washington, Russell joined a relatively new political media consulting firm, Beacon Media, and started hunting for prospective 2018 House candidates. In early March, he traveled to California’s Orange County — historically a G.O.P. stronghold, though its wealthy population included growing numbers of Asian-Americans who tended to vote Democratic. In Irvine he met with Dave Min, a wry 41-year-old law professor who had worked on the Hill as a senior policy adviser to Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, and at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress.

Min, the father of three young children, had never considered running for political office before. But he was also a son of Korean immigrants and was appalled by the Trump administration’s attempts to ban Muslims from entering the United States. The incumbent congresswoman of California’s 45th District, Mimi Walters, was a little-known two-term Republican who had never faced serious opposition. She had won by nearly 18 points in 2016, but Clinton beat Trump in the district by more than five points. A strong anti-Trump sentiment in 2018 could work to Min’s benefit. In April, he told Russell that he was in.

Russell then traveled to the Illinois suburbs just west of Chicago. Like California’s 45th District, the Sixth District of Illinois had been reliably Republican for decades. But Clinton beat Trump there by seven points, and already its six-term congressman, Peter Roskam, was avoiding public appearances lest he be called upon to answer for the president. The progressive women’s group Emily’s List had referred Russell to Kelly Mazeski, a longtime public servant on local boards and commissions who had already decided to challenge Roskam. Mazeski was a breast-cancer survivor whose platform, she told me recently, was “health care, health care, health care.” Russell helped Mazeski time her announcement for May 4, the day Roskam and his fellow House Republicans voted for a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Scores of candidates were announcing their intentions in terrain recently considered inhospitable to Democrats: West Virginia, Texas, Kansas. Some aspirants Russell met lacked the talent to match their enthusiasm. Others were hot property and elected to go with one of Beacon Media’s competitors. But by Labor Day, Russell and his firm had picked up 10 Democratic challengers. Among them were a few beguiling dark horses, like a 46-year-old physician and former Y.M.C.A. national health officer from Portage, Mich., named Matt Longjohn. Undeterred by his lack of political experience, Longjohn was challenging Fred Upton, a Republican who had represented Michigan’s Sixth District for three decades.

Russell himself grew up in the Sixth District and cast his first ballot as a registered voter against Upton in 2002. Back then, the incumbent seemed invincible. But now, after leading the committee that wrote the legislation seeking to eviscerate Obamacare, Upton was avoiding town halls and any other public events.

Still, when I met Russell recently, his optimism was tempered by previous electoral disappointments. The Democratic Party now has more candidates than it can support, and next spring is likely to be a season of what national Democratic officials tactfully refer to as “messy primaries.” And even with Trump as a foil, Russell’s candidates were struggling to make a case for themselves. “Right now it’s such a target-rich environment for us,” he told me. But “we’re having trouble explaining why we’re the heroes and the Republicans are the villains. At some point, our narrative will have to become more coherent than it is now.”

In pursuit of the 24 seats Democrats need to win the House, the D.C.C.C. intends to target 80 Republican-held districts — a dozen more than the party went after in its 2006 bonanza year, when it captured a majority after gaining 31 seats. Many of next year’s seem to be fanciful propositions, or strategic plays designed to force the G.O.P. to spend resources where it would rather not. In other cases, the D.C.C.C. is counting districts held by controversial Republicans — Chris Collins of New York, with his aggressive advocacy of a biotech firm in which he held substantial investments; Duncan D. Hunter of California, with the possibility of a federal indictment for supposed campaign fund malfeasances hanging over his head — who nonetheless appear safe, at least for the moment. But four Republican representatives in potential swing districts — Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Dave Reichert, Charlie Dent and Pat Tiberi — have already announced their retirement in advance of 2018, and more are expected to follow before the end of the year.

Only three times in the last century (during the Great Depression, after Bill Clinton’s impeachment and after the Sept. 11 attacks) has a president’s party not suffered electoral losses midway into his first term. Those losses — an average of 32 House seats in each such midterm since 1862 — increase to 36 when the president’s approval rating is under 50. President Trump’s polling average has never once exceeded a favorability rating of 48 percent, and it now hovers at about 37 percent.

“I think the best thing the Democrats can do,” Zac Petkanas, formerly the director of rapid response for the Clinton campaign, told me, “is find as many people with a pulse, with a D next to their names, in as many districts as possible, and run on Obamacare and standing up to Trump.” But so much of the politics, and political mood, of Trump’s presidency is off the map of previous experience that other Democrats have seemed at times at a loss for how to respond. What to make of the late August NBC poll, for instance, that showed Democrats being viewed unfavorably by 54 percent of those surveyed, which was better than Republicans (61) and Trump (61), but also Pelosi (64)? Was that good news or bad news? And what about the D.C.C.C. focus groups and polls yielding the conclusion that voters broadly dislike Trump but are also put off by candidates who profess to be “standing up to Trump,” on the grounds that such resistance will only guarantee more dysfunction in Washington?

Republicans are hopeful that, Trump being the exception to almost every political rule, the historical trends of wave elections will also not apply to him. “Clinton came up against a wave in 1994 because he had campaigned as a centrist but then led with gays in the military and Hillarycare,” Karl Rove, the former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, told me. “The 2006 election was a wave because Republicans were defending the Iraq war and crippled by a late-breaking ethics scandal. Democrats faced a wave in 2010 because of Obamacare. So it’s been issues that have driven wave elections. This time around, I think it’s more a personal antagonism to Trump. And the question is, how critical will that be in shaping the attitudes of swing voters?”

But by Rove’s own analysis, two of the last three wave elections were triggered by health care policies that did not approach the deep unpopularity of the G.O.P.’s attempts this year to repeal or otherwise roll back Obamacare. And Trump’s base cannot be counted on to prevent a wave in 2018, because a key constituency — less-educated white voters — is a group that tends not to show up during midterms. They may have even less motivation to do so next year, considering Trump’s periodic denunciations of the Republican lawmakers who will need their votes.

But in four special elections to fill seats vacated by House Republican incumbents this year, the Democrats fell short — and in the case of Georgia’s Jon Ossoff, lost by four points even after raising an unheard-of $23 million. His was the most expensive House race ever, and the fact that Democratic donors spent so heavily on a loss may help explain why the party’s fund-raising has diminished since then. The Democrats’ base — young and nonwhite voters — is no better than Trump’s at showing up for midterm elections and is unhelpfully clustered in urban districts. Many suburban and rural districts were artfully gerrymandered by Republican state legislators after the 2010 census and have proved impenetrable since then; they aren’t likely to change hands without a healthy number of recent Republican voters being persuaded to vote Democratic.

There is also a less quantifiable problem, the one that vexed Pelosi’s team in the months after the election: the Democratic Party’s chronic difficulty explaining just what it stands for. “There’s a deep worldview among conservative intellectuals that moved its way through a fear of fascism in the 1940s, through think tanks and campaigns and the California tax revolt of the 1970s,” Felicia Wong, president of the progressive Roosevelt Institute, says. “And basically the Democrats don’t have that. The New Deal was one thing, and the Great Society was another thing. The party never fully recognized that Jim Crow and segregation were economic decisions. That left Democrats with an incoherent economic argument. The result is that they lack a historical vocabulary.”

Questions about the interplay of race and economics, of course, aren’t just historical after the 2016 election — as much as politicians and operatives might want them to be. Plenty of progressives hold the view, as the MSNBC host Joy Ann Reid has argued on Twitter, that white working-class voters “resent the changes that racial and religious multiculturalism have brought to societies where people like them have been the majority.” But a former colleague of Reid’s at MSNBC, Krystal Ball, now president of the People’s House Project — which seeks to elect Democratic congressional candidates in G.O.P. districts — insists that the primary motivation of these voters is economic. “People who are holding onto their livelihoods by their fingernails thought that at least Trump gave a crap,” she says. “Maybe it was a pack of lies he was selling them, but at least he didn’t hold them in contempt. And frankly there’s a lot of contempt from certain corners of our party. And a billion dollars’ worth of ads saying we’re not elitists won’t change that.”

Early on the morning of July 27, a group of House Democrats held a private gathering in the Capitol basement with a special guest: Rahm Emanuel, the Chicago mayor and former Obama chief of staff, who over a decade ago, when he was an Illinois congressman, served as chairman of the D.C.C.C. Looking ahead to 2018, Emanuel offered a broad-brushstroke plan of attack: “Find the specific issues that resonate in your district,” he said, according to one meeting participant’s notes. “We want to appeal to Trump voters who are already pulling away from him.” In particular, “Suburbs are our best opportunities.” On the matter of ideological purity, he was blunt: “It’s not a question of left versus center — it’s forward versus backward.”

If this advice sounded familiar, it was because Emanuel advocated the same strategy a dozen years earlier, when he was trying to lift his party out of the trough it had occupied since the Newt Gingrich-led takeover of the House by the Republicans in 1994. Emanuel focused on recruiting more centrist candidates who were well liked in their districts rather than on ideological darlings of the national party. “The people who criticized me back in 2006 were from my own party,” he told me recently. “When I was recruiting candidates, I’d get yelled at: ‘Why is he getting all these sheriffs and military guys?’ It’s because they were running in red districts!”

The election cemented Emanuel’s legend as a tactician — none of the Democrats attending the July 27 meeting expressed skepticism about his advice — but his strategy has never sat well with the party’s progressive activists. “I would just point to the fact that Rahm Emanuel’s Democrats who won in 2006 couldn’t hold those seats,” Stephanie Taylor, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (P.C.C.C.), which supports, trains and funds candidates, told me.

She was referring to the nearly a dozen Democrats who rode the 2006 wave into Congress, only to wash back out of it with the Tea Party wave four years later. (Three more had lost in 2008.) “I would suggest a counterfactual,” she went on: “If we had true economic populist champions who made the case to the American people about fighting for a strong economic agenda, we might have had more lasting success.” Or as the P.C.C.C.’s other founder, Adam Green, put it to me: “If there’s a Democratic wave in 2018, progressives won’t just ride that wave — we will cause that wave.”

Of course, activists like Green and Taylor also vowed to be the tip of the party’s spear in the previous cycle, with not much to show for it. Indeed, the Breitbart chairman and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon scornfully likens the Democrats’ ideological tussles to a “pillow fight,” further charging that progressives will never accomplish their goals “until they have a Breitbart on the left,” he told me. “Our stock in trade is going after the Republican establishment. There’s no one like that on the other side.”

Most if not all Democrats are more than happy to watch Bannon’s kamikaze antics wreak havoc on the opposition. Still, some in the party rue the lack of pugnacity on their own side. “There are two types of Democrats,” David Krone, Harry Reid’s former chief of staff, told me one afternoon this summer in the Midtown Manhattan office where he now works as a consultant for an investment firm. “There are killers, and there are whiners. Unfortunately, we have too many of the latter and not enough of the former.”

Krone considers piety an obstacle to progressive policies. “Democrats are not that pure,” he told me, with a biting smile. “All those guys have a transactional component to them.” Under Reid’s leadership, the Democrats managed to pass important legislation like the Affordable Care Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act while also thwarting a stream of conservative bills generated by the Republican-controlled House. But it was also Reid who held his colleagues to the deal that garnered the pharmaceutical industry’s support for Obamacare by agreeing to take Medicare drug prices off the table. When the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision in 2010 opened the floodgates for outside-group contributions, Reid did not join the chorus of bemoaners. Instead, he ordered up a super PAC, called the Senate Majority PAC, to help keep the Senate in Democratic hands during the 2010 and 2012 cycles. “Reid just never pretended to be something he wasn’t,” Krone said. “You don’t want to pass health care? Fine. Don’t make deals. Keep losing.”

In the Democratic Killers Hall of Fame, Krone places Emanuel and Pelosi. But lately, Krone observed, the party seemed to be tilting toward the whiners — beginning with the excuses offered for Hillary Clinton’s defeat. “It’s insane,” he said. “They freaking lost! They can blame anyone they want to, but they fail to look in the mirror.”

The 2018 cycle, Krone argued, was no time for squeamishness. Again he cited the example of his former boss Reid, who, like many Democrats in 2010, was a heavy underdog going into his final Senate race. Rather than be cowed by a Republican field that, at the peak of the Tea Party movement, had been infiltrated by the party’s fringe, Reid turned that to his advantage. His campaign waded into the Republican primary, targeting the most formidable G.O.P. opponents one by one until the only one left standing was Sharron Angle: a Tea Party favorite who once crusaded against water fluoridation and claimed multiple American cities were under the rule of Shariah law. Reid beat her easily.

By way of contrast, Krone pointed to Russ Feingold, the Wisconsin senator who, with John McCain, was a standard-bearer for campaign-finance reform, as well as a crusader for civil liberties during the Bush years. Feingold lacked Reid’s appetite for the jugular, losing to Ron Johnson in 2010 and then again in 2016. “He had his foot on Johnson’s neck, and then he let up, because he was up in the polls,” Krone lamented. “They don’t hand out participation trophies in politics.” If the party limited itself to high-minded campaigning and legislating, “We’ll lose again, and Kennedy” — the Supreme Court justice — “will retire, and Trump will get to appoint another conservative crazy, and the Democrats will wonder how things got to be so horrible.”

Still, the party faces a conundrum in its pursuit of Trump voters whose anxieties aren’t just economic but cultural as well. Prevailing in some red districts may require, at minimum, tempering the party’s progressivism on social issues. “When anybody talks about a so-called litmus test for candidates, that upsets me,” Representative Cheri Bustos told me. “I’m from Illinois, where I’m the only downstate Democrat in our entire delegation. I’ve been a Democrat my whole life, and my core values are very much in line with what hard-core Democrats believe. I don’t ever lie about my views. However, I also don’t talk about issues that are by their very nature divisive. If asked, I’ll answer I’m pro-choice. But then I’ll get back to the economy.”

But a week after Bustos and I spoke, the D.C.C.C.’s chairman, Ben Ray Luján, enraged liberal groups by saying that his organization would not oppose House candidates in favor of restricting abortion. Seeking to douse the fire, Meredith Kelly, the D.C.C.C. communications director, released a statement clarifying that the D.C.C.C. listed abortion rights as among the “fundamental tenets of the Democratic Party” and that the recruits it was backing “represent the values of the party.”

Adam Green of the P.C.C.C. was adamant on the prospect of anti-abortion recruits: “We wouldn’t welcome candidates who are pushing anti-choice policies into the big tent any more than we would welcome racists and people who want to deregulate Wall Street.” Green wasn’t buying the implication by Bustos and other moderates that the Democratic Party will regain a majority only if it backs away from progressive ideals. He urged me to talk to Rick Nolan, a progressive rural Minnesota congressman who, he said, “wins the right way.”

Nolan is a folksy 73-year-old journeyman politician and businessman who has long advocated a single-payer health system. He also hunts, fishes, makes his own maple syrup and in other ways stays attuned to the culture of Minnesota’s Eighth District. Taking Green’s advice, I asked Nolan whether he would welcome an anti-abortion candidate into the Democratic caucus. “Wholeheartedly,” he said. “If there’s a fault today among Democrats, it’s that they’ve got the worst litmus test known to humankind. If we want to achieve the goals progressives want, we’ve got to get back into the majority. Democrats are damned fools if they don’t see that.”

There was one thing on which the Democrats I interviewed, across the spectrum — Adam Green, David Krone, Krystal Ball, Meredith Kelly — agreed: that I should watch a YouTube ad that was posted in June on behalf of a 52-year-old Wisconsin ironworker named Randy Bryce. Bryce, whose prodigious mustache has earned him the nickname Ironstache, is aiming to unseat the current officeholder of Wisconsin’s First District, Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House. The emotionally charged ad announcing his campaign culminates in a challenge: “Let’s trade places. Paul Ryan, you can come work the iron, and I’ll go to D.C.”

One rainy late summer afternoon, I met up with the ad’s creator, a 42-year-old Army veteran named Bill Hyers, in a Washington hotel bar overcrowded with well-dressed young professionals. Hyers was sipping an old-fashioned when I arrived. He was dressed in a T-shirt and khaki shorts, his preferred business attire. Hyers has successfully managed the campaigns of well-established Democratic politicians like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, and his own politics are straightforwardly liberal. At the same time, he harbors a Holden Caulfield-esque disdain of insincerity and believes that this quality, more than whining or ideological perfectionism, explains his party’s state of decline.

“What’s terrible about Democrats like Rahm Emanuel,” Hyers said, “is that it matters more to them if you’re a candidate who can raise money from very wealthy people than if you have an argument to make. They look at everything through the old Clinton triangulation strategy. Put out very carefully prepared statements. Don’t let anyone get to your right. Deny and ignore. Never have an honest dialogue. It was a bad strategy back in the ’90s. But it’s even worse today, because we can now have 24-7 access to candidates, and people can see when they’re not being authentic. Everything Hillary Clinton did was carefully scripted — they could see that.”

Hyers’s client Bryce has been the undisputed breakout star of the 2018 cycle so far; the announcement ad has attracted millions of views. (Such enthusiasm, it should be said, does not yet make Bryce any less of a long shot: The D.C.C.C. does not currently include Wisconsin’s First District among its 80 targeted seats.) The afternoon we met, Hyers showed me a rough cut of an ad for his newest client, a former Army champion boxer and ex-opioid addict from Staten Island named Boyd Melson — known in the ring as the Rainmaker — who is running for New York’s 11th District. Melson’s YouTube rollout, like Bryce’s, is replete with stirring proletarian imagery: neighborhoods festooned with American flags, an aloof Republican incumbent dodging town halls, Melson alone in the ring pummeling the air with slow-motion jabs. It suggests a trailer for “Rocky Goes to Washington.”

“I can only take a little credit for them,” Hyers admitted after the two-and-a-half-minute ad came to an end. Bryce’s and Melson’s ads, he told me, had a co-producer: Matt McLaughlin, a veteran of TV advertising who “didn’t know campaigns and politics, but he knows art.” Hyers did not think the party’s need for “authentic candidates” and a little theatrical verve were incompatible. If anything, the role the confluence of those two perceived assets played in Trump’s victory is one of the few inarguable lessons of the 2016 election.

This lesson, however unacknowledged, is playing out across the 2018 electoral landscape. In Kentucky, a former Marine fighter pilot named Amy McGrath appears in a bomber jacket, declaring that her “new mission” is to “take on a Congress full of career politicians.” Assessing her candidacy’s apparent long odds, she says, with a cockeyed grin, “We’ll see about that.” Another web ad shows a dashing scientist in a white lab coat: Hans Keirstead, a pioneering stem-cell researcher now running to represent California’s 48th District and billing himself as the very definition of a “problem solver.”

In mid-August, I spoke to Ian Russell’s latest client, a telegenic Marine veteran and two-term state representative from Lewiston, Me., named Jared Golden. Lewiston today is a hollowed-out exoskeleton of a textile mill town. “Our way of life is under attack here,” Golden said. “We’re a classic case of the America that’s being left behind. The social-identity issues that have been emphasized in Portland don’t resonate in rural Maine. It’s damaged the Democratic brand here, to be honest. We’re a community of hard-working people who may not be highly educated, but that doesn’t mean we’re not intelligent. The majority of the folks here voted for Donald Trump, and I can tell you that the description of them as a basket of deplorables is just dead wrong.”

Golden told me that his neighbors had until recently thought of themselves as Democrats. Golden himself still is. When we spoke, he had just decided to run in Maine’s Second District against the Republican incumbent, Bruce Poliquin. Golden would be the fifth Democrat to enter the race. He seemed to have little use for the national party’s “A Better Deal” pitch, telling me, “It’s going to take more than a glossy new policy document to take back the U.S. House.”

What, then, would it take? A few days after I spoke with Golden, Ian Russell traveled to Lewiston and shot his candidate’s announcement ad. It mixes twilit images of small-town Maine with footage of the candidate in combat fatigues; later, he jogs down a country road wearing a T-shirt that says, “Pain Is Weakness Leaving the Body.” The ad excoriates the Republican incumbent but also bipartisan trade deals and unnamed political leaders who push “issues that don’t impact your life.”

MONDAY PUZZLE — The crossword editor Will Shortz has called this period of time the “golden age of puzzles,” which makes it especially funny to me that a crossword puzzle then goes ahead and declares six of its own ages. It’s very meta, to use a colloquialism, and a decent start to our solving week.

Today’s Theme

Timothy Polin offers us a theme set of six words that all end in -AGE, and separates the suffix from the base word to make a new AGE, as it were. Mr. Polin manages to pack a lot of theme material comfortably within his grid.

For example, at 39A, the word BONDAGE is split into BOND AGE and clued as “Period known for its 007 movies?” Similarly, at 50A, the word COVERAGE is split into COVER AGE and clued as “Period when tribute bands thrived?” because tribute bands play covers of songs.

I liked this set, although the top entry, 17A’s ANCHORAGE, stood out to me as a place name in a set of nonplace name words. And we have OWIE crossing BOBO, which in itself is not an issue, but they are not great entries. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, I enjoyed seeing the debut of SAFE SPACE and am glad that it was not clued derogatorily. I also enjoyed the moment of thought I had to give to the cleverly written 10D, when I realized that CLOCKS are not seen in casinos purposely, so that gamblers will lose track of time and bet more.

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

Ms. King was taking several dance classes a week and practicing yoga, and she thought the stress of these activities might be causing the pain in her tight, inflexible back. But after a number of Feldenkrais sessions, she told Ms. Ramin, “I realized that the pain had more to do with the way I carried myself every day.”

Even after just one session, I understood what she meant. When I make a point of walking upright and fluid, sitting straight, even cooking relaxed and unhurried, I have no pain. The slow, gentle, repetitive movements I practiced in a Feldenkrais group class helped foster an awareness of how I use my body in relation to my environment, and awareness is the first step to changing one’s behavior.

One common problem of which I’m often guilty is using small muscles to accomplish tasks meant for large, heavy-duty ones, resulting in undue fatigue and pain.

The group class, called Awareness Through Movement, was followed by an individual session called Functional Integration with a therapist that helped to free tight muscles and joints that were limiting my motion and increasing my discomfort. Using gentle manipulation and passive movements, the therapist individualized his approach to my particular needs.

The ultimate goal of both sessions is, in effect, to retrain the brain – to establish new neural pathways that result in easy, simple movements that are physiologically effective and comfortable. Although the Feldenkrais method was developed in the mid-20th century, neurophysiologists have since demonstrated the plasticity of the brain, its ability to form new cells, reorganize itself and, in effect, learn new ways to do things.

The beauty of Feldenkrais lessons is that they are both relatively low-cost (group classes average $15 to $25, individual sessions $100 to $200) and potentially accessible to nearly everyone. There are more than 7,000 teachers and practitioners working in 18 countries, including large numbers in the United States. You can be any age, strength, fitness level and state of well-being to participate. The exercises are slow, gentle and adjustable to whatever might ail you. Their calming effect counters the stress that results in contracted muscles, tightness and pain.

Many Feldenkrais practitioners, like Marek Wyszynski, director of the New York center, start professional life as physical therapists, although many other practitioners begin with no medical background. They then undergo three and a half years of training to become certified in the Feldenkrais method.

Mr. Wyszynski explained that he starts by observing how patients are using their skeletons – how they sit, stand and walk in ways that may cause or contribute to their pathology, be it spinal disc disease, arthritis, shoulder pain or damaged knee joints. In accordance with Dr. Feldenkrais’s astute observation, “If you don’t know what you are doing, you can’t do what you want,” patients are then given a clear sensory experience of how their posture and behavior contribute to their pain and physical limitations.

For example, some people may use excessive force, clench their teeth, hold their breath or rush, causing undue muscle tension and skeletal stress. Years ago, I realized that my frequent headaches resulted from an unconscious habit of clenching my jaw when I concentrated intently on a task like sewing or cooking. Feldenkrais teachers do not give formulas for a proper way of behaving; rather, they rely on their patients’ ability to self-discover and self-correct.

Once aware of their counterproductive habits, students are given the opportunity to experience alternative movements, postures and behaviors and, through practice, create new habits that are less likely to cause pain.

Mr. Wyszynski told me that there are more than 1,000 distinct Feldenkrais lessons currently available, most of which involve everyday actions like reaching, getting up from a chair, turning, bending and walking.

As a mechanical engineer and physicist, Dr. Feldenkrais understood that the job of the human skeleton was to accommodate the effects of gravity in order to remain upright. And he wanted people to achieve this in the most efficient way possible.

Using two tall foam cylinders, one perched on top of the other, Mr. Wyszynski demonstrated a guiding principle of the Feldenkrais method. When the top cylinder was centered on the bottom one, it stood in place without assistance. But when it was off center, perched near the edge of the bottom cylinder, it tipped over. If instead of cylinders these were someone’s skeletal parts that were askew, tightened muscles would have to keep the patient from falling over.

As Mr. Wyszynski explained, “Good posture allows the skeleton to hold up and support the body without expending unnecessary energy despite the pull of gravity. However, with poor posture, the muscles are doing part of the job of the bones, and with poor skeletal support, the muscles have to remain contracted to prevent the body from falling.”",Trying the Feldenkrais Method for Chronic Pain,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/well/trying-the-feldenkrais-method-for-chronic-pain.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mr. Martin, who was the oldest living veteran of the House of Representatives, was in the first wave of a political tide that in the years to come would turn the South into a largely Republican bastion.

In 1964, he and four others became the first Republicans to be elected to Congress from Alabama since Reconstruction, in an election in which the party’s presidential candidate, Senator Barry M. Goldwater, carried the state despite losing to President Lyndon B. Johnson in a landslide.

While Republican candidates continued to make inroads elsewhere, however, their gains in Alabama were short-lived.

If Mr. Mueller is the stern-eyed public face of the investigation, Mr. Weissmann, 59, is its pounding heart, a bookish, legal pit bull with two Ivy League degrees, a weakness for gin martinis and classical music and a list of past enemies that includes professional killers and white-collar criminals.

Empowered by Mr. Mueller, for whom he previously worked as general counsel at the F.B.I., Mr. Weissmann has taken the lead in the government’s case against Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, whose indictment jolted the capital on Monday in a clear signal of the team’s seriousness.

But many defense lawyers have chafed at what they see as a scorched-earth approach, forged in Brooklyn while facing down Mafia members and refined on the government’s unit of Enron superprosecutors, which left a mixed legacy of high-profile successes, overturned convictions and one unanimous defeat at the Supreme Court.

It was Mr. Weissmann and his team who stunned Houston society by charging the wife of Enron’s chief financial officer with tax fraud, applying pressure on the executive, who became a star witness.

It was Mr. Weissmann, more recently, who oversaw the predawn raid of Mr. Manafort’s Virginia residence in July, when federal agents picked his lock and prosecutors communicated their intention to indict him.

When that moment came this week, representatives for Mr. Manafort and his longtime associate Rick Gates were given little warning: Prosecutors bypassed the common Justice Department practice of inviting lawyers to meet and discuss potential indictments beforehand, often an opportunity for the defense to argue for leniency and for prosecutors to identify potential holes in their case. As of Friday, people close to both men said they had received no indication that an indictment was imminent.

And while Mr. Mueller has remained the chief villain in the eyes of the president’s allies in conservative news media, efforts to discredit Mr. Weissmann have picked up. For months, Mr. Trump’s defenders have sought to draw attention to thousands of dollars in past donations from Mr. Weissmann to Democrats, including former President Barack Obama.

Then came the shock-and-awe raid of Mr. Manafort’s home — a Weissmann special, both admirers and critics recognized — the Zorro “Z” to announce his presence in the case.

“There’s a name,” the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh warned listeners last week, recapping the “intimidating technique” afoot. “Weissmann.”

On one end of the negotiating table sat Mr. Weissmann, the Princeton-educated son of a psychologist and a research scientist who is credited with codiscovering, and coining the term, liposomes.

On the other was Salvatore Gravano, a hitman-turned-informant better known as Sammy the Bull.

Mr. Weissmann and his team used Mr. Gravano as an explosive ally in their bid to prosecute high-ranking mobsters.

In the case of Mr. Gigante, Mr. Weissmann and his colleagues leaned on Mr. Gravano’s testimony, in large part, to dismantle a long-held insanity defense. Mr. Gigante, nicknamed “The Oddfather,” had been known to wander Greenwich Village in a bathrobe and pajamas, mumbling incoherently, tending to a feigned image of incompetence and cluelessness. “I’ve invested many years in this crazy act,” Mr. Gravano quoted Mr. Gigante as saying during court proceedings.

Mr. Weissmann, who declined to be interviewed for this article, even demonstrated that Mr. Gigante’s bathrobes were chosen with care: In public, his coverings were soiled and tattered. Inside, he slipped into something pristine.

“They respected him,” George A. Stamboulidis, Mr. Weissmann’s trial partner, said of his colleague and their mob witnesses. “He’s very bright and to the point but also has a pretty good read of his audience. It was definitely a relationship of mutual respect.”

Geoffrey S. Mearns, a former prosecutor in the Eastern District who is now the president of Ball State University in Indiana, said Mr. Weissmann’s personality mirrored that of the office — with its collection of scrappy, ambitious obsessives out to prove their relative mettle in a city where another office, the Southern District in Manhattan, was often viewed as more prestigious.

That their targets were some of the city’s most fearsome murderers tended to focus the mind, as well.

“He was trained in this environment that we were essentially going after these entrenched mob bosses,” Mr. Mearns said. “He’s trained as a prosecutor to be aggressive.”

‘I Don’t Drink Evian’

The locals did not all take well to their visitors from the federal government, dispatched to Houston after the collapse of Enron to investigate and prosecute the company’s fraud.

“Out-of-town, carpetbagging, Evian-swilling Department of Justice lawyers,” read one description in The Houston Chronicle.

This was an outrage, Mr. Weissmann told a reporter then. “I don’t drink Evian.”

It was this swagger that helped define the government’s posture as the task force went about its work, first with Mr. Weissmann as deputy director, then later as director. (Mr. Mueller, as F.B.I. director at the time, helped form the group.)

Their triumphs were many: With little precedent for such a complex inquiry into financial wrongdoing, the team won indictments and prison terms for almost all of the company’s top executives.

Mr. Weissmann was credited with acting on a hunch that Ben F. Glisan Jr., the former Enron treasurer who had already pleaded guilty without agreeing to cooperate, might be willing to say more. United States marshals hauled in Mr. Glisan from prison, at Mr. Weissmann’s direction, to appear before a grand jury. He became a key witness.

Prosecutors also initially earned a conviction of Arthur Andersen, an accounting firm charged with illegally destroying documents related to its audit of Enron, for obstruction of justice.

Colleagues praised his resourcefulness and legal guile. Opponents accused him of overreach, citing a series of overturned convictions and higher-court losses. Among the setbacks for the task force, the Arthur Andersen victory was unanimously overturned by the Supreme Court over a narrow issue involving jury instructions. Long before that outcome, the case had drawn ferocious criticism from members of the business community, who argued that the indictment alone amounted to a death sentence for the firm.

“It’s pretty clear that Weissmann created a culture in which they presumed that the people they were investigating were guilty,” said Tom Kirkendall, a Houston defense lawyer who represented clients on Enron-related cases.

This reputation has trailed Mr. Weissmann among some defense lawyers in the years since, propagated most vocally by a lawyer and author, Sidney Powell, whose work has been taken up by Trump allies like Newt Gingrich. (In 2015, Ms. Powell criticized Mr. Weissmann in an article for The New York Observer — which was owned by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law — after Mr. Weissmann was named to lead the Justice Department’s criminal fraud section.)

But those close to Mr. Weissmann — and some others less inclined to appreciate the work of prosecutors generally — have zealously defended his ethical compass.

Peter Neufeld, a civil rights lawyer and a founder of the Innocence Project, praised Mr. Weissmann’s nerve during his time at the F.B.I., as the agency grappled with the fallout of exonerations based on erroneous testimony from forensic hair examiners.

“He realized that what had gone on in the past was wrong,” Mr. Neufeld said, recalling Mr. Weissmann’s decision to order an audit of hundreds of convictions that may have relied on faulty testimony. “He did it. That was transformative.”

By 2013, both Mr. Weissmann and Mr. Mueller had left the agency. It seemed unlikely that they would partner again.

Mr. Warner hammered his point with blown-up prints of some of the Facebook posts that circulated. One featured an illustration of Hillary Clinton in a fistfight with a picture of Jesus, an inflammatory ad aimed at riling up conservative Americans.

Several senators trained their attacks on Facebook on Wednesday for its inadvertent role in the Russian influence campaign, a repeat of Tuesday’s Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing.

“I must say, I don’t think you get it,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who was also at Tuesday’s hearing. “I went home last night disappointed. I asked specific questions, I got vague answers.”

Republican defense: Russians didn’t elect Trump.

Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Senate Intelligence Committee’s Republican chairman, began the social media hearing with what amounted to an extraordinary defense of the legitimacy of President Trump’s election, pushing back on a narrative he said had been propagated by the media that Russia’s efforts had delivered victory.

“A lot of folks, including many in the media, have tried to reduce this entire conversation down to one premise: foreign actors conducted a surgically executed covert operation to help elect a United States president,” Mr. Burr said. “I’m here to tell you this story does not simplify that easily.”

Mr. Burr noted that five times more ads were targeted to Maryland, a safely Democratic state, than Wisconsin, a swing state that Mr. Trump narrowly carried. He said that more ads were targeted to Washington, D.C., an overwhelmingly Democratic area, than Pennsylvania. And he said that of the $1,979 spent ads in Wisconsin, all but $54 was spent before the primary.

He went on, but the message was clear.

“This isn’t about relitigating the 2016 presidential election. This isn’t about who one and who lost,” Mr. Burr said. “This is about national security. This is about corporate responsibility. And this is about the deliberate and multifaceted manipulation of the American people by agents of a hostile foreign power.”

Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho, picked up the line of questioning, as he pressed social media executives on the content of Russian advertising.

“My view of this is this is a whole lot broader than simply the 2016 election,” he said.

The executives agreed that Russian efforts were geared more toward sowing social discord that advocating directly for Mr. Trump or against Hillary Clinton.

But as Democrats noted, discord helped Mr. Trump’s grievance-based campaign.

“What we’re talking about is the beginning of cyber warfare. What we’re talking about is a major foreign power with the sophistication and ability to involve themselves in a presidential election and sow conflict and discontent all over this country,” said Ms. Feinstein.

Facebook defends reasons for taking down ads.

As senators pressed Facebook’s general counsel, Colin Stretch, on Facebook’s role in the election, one of the hallmarks of Facebook’s explanation has been the issue of “authentic accounts.”

Since Facebook went public with its findings, the company’s reasoning for taking down more than 80,000 fake, Russian-linked ads, was not the type of content they posted, but because those responsible for them had misrepresented who they were when creating the accounts.

That distinction is key for Facebook. Outside of some parameters like nudity or incitement to violence, executives at the company are wary of becoming the arbiters of what content is or is not allowed on Facebook, fearing accusations of censorship.

“We don’t take for granted that each one of you uses Facebook to connect with your constituents, and that the people you represent expect authentic experiences when they come to our platform to share,” Mr. Stretch said in his opening remarks on Tuesday.

Mr. Burr asked if Facebook would have shut down the 470 Russian-linked accounts if they weren’t fake.

“Does it trouble you it took this committee to look at the authentic nature of the users and the content?” Mr. Burr asked Facebook’s general counsel.

Mr. Stretch didn’t directly answer. “The authenticity issue is the key,” Mr. Stretch said, noting that many of those accounts would have been shut down anyway because they violated other terms of service.

But ads were only one way Russia influenced the election.

Political ads are just part of the problem, Mr. Warner said at Wednesday’s first hearing.

Russian agents spread nonpaid content through the creation of pages on Facebook dedicated to hot-button issues like race. On Twitter, the Kremlin-connected internet Research Agency used automatic messaging tools known as bots that could quickly spread tweets through multiple accounts.

“For Facebook, much of the attention has been focused on the paid ads Russian trolls targeted to Americans. However, these ads are just the tip of a very large iceberg,” Mr. Warner said. “The real story is the amount of misinformation and divisive content that was pushed for free on Russian-backed pages, which then spread widely on the news feeds of tens of millions of Americans.”

Twitter is still lowballing Russian intrusion.

Earlier this week, Twitter, Facebook and Google revealed new information and numbers showing that foreign interference on their site was worse than they first reported. But the companies all stressed that the amount of Russian propaganda that reached users was just a sliver of the total amount of content their platforms produce every day.

But some lawmakers think the companies are holding back information.

Twitter said it identified 2,752 accounts controlled by Russian operatives and more than 36,000 “bots” that tweeted 1.4 million times during the election. The company had previously told lawmakers it found only 201 accounts linked to Russia.

The new numbers still seem low, according to Mr. Warner.

“I’m concerned that Twitter seems to be vastly underestimating the number of fake accounts and bots pushing disinformation. Independent researchers have estimated that up to 15 percent of Twitter accounts – or potentially 48 million accounts – are fake or automated,” Mr. Warner said in his opening statement.

Mr. Burr also noted the slow reaction by internet companies.

With Facebook’s acknowledgment that 126 million people were exposed to Russia-linked content instead of the 10 million people they originally estimated, “tells me that your companies are just beginning to come grips with the scale and the depth of the problem,” Mr. Burr said.

“Your actions need to catch up to your responsibilities,” he added.

Google defends its stance on RT.

For a second straight day, Ms. Feinstein asked Google why it continues to allow RT to continue to publish videos on YouTube even though a report from the American intelligence community has described RT, formerly known as Russia Today, as the Kremlin’s “principal international propaganda outlet.”

Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel, walked a fine line, saying that RT’s influence goes beyond merely YouTube; he noted that RT is available on cable and satellite television packages. It advertises in newspapers and can be found on hotel television channels.

Google has reviewed RT’s content and found that no violations to YouTube’s community guidelines, Mr. Walker said. He said that the company provides information about the “government-funded nature” of RT on Google — presumably on search results — and said it is considering expanding that to YouTube. He didn’t elaborate how Google plans to do so.

On Tuesday in a separate hearing, Richard Salgado, Google’s director of law enforcement and information security, said Google dropped RT from its top advertising tier because of “a drop in viewership” — not because of its content.

Ms. Feinstein said Google’s answers were unsatisfactory. She repeated an earlier admonition of the tech companies: “We’re in a different day now.”

The executives left a judiciary subcommittee wanting.

Top executives for the three companies appeared before a judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday armed with regrets and pledges to do better. The lawmakers appeared to be unimpressed.

Facebook came under particularly heavy fire, as senators from both parties pressed the companies on their sluggish responses.

“Why has it taken Facebook 11 months to come forward and help us understand the scope of this problem, see it clearly for the problem it is, and begin to work in a responsible way to address it?” Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, asked in one pointed exchange.

The senators also raised doubts that efforts outlined by the companies — Facebook, for instance, said that it would hire more than 1,000 people to review political ad purchases — would protect the United States from outside influence.

“I’m trying to get us down from La-La Land here,” said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. “The truth of the matter is, you have five million advertisers that change every month. Every minute. Probably every second. You don’t have the ability to know who every one of those advertisers is, do you?”

Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, pushed the executives to weigh in on legislation that would require the companies to report who funds political ads online. In response, they suggested voluntary efforts already underway but said they hoped to work with lawmakers on such requirements.

The House committee will release copies of the Russian ads.

The House intelligence committee is expected on Wednesday to publicly release much-anticipated copies of Facebook ads purchased by Russian-linked accounts.

The top Republican and Democrat leading the investigation, Representatives Mike Conaway of Texas and Adam Schiff of California, pledged to do so this month after a meeting with Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer.

A few of the ads have leaked out, and others have been described by people who have viewed them, but the release should help cast new light on the Russian efforts.

Facebook’s bullish posture to Wall Street.

Wednesday will be a particularly busy day for Facebook, which will also report its third-quarter earnings at 4 p.m. Eastern, around the middle of the day’s second hearing.

The company, which is used by more than 2 billion people worldwide, is expected to post stellar results, with revenues from advertising jumping 41 percent from the same quarter last year to $9.88 billion.

With its stock trading at a record high and the company’s market capitalization over $500 billion — more than the gross domestic product of countries like Columbia and Taiwan — Facebook’s business success clashes with the posture it will present to lawmakers.

To members of Congress, Facebook will be contrite and stress the challenges of fixing its technology to prevent abuse of its site by foreign governments. But to investors, the message this afternoon will be decidedly bullish.

That contradiction is at the heart of the problem Facebook is confronting. Its business model, all based on advertising, is largely automated and reward the most viral content, even at the sake of the public interest.

The problem is worse than originally thought.

Facebook, Twitter and Google said on Monday, before their testimony, that the problems on the platforms were much worse than initially disclosed, illustrating the breadth and complexity of Russian efforts.

According to testimony by the companies, Russian agents spread inflammatory posts that reached 126 million Facebook users, published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded more than 1,000 videos to Google’s YouTube service.

The latest disclosure will most likely serve to underline complaints among lawmakers that the tech giants have been slow to recognize and react to the significance of the Russian campaign.

Mr. Warner has been sharply critical of Twitter, in particular, telling reporters in September that the company’s initial efforts “showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is.”

On Wednesday, Mr. Warner and others are likely to bore into the details of the companies’ internal investigations, questioning their rigor, as well remedies the companies have already volunteered.

They will also want to hear about solutions to issues beyond the disclosure of paid political advertising, like the influence of bots and “organic posts” harnessed by foreign powers.

WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, stripped a half-dozen scientists and academics of advisory positions Tuesday and issued new rules barring anyone who receives E.P.A. grant money from serving on panels that counsel the agency on scientific decisions.

The move will effectively bar a large number of academic researchers, many of them experts in fields ranging from toxicology to epidemiology, from advising the E.P.A. on scientific matters, since the agency is one of the largest funders of environmental research.

Mr. Pruitt was expected to appoint several industry representatives to the panels. He did not impose any new restrictions to prevent them from offering advice on environmental regulations that may affect their businesses.

Since 2013, Australia has paid Papua New Guinea to house hundreds of migrants caught at sea trying to reach the continent.

The latest attempt to shutter the Manus camp, which sits on a local naval base, has revived the controversy over Australia’s offshore detention policy, drawing condemnation from human rights groups and intensifying a political conflict between Australia and its nearest neighbor, Papua New Guinea.

Papua New Guinea has said that resettling the migrants, all of whom are men, is the exclusive responsibility of Australia, and that it would not force the detainees to settle on the island. Officials, however, told the men they had to vacate the camp on Tuesday.

The Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection, however, disputed that assessment. Australia has financed three alternative facilities in and around Lorengau and has pledged to provide food and other services to the migrants. How the men are moved to the new facilities is Papua New Guinea’s responsibility, the department said.

The closure of the camp and “the management of refugees and those found not to be refugees are matters for P.N.G.,” the department said Tuesday in an emailed statement.

Photographs posted online on Tuesday showed the detainees barricading the center with wire, in part to secure themselves from locals, who they claim are looting the camp.

The men also took legal action on Tuesday, claiming through their lawyer that being denied water, food and electricity violated their human rights.

Many of the men at the camp have actually had their asylum claims approved by the United States but are waiting for placement, according to two American officials with knowledge of the process. They said dozens if not hundreds of refugees from Manus and Nauru, the location of a second offshore facility, will be accepted in the coming weeks and months — adding to the about 50 men who have already moved to the United States under a deal brokered by former President Barack Obama.

Mr. Mohammad, who has gone through the vetting process, said it was not clear who would go, or when. And neither American nor Australian officials have provided a timeline.

Elaine Pearson, the Australia director at Human Rights Watch, said that even with the expected departures, many migrants would remain in Papua New Guinea for the foreseeable future.

“We know there is between 167 and 200 who are failed asylum seekers who definitely will not be going — and there are others, too,” she said.

Senator Nick McKim, of the Australian Greens party, who visited the island on Tuesday, called the standoff over the migrants a “humanitarian emergency.” He accused the Australian government of shirking its responsibility.

Mr. McKim posted photos from the camp online, showing the men sitting peacefully in the hot tropical sun.

They are stuck in legal and physical limbo, said David Manne, executive director of Refugee Legal, a group of Australian lawyers providing free legal assistance to asylum seekers.



“The future fate of all of these men remains completely uncertain,” he said. “Australia holds the key to this and any solution.”

“It is a highly volatile situation,” he added. “It could get dramatically worse very quickly.”



This year, a dispute between refugees and the local authorities over a soccer field at the facility resulted in shots being fired. One asylum seeker was injured.

A driver plowed a pickup truck down a crowded bike path along the Hudson River in Manhattan on Tuesday, killing eight people and injuring 11 before being shot by a police officer in what officials are calling the deadliest terrorist attack on New York City since Sept. 11, 2001.

The rampage ended when the motorist — whom the police identified as Sayfullo Saipov, 29 — smashed into a school bus, jumped out of his truck and ran up and down the highway waving a pellet gun and paintball gun and shouting “Allahu akbar,” Arabic for “God is great,” before he was shot in the abdomen by the officer. He remained in critical condition on Tuesday evening.

Mayor Bill de Blasio declared the rampage a terrorist attack and federal law enforcement authorities were leading the investigation. Investigators discovered handwritten notes in Arabic near the truck that indicated allegiance to the Islamic State, two law enforcement officials said. But investigators had not uncovered evidence of any direct or enabling ties between Mr. Saipov and ISIS and were treating the episode as a case of an “inspired” attacker, two counterterrorism officials said.

Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference, “Based on information we have at this moment, this was an act of terror, and a particularly cowardly act of terror aimed at innocent civilians.”

Five of the people killed were Argentine tourists who traveled to New York for a 30-year high school reunion celebration, said a senior official in Santa Fe Province, where they were from. The Argentine authorities said they were Hernán Mendoza, Diego Angelini, Alejandro Pagnucco, Ariel Erlij and Hernán Ferruchi. Martín Ludovico Marro, a sixth member of the group, was wounded. Belgian officials said one of those killed and three of the injured were from Belgium.

Mr. Saipov came to the United States from Uzbekistan in 2010, and had a green card that allowed permanent legal residence. He had apparently lived in Paterson, N.J., and Tampa, Fla. An official said Mr. Saipov rented a truck from a Home Depot in Passaic, N.J., where a white Toyota minivan believed to be his was found parked.

The truck came crashing to a stop near the corner of Chambers and West Streets by Stuyvesant High School. Sirus Minovi, 14, a freshman there who was hanging out with friends, said people scattered.

“We heard people screaming, ‘gun’ ‘shooter’ and ‘run away,’” Sirus said. “We thought it was a Halloween prank.”

He realized it was not a joke when he saw the man staggering through the intersection, waving guns and screaming words he could not make out. A passer-by approached the attacker, apparently trying to calm him, Sirus said, until the man realized the attacker had a gun. The man “put his hands up and was backing away,” Sirus said.

Almost immediately, as investigators began to look into Mr. Saipov’s history, it became clear that he had been on the radar of federal authorities. Three officials said he had come to the federal authorities’ attention as a result of an unrelated investigation, but it was not clear whether that was because he was a friend, an associate or a family member of someone under scrutiny or because he himself had been the focus of an investigation.

Over the last two years, a terrorism investigation by the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security, the New York Police Department and federal prosecutors in Brooklyn resulted in charges against five men from Uzbekistan and one from Kazakhstan of providing material support to ISIS. Several of the men have pleaded guilty. It is unclear whether Mr. Saipov was connected with that investigation.

Martin Feely, a spokesman for the New York F.B.I. office, declined to comment on whether Mr. Saipov was known to the bureau.

F.B.I. agents were expected to search Mr. Saipov’s home in Paterson, N.J., and his car on Tuesday night, a law enforcement official said. A phone, which was recovered at the scene of the attack, also would be searched, another official said.

The attack unfolded as nearby schools were letting out on a Halloween afternoon. It ended five blocks north of the World Trade Center. The driver left a roughly mile-long crime scene: a tree-lined bike path strewn with bodies, mangled bicycles and bicycle parts, from wheels twisted like pretzels to a dislodged seat.

Mr. Saipov, a slim, bearded man, was seen in videos running through traffic after the attack with a paintball gun in one hand and a pellet gun in the other. Six people died at the scene and two others died at a hospital, officials said. The authorities credited the officer who shot him with saving lives.

“He was Johnny-on-the-spot and he takes the guy down,” a city official said.

Coming five months after a car rammed into pedestrians in Times Square, killing one, Tuesday’s attack again highlighted the danger of a vehicle attack on busy city streets. The Times Square attack was not an act of terrorism. But both events brought to mind the terrorist attack last year in Nice, France, in which a cargo truck killed scores of people celebrating Bastille Day.

The episodes also evoked calls from terrorist magazines, including in an edition of Rumiyah, a magazine used by ISIS, for attackers to mow down pedestrians with trucks, continue the attacks with a knife or a gun and claim responsibility by shouting or leaving leaflets.

Students in Halloween costumes streamed out of nearby schools after lockdowns were lifted and huddled with parents. Their faces, once painted for the holiday, were streaked with tears.

Emily, 12, a seventh-grader at I.S. 289 whose father asked that her last name not be used, had been walking on her usual route home when other students turned and ran in the other direction.

“All the kids were screaming, ‘Run!’, ‘Gun!’ ‘Run inside,’” she said, still wearing cat ears. She said mothers pushing strollers and children in costumes ran in a herd back toward the school.

President Trump responded to the attack on Twitter: “In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!”

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo cautioned at a news conference, “There’s no evidence that suggests a wider plot or a wider scheme.” In the aftermath, city and state law enforcement agencies increased security at high-profile locations.

Terrorism analysts noted that on Monday a French pro-ISIS media unit, known as the Centre Mediatique An-Nur, put out a specific threat for Halloween, mentioning the date on a banner spread on the encrypted app Telegram and on ISIS-affiliated Twitter accounts.

Mr. Saipov wove a deadly path on a stretch usually bustling with commuters, runners and cyclists, drawn by the downtown offices nearby or the shimmering river.

He turned onto the bike path alongside the West Side Highway at Houston Street just after 3 p.m. and sped south, striking numerous pedestrians and cyclists, many of them in the back, the authorities said. People scattered and dived to the asphalt.

The truck, labeled with a sign saying, “Rent me starting at $19,” rammed into the bus near Chambers Street. The bus serves two schools in Lower Manhattan and transports students with special needs. Two adults and two children on the bus were injured, the authorities said.",Manhattan Terror Attack Kills 8 and Injures 11,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/nyregion/police-shooting-lower-manhattan.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

New Yorkers are infamous for regarding their city as the center of the universe and, on especially self-satisfied days, as the only place to be. This city’s theater artists, though, know that big things happen in small and out-of-the-way places. Consider some of the new productions opening this month.

Their settings, which embrace both real and unreal estate, include a quaint little Scottish village that exists beyond the borders of time, a tiny Israeli desert town most notable for its lack of distinguishing features, an American high school soccer field and most of the vast area classified as Latin America. And, oh yes, space — as in the cosmos, where meteors fly.

The Band’s Visit

Indisputable proof that boring (or at least bored) people can be terrifically exciting company, this beautiful and surprising musical from the composer David Yazbek and the playwright Itamar Moses takes place in a terminally sleepy provincial corner of Israel. But then a touring Egyptian band (mistakenly) winds up there, and new life blooms, shyly and unexpectedly, beneath desert skies. A sold-out hit for the Atlantic Theater Company in the spring, this wide-awake sleeper arrives on Broadway with most of its original team intact — including its inspired director, David Cromer, and a cast led by Tony Shalhoub and the incomparable Katrina Lenk.

Perhaps the ultimate “escape from New York” fantasy, this 1947 Lerner and Loewe musical drops two jaded Manhattanites into a mirage of a Scottish town that has never been tainted by urban bustle and stress. City Center has come up with a dream team to give life to this dream location. Its director and choreographer is Christopher Wheeldon, who triumphed with the stage version of “An American in Paris,” and the cast includes Kelli O’Hara, Patrick Wilson and the virtuosic dancer Robert Fairchild (who can act, too). Like the town of its title, this deluxe concert staging of “Brigadoon” will materialize only briefly, from Nov. 15 to 19, to be exact.

For an act to get the jukebox-musical treatment, hits are a minimum requirement. Abba, Frankie Valli and Carole King all had success on the charts before their music overtook Broadway with “Mamma Mia!,” “Jersey Boys” and “Beautiful.”

The Grateful Dead had only one Top 10 song, “Touch of Grey,” and yet here is “Red Roses, Green Gold,” Off Broadway at the Minetta Lane Theater. Not only that, but this is the third show the writer Michael Norman Mann has created using the Dead’s catalog, after “Cumberland Blues” in 1998 and “Shakedown Street” in 2005.

Not too bad for a band whose reputation was built on intense touring and extended live jams.

The good news is that the songs, which lean heavily on a classic Americana sound, are effective in a sit-down, smoke-free theatrical context. The show, which is billed as “featuring the music of Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter” (Mr. Hunter was the Dead’s nonperforming lyricist), sometimes feels like a wacky relative of the Steve Martin and Edie Brickell Broadway bluegrass musical “Bright Star.”

Even better for non-Deadheads, “Red Roses, Green Gold” lasts just over two hours rather than four, with numbers that mostly clock in around three or four minutes.

Unfortunately, Mr. Mann has shoehorned them into a cartoonishly corny story.

Like “Cumberland Blues,” the show takes place in a theme-park version of a Maryland mining town in the 1920s, more specifically at the saloon and mining company owned by the debonair Jackson Jones (Scott Wakefield). Alas, a pair of scheming brothers (Brian Russell Carey and Michael McCoy Reilly) have their sights on taking over the Palace, which is that in name only.","Review: ‘Red Roses, Green Gold’ Brings Back the Grateful Dead",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/theater/red-roses-green-gold-grateful-dead-review.html

Although the police have so far charged Mr. Shiraishi only with “abandoning bodies,” news reports on Tuesday described him as a serial killer who sought people who were thinking of killing themselves and who had expressed their dark thoughts on Twitter. The police are expected to charge Mr. Shiraishi with murder.

According to news reports, the police discovered body parts from eight women and one man in Mr. Shiraishi’s apartment, along with a saw, ropes and an awl, apparently used to restrain and cut the bodies. The body parts, which included severed heads, were found in cold-storage containers and tool boxes, some covered in cat litter. The national broadcaster NHK reported that Mr. Shiraishi had said four of the victims were teenagers.

Kyodo News reported that Mr. Shiraishi, who worked as a recruiter for an escort service based in the Tokyo red-light district of Kabukicho, had confessed to sexually assaulting some of the women before killing them.

He also wanted money, according to the Kyodo report, and stole 500,000 yen, or about $4,400, from one of the victims.

The Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun reported that Mr. Shiraishi had described to investigators telling his father over the summer that his life was meaningless. Then, according to news outlets including Mainichi Shimbun, he created Twitter accounts specifically to attract people with suicidal thoughts.

The Mainichi report said that he had found his first victim on Twitter and had asked to meet up, but that she had come with her boyfriend. The three went out for a drink.

Mr. Shiraishi told the police that he later invited the woman to come alone to his apartment, where he killed her. When her boyfriend came looking for her, Mr. Shiraishi told the police, he killed him, as well.

“If the man reported her missing to the police, I thought I would be suspected, so I killed him,” the Mainichi report described Mr. Shiraishi as saying to the police.

The authorities were initially led to Mr. Shiraishi’s apartment while searching for a missing 23-year-old Tokyo woman who had posted on Twitter that she was “looking for someone who will die with me.”

Her brother reported her missing late last month, and through her Twitter account found that she had been exchanging messages with Mr. Shiraishi. The brother said she had been thinking of killing herself since the death of their mother in June, and that she had disappeared on Oct. 23 from the group home in Hachioji, a suburb of Tokyo, where she was living.

The suspect told the police that he had sent a Twitter message to the woman saying, “Let’s die together,” Kyodo reported.

The police have not yet said whether the woman’s remains were among those at Mr. Shiraishi’s apartment.

According to The Asahi Shimbun, the brother provided the police with Mr. Shiraishi’s Twitter handle, and investigators identified another woman who had been in touch with the suspect. She agreed to contact Mr. Shiraishi and to invite him to meet her at a train station while the police observed.

After the woman identified Mr. Shiraishi, the police followed him back to his apartment on Monday.

When they knocked on the door, he answered, and the police saw boxes inside. When they asked Mr. Shiraishi if he knew where the missing woman was, according to the Asahi report, he replied, “In that cooler.”

Neighbors told officers that they had noticed a sewage-like smell for at least two months, but that they had not reported it. According to Kyodo, Mr. Shiraishi told the police that he had not discarded the bodies because he was afraid of being caught.

President Donald Trump is an avid viewer of Fox News and its morning program “Fox & Friends,” which is seen as offering more favorable coverage of the administration than other news outlets. His early morning tweets often reference coverage on the program.

The reasons behind his affection for the network and its flagship morning program were apparent on Monday, when Mr. Trump's campaign associates Paul Manafort and Rick Gates were indicted as part of the investigation by the special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

The way each network covered the story – or avoided it – are signs of how the media landscape has become ever more politicized in the Trump era. That is particularly true of Fox News.

How They Covered the Indictments

Fox News aired 25 minutes of indictment coverage in the first hour after news of the charges broke around 8 a.m. – just as attention would have surged. CNN and MSNBC, in contrast, aired at least an hour of nearly uninterrupted and ad-free coverage.

Fox devoted much of its morning programming to other topics: the hamburger emoji, Halloween costumes and dubious actions by Democrats. One particularly long segment critiqued an essay in The Economist that asked if Americans over-romanticize the military. They also ran at least seven ad breaks.

While major network news channels claim to be unbiased, Americans see them as having political leanings. A survey from Pew Research Center found that Fox was more trusted by conservatives, while MSNBC was more trusted by liberals and CNN was considered somewhere in the middle. In their coverage, the channels tend to confirm their viewers' perceptions.

But during the hyperpolarized first year of this administration, the ways in which television networks cover the president are being deeply scrutinized – particularly as the investigation by Mr. Mueller draws closer to the White House. This climate seems to have offered ample opportunities for each network’s political perspective to become even more pronounced.

Significant breaking news can sometimes subdue those leanings, as networks scramble to air whatever information they have on a mass shooting or hurricane. But in the case of political stories like this one, it seems newsworthiness can’t trump ideology.

In its morning coverage, Fox played down the indictment news in two ways. First, it cut away in the first few minutes to discuss a dossier, which was partly funded by the Democratic Party, that had leaked during the presidential campaign and included unverified allegations about Mr. Trump. They aired an interview that had already been shown half an hour earlier with the Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway in which she called for an investigation into the Hillary Clinton campaign.

Next, the network maintained a seemingly regular ad break schedule, running about 24 minutes of ads in the first hour of coverage. Other major networks did not break for ads until nearly an hour had passed, a common practice during major breaking news.

Reporting on the indictment continued, with only the occasional ad break, for the next hour on CNN and MSNBC, while Fox reported on North Korea and allegations of sexual misconduct against the actor Kevin Spacey – news that had gained steam after Mr. Spacey issued a widely criticized apology the previous evening.

Our data comes from the Internet Archive’s Television Archive, which tracks the text appearing on the lower-third portion of the screen, a feature that is called a “chyron.” The analysis tracks the text that appeared in the chyron during the start of each minute of airtime.

In certain moments during Monday morning’s coverage, it was possible to see how Fox’s lower-third text differed sharply from that of the other networks:

Though it is far from the only possible way to evaluate news coverage, the chyron has become something of a touchstone for media analysts, being both the most obvious visual example of spin or distraction and the most shareable. Any negative coverage of the president usually prompts a flurry of tweets cataloguing the differences among networks in their chyron text. While CNN, MSNBC and the BBC are typically in alignment, Monday morning was a particularly stark example of how Fox News pushes its own version of reality.

To right-leaning media observers, the coverage by the other networks might seem equally troubling: does the Manafort indictment deserve an hour or more of uninterrupted airtime? On many stories, there could be legitimate differences in news judgment by editors and producers at competing news outlets, in turn leading to varying focuses in coverage.",Trump Loves ‘Fox & Friends.’ Here’s Why,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/01/opinion/How-Fox-News-Covered-the-Manafort-Indictment.html

The indictments on Monday of the former Trump campaign officials Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have some prominent conservatives openly considering desperate measures. The Wall Street Journal editorial board called on the special counsel whose investigation led to the indictments, Robert Mueller, to resign, arguing that he lacks the “critical distance” to carry out the inquiry. So did the New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin.

But the most radical suggestion came from two former Republican administration lawyers. To forestall a deepening crisis that could cripple the Trump White House, these lawyers, David B. Rivkin Jr. and Lee A. Casey, urged the president to issue a blanket pardon to anyone involved with Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. This isn’t just a fringe possibility. A reporter raised the idea on Tuesday; Mr. Trump didn’t answer the question.

Though such a move would not violate the Constitution, it would provoke a political disaster.

President Trump has tweeted that he has the “complete power to pardon.” As someone who supported the broadest reading of executive power as a deputy assistant attorney general during the George W. Bush administration, I think that Mr. Trump has the Constitution about right. Article II declares that the president “shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.” President Trump can clearly pardon anyone — even himself — subject to the Mueller investigation.

But unless Mr. Trump wants to meet the same end as Richard Nixon, he should resort only to pardons that promote the central purpose of the power. As Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 74, the Constitution creates a pardon power out of “humanity and good policy” to allow for “mitigation from the rigor of the law.”

So far, nothing in the Mueller inquiry cries out for considerations of mercy. Far from it.

If the facts of the indictment are to be believed, Mr. Manafort and his associate wove a dark web of shell companies and foreign bank accounts to launder millions of dollars and avoid taxes on unreported income paid by Ukraine, its former president and its pro-Russia political party. The president tweeted on Monday that “this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign.” That’s true.

Democracy vs. Data

From TED Talks: During a week in which the largest tech companies in the world are facing congressional scrutiny over enabling Russian election interference, this recent TED Talk offers a cleareyed look at the even more serious implications that artificial intelligence and big data have for democracy and privacy. Zeynep Tufekci, a techno-sociologist, contends that Orwell’s 1984 is not the dystopian future we should be afraid of, it’s the future where the highest-bidding authoritarian can own our attention.

From The New York Times: Monday’s announcement of indictments of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, along with George Papadopoulos’s guilty plea, consumed writers from the left, right and center. While those on the right mostly focused on how Mr. Manafort’s charges did not implicate the Trump campaign, writers on the left zeroed in on the importance of Mr. Papadopoulos’s plea in the investigation into Russian meddling. — Anna Dubenko, senior digital strategist

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’Homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off.","The Parisian sun casting a warm glow on a balcony overlooking narrow streets, laundry drying overhead. The bustle of a market. Marseille’s sprawling vineyards.

Julia Child’s time in France inspired her to capture the country through its cuisine, introducing French cooking to kitchens around the world. But it was that same French magic — and Ms. Child herself — that inspired her husband, Paul, to also capture the country, albeit through a different medium, photography. A new book lets him offer a personal glimpse into the world beyond the kitchen.

“There is this combination of intimacy and formal, rigorous design,” said Alex Prud’Homme, the couple’s grandnephew and a co-author of “France Is a Feast: The Photographic Journey of Paul and Julia Child.”

The Childs met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, leading them to various postings around Europe. But it was Paris, where they arrived in 1948, that captured their hearts.

“Apart from our official lives — cooking and government — the other things we do fall into fairly repetitive categories whose two main divisions are, being entertained and entertaining others,” Mr. Child wrote to his twin brother, Charlie. “Sometimes when we’re being entertained it isn’t people, but just Paris herself who acts as hostess.”

Photo

While Ms. Child took French cooking classes, and eventually began work on “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck, Mr. Child was engaged in diplomatic duties as a cultural attaché for the United States government. And he was rarely without a camera.

The photographs, taken between 1948 and 1954, focus on the beauty of postwar France. The perfectly-landscaped parks, the bustling waterfront in Marseille, the glow of Place de la Concorde at night, a cold fog settling over the Sacré-Coeur basilica. The shadow play on the grand entryways and the underpasses along the Seine.

But Mr. Child’s main subject was always his wife. Ms. Child in the kitchen; changing her clothes on the side of the road; legs propped up in a telephone booth; sunbathing in Cassis.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’Homme said.

The detail and expansive catalog of Mr. Child’s work raise the question: Did he have a sense that their lives would have a bigger impact than their immediate Parisian universe?

“He was an obsessive photographer and note taker, it’s almost like he knew back then that their lives were worth preserving for posterity,” Mr. Prud’Homme said. “It’s like they were leaving breadcrumbs.”

Mr. Prud’Homme helped Ms. Child write her memoir, “My Life in France” (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006), but he felt it wasn’t complete. That’s when Katie Pratt, a longtime family friend of the Childs and the book’s co-author, discovered a “Pandora’s box” of hundreds of black and white and color photographs, everything from surrealistic street documentary to formal portraits and landscapes.

Negatives were clearly labeled. Log books and letters provided a time frame, and were often accompanied by long letters detailing their routine: embassy comings and goings during the Cold War, their meals, the price of wine or the performance they saw the evening before. Everything was for the taking.

Mr. Child had a “distinct style,” Ms. Pratt said.

“His style as a visual artist, whether it was photography or other mediums, it was very important for him to have strong, well-organized, well-balanced compositions, often with perspective and depth,” she said. “There’s often a story going on.”

Mr. Child’s style was heavily influenced by artists living in France at the time. And as a cultural attaché, he quickly gravitated to the top artists of the day: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Edward Steichen were all friends of his. They even shared the same printer, using Pictorial Service owned by Pierre Gassmann in Paris.

“My interpretation was that Paul was a very independent-minded guy who really developed his own aesthetic, but he was swimming in the waters of these masters of 20th-century photography,” Mr. Prud’Homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off. But he always remained behind the camera.

“Paul and Julia, in their own ways, were really good teachers,” Ms. Pratt said. “They really cared about not only perfecting their craft and communicating it clearly with others. They put it to operational proof and shared it with others.”

“That’s something they learned while in the O.S.S.,” Mr. Prud’Homme said. “Don’t trust common wisdom, find out for yourself whether something works or doesn’t. That’s something they both did in their art, and cooking.”

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

It was not clear whether that was a good thing or a bad one.

One crucial implication of this finding is that political elites have enormous power to dictate ideological terms to their rank-and-file supporters.
For a healthy chunk of conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats, the “liberal” and “conservative” position on most issues is whatever their party leaders say it is.
When we look past ideological self-identification to polling on discrete public policy questions, America appears to be far more center-left than center-right.
Recent surveys have shown that most Americans — including majorities of Republican voters — support increasing federal financing of health care and oppose cutting taxes for the wealthy.","The political scientist Philip Converse first brought the first reality to national attention in 1964. In his classic essay “The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics,” Mr. Converse demonstrated that only 17 percent of American voters could both correctly assign the terms “liberal” and “conservative” to the nation’s two major political parties and offer a sensible description of what those terms meant. The rest of the electorate did not understand politics as a fight over abstract theories of good government but rather a conflict between interest groups. Ordinary voters did not select the party that most faithfully represented their political philosophy — they picked the one that appeared to best represent their people, a group they might define with reference to class, region, religion, race or partisanship itself.

This make intuitive sense: The left-to-right political spectrum is a construct born of seating arrangements during the French Revolution. The impulse to define oneself in relation to an in-group — and opposition to an out-group — is a survival strategy that’s been with us since the dawn of our species.

And in their recent book “Neither Liberal Nor Conservative: Ideological Innocence in the American Public,” the political scientists Donald Kinder and Nathan Kalmoe show that the electorate is scarcely more ideological today, at the peak of partisan polarization, than it was at the height of the New Deal consensus (when Mr. Converse published his landmark study).

Thus, while it’s true that fewer Americans self-identify as liberal than as moderate or conservative, this tells us almost nothing about voters’ policy views. “Moderates” do not actually display a preference for “centrist” positions, but merely for ideologically inconsistent ones. In fact, the Stanford political scientist David Broockman has shown that moderates are just as likely to subscribe to “extreme” policy positions as other voters are: In the United States, there are self-identified “moderates” who support a $1 million maximum income, prohibiting gays and lesbians from teaching public school and the mass deportation of all undocumented immigrants.

Meanwhile, the number of genuine “liberals” and “conservatives” is far smaller than meets the eye. Most voters who identify with those terms are partisans first, and ideologues second. Or as Mr. Kinder and Mr. Kalmoe conclude an analysis of four decades of voter survey data, “ideological identification seems more a reflection of political decisions than a cause.” In other words: The average conservative Republican isn’t a Republican because she’s a conservative — she self-identifies as a conservative because she’s a Republican.

One crucial implication of this finding is that political elites have enormous power to dictate ideological terms to their rank-and-file supporters. For a healthy chunk of conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats, the “liberal” and “conservative” position on most issues is whatever their party leaders say it is. Donald Trump’s success at redefining conservative voters’ consensus views on free trade, American policy toward Russia and the relevance of personal morality to effective political leadership offers a particularly vivid illustration of this phenomenon.

When we look past ideological self-identification to polling on discrete public policy questions, America appears to be far more center-left than center-right. In a recent analysis of Democracy Fund Voter Study Group survey data, the political scientist Lee Drutman found that 73.5 percent of the 2016 electorate espoused broadly left-of-center views on economic policy.

That finding is supported by polling on individual fiscal issues over the past year. Recent surveys have shown that most Americans — including majorities of Republican voters — support increasing federal financing of health care and oppose cutting taxes for the wealthy. And there’s little evidence that the Democrats’ left flank is exhausting the public’s tolerance for government intervention in the economy: Recent polls have found that over 60 percent of Americans support tuition-free public college (a majority that includes 58 percent of independents and 47 percent of Republicans); that over 60 percent of all voters favor Medicaid and Medicare buy-in programs, while a slim majority likes the sound of single-payer; and that 82 percent of voters, including 70 percent of Republicans, support new legislation expanding access to paid family and medical leave.

The Democratic Party has failed to translate the popularity of progressive economics into electoral success for a variety of reasons. The most fundamental is the one we’ve already observed: Most voters cast their ballots on the basis of identity, not policy. And America’s rapidly changing demographics — and the right’s steadfast efforts to inflame and exploit anxieties about those changes — have made racial identity increasingly salient to white voters, particularly rural ones. This development, combined with the disproportionate influence that our political system awards to white rural voters, has given Republicans a structural advantage.

Democrats have all kinds of ways of addressing this problem. One would be to cultivate the class identity of white voters by embracing populist rhetoric that paints “the billionaire class” as an out-group they can define themselves against. Another would be to invest more resources into registering nonwhite voters. According to the Census Bureau, 74 percent of non-Hispanic whites are registered to vote in the United States. For African-Americans, that figure is 69 percent; for Hispanics, 57; and for Asian-Americans, 56. As the policy analyst Sean McElwee has noted, this means that even if every registered Latino voter in America went to the polls last November, Latinos’ overall turnout rate still would have been lower than it was for whites (63 percent).

Embracing a more conservative economic agenda, however, would solve none of the Democrats’ problems. At a time of historic inequality, rampant corporate consolidation and environmental crisis, the case for more robust redistributive social programs and public-interest regulations is strong. When centrist Democrats claim that making such a case is electoral suicide, they reveal less about the American public’s stubbornly center-right convictions than about their own.",America Is Not a ‘Center-Right Nation’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/opinion/democrats-economic-policy.html

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country.
Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.
The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.
Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.","Joao Silva came of age as a photographer documenting social upheaval in South Africa. Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Photo

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

Photo

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

The technology, developed in Luxembourg by IEE, a manufacturer of automotive sensors, can reportedly detect even a sleeping infant in a rear-facing child seat.","This is not the first time that the Auto Alliance has dismissed the need for regulation. In 2011, for example, Robert Strassburger, vice president for vehicle safety at the organization, made a similar argument. “We shouldn’t overemphasize the effectiveness of technology,” he said, adding that a government requirement for warning devices would initially have minimal impact, because the vast majority of cars on the road are years old.

The Auto Alliance, like some other industry groups, calls for education rather than technology. For 10 years, it has pushed messages, both online and in print, that describe why cars overheat when parked in the sun and that advise parents never to leave children in a car.

But advocates for stronger rules say the years of educational efforts have not slowed the number of deaths. And in almost all cases, they say, the action is a matter of distraction and simple forgetfulness.

“You can’t teach people not to forget,” said Janette Fennell, president of KidsandCars.org, an organization dedicated to protecting children in and around motor vehicles. “There is a scientific reason why this is happening. It’s not that people don’t love their kids.”

David Diamond, a neuroscientist at the University of South Florida who has studied the issue, said a child in the back seat could easily be forgotten. Habit memory can take over during the drive home from work, causing a person to forget to stop on the way for an important prescription. Police officers, he said, have forgotten their guns after laying them down on the toilet paper roll in public bathrooms, so it should not be surprising that parents forget their child in the back seat.

“The brain process is the same,” Dr. Diamond said. “All involve an interaction between our habit and conscious memory systems.”

General Motors and Nissan have introduced technologies that remind the driver that a child is in the back seat by analyzing door sequencing. If the rear door is opened before the car is started but not after it is turned off, a warning sounds. The GM reminder is standard or available on numerous 2017 models and will be offered on others for the 2018 model year. The Nissan system is standard on the 2018 Pathfinder and will be on other models in the future.

This technology does not meet the standard of the legislation, however, because it does not detect the presence of a child. Hyundai’s technology, which is scheduled for release on some 2019 models, can detect someone in the back seat.

Some companies that sell equipment to the auto industry have developed warning devices. One such system, the VitaSense, uses low-power radio to sense movement and breathing. The technology, developed in Luxembourg by IEE, a manufacturer of automotive sensors, can reportedly detect even a sleeping infant in a rear-facing child seat. If a child is detected after the vehicle has been turned off, it alerts the driver by several means, including flashing lights, beeps, and messages sent to cellphones and computers.

Ms. Fennell applauded independent efforts to produce a warning device but argued that the only real solution was legislation that required the technology in all new vehicles.

When she got an alert from her car that she had left her gas tank open, Ms. Fennell said, “I realized that while my car can tell me that, it can’t tell me if a child has been left in the back seat.”

“We get buzzers and warnings for everything,” she said. “How in the world do you not develop a reminder for what is indisputably the most important thing?”",Forgetting a Child in a Back Seat Can Kill.

For a few months, the bat mothers were also kept in the chambers and would regularly communicate with their offspring.
“When we examined the dialects more carefully, we found that they were similar to what the bats were hearing — the high-pitched group shifted toward higher-pitched calls and the low-pitched group shifted toward lower-pitched calls,” Dr. Yovel said.

“I think vocal plasticity, or vocal learning, is something not rare, but prominent, in the lives of many animals.”","To start, the scientists captured 14 wild pregnant Egyptian fruit bats, a highly social and vocal species commonly found in the Middle East. Each mother gave birth in one of three chambers.

In these chambers, the researchers played different soundtracks to the pups continuously, starting from birth. The tracks sampled calls from actual bats, each mimicking a cave or tree roost with 300 bats in it, but featured different ranges of pitch.

For a few months, the bat mothers were also kept in the chambers and would regularly communicate with their offspring. But at 14 weeks, when a pup would normally become independent in the wild, the mothers were set free. At this point, the researchers started recording the pups’ vocalizations every few months until the bats reached adulthood.

Over time, the scientists found, the three pup groups took on distinct dialects. “When we examined the dialects more carefully, we found that they were similar to what the bats were hearing — the high-pitched group shifted toward higher-pitched calls and the low-pitched group shifted toward lower-pitched calls,” Dr. Yovel said.

He added that the difference between the calls the bats learned from their mothers and the ones they adopted from the soundtracks could be considered similar to the difference between New England and Texan accents. And while it’s not known whether bat colonies in different locations naturally communicate with varying frequencies, Dr. Yovel said, “our findings suggest they do.”

Next, his team wants to see how dialects affect the bats’ social behaviors. “If I teach a few bats a new dialect and then send them into a new colony, how will they be treated?” he said.

The research also touches on broader evolutionary questions, like whether human vocal learning emerged independently, or whether it’s a more primitive behavior, spread across the mammalian kingdom, Dr. Yovel said. So far, aside from bats, vocal learning has anecdotally been reported in just a few other nonhuman mammals, including whales, seals and other primates.

Mirjam Knörnschild, a bat expert at the Free University of Berlin who was not involved in the study, suspects vocal learning takes place in far more species.

Hearing loss is endemic, and not just for older people. Almost one in four Americans between the ages of 20 and 69 who think they have good hearing actually have some hearing impairment. Among those in their 50s, 4.5 million people have some hearing loss. How many wear devices that would enable them to better hear the world? Less than 5 percent.

Wearing hearing aids can change your life in an instant — not to mention that of the people you love, whose actual voices you may have been unable to hear. But we don’t get help. Because coverage by insurance carriers is inconsistent. Because we don’t know where or how to get our hearing tested. Because we’re afraid of what others might think. Because hearing loss is uncool.

This needs to change. Start with insurance: Hearing aids can be expensive, but employers need to know that people who can’t hear can’t do their jobs well. Education matters, too: People who thought it was dumb for Donald Trump to look directly at the sun during the solar eclipse might think nothing of slapping on a pair of headphones and cranking their music to 11.

The first thing you can do is to get your hearing tested; this is helpful even if you don’t think you have hearing loss, so that you have a baseline reference. There are several free tests online, sponsored by Phonak, Miracle-Ear, Beltone and others. They aren’t as good as the ones a doctor can give you, but it’s a start.

About 90 percent of hearing loss is “sensorineural,” usually caused by damage to hair cells in the inner ear. Sometimes it’s the result of exposure to loud sounds (like concerts at the Spectrum). That’s the kind of hearing loss I have; my inability to hear high-pitched sounds means that understanding a conversation in a crowded restaurant can be a challenge.

New technology enables wearers to focus their hearing on the person in front of them while canceling out all sound behind. You can control just how much of the world you want to amplify or cancel out by using a free app on your mobile device. And it looks good — I recently wore such a device at a party where, for the first time in years, I heard everything that everyone was saying. It completely changed the way I experienced the world.

When I first learned that I had serious hearing loss (after a lifetime of playing in super-loud bands), I called my wife on the phone, and as I told her of my diagnosis I started to cry. “I’m so sorry you have to be married to someone like me,” I sobbed.

My wife, a tolerant woman by any measure, laughed. “You really think I’d leave you because you have hearing aids?” she said.

Well, yeah, I sort of did. Because I thought it would make me seem old and undesirable. Because somehow I’d forgotten that the world has long been full of people just like me.

I always loved that song that Elton opened with at the Spectrum. I have a friend who loves it, too, although once, when we heard it come on the radio, she asked me: “Hey wait. Why is he singing, ‘Hold me closer, Tony Danza?’ ”

“It’s ‘Tiny Dancer,’ ” I explained. “Not Tony Danza. Tiny Dancer.”

“Duh, Jenny, like — I know, ” she said. “Did you really think I was deaf?”

It was a joke, of course, and she laughed. As if the whole idea was funny, as if our hearing was a gift we could never lose.",Glasses Are Cool. Why Aren’t Hearing Aids?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/opinion/hearing-aids-ears-eyesight.html

Google said it will identify the advertisers paying for political ads within a link accessible from the ad.","The Russia-linked posts were “an insidious attempt to drive people apart,” Colin Stretch, the general counsel for Facebook who will appear at the hearings, said in his prepared remarks. He called the posts “deeply disturbing,” and noted they focused on race, religion, gun rights, and gay and transgender issues.

Facebook, Mr. Stretch said, was “determined to prevent it from happening again.”

The new information also illuminated when Facebook knew there had been Russian interference on its platform. Several times before the election last Nov. 8, Facebook said its security team discovered threats targeted at employees of the major American political parties from a group called APT28, an agency that United States law enforcement officials have previously linked to Russian military intelligence operations.

Facebook cautioned that the Russia-linked posts represented a minuscule amount of content compared with the billions of posts that flow through users’ News Feeds everyday. Between 2015 and 2017, people in the United States saw more than 11 trillion posts from Pages on Facebook.

Twitter, in its prepared remarks, said it had discovered more than 2,700 accounts on its service that were linked to the Internet Research Agency between September 2016 and November 2016. Those accounts, which Twitter has suspended, posted roughly 131,000 tweets over that period.

Outside of the activity of the Internet Research Agency, Twitter identified more than 36,000 automated accounts that posted 1.4 million election-related tweets linked to Russia over that three-month period. The tweets received approximately 288 million views, according to the company’s remarks.

Twitter noted that the 1.4 million Russia-linked election tweets represented less than three-quarters of one percent of all election-related tweets during that period.

Google, in its prepared statement, said it had also found evidence that the Internet Research Agency bought ads on its services and created YouTube channels to upload short videos about divisive social issues including law enforcement, race relations or Syria.

Google said it had found 18 channels that were “likely associated” with the Russian agents that posted political videos to YouTube. All told, those accounts — now suspended — uploaded more than 1,100 videos totaling 43 hours of content from 2015 through the summer of 2017. Google said, in general, those videos had very low view counts that added up to 309,000 views between the middle of 2015 and late 2016. Only three percent of the videos had more than 5,000 views and there was no evidence that the accounts had targeted American viewers, the company said.

The internet search giant also confirmed earlier reports that the Internet Research Agency had purchased search and display ads from it. Google said the group had bought $4,700 in ads but none of them had targeted users by their political leanings, which was a targeting tool that Google added before the election.

Google had been investigating a separate $53,000 in ad purchases with political material from Russian internet or building addresses, but discovered that those were not related to the Kremlin.

“While we found only limited activity on our services, we will continue to work to prevent all of it, because no amount of interference is acceptable,” wrote Richard Salgado, Google’s director of law enforcement and information security, and Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel. The two men were scheduled to testify at separate congressional committees on Tuesday and Wednesday.

For Facebook, Google and Twitter, the discovery of Russian influence by way of their sites has been a rude awakening. The companies had long positioned themselves as spreading information and connecting people for positive ends. Now the companies must grapple with how Russian agents used their technologies exactly as they were meant to be used — but for malevolent purposes.

That has led to thorny debates inside the companies. For Facebook, the problem is less straightforward than finding Russia-linked pages and taking down content. Executives worry about how stifling speech from non-American entities could set a precedent on the social network — and how it could potentially be used against other groups in the future.

So Facebook has focused on the issue of authenticity — or the fact that the Russian agencies did not identify themselves as such — as a reason for taking down the accounts.

“Many of these ads did not violate our content policies,” Elliot Schrage, vice president of policy and communications at Facebook, said in a company blog post earlier this month. “That means that for most of them, if they had been run by authentic individuals, anywhere, they could have remained on the platform.”

Earlier this month, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner introduced a bipartisan bill to require internet companies to identify those who paid for political ads on the tech companies’ platforms.

Facebook has been promoting its strengthened advertising disclosure policies as an attempt to pre-empt the bipartisan bill. Last week, Facebook began rolling out new features that provide insight into who is paying for ads, and it will maintain a publicly viewable database of ads purchased on the network.

The company is also stepping up its counterintelligence and security measures. Facebook has said it is working with Twitter, Google and other companies to spot sophisticated threats earlier, and will continue to coordinate with law enforcement when appropriate. The company said it shuttered 5.8 million fake accounts in October 2016, and removed 30,000 accounts attempting to influence the French elections this year.

Google also said it plans to increase its transparency for political ads. The company is working to issue an annual report about who is buying political ads and how much they are spending.

The company also said it planned to create a publicly accessible database into what election ads ran on Google’s AdWords — for example, web search ads — and YouTube. Google said it will identify the advertisers paying for political ads within a link accessible from the ad.

But Google said it did not intend to take any further action against state-backed Russian news channel RT, which has built a massive online audience through YouTube. The American intelligence community has described RT as the Kremlin’s “principal international propaganda outlet”, but Google said the organization had not violated any of its policies or misused the service.

Last week, by contrast, Twitter said it would ban RT and Sputnik, another Kremlin-backed news organization, from advertising on its service.",Russian Influence Reached 126 Million Through Facebook Alone,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/technology/facebook-google-russia.html

The handful of out gay pop stars before him — including his idol, George Michael — mostly endured lengthy “are they or aren’t they?” periods before they publicly acknowledged that they were gay. Banking on pop stardom as your whole and complete admitted self wasn’t something that happened every day.

“IN THE LONELY HOUR” was a little more than a half-hour crying jag about longing for a man — a straight, married one he was in love with whom he never so much as kissed. Nearly every song was about this: “Stay With Me,” the sad song about wanting a man to stay even when it’s clear he’s not in love; “Good Thing,” the sad song about deciding that he’s stayed too long waiting around — that one begins with a vision of him getting mugged outside the man’s door and dying in his arms like Éponine. And, on the deluxe edition of the album, a cover of Whitney Houston’s “How Will I Know?” which was not a sad song until he sang it.

He told Rolling Stone that he “had to be careful” so that straight people could sing along with his music, too. “I am not Sam Smith, the gay singer,” he said at the time. “I am Sam Smith, the singer who happens to be gay.” He gave an interview where he talked about Grindr and Tinder, the hookup apps, and how sad it was that all the possibility behind love and serendipity came down to a swiping culture, and saying this offended some in the gay community too. He accepted the Oscar for best original song for “Writing’s on the Wall,” from “Spectre,” the James Bond movie, referring to an article he’d read in which Ian McKellen had “said that no openly gay man had ever won an Oscar. If this is the case — even if it isn’t the case — I want to dedicate this to the L.G.B.T. community all around the world.”

Well, he woke up the morning after the Oscars to an assassination’s worth of ridicule, including from an openly gay man who had won an Oscar. The Verge called Mr. Smith’s statement “vague” and “inaccurate,” saying, “If you’re going to stump for a cause on stage, you need to come correct.” Gawker, in an essay about Mr. Smith’s “gay conservatism,” wrote, “His philosophy is, in short, to be gay, but not too gay.” Sure, he quickly realized, the Oscar thing was wrong — he’d meant to say that there’d never been an openly gay lead actor winner — but the other stuff: why was it taken so badly? So what if he didn’t like hookup apps? Why was that surprising? Hadn’t people seen him, dressed like a 1950s lounge act, complete with a pompadour? Hadn’t they heard his retro soul? What exactly about him seemed modern? So what that he wanted his music to be a universal experience? He never said he was the spokesman for gay people.

The vitriol of the Oscar incident surprised him. His heart was clearly in the right place. He was a proud gay man. How could that not mean anything? “I’m not the most eloquent person,” Mr. Smith says now. “I didn’t get the best grades in school. I mean, I’m just good at singing.”

It felt like he was getting hammered every time he opened his mouth. All he wanted was to remind people that love is love is love, particularly his brand of young adult love: heart-eye emoji love, cupid-arrow love, the love from “The Notebook” and “Titanic.” That’s how big love is. Once again, on his favorite subject, he pretend-faints on the couch in swoon and desire. He clutches his heart and makes his eyebrows almost touching a near-steeple of longing. This was the thing we all had in common. Why talk about the things that make us different?

YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND what it was like for him. Mr. Smith was raised in Great Chishill, a village an hour and a half from London with a population of less than 700. He wore a full face of makeup to school — to Catholic school — and fake eyelashes, too, and elaborate arrangements of flowers pinned to his lapel, along with the occasional all-over sprinkling of glitter. Some kids were mean to him about his sexuality, but it was the making fun of his weight that bothered him. His sexuality was not a negotiation; his weight was.

He grew up with two younger sisters in a pink house; there’s a tattoo of its address around the C6 vertebra of his cervical spine. His bedroom walls were painted a shiny gold and his bed had a red silk duvet. He applied cheap, clumpy mascara each morning and on the gold wall next to his mirror, he dabbed his mascara wand to rid it of excess. One day, in detention, someone told him about dream boards, and so he spent the hour making one to put up on his bedroom wall. There was a sketch of a Grammy there. He drew the back of his head performing to an arena.

He came out when he was 10. Literally someone at school said, “Are you gay?” and he said, “I am!” His mother said she’d known since he was 3. He’d always had very short hair, but when he was young, he used to make the gesture of pushing strands behind his ears, like it was long, or flicking imaginary hair off his shoulder. In the car, when the windows were open, he would pretend he’d gotten a hair stuck to his lips and pick it away.

And it was all totally fine, even when it wasn’t, even when the first boy he had a crush on said nasty, homophobic things to him that still make him cry. But he had a lot of friends. There were no other (openly) gay boys. He fell in love with straight boys. He could barely picture a future when one of them would look back at him with lust or sexual curiosity, let alone love. And still he was happy. He grew comfortable in his longing. People sometimes made fun of him, but so what? He understood who he was. He thought that if you know who you are, and if you’re confident in that and you don’t make a big deal of it, people will accept you.

His parents signed him up for voice lessons when he wouldn’t stop crooning throughout the house. He had a manager from the age of 11, then another, then another, each promising him that he would become very famous very soon. It didn’t happen. He moved to London, where he tended bar. One day, he met Jimmy Napes, who introduced him to his eventual managers, who in turn introduced him to the electronic duo Disclosure, with whom he recorded the vocals for “Latch,” Disclosure’s single — and his breakout — in 2012.

The rest — the album, the tour — it all happened fast. He woke up the day after the Oscars, saw the chaos online, apologized, and slunk off. Why wasn’t this working? People loved his music, but they were turning on him. He couldn’t bear being thought of as a traitor to his people — he was so open about everything! Sure, he didn’t like Tinder, and it’s mostly true that he didn’t like it because it isn’t romantic, but it is maybe truer that he was afraid he would be swiped away. Believe it or not, he did use Grindr, but he didn’t want random hookups so he arranged dinner dates with several very confused men.

Then, one day, he went to Australia for a show, and afterward had a talk with his publicist there, a gay man who lives with his partner of 18 years. The publicist took Mr. Smith to the Stonewall, a gay bar in Sydney, for a drink one afternoon. He decided to help educate him, taking him to a gay bookshop. “My mind just went,” Mr. Smith said. He read the memoir “Holding the Man,” which blew his mind. He watched “Paris Is Burning.” He still has “Tales of the City” on his night table. Next, the Australians introduced him to drag. They crammed his feet into thigh-high, high-heeled boots. They draped a red sequin dress over his 6’2” body. They had barbecues and played Madonna and danced.

“I lived in a village in the middle of nowhere as an openly gay man from the age of 10 years old,” Mr. Smith said. “I didn’t meet another gay man until I was 19 when I moved to London. I just went gay clubbing a few times with some straight friends and with some girlfriends of mine, and then I became famous. I never got an opportunity to find my people in the gay community and find my friends.”

He decided not to drink or smoke or be with a man, even just kissing, for a long time, while he was figuring all this stuff out. He was trying to understand how he fit into the gay community at large. “I just really sat with myself and got to know myself and started to just like my stretch marks and not be so hard on myself and stop watching perfection everywhere.”

He began seeking out the art that struck him as truest. He stopped watching “Titanic” and “The Notebook.” O.K., he watched “The Notebook” again last week but he also watched “Weekend,” the gay indie film, so it balanced out.

Then he found George Michael. He had always been a fan of his music. He was 15 when he saw him in concert. But now, reading and watching interviews with him in his last years, after Mr. Michael came out, Mr. Smith found him to be a great mentor. “I just feel like I’m going to offend someone every time I open my mouth,” he said. “I feel like George Michael had a way of being authentic to himself and honest in a way that was warm.”

Back at the interview in West Hollywood, he leaned back on the couch, looked up at the ceiling and blew a stream of breath out through pursed lips. “People forget but no one learns about gay history in school. Nothing. So I didn’t know anything about my history as a gay man and then words like ‘spokesperson’ are being thrown at me when I’ve just brought out my first album,” he said. “It scared me because I was like, I don’t know anything about being gay, really.”

He realized two things. One was that he was ready to make a second album. The other thing was that coming out as gay wasn’t enough. He now understood that every visible gay person still had a leadership role. He now understood that he wasn’t operating on his own, but that he lived in context to a community whether he’d realized it or not. No, having come out as a gay singer, he realized it was now time to come out as a gay man.

THE NEXT AFTERNOON, Saturday, he rode to the Hollywood Bowl, where he was performing at a breast cancer benefit that included Lorde and Kesha and Harry Styles. He was wearing a pastel, airbrushed silk, short-sleeve button-down shirt and olive silk pleated pants. “I can tuck them in now,” he said proudly. “I’m a tucker.”

Since he left the public eye for the studio, which is where he’d been since the end of his last tour, in 2015, he’d lost a ton of weight by doing something called “intermittent fasting,” meaning he waits five hours after eating to eat again (and which is also called not eating between meals). A trainer. A nutritionist. He stopped eating bread. Probably being a man in his 20s helped.

His transformation was sparked by seeing a tabloid picture of himself on the beach without a shirt, and that was not the self he wanted to be. He was also concerned about his health. He gets acid reflux, and it’s bad for his voice. He knows other stars “mime,” as he puts it, but he doesn’t want to. His voice is his whole thing, his whole bag of tricks.

Mr. Smith had also cut off his pompadour, which he called his “quiff,” his short hair now reminiscent of George Michael’s on his 2011 Symphonica tour. His hair was thicker than it’s been recently. After the Oscars, it had started falling out from stress, he thought. He began to use Rogaine and take Propecia, and it worked. Men need to talk about hair loss, he thinks.

If “In the Lonely Hour” was the myopic look into the heart of a boy helplessly in love, then the new album, “The Thrill of It All,” is about a man who turns his gaze outward. “Midnight Train” is a sad song about ending a relationship that was inspired by friends; “Palace,” a sad song about whether or not love is worth it if it ends; “HIM,” a sad story of an imagined boy in Mississippi coming out to his father. Some of the tracks are about Mr. Smith himself, including “Burning,” a sad song about pining for a man who has left; and “One Last Song,” a sad final ode to the man who was the subject of “In the Lonely Hour.” The new album won’t be a surprise to anyone familiar with the first one: The old-timey soul is still there. Mr. Smith decided long ago that his voice was the instrument: melisma, whispered baritones, surprise out-of-nowhere ultra-high falsetto, even a haunting, beautiful croak of longing sprinkled here and there. It is still prime music for “having sex with your sadness,” as Mr. Smith said.

But he can now recount actual relationships in his songs. He’s still never been in the kind of magical “Notebook” love he longs for, he said, but about a year ago, he had a five-month relationship that took three breakups before the breakup took and which is the subject of “Too Good at Goodbyes,” the first single off the new album, which is in the Billboard Top 10 as of this writing. He’s been dating the actor Brandon Flynn, from Netflix’s “13 Reasons Why,” seeing where that goes.

Backstage at the Hollywood Bowl, Mr. Smith drank a cup of Throat Coat, and then took a Gaviscon for acid reflux. He sang through a cocktail straw while holding up a tissue to make it move with his breath to strengthen his throat muscles, something he learned from an opera singer. He motor-boated his lips. He was ready for the show.

The next day, the news media would pick up a statement he made about feeling as much like a woman as a man, and social media would get on him for being too casual about gender fluidity when he identifies as a gay man. One day he will get it right, he said, his eyes shiny with big, sad Sam Smith tears,

“The only thing I’d like everyone to know is I’m really sorry if I say the wrong things,” he said. “I don’t want to offend anyone and my intentions are genuinely pure and good. I’m still trying to figure [expletive] out and I’d like to be treated like a human. If I make mistakes don’t kill me.”

Yes, one day. One day when he’s old, he said, he’s going to know what to say. He’s going to be someone who can figure out how to think his words through before he says them. He’ll get older, and as he does, he’s going to stop using his falsetto so much, he said.

Erinn Egbert was a candidate for Season 8 of the “Biggest Loser” but ultimately did not make the cut.
“The idea that people who regain lost weight are necessarily slothful and gluttonous is an unfortunate stigmatization that is not based in fact,” he said.","The study was published on Tuesday in the journal Obesity. The lead author, Kevin Hall, chief of the Integrative Physiology Section at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and his colleagues also presented their work at the Obesity Society’s annual meeting.

Although the study is very small and must be replicated, Dr. Hall said, it is the first to assess obese people years after they lost weight with state-of-the-art methods to measure the calories they had consumed and the amount of exercise they had done.

The researchers did their measurements when the contestants were chosen, and again at six weeks, 30 weeks and six years after the contest began.

After ‘The Biggest Loser,’ Their Bodies Fought to Regain Weight

“The findings here are important,” said Rena Wing, a psychiatry professor at Brown University and a founder of the National Weight Control Registry, which includes more than 10,000 people.

The food eaten “is the key determinant of initial weight loss. And physical activity is the key to maintenance,” she said.

The study also helps explain why that might be. One consequence of weight loss among the Biggest Loser participants was a greatly slowed metabolism.

The subjects were burning an average of 500 fewer calories a day than would be expected, Dr. Hall and his colleagues found. In essence, their bodies were fighting against weight loss.

Those who kept the weight off “are countering the drop in metabolism with physical activity,” Dr. Hall said.

During the initial weight loss, the equation was different. Then, the difference between how much weight “Biggest Loser” contestants lost could be explained by the number of calories they cut from their diets. The amount of exercise did not distinguish those who lost more from those who lost less.

The contestants competed for six months to see who could lose the most weight. Participants followed a grueling diet and an exhausting exercise program.

Contestants’ average weight at the start of the show was 329 pounds. At the end, it was 200 pounds, a 129-pound loss. But six years after the study ended, their average weight rebounded to 290 pounds, just 38 pounds less than when they started.

That average, though, hid wide variations.

To learn more, Dr. Hall and his colleagues divided the group of 14 into two. There were the “regainers,” the seven participants who ended up after six years weighing five pounds more on average than they had at the start.

And there were the “maintainers,” the seven who maintained an average weight loss of 81 pounds.

To measure the number of calories the contestants burned, the researchers asked the subjects to drink “doubly labeled water,” in which hydrogen and oxygen atoms are at least partially replaced by stable isotopes, which have a different atomic mass.

The oxygen isotopes appear in carbon dioxide exhaled by subjects, which allowed the researchers to estimate the average amount exhaled each day. The more calories burned, the more carbon dioxide exhaled.

Some “Biggest Loser” contestants — including the first author, Dr. Jennifer Kerns, now an obesity specialist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington — said the conclusions of the new study confirmed their own experiences.

Dr. Kerns, a contestant in Season 3 of the show, says she has managed to keep off 100 pounds only by tracking everything she eats and by exercising on an elliptical cross-trainer for 35 to 40 minutes a day. In addition, her job requires her to walk around the hospital seeing patients.

She has learned that she cannot relax this regimen if she wants to maintain her weight. “My natural tendency is to regain,” she said.

Erinn Egbert was a candidate for Season 8 of the “Biggest Loser” but ultimately did not make the cut. So she went home “to figure it out on my own.”

She hired two trainers and followed a diet and exercise program while she finished her senior year at Ohio State University. She weighed 237 pounds when the show began and lost about 120 pounds.

She has maintained a weight that is just eight pounds more. She does it with rigid portion control and regular, intense exercise — 45 minutes to an hour a day, Monday through Saturday, doing the Beachbody programs, a challenging combination of strength training and cardiovascular exercise.

Ms. Egbert, who is 30 and lives in Lexington, Ky., says she learned the importance of working consistently to stay thin, even with a slowed metabolism.

“You have got to keep at it every single day,” she said.

It’s a difficult task for virtually anyone, Dr. Kerns said: “The amount of time and dedication it takes to manage one’s food intake and prioritize exercise every day can be an untenable burden for many people.”

“It’s totally unfair to judge those who can’t do it,” she added.

Dr. Hall agreed. “The idea that people who regain lost weight are necessarily slothful and gluttonous is an unfortunate stigmatization that is not based in fact,” he said.

Danny Cahill, who is 47 and lives in Tulsa, Okla., is among those who found it increasingly difficult to keep up the sort of regimen he needed to avoid gaining weight.

He won the “Biggest Loser” competition in Season 8. He weighed 430 pounds when the show began, and lost 239 of them.

For the four years after the show, he exercised more than two and half hours a day and gained back just 40 pounds.

Then the injuries began, forcing him to cut back his workouts to one and half hours a day. His weight crept up to 235 pounds.

The next year, “my body just started breaking down,” he said. “I had a foot injury, a wrist injury. I couldn’t keep it up.” And he was exhausted.

His weight went up to 300 pounds. For the last two years, his weight has remained stable at about 340 to 350 pounds, “but only because I am eating as very little as I can,” he said.

“That’s the disheartening part,” Mr. Cahill said. Losing the pounds is one thing. Keeping them off?

WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday essentially blamed the terrorist attack in New York City on what he characterized as soft immigration policies promoted by Democrats, singling out Senator Chuck Schumer, the state’s senior lawmaker and the party’s leader in the upper chamber.

He made clear that he was getting his information from Fox News, as he often does in the morning. “We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems,” he wrote. “We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter). @foxandfriends.”

Mr. Schumer quickly fired back at Mr. Trump in a statement saying that immigration is good for America.

“President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be focusing on the real solution — antiterrorism funding — which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement. “I’m calling on the president to immediately rescind his proposed cuts to this vital antiterrorism funding.”

The diversity visa program cited by Mr. Trump was created in 1990 by a bill supported by Mr. Schumer, passed by bipartisan votes and signed into law by a Republican president, George Bush. Mr. Schumer supported getting rid of the program as part of a comprehensive plan to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws crafted by eight lawmakers and passed by the Senate in 2013. But the plan was blocked in the House by Republicans who objected to other elements of the plan that they considered too permissive.

Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona who has broken with Mr. Trump, came to Mr. Schumer’s defense on Wednesday. “Actually, the Gang of 8, including @SenSchumer, did away with the Diversity Visa Program as part of broader reforms,” Mr. Flake wrote on Twitter. “I know, I was there.”

Democrats on Wednesday noted that Mr. Trump was quick to assail his political opponents and immigration policies less than 24 hours after the New York attack, even though his own White House declared it unseemly to talk about gun control policies in the immediate aftermath of the massacre in Las Vegas, in which a heavily armed American citizen shot and killed 58 people and injured hundreds of others.

“This is an unspeakable tragedy. Today is a day for consoling of survivors and mourning those we lost,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said at the time, scolding those who called for more gun control. “There is a time and place for political debate, but now is a time to unite as a country.”

Eight people were killed and 11 were injured when a driver rammed a pickup truck down a bicycle path in Manhattan on Tuesday in what the authorities called the deadliest terrorist attack in the city since Sept. 11, 2001. The driver, who shouted “Allahu akbar,” was shot by a police officer and was in critical condition on Tuesday night. The suspect was identified as Sayfullo Saipov, who came to the United States in 2010 from Uzbekistan and has a green card that permitted permanent legal residency.

Mr. Trump was evidently referring to a policy that creates a class of immigrants called “diversity immigrants” from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the United States. About 50,000 diversity visas are distributed annually among six geographic regions, and no single country receives more than 7 percent of the available visas in one year, according to the State Department website.

The program has been a target of conservatives, who proposed eliminating it in legislation endorsed by Mr. Trump that would crack down on legal immigration. The legislation would slash legal immigration to the United States in half within a decade by sharply curtailing the ability of American citizens and legal residents to bring family members into the country.

Whether Mr. Saipov actually came into the country through the diversity visa program was not immediately confirmed by government officials, but conservative media outlets like Fox News and Breitbart News quickly blamed the program and pointed the finger at Mr. Schumer.

Mr. Trump, who during last year’s campaign called for a complete ban on all Muslims entering the United States, has long sought to close the borders to many outsiders. He has signed several versions of a travel ban aimed mainly at countries with Muslim majorities even as courts repeatedly intervened. He has embraced plans to cut the number of refugees allowed into the country as well as legal immigrants.

Mr. Saipov came from Uzbekistan, which was not among the countries targeted by Mr. Trump’s travel restrictions. A former Soviet republic, it has over the years hosted American and other Western military forces as part of the war in neighboring Afghanistan, although it forced the United States to close a base there in 2005 after a human rights dispute following a massacre.

Likewise, Mr. Trump seemed to suggest Uzbekistan was part of Europe instead of Central Asia.

The attack on Mr. Schumer offered a timely way for Mr. Trump to change the subject from the special counsel investigation that unveiled its first criminal charges this week against three campaign advisers to Mr. Trump. It also served to reassure Mr. Trump’s conservative base, which was nervous after the president seemed to find common cause with “Chuck and Nancy,” meaning Mr. Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader.

After Tuesday evening’s attack in New York, other Republicans pressed Mr. Trump to dispense with legal protections for the suspect in New York and declare him an enemy combatant. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and a onetime critic of Mr. Trump who has lately become an ally, praised the president’s tough stance.

“The one thing I like about President Trump, he understands that we are in a religious war,” Mr. Graham told Fox News on Tuesday night, before the president’s Twitter posts about Mr. Schumer and immigration. “And to the American people, we are fighting people who are compelled by their religious views to kill us all. They kill fellow Muslims who don’t agree with their view of Islam. They kill Christians, vegetarians, libertarians, you name it. So we’re in a war.”",Trump Blames Schumer and Immigration Policies Hours After New York Terrorist Attack,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/us/politics/trump-new-york-attack-schumer-visa.html

She “stunned” at the Emmy awards, he writes, “in a red gown cut at the ankle with the most exquisite silver roping around the neckline.”

He reserves his barbs for the likes of Jane Fonda, ”the leftist actress,” who “in a faux, Beyoncé-esque ponytail looked like she had developed a classic case of ‘trying to be a teeny-bopper.’ Give it up, Jane.” Samantha Bee, “liberal Hollywood’s talk show darling,” fared no better, pretty much a train wreck, Mr. Binder writes, “a leprechaun in her shoulder-padded, emerald green ensemble.”

For Mr. Binder, 25, delivering tart commentary is all in a day’s work. He is the fashion critic for Breitbart News.

Yes, Breitbart has a fashion critic (!), a man who by his own account is uniquely cut out for the job. Mr. Binder has been following his twin passions, fashion and politics, since his student days at Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond, La. His professors were all too predictably liberal, he said in a phone conversation last week. Which left Mr. Binder, a contrarian by nature, to take an opposing position. “The university turned me into a total right-winger,” he said.

All the same, he remained enthralled by the celebrity culture that spoke to his more progressive peers. “I loved music, the whole punk rock era, all of those things,” he recalled, such attractions all the more compelling to a boy with a nose perpetually pressed to the glass.

“I don’t live this grand fabulous lifestyle,” said Mr. Binder, who was reared in Slidell, La., near New Orleans, the youngest of eight siblings in a family of moderate means. “I don’t come from a place of growing up in a grand apartment in the West Village, from a place of having the same opinion as everyone else.”

His opinions, as might be expected, are in line with those of his employer. At its founding a decade ago, Breitbart dedicated its ideologically right-leaning coverage to celebrity culture. “One of our governing principles,” said Alex Marlow, the site’s editor in chief, “is that culture is upstream from politics. Meaning that the culture in influencing our political climate more than our political climate is influencing the culture.”

Mr. Marlow, who hired Mr. Binder in April, would like those priorities reflected on the site’s home page. “I want people to go there and find something amusing,” he said, “and not regard it purely as a place where readers get outraged.”

The site attracts its audience through, among other things, Mr. Binder’s relentless — O.K., obsessive — monitoring of Mrs. Trump, a click magnet, Mr. Marlow noted, to both male and female readers, and “the member of the first family that gets the highest approval rating.”

Mr. Binder places her on a pedestal alongside a couple of his other revered tastemakers, “the greatest living women,” in his phrase: Victoria Beckham and the Olsen sisters, Mary-Kate and Ashley.

In part, he admires his seemingly unlikely idols for their skillful self-branding. Ms. Beckham, in particular, works a kind of uniform, he noted: “With her perfect hair, oversize sweaters, pants and a handbag, you can’t imagine her any other way. In that sense she is very much like Melania.”

The first lady, he said, rarely veers from her signature formality, cleaving to a daytime wardrobe of crisp shift dresses or tailored suits. Never mind that she flaunted a $51,500 Dolce & Gabbana coat during a visit to Sicily. Or got down in the dirt at the White House in September, gardening in a Balmain tartan shirt that costs $1,380. Or that she walked tall in stilettos en route to Houston in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.

Even in that time of crisis, Mr. Binder enthused the other day, “she was unapologetic and fabulous.”

That sort of boosterism may not raise his stock with fashion insiders, but Mr. Binder is unfazed. In his view the first lady is a bellwether. Until recently, if you were fashionable, you wore sneakers, he said, “even if they cost $2,000 and were Gucci. You didn’t want to look expensive or as if you were trying too hard.”

“With Melania, all that has gone out the window,” he said. “She is transitioning us into a kind of bitch-goddess ultra-femininity.”

Of course, his column is not all Melania, all the time. Mr. Binder shuttles between coverage of style and — wait for it — immigration. His recent reports on that politically freighted beat, which takes up roughly 60 percent of his time, include an account of a California woman who obtained United States citizenship without being able to speak, read or write English. And he wags a finger at Ivanka Trump, not a current Breitbart favorite. At a recent dinner panel, Ms. Trump referred to the young immigrants covered by the DACA program as “innocent people,” while failing to mention, Mr. Binder writes, “some of the egregious crimes committed by illegal aliens.”

How does he reconcile his fashion reporting with his coverage of immigration? Not a problem, Mr. Binder said. “We’re one of the very few news outlets that cover immigration from the point of view of the American worker.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

His style analysis is in line with that mission, he said. “We’re reporting with the gaze of ordinary people who want to look at photos of beautiful women in beautiful clothes.”

Enthralled as he is with his subjects’ appearance, he is no feminist. The movement “has denigrated women,” he said, “reducing those who feel that their chief purpose is to raise children to feeling that they are not on a par with these yuppies on the Upper East Side.”

He acknowledged that such views tend to color his coverage. He reported on the harassment charges against the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein but now focuses much of his ire on fashion designers and editors, calling out their silence as disingenuous. “They seemed to know things, but acted as if they didn’t know,” Mr. Binder said.

He is a maverick and ambitious, for sure. But he nurtures no ardent hope of piercing fashion’s fabled glass ceiling. Does he expect one day to get a summons from Vogue or its more rarefied cousin W?

At Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United, the likes of Phil Neville, Park Ji-Sung and John O’Shea filled the role of utility players. Ferguson deemed the latter to be of such importance in the club’s 2008-09 season that at one point he anointed him a contender for player of the year in England. The great Liverpool side of the late 1980s boasted Steve Nicol; the Ajax team that swept through Europe in the 1990s could call on Ronald de Boer.

To a manager, versatility was an asset; to a player, it was an advantage. Steve Watson, who played in every outfield position for both Newcastle United and Everton, knew his flexibility made him “ideal cover” as a substitute, but always felt it gave him “a much better opportunity of getting into the team.”

In recent years, however, utility seemed to have fallen out of fashion. When clubs can name at least seven substitutes, rather than three, for every game, managers had no need to reserve a space on the bench for someone who could cover anywhere.

As squads grew, too, managers learned to favor expertise. Most elite teams employ two specialists for every position, with those positions ever more tightly defined. Few would expect an attacking midfielder to slot into a holding role, much less play at fullback.

In many ways, José Mourinho encapsulates this thinking. In the spring of 2016, when he agreed to replace Louis van Gaal at Manchester United, Mourinho commanded the club’s executive vice chairman, Ed Woodward, to sign four players, each of them designated a specific role: Paul Pogba, Eric Bailly, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

“As you know, especially the ones with more vision, I am a manager that likes specialists,” Mourinho explained at the time. “I am clear with my approach and model of players.” At most, he said, he likes “one or two multifunctional players,” because “you always need someone that can give you a hand.”

In such an environment, then, it should be no surprise that players are increasingly keen to define themselves as specialists. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, for example, cited a desire to play in his favored central midfield role when he joined Liverpool, and Aaron Ramsey made the same request to Arsène Wenger, the Arsenal manager, with more success.

“Some guys, they only want to play in one position,” Guardiola, now the Manchester City manager, said recently. “They say that they are not comfortable in another one.” Soccer, it seems, no longer has much room, or much appetite, for the jacks-of-all-trades.

Guardiola, however, was speaking immediately after his team had beaten Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, thanks in no small part to the performance of Fabian Delph — who has spent much of his career as a midfield player — at left back.

“He showed us,” Guardiola said. “It’s not easy when a manager gives you an opportunity to play in a position you’ve never played before, so it means a lot. I’m so happy for him.”

It is the same across Manchester at United, where Mourinho, for all his professed preference for specialists, is enjoying no little success with Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young, brought up as wingers, as his two fullbacks. At Liverpool, midfielder James Milner was deputized as a left back for much of last season.

It is not just fullbacks, though. At Barcelona, Javier Mascherano, a defensive midfielder for Argentina, plays in central defense, while Sergi Roberto has won praise for his ability to fill as many as eight positions.

Bayern Munich uses Javi Martínez as a defender and a midfielder, while Guardiola’s intervention ensured Philipp Lahm was reimagined as a midfielder rather than a defender in the final years before his retirement. David Alaba is most often used as a left back but can play across the midfield, too.

In attack, if anything, versatility is even more of a prerequisite, among both the elite and the lesser lights. When Stoke City signed Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting this summer, it was his ability to play across the front line that persuaded the Stoke manager, Mark Hughes, to make his move. He had specifically commissioned his scouting team to find a forward comfortable in several roles.

To some, in fact, soccer is moving beyond the traditional, tight definitions of positions. Modern systems and tactics demand that players fill any number of roles during any given game, shifting between duties as the situation demands. “Who even decides the positions?” Jurgen Klopp, the Liverpool manager, said. “If you are a left back, maybe you started as a left winger. A central defender might have started as a No. 6.

“We play sometimes with wingers, but really only when we defend. It is quite fluid. I am not interested in positions: only when we are defending, and in terms of the distances between players.”

It is much the same message many young players are given during their education. “There are different, and continually evolving, systems and styles at the highest level,” said Joel Waldron, the manager of Everton’s youth academy, among the most prolific in England. “We feel it is important that we develop players who are tactically flexible.”

That process involves playing young prospects in as many positions as possible: not just within games, Waldron said, but during coaching sessions designed to “expose them to a variety of selected positional roles and responsibilities,” and in the classroom, too. “As the boys get older, we supplement their learning with video sessions,” Waldron said.

There is an element of pragmatism behind all this; as Waldron noted, many of his graduates will make their debuts in “unfavored” and occasionally unfamiliar positions. But mostly it is a philosophical choice.

“It’s important we have a curriculum that is conducive to developing players who understand the breadth of roles they may be asked to fulfill at first-team level,” he said. “Though understanding a wide range of roles must not be to the detriment of being outstanding at some or all of them.”

That was Enrique’s secret, of course: He was a master of every position he played, not simply a place-filler. It is the model, more and more, that all teams are trying to follow in an age when fluidity is paramount, when managers require players who can adapt to any system they choose. They need players who can play anywhere, who can do anything.

Baseball is a series of definitive moments, but none are quite like the final out of the World Series. It’s recorded, and we all, players and fans, claim instant perspective. Win the World Series and everything you experienced before it has led, inevitably and majestically, to this moment. Even previous failure has new meaning, and previous success has been bottled. More important, winning made it worth it all, whatever “it” was — the rehab from Tommy John surgery, the 111 losses four years ago, the boos.

Jeff Luhnow, the general manager of the Astros, has been accused of thinking he was smarter than everyone else. He experimented with unconventional concepts. He split minor league games into two parts, in effect using two starting pitchers (a k a the “piggyback”). He unearthed unorthodox players and turned them into stable big leaguers. Luhnow, the Penn grad with degrees in engineering and economics, brought with him a decision scientist with a NASA engineering background from his previous position with the St. Louis Cardinals. He thinks and lives outside the box.

An Astros victory could show that maybe he was smarter than everyone else, or at least could see the future more clearly than others. Anyone who blazes a trail will at one time or another be considered an outsider, a rogue. Only with the benefit of time can we think about it objectively. A 13-12 win, or a 13-12 loss, in Game 5, for instance, can be the difference between being perceived as a visionary or as a gimmicky bureaucrat. Results create perceptions.

The Astros put together a 101-win season in 2017, after losing over 100 games for three years running. Now they’re fueled by MVP candidates galore, and opponents must pick their poison: Pitch to Jose Altuve, George Springer or Carlos Correa? Defensively, they seem to catch everything, and they feature a lefty-righty standout pitching combo of the 2011 Cy Young Award winner and MVP Justin Verlander and another Cy Young winner, Dallas Keuchel.

All of that added up to what Atul Goyal, an analyst at the securities firm Jefferies, called “blowout results” for Sony’s latest quarter.

The company said on Tuesday it had earned an operating profit — before taxes and other reductions — of 204 billion yen, or about $1.79 billion, in the three months through September. That was more than four times what it made in the same period last year.

Sony also upgraded its profit forecast for the full financial year, which ends in March, from ¥500 billion to ¥630 billion, which would be an all-time high if realized.

Investors piled into Sony’s shares on Wednesday in response. The stock closed up 11 percent at ¥4,918, the highest level since the start of the global financial crisis in 2008. Japanese share prices have been buoyant across the board lately, and the country’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index has reached multidecade highs while Wall Street and other markets have also surged. Still, Sony was Japan’s most sought-after stock on Wednesday.

Lovers of the Aibo might be tempted to see karma at work. Sony first introduced the dog in 1999, saying it hoped robotic animal companions would become as ubiquitous as the real thing. That never happened, and Sony stopped making the Aibo in 2006, as it struggled to rein in losses. The mechanical dog’s small but devoted fan base was crushed.

Sony hopes that the world is now ready for artificially intelligent consumer robots, and that it can be a leader in the quickly advancing technology. The new Aibo uses Sony’s image sensors to interact with the world around it, and the company says it will be capable of learning, to a limited degree — for instance by repeating behaviors that owners praise.

The dog goes on sale in Japan in January for ¥198,000, or about $1,750.

“Combining robotics and A.I. is a way for Sony to play on its strengths,” Sony’s chief executive, Kazuo Hirai, who has driven the company’s restructuring since taking over in 2012, said at a news conference. “We have multiple projects in development, and one of them is Aibo.”","Sony’s Fortunes Improve, From Rising Profit to a Return for Aibo",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/business/sony-stock-aibo.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

‘What Do You Think Caused World War II, a Zoning Issue?’

Stephen Colbert took a break Tuesday from his focus on the Russia investigation to address some controversial comments by the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly. In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Mr. Kelly praised Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general, and said the Civil War took place only because of “the lack of an ability to compromise.”

“What do you mean, there was a lack of compromise? The Civil War happened because of compromise: the Missouri Compromise, the Three-Fifths Compromise. You’re a general and you don’t know why the Civil War happened? What do you think caused World War II, a zoning issue? ‘I vant to build a strip mall in the Sudetenlands!

The “Late Night” correspondent Amber Ruffin registered her disgust with Mr. Kelly.

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

“IN THE LONELY HOUR” was a little more than a half-hour crying jag about longing for a man — a straight, married one he was in love with whom he never so much as kissed. Nearly every song was about this: “Stay With Me,” the sad song about wanting a man to stay even when it’s clear he’s not in love; “Good Thing,” the sad song about deciding that he’s stayed too long waiting around — that one begins with a vision of him getting mugged outside the man’s door and dying in his arms like Éponine. And, on the deluxe edition of the album, a cover of Whitney Houston’s “How Will I Know?” which was not a sad song until he sang it.

He told Rolling Stone that he “had to be careful” so that straight people could sing along with his music, too. “I am not Sam Smith, the gay singer,” he said at the time. “I am Sam Smith, the singer who happens to be gay.” He gave an interview where he talked about Grindr and Tinder, the hookup apps, and how sad it was that all the possibility behind love and serendipity came down to a swiping culture, and saying this offended some in the gay community too. He accepted the Oscar for best original song for “Writing’s on the Wall,” from “Spectre,” the James Bond movie, referring to an article he’d read in which Ian McKellen had “said that no openly gay man had ever won an Oscar. If this is the case — even if it isn’t the case — I want to dedicate this to the L.G.B.T. community all around the world.”

Well, he woke up the morning after the Oscars to an assassination’s worth of ridicule, including from an openly gay man who had won an Oscar. The Verge called Mr. Smith’s statement “vague” and “inaccurate,” saying, “If you’re going to stump for a cause on stage, you need to come correct.” Gawker, in an essay about Mr. Smith’s “gay conservatism,” wrote, “His philosophy is, in short, to be gay, but not too gay.” Sure, he quickly realized, the Oscar thing was wrong — he’d meant to say that there’d never been an openly gay lead actor winner — but the other stuff: why was it taken so badly? So what if he didn’t like hookup apps? Why was that surprising? Hadn’t people seen him, dressed like a 1950s lounge act, complete with a pompadour? Hadn’t they heard his retro soul? What exactly about him seemed modern? So what that he wanted his music to be a universal experience? He never said he was the spokesman for gay people.

The vitriol of the Oscar incident surprised him. His heart was clearly in the right place. He was a proud gay man. How could that not mean anything? “I’m not the most eloquent person,” Mr. Smith says now. “I didn’t get the best grades in school. I mean, I’m just good at singing.”

It felt like he was getting hammered every time he opened his mouth. All he wanted was to remind people that love is love is love, particularly his brand of young adult love: heart-eye emoji love, cupid-arrow love, the love from “The Notebook” and “Titanic.” That’s how big love is. Once again, on his favorite subject, he pretend-faints on the couch in swoon and desire. He clutches his heart and makes his eyebrows almost touching a near-steeple of longing. This was the thing we all had in common. Why talk about the things that make us different?

YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND what it was like for him. Mr. Smith was raised in Great Chishill, a village an hour and a half from London with a population of less than 700. He wore a full face of makeup to school — to Catholic school — and fake eyelashes, too, and elaborate arrangements of flowers pinned to his lapel, along with the occasional all-over sprinkling of glitter. Some kids were mean to him about his sexuality, but it was the making fun of his weight that bothered him. His sexuality was not a negotiation; his weight was.

He grew up with two younger sisters in a pink house; there’s a tattoo of its address around the C6 vertebra of his cervical spine. His bedroom walls were painted a shiny gold and his bed had a red silk duvet. He applied cheap, clumpy mascara each morning and on the gold wall next to his mirror, he dabbed his mascara wand to rid it of excess. One day, in detention, someone told him about dream boards, and so he spent the hour making one to put up on his bedroom wall. There was a sketch of a Grammy there. He drew the back of his head performing to an arena.

He came out when he was 10. Literally someone at school said, “Are you gay?” and he said, “I am!” His mother said she’d known since he was 3. He’d always had very short hair, but when he was young, he used to make the gesture of pushing strands behind his ears, like it was long, or flicking imaginary hair off his shoulder. In the car, when the windows were open, he would pretend he’d gotten a hair stuck to his lips and pick it away.

And it was all totally fine, even when it wasn’t, even when the first boy he had a crush on said nasty, homophobic things to him that still make him cry. But he had a lot of friends. There were no other (openly) gay boys. He fell in love with straight boys. He could barely picture a future when one of them would look back at him with lust or sexual curiosity, let alone love. And still he was happy. He grew comfortable in his longing. People sometimes made fun of him, but so what? He understood who he was. He thought that if you know who you are, and if you’re confident in that and you don’t make a big deal of it, people will accept you.

His parents signed him up for voice lessons when he wouldn’t stop crooning throughout the house. He had a manager from the age of 11, then another, then another, each promising him that he would become very famous very soon. It didn’t happen. He moved to London, where he tended bar. One day, he met Jimmy Napes, who introduced him to his eventual managers, who in turn introduced him to the electronic duo Disclosure, with whom he recorded the vocals for “Latch,” Disclosure’s single — and his breakout — in 2012.

The rest — the album, the tour — it all happened fast. He woke up the day after the Oscars, saw the chaos online, apologized, and slunk off. Why wasn’t this working? People loved his music, but they were turning on him. He couldn’t bear being thought of as a traitor to his people — he was so open about everything! Sure, he didn’t like Tinder, and it’s mostly true that he didn’t like it because it isn’t romantic, but it is maybe truer that he was afraid he would be swiped away. Believe it or not, he did use Grindr, but he didn’t want random hookups so he arranged dinner dates with several very confused men.

Then, one day, he went to Australia for a show, and afterward had a talk with his publicist there, a gay man who lives with his partner of 18 years. The publicist took Mr. Smith to the Stonewall, a gay bar in Sydney, for a drink one afternoon. He decided to help educate him, taking him to a gay bookshop. “My mind just went,” Mr. Smith said. He read the memoir “Holding the Man,” which blew his mind. He watched “Paris Is Burning.” He still has “Tales of the City” on his night table. Next, the Australians introduced him to drag. They crammed his feet into thigh-high, high-heeled boots. They draped a red sequin dress over his 6’2” body. They had barbecues and played Madonna and danced.

“I lived in a village in the middle of nowhere as an openly gay man from the age of 10 years old,” Mr. Smith said. “I didn’t meet another gay man until I was 19 when I moved to London. I just went gay clubbing a few times with some straight friends and with some girlfriends of mine, and then I became famous. I never got an opportunity to find my people in the gay community and find my friends.”

He decided not to drink or smoke or be with a man, even just kissing, for a long time, while he was figuring all this stuff out. He was trying to understand how he fit into the gay community at large. “I just really sat with myself and got to know myself and started to just like my stretch marks and not be so hard on myself and stop watching perfection everywhere.”

He began seeking out the art that struck him as truest. He stopped watching “Titanic” and “The Notebook.” O.K., he watched “The Notebook” again last week but he also watched “Weekend,” the gay indie film, so it balanced out.

Then he found George Michael. He had always been a fan of his music. He was 15 when he saw him in concert. But now, reading and watching interviews with him in his last years, after Mr. Michael came out, Mr. Smith found him to be a great mentor. “I just feel like I’m going to offend someone every time I open my mouth,” he said. “I feel like George Michael had a way of being authentic to himself and honest in a way that was warm.”

Back at the interview in West Hollywood, he leaned back on the couch, looked up at the ceiling and blew a stream of breath out through pursed lips. “People forget but no one learns about gay history in school. Nothing. So I didn’t know anything about my history as a gay man and then words like ‘spokesperson’ are being thrown at me when I’ve just brought out my first album,” he said. “It scared me because I was like, I don’t know anything about being gay, really.”

He realized two things. One was that he was ready to make a second album. The other thing was that coming out as gay wasn’t enough. He now understood that every visible gay person still had a leadership role. He now understood that he wasn’t operating on his own, but that he lived in context to a community whether he’d realized it or not. No, having come out as a gay singer, he realized it was now time to come out as a gay man.

THE NEXT AFTERNOON, Saturday, he rode to the Hollywood Bowl, where he was performing at a breast cancer benefit that included Lorde and Kesha and Harry Styles. He was wearing a pastel, airbrushed silk, short-sleeve button-down shirt and olive silk pleated pants. “I can tuck them in now,” he said proudly. “I’m a tucker.”

Since he left the public eye for the studio, which is where he’d been since the end of his last tour, in 2015, he’d lost a ton of weight by doing something called “intermittent fasting,” meaning he waits five hours after eating to eat again (and which is also called not eating between meals). A trainer. A nutritionist. He stopped eating bread. Probably being a man in his 20s helped.

His transformation was sparked by seeing a tabloid picture of himself on the beach without a shirt, and that was not the self he wanted to be. He was also concerned about his health. He gets acid reflux, and it’s bad for his voice. He knows other stars “mime,” as he puts it, but he doesn’t want to. His voice is his whole thing, his whole bag of tricks.

Mr. Smith had also cut off his pompadour, which he called his “quiff,” his short hair now reminiscent of George Michael’s on his 2011 Symphonica tour. His hair was thicker than it’s been recently. After the Oscars, it had started falling out from stress, he thought. He began to use Rogaine and take Propecia, and it worked. Men need to talk about hair loss, he thinks.

If “In the Lonely Hour” was the myopic look into the heart of a boy helplessly in love, then the new album, “The Thrill of It All,” is about a man who turns his gaze outward. “Midnight Train” is a sad song about ending a relationship that was inspired by friends; “Palace,” a sad song about whether or not love is worth it if it ends; “HIM,” a sad story of an imagined boy in Mississippi coming out to his father. Some of the tracks are about Mr. Smith himself, including “Burning,” a sad song about pining for a man who has left; and “One Last Song,” a sad final ode to the man who was the subject of “In the Lonely Hour.” The new album won’t be a surprise to anyone familiar with the first one: The old-timey soul is still there. Mr. Smith decided long ago that his voice was the instrument: melisma, whispered baritones, surprise out-of-nowhere ultra-high falsetto, even a haunting, beautiful croak of longing sprinkled here and there. It is still prime music for “having sex with your sadness,” as Mr. Smith said.

But he can now recount actual relationships in his songs. He’s still never been in the kind of magical “Notebook” love he longs for, he said, but about a year ago, he had a five-month relationship that took three breakups before the breakup took and which is the subject of “Too Good at Goodbyes,” the first single off the new album, which is in the Billboard Top 10 as of this writing. He’s been dating the actor Brandon Flynn, from Netflix’s “13 Reasons Why,” seeing where that goes.

Backstage at the Hollywood Bowl, Mr. Smith drank a cup of Throat Coat, and then took a Gaviscon for acid reflux. He sang through a cocktail straw while holding up a tissue to make it move with his breath to strengthen his throat muscles, something he learned from an opera singer. He motor-boated his lips. He was ready for the show.

The next day, the news media would pick up a statement he made about feeling as much like a woman as a man, and social media would get on him for being too casual about gender fluidity when he identifies as a gay man. One day he will get it right, he said, his eyes shiny with big, sad Sam Smith tears,

“The only thing I’d like everyone to know is I’m really sorry if I say the wrong things,” he said. “I don’t want to offend anyone and my intentions are genuinely pure and good. I’m still trying to figure [expletive] out and I’d like to be treated like a human. If I make mistakes don’t kill me.”

Yes, one day. One day when he’s old, he said, he’s going to know what to say. He’s going to be someone who can figure out how to think his words through before he says them. He’ll get older, and as he does, he’s going to stop using his falsetto so much, he said. It’s a sound that can’t age with you, and even on the new album, he’s started to sing more in his regular voice. Eventually, he’s going to be like Joni Mitchell and just use the lowest registers. He’s going to come out on stage like Joni on the cover of “Both Sides Now,” with a glass of wine and a cigarette (yes, by then he’ll be drinking and smoking again). He’s looking forward to that, when his voice starts to get breathy and broken like Judy Garland’s when she sings “Over the Rainbow” at Carnegie Hall. Eventually he’ll retire and open up a flower shop in the English countryside, he said. He’ll get really into cooking, he’ll have a pet pig named Kong or maybe Flo, and he’ll live forever happily, surrounded by his husband and children and his closet full of drag. His funeral will call for fancy dress, and the men will have to dress like women and the women will have to dress like men. Drag queens wearing big black hats with veils and high heels will carry his coffin out. Then disco music will play. That’s nice, isn’t it?

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

But while Mr. Redman soloed with a smokestack effusiveness, getting underneath the melodies and setting them alight, Mr. Coltrane’s horn was liquid. It seemed to move freely on its own, as if any expansion or turn was coming directly from the notes themselves.

The festival, Monk@100, was produced by Duke University, and studiously programmed by Mr. Iverson and Aaron Greenwald, the director of Duke Performances. It was the highest-profile and probably the most far-reaching of the many Monk tributes happening this year, and it attested to the durability of Monk’s influence, even at a time when consensus in jazz has grown rare.

The major focus, perhaps inevitably, was on Monk’s pen. The 60-plus tunes he is known to have written are some of the most beloved pieces in jazz’s canon, partly because they live just barely outside of its conventional language. That’s what the daytime show on Oct. 21 was about, when five pianists took turns playing solo and duo renditions of almost every work Monk wrote. The same applied for the performances of the J.D. Allen Trio, which worked with a different guest each of the festival’s first three nights.

But it went beyond that. On Oct. 20, the pianist Jason Moran came together in a duo with the drummer and multi-instrumentalist Tyshawn Sorey. (I wasn’t in town for this part of the festival but was able to watch video shot by a film crew documenting the entire event. That footage may someday be public.) Their first set began with a loose reading of the ruminative melody to “Monk’s Mood” and ventured quickly into abstraction, dispatching with the standard ideas of what it takes to interpret Monk’s music.

This set was one of the moments when the spirit of Monk’s piano playing got called up and shocked back to life in the air of the present day. This came naturally through Mr. Moran’s fingers and his memory. He grew up idolizing Monk and reworked Monk’s language of halting gestures and piquant dissonance, eventually rendering his own approach. Playing with Mr. Sorey here, he often reduced Monk’s song themes to scaffolds and wisps; his own chiming, splintery swing feels attested to Monk’s long shadow, even in a context dominated by free improvisation.","At 100, Thelonious Monk Gets a Hero’s Celebration",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/music/thelonious-monk-centennial-festival.html

In the end, her only opponent was Tim Ryan, a young congressman and former high school quarterback star from Ohio’s 13th District, the ailing industrial region surrounding Youngstown and Akron. Ryan offered a splash-of-cold-water speech just before the vote: “We got wiped out,” he said, according to a recording of his remarks. “We’re toxic in the Midwest, and we’re toxic in the South.”

Pelosi won easily, but fully a third of the Democratic caucus voted against their leader, and Ryan’s insurrection seemed to have left a mark: After the election, three well-liked and nonrebellious members — Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Hakeem Jeffries of New York and David Cicilline of Rhode Island — were chosen by the caucus to help manage the rebranding of the party. The three of them spent the first half of 2017 dutifully interviewing nearly every member of the caucus and conducting more than a dozen listening sessions with authors, pollsters and former Obama cabinet secretaries. They hosted a dinner at which the party’s various factions — the Progressive Caucus, the Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, the conservative Blue Dogs and the New Democrats, among others — mingled as if meeting for the first time.

In late July, Pelosi, Bustos, Jeffries and Cicilline stood on a stage with six other Democrats under a wiltingly hot summer sky in the city park of Berryville, Va. — a town of 4,306 residents in a purple district within easy driving distance of Washington — and unveiled their new agenda, titled “A Better Deal: Better Jobs, Better Wages, Better Future.” The phrase, which had been poll-tested by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was an intentional echo of F.D.R.’s New Deal — and, less intentionally, of a Papa John’s pizza slogan. But its biggest debt was to the author of “The Art of the Deal,” and to his crimson-jowled populism.

“A Better Deal” called for retraining in America’s fading manufacturing sector, renegotiating trade deals, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and fighting the corporate consolidation that had affected the prices of everything from eyeglasses to beer. None of the 10 speakers invoked President Barack Obama. In fact, one of the key provisions in “A Better Deal” — renegotiating drug prices for Medicare recipients — was an implicit rebuke of the former president, who had agreed with the pharmaceutical industry to freeze Medicare drug prices in exchange for its support of the Affordable Care Act.

But even before the rollout, Pelosi diminished the substance of “A Better Deal” in an interview with The Washington Post, clarifying that it was not “a course correction, but it’s a presentation correction.” A Quinnipiac poll in August found that only 33 percent of Democrats and 12 percent of independents had a favorable opinion of the new Democratic agenda. The self-consciousness of the rebranding, one congressman mused to me at the time, “seems like what you would do in a different era.”

There was a stiff-jointedness to the whole spectacle, a sense of the Democrats’ trying to regain the use of muscles they had let atrophy over the previous eight years. Obama, after all, used to make this sort of thing look easy. Conflating the American story with his own — “This is who we are” — the president conveyed, even in policy irresolution, an unshakable sense of his and America’s place in the world. “I love the guy, I miss him,” Scott Peters said of Obama. “But organizationally, the party is in disarray. We’re at the lowest level of elected officeholders since Hoover. We got a bit lazy and found ourselves relying on Barack Obama’s charisma, and it left us in bad shape.”

Barring seismic developments, the G.O.P. is still likely to control both the White House and the Senate until at least January 2021. But nine months into Trump’s presidency, the chances of the Democrats’ retaking the House are much better. Multiple polls in recent months have shown generic Democratic candidates beating generic Republicans by as many as 15 points — a spread that, in past elections, correlated with winning more than enough seats for the Democrats to gain a House majority next year. And if they do, the consequences will be enormous. A Democrat-controlled House in 2019 would very likely derail the Republican legislative agenda. It could also conceivably set the stage for impeachment proceedings against the president — a move that many Democrats have openly proposed for months now.

But the Democrats’ path back from the wilderness is not a short one. No president since Ronald Reagan has won the presidency as convincingly, twice over, as Obama did — but those victories papered over an extraordinary decline in his party that became suddenly unignorable on Nov. 9, 2016. The Democratic National Committee today is an understaffed, demoralized bureaucracy. It has raised less than half of what its Republican counterpart has taken in so far this year. (Other party organizations — the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee — are faring better.)

Democratic presidents have generally been less than attentive to the financial and electoral health of their party, during and after their presidencies. The Northwestern political-science professor Daniel J. Galvin writes in his 2010 book, “Presidential Party Building,” that since John F. Kennedy, each of them “neglected, exploited or undercut his party’s organizational capacities.” Galvin found that this maltreatment was because such presidents had operated with “deep and durable majorities” in Congress. After the Democrats lost theirs in 1994, President Bill Clinton awakened to the virtues of party-building. Galvin predicted that Obama would most likely have sufficient reason to do the same.

Instead, Obama was every bit as indifferent as his predecessors. After he took office, his campaign’s formidable grass-roots organization, rechristened Organizing for America, became what some party leaders complained was a “shadow organization” that drained resources from the D.N.C. while championing the president rather than the Democratic Party as a whole. The president did not have anywhere near the kind of close relationship with the last D.N.C. chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, that George W. Bush had with the Republican National Committee chairmen Ed Gillespie and Ken Mehlman.

In 2012, Obama’s campaign chose not to contribute any money to the D.S.C.C. during that cycle — and then, emerging from its victory that year with a $20 million debt, the campaign promptly offloaded it onto the D.N.C. In early 2014, Obama assured Senate Democrats that keeping the Senate majority was his “No. 1 priority.” Months passed without any further action. Finally, two months before the midterms, Obama informed Harry Reid by phone that he was authorizing a $5 million transfer of D.N.C. funds to Senate election efforts. Reid tersely replied, “It shouldn’t have been this hard.”

Few of the Obama campaigns’ innovations have meaningfully outlasted his presidency. Their once-pioneering digital-organizing operation, for example, went largely to ground in 2016, while the party failed to fully grasp even the basics, like the usefulness of digital advertising. “What I can tell you,” says Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, who oversaw an analysis of the party’s shortcomings in the last election cycle, “is that our candidates and their staff told us that the Republicans did much better digitally than we did. And they spent more than us on digital.” (Teddy Goff, Obama’s former digital director, says: “I sincerely wish the technology built in the two Obama campaigns had been put to better use for 2016 and races down the ballot.”)

State Democratic Party leaders complain about O.F.A. — rebranded again recently as Organizing for Action — hoarding campaign resources to little end. And Priorities USA, the extravagantly funded super PAC that was started to support Obama’s 2012 campaign, never built the kind of entrenched ground-level presence maintained by its analogues on the right. In contrast, Americans for Prosperity, the conservative network financed by David and Charles Koch, spent the Obama years establishing a network of more than three million activists in 36 states and mobilizing them to protest against Obamacare, environmental regulations and tax increases — becoming what the group’s president, Tim Phillips, described to me as “a state-based long-game organization that would always be there.” The current chairman of Priorities USA, Guy Cecil, acknowledges the disparity: “Most of our activities, most of our structures, are built around individual fights, or individual candidates, or individual organizations, and I think that’s put us at a disadvantage.”

Organizational and technological lapses do not fully account for the Democratic Party’s travails. “All that stuff is like the field-goal team,” the Obama strategist David Axelrod told me. “None of it will help you if you haven’t already moved 80 yards down the field. Being technologically proficient wouldn’t have saved Obama if he didn’t also have a consistent, compelling message.”

But that message had grown threadbare by 2016. No longer was it sufficient to campaign on hope and change, or even on the president’s successful efforts in 2009 to stave off a deep recession. The uneven economic recovery raised questions about the party’s obliviousness to the impunity of Wall Street and the gap between the megawealthy and everyone else. Hakeem Jeffries, the New York congressman who was an author of “A Better Deal,” admits, “We developed a blind spot for the economic challenges that still remained unmet.”

By the end of Obama’s presidency, the Democratic Party had lost nearly a thousand seats in state legislatures across America. It had forfeited its majority in both the House and the Senate. A mere 16 of the nation’s 50 governors were Democrats — and that number dwindled to 15 in August, when Jim Justice of West Virginia announced with a grinning Donald Trump at his side that he, too, had decided to become a Republican.

A few days after the election, Ian Russell quit his job as the deputy executive director of the D.C.C.C. and cashed in his frequent-flier miles on a trip to Ireland. He watched Trump’s swearing-in on his phone in a Dublin pub over a pint of Guinness, and then a few more. The following morning, he threw his bags in a rental car and began a sort of weeklong post-traumatic odyssey, rambling westward to the coast.

Russell, now 33, had spent the past six years at the D.C.C.C. trying to help the Democrats regain the House majority that they lost to the Republicans in the 2010 midterm election. During every election cycle, political journalists and donors would file into one of the drab conference rooms inside the D.N.C. headquarters near the Capitol and watch as D.C.C.C. officials like Russell unveiled maps and polling data in support of the claim that this election cycle — unlike the last one — was going to break for the Democrats. Each time, Russell maybe half-believed it.

But election night left him reeling. It wasn’t just that Trump had upset Clinton — including in Russell’s home state, Michigan — or that the Democrats emerged 24 seats short of a House majority. What gnawed at him was a fear that Trump might actually win over Democratic voters more lastingly. Benton Harbor, a few miles down the road from Russell’s hometown in the western part of the state, lost its last Whirlpool manufacturing facility years ago. The childhood friends of his who remained in the area had renounced the Democrats and were now Trump voters. “Trump could transform American politics,” he remembers thinking at the time. “He could truly scramble things.”

But Russell’s fears of a unifying, postpartisan pragmatist in chief swiftly proved unjustified. Rather than focusing on jobs and infrastructure projects, Trump immediately set in motion an attempt to repeal Obamacare and ordered a travel ban on citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, which was met with demonstrations at airports across the country. On Jan. 30, the nonpartisan Hill analyst Stuart Rothenberg published a column headlined “Trump’s Fast Start Likely Puts the House in Play in 2018.” Rothenberg reasoned that overly aggressive new presidents tended to be judged harshly by the electorate in the middle of their first term. “The House map favors Republicans, but the midterm dynamic could well prove more powerful,” he wrote, listing 20 Republican seats — out of 24 the Democrats would need to flip the House — that, if typical midterm election patterns held, would most likely be imperiled. “Nothing is yet guaranteed, but don’t be surprised if the House is up for grabs in the fall of 2018.”

Late on his last evening in Ireland, Russell was drinking a final Guinness and listening to a passable folk band at the Palace Bar in Dublin while halfheartedly scrolling through the news back home on his phone when he came across Rothenberg’s column. He read through to the end with an accelerating heartbeat. It seemed big news to him that Rothenberg, a dispassionate prognosticator, had confidently issued such a prediction just 10 days into Trump’s presidency.

Back in Washington, Russell joined a relatively new political media consulting firm, Beacon Media, and started hunting for prospective 2018 House candidates. In early March, he traveled to California’s Orange County — historically a G.O.P. stronghold, though its wealthy population included growing numbers of Asian-Americans who tended to vote Democratic. In Irvine he met with Dave Min, a wry 41-year-old law professor who had worked on the Hill as a senior policy adviser to Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, and at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress.

Min, the father of three young children, had never considered running for political office before. But he was also a son of Korean immigrants and was appalled by the Trump administration’s attempts to ban Muslims from entering the United States. The incumbent congresswoman of California’s 45th District, Mimi Walters, was a little-known two-term Republican who had never faced serious opposition. She had won by nearly 18 points in 2016, but Clinton beat Trump in the district by more than five points. A strong anti-Trump sentiment in 2018 could work to Min’s benefit. In April, he told Russell that he was in.

Russell then traveled to the Illinois suburbs just west of Chicago. Like California’s 45th District, the Sixth District of Illinois had been reliably Republican for decades. But Clinton beat Trump there by seven points, and already its six-term congressman, Peter Roskam, was avoiding public appearances lest he be called upon to answer for the president. The progressive women’s group Emily’s List had referred Russell to Kelly Mazeski, a longtime public servant on local boards and commissions who had already decided to challenge Roskam. Mazeski was a breast-cancer survivor whose platform, she told me recently, was “health care, health care, health care.” Russell helped Mazeski time her announcement for May 4, the day Roskam and his fellow House Republicans voted for a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Scores of candidates were announcing their intentions in terrain recently considered inhospitable to Democrats: West Virginia, Texas, Kansas. Some aspirants Russell met lacked the talent to match their enthusiasm. Others were hot property and elected to go with one of Beacon Media’s competitors. But by Labor Day, Russell and his firm had picked up 10 Democratic challengers. Among them were a few beguiling dark horses, like a 46-year-old physician and former Y.M.C.A. national health officer from Portage, Mich., named Matt Longjohn. Undeterred by his lack of political experience, Longjohn was challenging Fred Upton, a Republican who had represented Michigan’s Sixth District for three decades.

Russell himself grew up in the Sixth District and cast his first ballot as a registered voter against Upton in 2002. Back then, the incumbent seemed invincible. But now, after leading the committee that wrote the legislation seeking to eviscerate Obamacare, Upton was avoiding town halls and any other public events.

Still, when I met Russell recently, his optimism was tempered by previous electoral disappointments. The Democratic Party now has more candidates than it can support, and next spring is likely to be a season of what national Democratic officials tactfully refer to as “messy primaries.” And even with Trump as a foil, Russell’s candidates were struggling to make a case for themselves. “Right now it’s such a target-rich environment for us,” he told me. But “we’re having trouble explaining why we’re the heroes and the Republicans are the villains. At some point, our narrative will have to become more coherent than it is now.”

In pursuit of the 24 seats Democrats need to win the House, the D.C.C.C. intends to target 80 Republican-held districts — a dozen more than the party went after in its 2006 bonanza year, when it captured a majority after gaining 31 seats. Many of next year’s seem to be fanciful propositions, or strategic plays designed to force the G.O.P. to spend resources where it would rather not. In other cases, the D.C.C.C. is counting districts held by controversial Republicans — Chris Collins of New York, with his aggressive advocacy of a biotech firm in which he held substantial investments; Duncan D. Hunter of California, with the possibility of a federal indictment for supposed campaign fund malfeasances hanging over his head — who nonetheless appear safe, at least for the moment. But four Republican representatives in potential swing districts — Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Dave Reichert, Charlie Dent and Pat Tiberi — have already announced their retirement in advance of 2018, and more are expected to follow before the end of the year.

Only three times in the last century (during the Great Depression, after Bill Clinton’s impeachment and after the Sept. 11 attacks) has a president’s party not suffered electoral losses midway into his first term. Those losses — an average of 32 House seats in each such midterm since 1862 — increase to 36 when the president’s approval rating is under 50. President Trump’s polling average has never once exceeded a favorability rating of 48 percent, and it now hovers at about 37 percent.

“I think the best thing the Democrats can do,” Zac Petkanas, formerly the director of rapid response for the Clinton campaign, told me, “is find as many people with a pulse, with a D next to their names, in as many districts as possible, and run on Obamacare and standing up to Trump.” But so much of the politics, and political mood, of Trump’s presidency is off the map of previous experience that other Democrats have seemed at times at a loss for how to respond. What to make of the late August NBC poll, for instance, that showed Democrats being viewed unfavorably by 54 percent of those surveyed, which was better than Republicans (61) and Trump (61), but also Pelosi (64)? Was that good news or bad news? And what about the D.C.C.C. focus groups and polls yielding the conclusion that voters broadly dislike Trump but are also put off by candidates who profess to be “standing up to Trump,” on the grounds that such resistance will only guarantee more dysfunction in Washington?

Republicans are hopeful that, Trump being the exception to almost every political rule, the historical trends of wave elections will also not apply to him. “Clinton came up against a wave in 1994 because he had campaigned as a centrist but then led with gays in the military and Hillarycare,” Karl Rove, the former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, told me. “The 2006 election was a wave because Republicans were defending the Iraq war and crippled by a late-breaking ethics scandal. Democrats faced a wave in 2010 because of Obamacare. So it’s been issues that have driven wave elections. This time around, I think it’s more a personal antagonism to Trump. And the question is, how critical will that be in shaping the attitudes of swing voters?”

But by Rove’s own analysis, two of the last three wave elections were triggered by health care policies that did not approach the deep unpopularity of the G.O.P.’s attempts this year to repeal or otherwise roll back Obamacare. And Trump’s base cannot be counted on to prevent a wave in 2018, because a key constituency — less-educated white voters — is a group that tends not to show up during midterms. They may have even less motivation to do so next year, considering Trump’s periodic denunciations of the Republican lawmakers who will need their votes.

But in four special elections to fill seats vacated by House Republican incumbents this year, the Democrats fell short — and in the case of Georgia’s Jon Ossoff, lost by four points even after raising an unheard-of $23 million. His was the most expensive House race ever, and the fact that Democratic donors spent so heavily on a loss may help explain why the party’s fund-raising has diminished since then. The Democrats’ base — young and nonwhite voters — is no better than Trump’s at showing up for midterm elections and is unhelpfully clustered in urban districts. Many suburban and rural districts were artfully gerrymandered by Republican state legislators after the 2010 census and have proved impenetrable since then; they aren’t likely to change hands without a healthy number of recent Republican voters being persuaded to vote Democratic.

There is also a less quantifiable problem, the one that vexed Pelosi’s team in the months after the election: the Democratic Party’s chronic difficulty explaining just what it stands for. “There’s a deep worldview among conservative intellectuals that moved its way through a fear of fascism in the 1940s, through think tanks and campaigns and the California tax revolt of the 1970s,” Felicia Wong, president of the progressive Roosevelt Institute, says. “And basically the Democrats don’t have that. The New Deal was one thing, and the Great Society was another thing. The party never fully recognized that Jim Crow and segregation were economic decisions. That left Democrats with an incoherent economic argument. The result is that they lack a historical vocabulary.”

Questions about the interplay of race and economics, of course, aren’t just historical after the 2016 election — as much as politicians and operatives might want them to be. Plenty of progressives hold the view, as the MSNBC host Joy Ann Reid has argued on Twitter, that white working-class voters “resent the changes that racial and religious multiculturalism have brought to societies where people like them have been the majority.” But a former colleague of Reid’s at MSNBC, Krystal Ball, now president of the People’s House Project — which seeks to elect Democratic congressional candidates in G.O.P. districts — insists that the primary motivation of these voters is economic. “People who are holding onto their livelihoods by their fingernails thought that at least Trump gave a crap,” she says. “Maybe it was a pack of lies he was selling them, but at least he didn’t hold them in contempt. And frankly there’s a lot of contempt from certain corners of our party. And a billion dollars’ worth of ads saying we’re not elitists won’t change that.”

Early on the morning of July 27, a group of House Democrats held a private gathering in the Capitol basement with a special guest: Rahm Emanuel, the Chicago mayor and former Obama chief of staff, who over a decade ago, when he was an Illinois congressman, served as chairman of the D.C.C.C. Looking ahead to 2018, Emanuel offered a broad-brushstroke plan of attack: “Find the specific issues that resonate in your district,” he said, according to one meeting participant’s notes. “We want to appeal to Trump voters who are already pulling away from him.” In particular, “Suburbs are our best opportunities.” On the matter of ideological purity, he was blunt: “It’s not a question of left versus center — it’s forward versus backward.”

If this advice sounded familiar, it was because Emanuel advocated the same strategy a dozen years earlier, when he was trying to lift his party out of the trough it had occupied since the Newt Gingrich-led takeover of the House by the Republicans in 1994. Emanuel focused on recruiting more centrist candidates who were well liked in their districts rather than on ideological darlings of the national party. “The people who criticized me back in 2006 were from my own party,” he told me recently. “When I was recruiting candidates, I’d get yelled at: ‘Why is he getting all these sheriffs and military guys?’ It’s because they were running in red districts!”

The election cemented Emanuel’s legend as a tactician — none of the Democrats attending the July 27 meeting expressed skepticism about his advice — but his strategy has never sat well with the party’s progressive activists. “I would just point to the fact that Rahm Emanuel’s Democrats who won in 2006 couldn’t hold those seats,” Stephanie Taylor, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (P.C.C.C.), which supports, trains and funds candidates, told me.

She was referring to the nearly a dozen Democrats who rode the 2006 wave into Congress, only to wash back out of it with the Tea Party wave four years later. (Three more had lost in 2008.) “I would suggest a counterfactual,” she went on: “If we had true economic populist champions who made the case to the American people about fighting for a strong economic agenda, we might have had more lasting success.” Or as the P.C.C.C.’s other founder, Adam Green, put it to me: “If there’s a Democratic wave in 2018, progressives won’t just ride that wave — we will cause that wave.”

Of course, activists like Green and Taylor also vowed to be the tip of the party’s spear in the previous cycle, with not much to show for it. Indeed, the Breitbart chairman and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon scornfully likens the Democrats’ ideological tussles to a “pillow fight,” further charging that progressives will never accomplish their goals “until they have a Breitbart on the left,” he told me. “Our stock in trade is going after the Republican establishment. There’s no one like that on the other side.”

Most if not all Democrats are more than happy to watch Bannon’s kamikaze antics wreak havoc on the opposition. Still, some in the party rue the lack of pugnacity on their own side. “There are two types of Democrats,” David Krone, Harry Reid’s former chief of staff, told me one afternoon this summer in the Midtown Manhattan office where he now works as a consultant for an investment firm. “There are killers, and there are whiners. Unfortunately, we have too many of the latter and not enough of the former.”

Krone considers piety an obstacle to progressive policies. “Democrats are not that pure,” he told me, with a biting smile. “All those guys have a transactional component to them.” Under Reid’s leadership, the Democrats managed to pass important legislation like the Affordable Care Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act while also thwarting a stream of conservative bills generated by the Republican-controlled House. But it was also Reid who held his colleagues to the deal that garnered the pharmaceutical industry’s support for Obamacare by agreeing to take Medicare drug prices off the table. When the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision in 2010 opened the floodgates for outside-group contributions, Reid did not join the chorus of bemoaners. Instead, he ordered up a super PAC, called the Senate Majority PAC, to help keep the Senate in Democratic hands during the 2010 and 2012 cycles. “Reid just never pretended to be something he wasn’t,” Krone said. “You don’t want to pass health care? Fine. Don’t make deals. Keep losing.”

In the Democratic Killers Hall of Fame, Krone places Emanuel and Pelosi. But lately, Krone observed, the party seemed to be tilting toward the whiners — beginning with the excuses offered for Hillary Clinton’s defeat. “It’s insane,” he said. “They freaking lost! They can blame anyone they want to, but they fail to look in the mirror.”

The 2018 cycle, Krone argued, was no time for squeamishness. Again he cited the example of his former boss Reid, who, like many Democrats in 2010, was a heavy underdog going into his final Senate race. Rather than be cowed by a Republican field that, at the peak of the Tea Party movement, had been infiltrated by the party’s fringe, Reid turned that to his advantage. His campaign waded into the Republican primary, targeting the most formidable G.O.P. opponents one by one until the only one left standing was Sharron Angle: a Tea Party favorite who once crusaded against water fluoridation and claimed multiple American cities were under the rule of Shariah law. Reid beat her easily.

By way of contrast, Krone pointed to Russ Feingold, the Wisconsin senator who, with John McCain, was a standard-bearer for campaign-finance reform, as well as a crusader for civil liberties during the Bush years. Feingold lacked Reid’s appetite for the jugular, losing to Ron Johnson in 2010 and then again in 2016. “He had his foot on Johnson’s neck, and then he let up, because he was up in the polls,” Krone lamented. “They don’t hand out participation trophies in politics.” If the party limited itself to high-minded campaigning and legislating, “We’ll lose again, and Kennedy” — the Supreme Court justice — “will retire, and Trump will get to appoint another conservative crazy, and the Democrats will wonder how things got to be so horrible.”

Still, the party faces a conundrum in its pursuit of Trump voters whose anxieties aren’t just economic but cultural as well. Prevailing in some red districts may require, at minimum, tempering the party’s progressivism on social issues. “When anybody talks about a so-called litmus test for candidates, that upsets me,” Representative Cheri Bustos told me. “I’m from Illinois, where I’m the only downstate Democrat in our entire delegation. I’ve been a Democrat my whole life, and my core values are very much in line with what hard-core Democrats believe. I don’t ever lie about my views. However, I also don’t talk about issues that are by their very nature divisive. If asked, I’ll answer I’m pro-choice. But then I’ll get back to the economy.”

But a week after Bustos and I spoke, the D.C.C.C.’s chairman, Ben Ray Luján, enraged liberal groups by saying that his organization would not oppose House candidates in favor of restricting abortion. Seeking to douse the fire, Meredith Kelly, the D.C.C.C. communications director, released a statement clarifying that the D.C.C.C. listed abortion rights as among the “fundamental tenets of the Democratic Party” and that the recruits it was backing “represent the values of the party.”

Adam Green of the P.C.C.C. was adamant on the prospect of anti-abortion recruits: “We wouldn’t welcome candidates who are pushing anti-choice policies into the big tent any more than we would welcome racists and people who want to deregulate Wall Street.” Green wasn’t buying the implication by Bustos and other moderates that the Democratic Party will regain a majority only if it backs away from progressive ideals. He urged me to talk to Rick Nolan, a progressive rural Minnesota congressman who, he said, “wins the right way.”

Nolan is a folksy 73-year-old journeyman politician and businessman who has long advocated a single-payer health system. He also hunts, fishes, makes his own maple syrup and in other ways stays attuned to the culture of Minnesota’s Eighth District. Taking Green’s advice, I asked Nolan whether he would welcome an anti-abortion candidate into the Democratic caucus. “Wholeheartedly,” he said. “If there’s a fault today among Democrats, it’s that they’ve got the worst litmus test known to humankind. If we want to achieve the goals progressives want, we’ve got to get back into the majority. Democrats are damned fools if they don’t see that.”

There was one thing on which the Democrats I interviewed, across the spectrum — Adam Green, David Krone, Krystal Ball, Meredith Kelly — agreed: that I should watch a YouTube ad that was posted in June on behalf of a 52-year-old Wisconsin ironworker named Randy Bryce. Bryce, whose prodigious mustache has earned him the nickname Ironstache, is aiming to unseat the current officeholder of Wisconsin’s First District, Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House. The emotionally charged ad announcing his campaign culminates in a challenge: “Let’s trade places. Paul Ryan, you can come work the iron, and I’ll go to D.C.”

One rainy late summer afternoon, I met up with the ad’s creator, a 42-year-old Army veteran named Bill Hyers, in a Washington hotel bar overcrowded with well-dressed young professionals. Hyers was sipping an old-fashioned when I arrived. He was dressed in a T-shirt and khaki shorts, his preferred business attire. Hyers has successfully managed the campaigns of well-established Democratic politicians like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, and his own politics are straightforwardly liberal. At the same time, he harbors a Holden Caulfield-esque disdain of insincerity and believes that this quality, more than whining or ideological perfectionism, explains his party’s state of decline.

“What’s terrible about Democrats like Rahm Emanuel,” Hyers said, “is that it matters more to them if you’re a candidate who can raise money from very wealthy people than if you have an argument to make. They look at everything through the old Clinton triangulation strategy. Put out very carefully prepared statements. Don’t let anyone get to your right. Deny and ignore. Never have an honest dialogue. It was a bad strategy back in the ’90s. But it’s even worse today, because we can now have 24-7 access to candidates, and people can see when they’re not being authentic. Everything Hillary Clinton did was carefully scripted — they could see that.”

Hyers’s client Bryce has been the undisputed breakout star of the 2018 cycle so far; the announcement ad has attracted millions of views. (Such enthusiasm, it should be said, does not yet make Bryce any less of a long shot: The D.C.C.C. does not currently include Wisconsin’s First District among its 80 targeted seats.) The afternoon we met, Hyers showed me a rough cut of an ad for his newest client, a former Army champion boxer and ex-opioid addict from Staten Island named Boyd Melson — known in the ring as the Rainmaker — who is running for New York’s 11th District. Melson’s YouTube rollout, like Bryce’s, is replete with stirring proletarian imagery: neighborhoods festooned with American flags, an aloof Republican incumbent dodging town halls, Melson alone in the ring pummeling the air with slow-motion jabs. It suggests a trailer for “Rocky Goes to Washington.”

“I can only take a little credit for them,” Hyers admitted after the two-and-a-half-minute ad came to an end. Bryce’s and Melson’s ads, he told me, had a co-producer: Matt McLaughlin, a veteran of TV advertising who “didn’t know campaigns and politics, but he knows art.” Hyers did not think the party’s need for “authentic candidates” and a little theatrical verve were incompatible. If anything, the role the confluence of those two perceived assets played in Trump’s victory is one of the few inarguable lessons of the 2016 election.

This lesson, however unacknowledged, is playing out across the 2018 electoral landscape. In Kentucky, a former Marine fighter pilot named Amy McGrath appears in a bomber jacket, declaring that her “new mission” is to “take on a Congress full of career politicians.” Assessing her candidacy’s apparent long odds, she says, with a cockeyed grin, “We’ll see about that.” Another web ad shows a dashing scientist in a white lab coat: Hans Keirstead, a pioneering stem-cell researcher now running to represent California’s 48th District and billing himself as the very definition of a “problem solver.”

In mid-August, I spoke to Ian Russell’s latest client, a telegenic Marine veteran and two-term state representative from Lewiston, Me., named Jared Golden. Lewiston today is a hollowed-out exoskeleton of a textile mill town. “Our way of life is under attack here,” Golden said. “We’re a classic case of the America that’s being left behind. The social-identity issues that have been emphasized in Portland don’t resonate in rural Maine. It’s damaged the Democratic brand here, to be honest. We’re a community of hard-working people who may not be highly educated, but that doesn’t mean we’re not intelligent. The majority of the folks here voted for Donald Trump, and I can tell you that the description of them as a basket of deplorables is just dead wrong.”

Golden told me that his neighbors had until recently thought of themselves as Democrats. Golden himself still is. When we spoke, he had just decided to run in Maine’s Second District against the Republican incumbent, Bruce Poliquin. Golden would be the fifth Democrat to enter the race. He seemed to have little use for the national party’s “A Better Deal” pitch, telling me, “It’s going to take more than a glossy new policy document to take back the U.S. House.”

What, then, would it take? A few days after I spoke with Golden, Ian Russell traveled to Lewiston and shot his candidate’s announcement ad. It mixes twilit images of small-town Maine with footage of the candidate in combat fatigues; later, he jogs down a country road wearing a T-shirt that says, “Pain Is Weakness Leaving the Body.” The ad excoriates the Republican incumbent but also bipartisan trade deals and unnamed political leaders who push “issues that don’t impact your life.”

I’m going to be forming a team,” Mr. Trump said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on March 8, 2016.
At a March 31 meeting in a foreman’s lounge at the Trump Hotel in Washington, which was under construction, with Mr. Trump and the rest of the foreign policy team, Mr. Papadopoulos pitched the idea of a personal meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin.
But Mr. Trump listened with interest and asked questions of Mr. Papadopoulos.
In August 2016, Mr. Clovis wrote Mr. Papadopoulos encouraging him and another adviser to make the trip, “if it is feasible.” It never took place.","They have described Carter Page, an energy executive who F.B.I. agents suspected had once been marked for recruitment by Russian spies, as a gadfly who had been “put on notice” by the campaign and whom Mr. Trump “does not know.” Mr. Page’s trip to Moscow in July 2016 was one of the triggers leading the F.B.I. to open a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, and he has appeared before a grand jury in the investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel.

It is harder for the White House to distance itself from Michael T. Flynn, a retired military intelligence officer who was forced out in February after less than a month as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser. The White House has said Mr. Flynn resigned after it became clear he had not been forthright about conversations he had in late December with Sergey I. Kislyak, who was then the Russian ambassador.

The fact that so many of Mr. Trump’s foreign policy aides from that period have now acknowledged contacts with Russian officials or their intermediaries hints at Moscow’s eagerness to establish links to his campaign.

Mr. Flynn’s pro-Russian tilt was well established before he joined the Trump campaign. He had pushed for greater cooperation with Russia on counterterrorism issues while director of the Defense Intelligence Agency from 2012 to 2014. He became even more vocal after he was forced to retire by President Barack Obama, arguing that Russia was a necessary ally in a “world war” against Islamist militancy. Mr. Flynn even traveled to Russia in December 2015 for a paid speaking engagement with RT, the Kremlin-financed news network that American intelligence says is a propaganda operation. The trip also included an invitation to RT’s anniversary dinner, where he was photographed sitting at the elbow of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

It has since become clear that the White House knew before the inauguration that Mr. Flynn was already under federal investigation for secretly working as a paid agent of Turkey during the campaign. That investigation has widened to examine possible money laundering and failure to disclose payments from Russian companies, including RT.

Although as a candidate Mr. Trump touted the “many great national security people” at his side, he was reduced in large part to unknowns or carry-overs from other failed campaigns, even as late as March 2016, when he was the clear front-runner. More than 50 conservative foreign policy experts signed an open letter condemning his national security views.

And his own statements were confusing: “Yes, there is a team. There’s not a team. I’m going to be forming a team,” Mr. Trump said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on March 8, 2016.

Finally, in late March, Mr. Trump presented his team, led by Jeff Sessions, the Alabama senator and future attorney general. Among the other five he named were Mr. Page and Mr. Papadopoulos, whom he described as “an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy.”

Mr. Papadopoulos, then 28, had some minor campaign experience. After he promised to raise substantial sums from the Greek-American community, Ben Carson’s campaign hired him for $5,000 a month to serve on its national security and foreign policy advisory committee.

After Mr. Carson’s campaign collapsed, Mr. Papadopoulos moved into Mr. Trump’s orbit. According to interviews and the court papers released Monday, he discussed the campaign’s priorities with Sam Clovis, then a top policy adviser and campaign supervisor, and “understood that a principal foreign policy focus of the campaign was an improved U.S. relationship with Russia.”

In a statement from his lawyer, Victoria Toensing, Mr. Clovis denied that. “That was not Dr. Clovis’s view,” it said.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters during a news briefing on Tuesday that the Trump campaign had voluntarily given Mr. Papadopoulos’s emails to investigators.

“That is what led to the process and the place that we’re in,” Ms. Sanders said, adding that the campaign had been “fully cooperating and helping with that.”

In late March last year, Mr. Papadopoulos emailed Mr. Clovis and others that he had discussed with his contacts — a London-based professor with Moscow ties and a Russian woman whom he described as a relative of Mr. Putin’s — the possibility of a meeting between the Trump campaign and Russia’s leadership.

“Great work,” Mr. Clovis responded, according to the court documents and interviews.

At a March 31 meeting in a foreman’s lounge at the Trump Hotel in Washington, which was under construction, with Mr. Trump and the rest of the foreign policy team, Mr. Papadopoulos pitched the idea of a personal meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. Mr. Clovis and others immediately expressed doubts about the wisdom of the idea, noting that Russia was under United States sanctions and denouncing the “optics” of a meeting with Mr. Putin, according to a former campaign aide who attended the meeting.

But Mr. Trump listened with interest and asked questions of Mr. Papadopoulos. Mr. Trump “didn’t say yes, and he didn’t say no,” said the former aide, who agreed to describe the meeting on the condition of anonymity.

Finally, Mr. Sessions, as the campaign’s top national security official, spoke vehemently against the idea, asking others not to discuss it again. Mr. Trump did not challenge him, the former aide said.

Nonetheless, Mr. Papadopoulos continued to pursue the notion of some sort of meeting for several months, updating Trump campaign officials on his efforts, the court records showed.

He emailed one high-ranking campaign official saying that the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had asked if the campaign would send a representative to Russia, and he offered to go. In August 2016, Mr. Clovis wrote Mr. Papadopoulos encouraging him and another adviser to make the trip, “if it is feasible.” It never took place.

Ms. Toensing, Mr. Clovis’s lawyer, said that Mr. Clovis agreed that Mr. Papadopoulos should travel as a private individual, not as a campaign aide.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Photo

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

THURSDAY PUZZLE — The romantic in Ned White emerges today with a 76-word puzzle that plays around with a popular phrase.

Today’s Theme

I managed to solve the revealer, HEAD OVER HEELS, before I figured out the theme, which may or may not have helped me.

The theme itself places phrases used to designate people as the “head” of something (NUMERO UNO at 13A, for example) on top of phrases used to call someone a “heel” (SCOUNDREL at 17A), thus giving us HEAD OVER HEELS. I liked this idea, and Mr. White does it well, except I had trouble locating the central pair because they were staggered at 56A (BIG WHEEL) and 42A (DIRTY RAT).

Tricky Clues

8A: Yes, a five-letter entry for “One of the Obamas” could be either SASHA or MALIA. But check those crossings. They’re not all easy, but perhaps you knew that a SPORE was “One of billions in a puffball” at 8D.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Everyone have a glass of milk ready? Thanks to Herre Schouwerwou, we have a tasty snack in our puzzle today. We’re just going to have to find it.

Today’s Theme

This isn’t going to be as simple as taking your snack out of a cardboard box. It’s midweek, so you’re going to have to do a little detective work.

As it happens, our snack today is on both sides of a black square, as the revealer clues at 54- and 56A say. We are told that the lunchbox items we are looking for are ANIMAL CRACKERS, and the four that we are given are “cracked” by that black square.

Still don’t see them? Here’s one: 17A is MCGREGOR and 18A is I’LL ASK, and the two entries are separated by a single black square. If you look closely and even scratch and sniff the entries, which have been scented to smell like the aforementioned ANIMAL CRACKERS so you can easily track them down [Don’t listen to her. And for the love of all that is holy, do not scratch your screens. Or your newspapers. — Ed.], the last letters of MCGREGOR and the first letters of I’LL ASK spell out the cracked GORILLA:

Now you find the other CRACKERS, and don’t forget to drink your milk.

Constructor Notes

DISCLAIMER: No animals were harmed in the making of this puzzle. I don’t recall the exact inspiration for this puzzle, but I was probably hungry and noticed an animal split between two entries in another crossword. To limit the theme choices, I decided to use only animals in the current Barnum’s box (according to Wikipedia) that were five letters or longer. The other decision was where to place the revealer. I’m not a fan of center placement and that would mean changing the grid to 14 or 16 squares wide or just having ANIMAL CRACKER, which wasn’t great. You can’t eat just one! So I went with the “cracked” revealer that fortunately echoed the theme. Will liked the concept, but asked to remove some iffy fill and to replace HIPPO, which was the only shortened entry. Of two revised submissions, the one that had the longest split entries was chosen over the one that had VEGANS crossing ANIMAL. Kudos to Will and Joel for the double “parked” clues for 49- and 50-Across. Hope this satisfies your crossword snacking pleasure!

In Bonn, works in “Nazi Art Theft and its Consequences” will go on display on Friday. Most of the art in the Bonn show is suspected of having been wrongfully taken by the Nazis from its Jewish owners and the ownership history of many pieces on display is not yet clear.

Last week, researchers working with Project Gurlitt, the team of art historians and provenance researchers tasked by the German government with establishing the original ownership of works in the collection, identified a Thomas Couture painting as having belonged to Georges Mendel, a Jewish French politician.

The work, “Portrait of a Seated Young Woman,” was the sixth to have been identified, thanks in part to the restoration team in Bonn, which was readying it for the exhibition. They noticed a barely detectable repaired hole in the canvas, at the level of the young woman’s chest, a detail which had been recorded in an initial claim filed after the end of the war.

“The fact that the researchers have been able, through their meticulous and unstinting work, to identify the painting by Thomas Couture as Nazi-looted art demonstrates once again how important it is not to let up in our efforts in the field of provenance research,” Monica Grütters, Germany’s culture minister said in a statement.

News of the collection’s existence, first reported by Focus magazine in November 2013, spurred Germany to intensify efforts to establish provenance, following intense criticism for having kept the works secret for months after their initial discovery by tax authorities in February 2012. But three years after research efforts began, researchers had established the original ownership of only five works.

The collection was hailed by art historians when it was found as the “most important discovery of Nazi-looted art since the Allies discovered the hoards in the salt mines and the castles,” and initial speculation placed its total value at more than $1 billion. As the reality of the scope and contents of the collection have become clear, the monetary value has been scaled back to hundreds of millions.

Rein Wolfs, director of the Kunstmuseum Bern, and Nina Zimmer, director of the Bundesdunsthalle, wrote in the catalog that accompanies the exhibition that they do not see the value of the collection in monetary terms.

Mueller III bears down in his investigation of the alleged Russian efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election.

As Mr. Mueller and his team home in on people connected to President Trump, including his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, the president and his allies in the conservative media sphere are pointing at the Democrats and Hillary Clinton.

Adding to the problem is the recent behavior of the tech companies, which have not shown the same desire for accountability exhibited by Mr. Ailes and his fellow network chiefs all those years ago. On Tuesday, when Congress called Facebook, Twitter and Google to testify, the platforms sent their lawyers, not their top bosses.

Yes, the lawyers provided some details about how Russian operatives had reached scores of millions of Americans with divisive and misleading messages. But that was only after Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, insisted in November that it was a “pretty crazy idea” that Russian operatives had used Facebook to influence the election. (Facebook’s latest tally of Americans who were exposed to Russia’s divisive content: 126 million.)

The opacity of the tech companies was matched by the efforts of some conservative media outlets to confuse and distract.

In the days leading up to the indictment of Mr. Manafort and his lobbying partner Rick Gates, they saw fit to question Mr. Mueller’s legitimacy. They did so while arguing that the real focus should be on Mrs. Clinton, the Democrats and a political research firm that commissioned the gathering of information on Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia, Fusion GPS.

The counternarrative was particularly pronounced in the outlets controlled by Mr. Murdoch — who has close ties to the president’s family — and his news and entertainment companies, 21st Century Fox and News Corp.

On Saturday, the Fox News host Jeanine Pirro called for the jailing of Mrs. Clinton, saying, “It’s time to shut it down, turn the tables and lock her up.”

She alleged that “the Obamas and the Clintons” had “built the Trump-Russia connection,” pointing to a report in The Washington Post that the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee had helped finance research by Fusion GPS, which produced a dossier describing ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. She did not mention a report in The New York Times that a conservative media organization, The Free Beacon, hired Fusion GPS to research Mr. Trump and other Republicans.

The most salacious findings in the dossier, based on information collected from sources inside and outside the Kremlin by a Fusion GPS contractor, the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, remain uncorroborated.

Also on Saturday, The New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin called for Mr. Mueller’s resignation, citing Fusion GPS as well as Mr. Mueller’s previous job as an F.B.I. director under President Barack Obama, given that, in Mr. Goodwin’s view, so much of the investigative focus must now fall on Mr. Obama’s administration.

Foreshadowing Mr. Goodwin’s dubious argument was an editorial in the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal, which declared that Mr. Mueller “lacks the critical distance” to look into the allegation that “Democrats paid for Russians to compile wild allegations about a U.S. presidential candidate.” The editorial also questioned whether the dossier had triggered the F.B.I. inquiry into Mr. Trump’s campaign.

But the investigation began in July last year, James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director at the time, told Congress in March, not long after Fusion GPS’s financing passed from Republican to Democratic sources.

And while skepticism is a virtue in all journalistic endeavors, there is no evidence to support the assertion that the Democrats hired Fusion GPS with the purpose of getting Russians to spread “wild allegations” about Mr. Trump.

As John Sipher, a former Central Intelligence Agency chief of station, pointed out, intelligence tends to come from sources within foreign governments.

“Reaching out to Russians and Americans to try to collect information on what might have happened and then pass that information to sources in good faith, that’s different from trying to conspire with Russia to get stolen emails from the United States,” Mr. Sipher told me.

The collective coverage from The Journal editorial page, The New York Post and Fox News — not including the straight-ahead coverage by the likes of Shepard Smith and Bret Baier — was testament to the Murdoch empire’s ability to make its own journalistic weather.

Between the promotion of alternative narratives and the way the social media platforms have been so slow in describing their inadvertent hosting of the Russian effort, there’s a striking lack of national unity over what appears to have been a foreign incursion in an American election. So you have to wonder how the country will ever come together to do something about it.

“There’s this epic lack of consensus, or active dis-census,” said Shawn Powers, the executive director of the United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, who has spent years studying what he calls the “geopolitics of information.”

Mr. Powers was confident that, as the facts come out, the country will find a way to fend off similar attacks. For instance, he said, Facebook, Twitter and Google are adding new policies to combat false information, fake accounts and nefarious foreign political advertising.

But I can’t help thinking back to 2001.

On Tuesday, I called Tom Johnson, the former CNN chairman, who was one of the executives who appeared on Capitol Hill to testify in 2001. He said some colleagues had some qualms appearing before Congress, given the First Amendment implications. But he told me that he had felt it was the right thing to do.

“I still think we have the very highest public responsibility to make sure we get it right and, when we don’t get it right, that we try to determine what went wrong and what we can do about it,” he said. “It really gets down to operating in the public interest.”

His twin brother seemed to be invited to a party a week. Why were the families of kids with special needs different? Was the idea of reaching out too painful because it meant the risk of rejection?

When I finally invited another child for a play date, his mother wept with astonishment and appreciation. Our kids were doing something everyone else’s kids did.

This inspired me to have a little end-of-year celebration for my son’s small preschool class in our backyard. Everyone came and some brought wrapped gifts even though it wasn’t a birthday party. It was clear that this was the first party most of the children had been invited to. I had a few more parties, but as kids grow older, parents naturally step back, leaving the kids to bond with the friends of their choosing — the typical way.

In elementary school, my son with disabilities lagged behind his twin in friendships and maturity. He could not see faces clearly and missed social cues. It wasn’t until middle school, a time I feared the most for him, that he truly connected with a friend. This boy lived right in our neighborhood but had attended a different elementary school, so they didn’t know each other. Then they started riding the middle school bus together and bonded because the other boy also had some visual struggles. They found that they both loved cats and video games, so they started to hang out.

My son used his white cane to walk to this friend’s house, which turned out to be just around the block. I would stand at my dining room window and watch him disappear around the corner with his cane swaying back and forth in front of him just as he had been trained to do. I felt anxious about letting him go, worrying that he might get lost, but I was proud of his courageous independence.

His friend’s family even took him with them for an overnight trip to Cape Cod. My son, who is medically fragile, had an incident at the beach that required medical assistance, which his friend’s mom handled like a pro.

My son is now a sophomore in high school and has made several friends through school and our church youth group. Despite his limited vision, he has found a passion in film, photography and editing videos. He even films the high school football games for his TV production class and has wonderful teachers and fellow classmates who support him.

His confidence is growing daily. When he visited one friend’s house, the dad texted my husband ahead of time to make sure they had some of our son’s favorite snacks, which was so sweet.

Last Halloween, he went trick-or-treating with a friend whose dad gleefully accompanied them, dressed in full costume himself. He went along to help keep our son safe in the dark, because of his limited vision and his own son’s special needs. This dad innately understood the importance of their friendship.

Several years ago, he had seen “Early Shaker Spirituals.” While working in a Chinese tea shop as a waiter, he met that show’s director, the Wooster stalwart Kate Valk, and told her he had an idea for her.

And so Ms. Valk wound up staging “The B-Side.” It is a task to which she — and a design team overseen by Elizabeth LeCompte, the Wooster Group’s artistic director, with lighting by Ryan Seelig and sound by Eric Sluyter — have brought a rigorous elegance and clarity.

I mean, really, really old — as in centuries old. Not that any of these performers are geriatric. But they become conduits for the songs of prisoners who were themselves conduits for an oral tradition that stretches back to at least the early days of slavery in this country. This is music that feels viral not in the technological sense of current usage, but in the sense of residing in the bloodstream.

Mr. Berryman occasionally annotates the separate numbers (there are 14 in total) with readings of passages from Mr. Jackson’s book of oral history, “Wake Up Dead Man: Hard Labor and Southern Blues.” As in Mr. Berryman’s introduction to the show, none of these descriptions is politically or emotionally shaded. They’re neutral, so as not to block our view of the main event here.

That’s the music, of course, and the recorded spoken-word toasts. Performed a cappella, the songs spin tales of mythologically mean prison guards, and loves and lives lost, and the backbreaking purgatory of unendingly repetitive physical tasks.

The actors do not try to re-create the wood-hacking and hoeing that was the daily lot of the men they are channeling. Mostly, they are uncommonly still, conflating the acts of singing and listening. Gestures and movements are severely rationed, so that each one reads incisively.

Apple is selling the iPhone X with two options for storage capacity: 64 gigabytes for $999 and 256 gigabytes for $1,149.

There are various ways to pay that hefty price.

The simplest route is to pay for the device outright. This is the least confusing option because your wireless bill will contain charges only for your phone plan, and you can do whatever you want with the device — like sell it or switch to a different wireless carrier — whenever you want.

You can also opt to spread out the payments with a monthly installment plan. For example, if you are a Verizon customer, you can choose to pay off the $999 iPhone over 24 months for $41.62 a month. This is a nice option because spreading out the payments does not incur interest fees.

Another option is to go for an early upgrade plan, which lets you pay a flat monthly rate and upgrade to a new iPhone annually. It’s essentially leasing a new phone every year.

There are various early upgrade plans on the market. With Apple’s early upgrade program, you can pay $49.91 a month, and once you’ve made 12 payments, you can trade in your iPhone to upgrade to the next one and continue paying that monthly rate. (I’m not a fan of this path because I suggest cherishing your devices for as long as you can before upgrading.)

Similarities to the Cheaper iPhone 8

Before you splurge, consider your options. Apple’s iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which share many features of the iPhone X, have starting prices of $699 and $799. The cheaper iPhones have the same computing processor as the iPhone X, so they are just as fast, and their 12-megapixel rear cameras are on a par with the rear camera on the iPhone X.

So what’s the difference? Mainly, the screen.

■The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen that takes up the entire face of the device, with the exception of a notch at the top containing an infrared camera system.

■The iPhone 8 has a 4.7-inch screen, and the iPhone 8 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen.

Both of the cheaper iPhones have bezels — the border surrounding the display — whereas the iPhone X has eliminated the bezel.

Other than screen size, the screen technologies differ. The iPhone X is the only Apple phone that uses OLED, a type of display that can be made thinner, lighter and brighter, and with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD. So the screen on the iPhone X looks more vibrant than the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8, which still use LCD.

Last but not least, the iPhone X has a unique infrared face scanner. The technology, called Face ID, uses the infrared camera system on the front of the phone to scan the contours and shape of a person’s head to unlock the device and authorize mobile payments. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus have normal front-facing cameras for snapping selfies.

How Face Recognition Replaces the Fingerprint Sensor

The primary way you can unlock an iPhone X is with the face scanner. The premium phone lacks Touch ID, the fingerprint sensor that has been a popular feature on iPhones for several years.

Face ID is brand new — there hasn’t been anything like it on a smartphone before. It works by spraying an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots. The imaging system can stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it. Because the shape of a person’s head is unique, the likelihood of bypassing facial recognition with someone else’s face is one in a million, according to Apple.

Older facial recognition systems worked by using the camera to take a photo of yourself and comparing that with an image that was stored on the device. All a thief would need to do to fool the system was hold a photo of your face in front of the camera — which some people already did with Samsung’s facial-recognition feature. The false acceptance rate of older face recognition systems was one in 100.

It will be interesting to see how early adopters react to Face ID, and whether it will work well with many different kinds of faces. If you’re skeptical or turned off by the idea of your phone constantly scanning your face to unlock your phone, you could always get an iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus, which still have Touch ID.",The iPhone X Arrives Friday.

As Christmas approached that year, the family didn’t have the heart to celebrate.

The Genzolis went out to the orchard soon to discover that somebody had decorated the tree with homemade Christmas ornaments.

“We don’t know who it was,” said Ms. Genzoli, “but it kind of started from there.”

One February, Danielle’s first grade teacher had her students create laminated hearts that they hung from the tree for Valentine’s Day. It was festooned for St. Patrick’s Day and Easter.

At some point, Danielle’s grandfather and great-uncle began running electricity out to the tree so they could add lights. People sometimes left notes with remembrances of Danielle.

Right now the tree is decorated for Halloween.

David Genzoli said he was driving a tractor in the orchard last Saturday, when he saw an older woman hanging a small cellophane pumpkin on the tree. He wandered over.

The woman told him she had been touched by the story in the Bee and that in February she had lost her son, a father of two girls aged 3 and 5.

Inside the pumpkin were notes written by the girls to their father.

It’s gas tax hike day.

After much wrangling and debate, the price of a gallon of gas is rising 12 cents.

For a typical car, that could mean roughly $2 extra per fill-up. But don’t expect to notice the difference right away.

As it happens, the tax increase is happening on Nov. 1, the same day that California gas stations switch each year to a cheaper winter blend of gas.

The cost of a gallon of gas typically drops as much as 10 cents with the changeover, said Jeffrey Spring, a spokesman for the Automobile Club of Southern California, which opposed the gas tax.

From the consumer’s point of view then, the tax hike may appear to be canceled out.

“I don’t know if they timed it this way,” Mr. Spring said. “But it’s smart.”

The tax increase is part of legislation intended to raise more than $5 billion a year over the next decade to help fix the state’s roads and bridges.

Gov. Jerry Brown signed it in April.

But the wrangling may not be over. Republican leaders are fighting hard to dismantle the law.

Lady Bird will put on the dress and wear it out and think nothing of it.","Gerwig has acted in 25 films and co-written five, but “Lady Bird,” her first solo directorial project, is the most unadulterated distillation of her sensibility to date. The title character is a high-school senior, played with winning naturalness by Saoirse Ronan, who lives in Sacramento and attends an all-girls Catholic school. She was born Christine, but demands to be called by the name she has given herself — as if she were a pop star, or being constantly confirmed in the faith. The film’s working title was “Mothers and Daughters,” and Gerwig is especially attentive to Lady Bird’s tempestuous relationship with her mother, Marion, played with brilliant, wounded toughness by Laurie Metcalf. Their fights hit every note and tempo: nagging, bickering, quarrelsome, sniping, passive-aggression, shouting, screaming, wailing, whispered rage.

Lady Bird is a delicious and daring weirdo. She shows up to audition for the school musical with a prepared belter. She runs a long-shot campaign for class president every fall, just because she can. Her hair is stringy and dyed. She is sexy without being conventionally pretty, and when she decides she likes a boy, she writes his name in marker on her bedroom wall and pursues him boldly. Saying that she “puts herself out there” is an understatement. She throws herself over every cliff. (At one point, she throws herself out of a moving car.) She’s the girl — I’m stealing this from Ronan, who told me that she “admires” the character — whom you didn’t even know you wanted to be. That all this buoyant confidence feels so effervescently radical is a testament to the humor and intelligence of Gerwig’s script. That it is so rare is an indictment of our woman-hating culture, which makes a depiction of a smart teenage girl who likes herself and chases her desires seem like news.

Gerwig couldn’t have played Lady Bird; she’s 34. But it’s notable that she didn’t choose to write a character she could have played. Perhaps she didn’t want to confuse the issue. A female body onscreen has a way of obscuring, or distracting from, the intelligence offscreen. She is already well established as an actor — the critic Richard Brody has called her “the most important new actor” to emerge in the last 10 years of American independent film. What shines through in Gerwig’s performances is a quality of radiant openness. Jay Duplass, the filmmaker and actor who directed Gerwig in the 2008 movie “Baghead,” described her to me as a “spazzy genius” who has “the courage to let herself unfold in front of other people.” Think of her toddling down the steps behind the Times Square TKTS booth in “Mistress America,” issuing a cornball greeting to her soon-to-be-stepsister standing below: “Welcome to the Great White Way!” And the frozen smile on her face, as she continues her grand descent, trying awkwardly, antically, to hold on to the magic of making an entrance.

Her smile is of the huge, gum-baring variety. She talks with her whole body. She was a live wire in Mary Bronstein’s “Yeast” and enchanting in Whit Stillman’s “Damsels in Distress” and a little out of place in Pablo Larraín’s “Jackie,” where all she did was stand around. She needs to be moving — galloping down the street or shoving somebody through a door or doing a shuffle-ball-change. The writer, artist and filmmaker Miranda July, when I asked her about Gerwig’s physicality, told me, “She looks very strong, and she can either spin that into something that’s grounded and familiar and funny or into something that’s really quite beautiful and dancerly.” She can sing and tap too. I’ve heard her compared to Diane Keaton, which I’m sure she’d like — for a while as a teenager she tried to dress like Annie Hall — but I think of her as a taller Irene Dunne. Except that instead of being in movies about love affairs, she is in movies — and making movies — about women self-actualizing and paying their bills.

The check arrived, and I reached for my wallet. Gerwig became concerned. “You can put this on The New York Times?” she said. “I just always worry.” After breakfast, while we were power-walking through the West Village, I mentioned that I had seen that she was doing a voice part in Wes Anderson’s forthcoming animated movie, “Isle of Dogs.” She remarked that Anderson’s previous animated film, “Fantastic Mr. Fox,” isn’t “really” about animals. “It’s not?” I said, which prompted the beginnings of an earnest analysis, until I cut her off to explain that I had been kidding. “Ohhhhh,” she said. “I don’t understand sarcasm. I take it seriously!” Her T’s are shiny and bright, like the ringing of a hand bell.

When Gerwig went out to raise the money for “Lady Bird,” she noticed something interesting. Most of the potential funders she met with were men, of course — that’s not the interesting thing. It’s men, for the most part, who have the power and money to finance films. “What I typically found,” she said, “was that if they had daughters or had been raised with sisters, they understood what it was, and if they didn’t, they kind of couldn’t believe that women actually fought like that, which was an interesting window into why some stories can’t get told. People don’t understand that they’re even a story to tell.”

Gerwig has long been interested in how women fight. “Frances Ha” (2013), the film she made with her partner, Noah Baumbach, begins with two best friends sparring gleefully in Washington Square Park. Over the course of the film, they fall out in the usual way — very slowly and then all at once — but by the end are back in each other’s lives, casually, at arm’s length. In “Mistress America” (2015), which Gerwig and Baumbach also made together, a major act of betrayal leads to the severing of a bond between two women. In “Lady Bird” the fights between mother and daughter are constant — at once background noise and main event. Every situation is pretext for a confrontation: underdone eggs, a pile of rumpled clothes, a hand reaching too quickly for the radio. The question on the surface might be What did you do? but the feeling underneath is Who are you and why don’t you know how to love me?

The visual style of “Lady Bird” is intentionally unshowy — most shots are framed and still, so that attention is focused on the actors and the dialogue. Language is what matters. There was no improvisation on the set, and the movie matches the shooting script “probably 95 percent.” The writer and director Lena Dunham told me that what she often admires about Gerwig’s dialogue is the contrast between erudition and naturalism — “In one breath she’ll be referencing a superobscure book and also utilizing the awkward parlance of our times.” “Lady Bird” does that, too. Gerwig expects her audience to be well read enough to get what’s funny about a nun referencing Kierkegaard’s “love story” (Kierkegaard broke off his engagement) but also to laugh when Lady Bird tells her friend that they’re done with “the learning portion of high school.” The rhythm is very quick, and much of the humor lies in the way that characters respond to or undercut one another. My favorite joke of the movie is when Lady Bird, after passing her driver’s test, profusely thanks the guy from the D.M.V. “It’s not a thanking situation,” he says. “You either pass or you don’t.”

The plot is structured according to the “rituals” of senior year — homecoming, prom — which Gerwig has said she imagined “unfolding in a series of placed scenes like Stations of the Cross.” Emotional drama presents itself in the form of Lady Bird’s two boyfriends, Danny and Kyle, and a rough patch with her best friend, Julie, but the big narrative question is where Lady Bird will go to college. She longs to go to a private East Coast (i.e., outrageously expensive) college; her family expects her to stay in state. As it is, they’re barely keeping it together, moneywise. Marion works double shifts as a psychiatric nurse, and Lady Bird’s father, played by Tracy Letts, has lost his job. They live in a shabby, cramped house that is literally on the wrong side of the railroad tracks. (Marion and Lady Bird’s favorite Sunday-afternoon activity is dropping in at real estate open houses and admiring what they cannot have.) But “those East Coast schools” carry complex symbolic weight for Lady Bird: They mean possibility, and glamour, and leaving home, and something like self-worth. The movie doesn’t totally endorse her fantasy, but it is a little unsettling, in this moment, to witness a narrative triumph that hinges on a teenager’s assumption of a lifetime of student debt.

Gerwig wrote “Lady Bird” partly as a response to films about boys growing up. At the New York Film Festival, she asked the crowd: “What is ‘Boyhood,’ but for a girl? What is ‘The 400 Blows,’ but for a girl? What is personhood for young women?” In most films, girls exist to be looked at. Sometimes they help a male protagonist come to a realization about himself. Sometimes they die. Gerwig makes Lady Bird the one who looks: at boys but also houses, magazines, books, clothes and at the city of Sacramento. She also takes the wind out of a particular kind of male self-seriousness around cultural objects. Toward the end of the movie, a very drunk Lady Bird is in her dorm room with a boy — the kind of boy who would invite you to see “The 400 Blows” on a first date — who is flipping through her CD case. He scoffs that her taste in music sucks: All she has are greatest-hits albums. “But they’re the greatest,” she says. They immediately start making out.

As in “Boyhood,” “Lady Bird” is remarkable for what doesn’t happen. No one dies. No one overdoses. Conflicts are reconciled. The film is ostensibly about a young girl’s ambition, but the mood is one of poignant loss. “There is a certain vividness in worlds that are coming to an end,” Gerwig wrote in the production notes. “It is something beautiful that you never appreciated and ends just as you come to understand it.” Her characters are always preternaturally nostalgic, able to look back on recent hurts with the bittersweet regard that it takes more rancorous humans a lifetime to achieve. She loves Mike Leigh and Éric Rohmer, but the movie moment that will always stay with her is the end of “Annie Hall”: “When they leave each other, and he says it’s just nice knowing her, and you’re like, ugh! That’s life!”

There are no jerks or bullies in “Lady Bird,” no one who intentionally manipulates or abuses, no one who hates or is hateable, no one who holds a grudge. All the characters are doing their best — it’s just nice to know them. You can’t accuse Gerwig of a lack of seriousness; her conversation is peppered with references to George Eliot, Elena Ferrante, Maggie Nelson, Simone Weil, Milton and Kierkegaard. But the way she distributes sympathy has an undeniably magical effect. The result is delightful and a little bit romantic — delightful, perhaps, because it is romantic, showing life as it should be, or could be.

“I have a deep need to take care of my characters,” she said to me at breakfast. “It’s not that I don’t want to go down the dark avenues — I want to hold their hands down the dark avenues. I want to walk with them while they go there and give them the dignity of representing it honestly, and finding the thing that is grace-filled.”

Early reviews of “Lady Bird” have referred to the film as “autobiographical.” The word irks Gerwig. “I was doing interviews in Toronto,” she said to me, “and people would say, ‘Well, it’s autobiographical,’ and I’d think: Do you know my autobiography? How do you know that this is autobiographical? That’s a leap!”

“Autobiographical” can carry a whiff of dismissal, a suggestion that the achievement was somehow easier to pull off because it involved less creative effort. There are, to be sure, parallels to reality: Gerwig is from Sacramento and went to an all-girls Catholic school before attending a college in New York, Barnard, on scholarships and loans. But she wasn’t like Lady Bird as a high-school student. She followed the rules.

Still, only a person who liked high school could have written this movie. And Gerwig liked high school. There were the usual cliques and hierarchies, but because it was a Catholic school, the focus was on being a good citizen of the community and using your talents for a higher purpose. She refers to the nuns who taught her as “really groovy.” She admits to “some teenage anger” and says that her fights with her mother were “epic,” but “for me, epic fighting never spelled lack of love.” Her eyes widened. “Some of my friends have been, like, ‘You can really scare the [expletive] out of me,’ and I’m like, ‘Oh, no, that’s just me being close!’ ”

“These are my parents,” Gerwig said, holding out her phone.

We were in a greenroom at Lincoln Center, during the New York Film Festival. Previously I had seen Gerwig dressed down in casual settings, carrying a backpack: drinking coffee on a park bench, being shushed at Film Forum for talking during a movie. Now she was in busy professional mode: Proenza Schouler dress, eyeliner, flanked by publicists. On the phone, her parents were squinting in sunshine, from what looked to be a very nice vacation in San Diego.

Gerwig is close to her parents. (They appeared as Frances’s parents in “Frances Ha.”) Her mother is a retired OB/GYN nurse and her father works in small-business loans for a credit union. “I always felt like they were both artists without being artists,” she said. At the holidays, the house overflowed with guests. Her father plays “a ton” of instruments. Her mother has a closet in the hallway where she keeps presents, wrapped, for all different ages — just in case someone comes over and it’s her birthday.

As a child, Gerwig had a tendency to become obsessive — first about ballet, which she had to quit (her hips lacked turnout, and her knees couldn’t take it), and then about fencing, which her mother urged her to put aside, lest she become “a mono-person.” In high school she got into theater, and in college she continued acting and writing plays. One play she wrote featured a seduction scene in which someone breaks a jar of mayonnaise onstage. Another one, which involved a daughter murdering her mother, was written in two weeks’ time, after a group lost the rights to perform “Misery.” She always liked movies, but it wasn’t until she started renting DVDs from the indie video store Kim’s while a student at Barnard that she thought of film as an art made by directors. “Beau Travail” was the movie that helped her truly understand cinema. She didn’t realize until she saw Claire Denis’s name in the credits that it had been directed by a woman. She remembers thinking: That’s a job you can have?

After she was rejected from M.F.A. programs in playwriting, she began acting in very-low-budget, independent “mumblecore” films, including “LOL,” “Hannah Takes the Stairs” and “Nights and Weekends,” which she directed with Joe Swanberg. In 2010 she broke through to the mainstream, when she appeared in Noah Baumbach’s “Greenberg.” After “Greenberg,” she and Baumbach, who had been married to Jennifer Jason Leigh, became a couple, and together they wrote two films that Gerwig starred in: “Frances Ha” and “Mistress America,” which feature some unmistakable Gerwigian traits. Their protagonists are semidelusional female dreamers, surrounded by rich people and anxious about money, with hearts pure enough to put them in a Dostoyevsky novel. But film is a director’s medium, and occasionally Gerwig’s work on these projects was dismissed by journalists and people in the industry. “Something that used to really hurt me is, people would say, ‘Did you help write the script?’ And I’d say: ‘I co-wrote it. I didn’t “help” to write it,’ ” she said. “It used to make my blood rise.”

Gerwig calls her last 10 years of working in film “my version of my 10,000 hours.” When she finished the writing of “Lady Bird” in 2015, she knew she had to direct it herself. “I thought, Yes, there is more to learn, but you are not going to keep learning it by not doing it. You will only now learn the next part if you go ahead and do it.”

Acting in films under two female directors, Rebecca Miller and Mia Hansen-Love, helped “shift” something in her. She recalls a conversation with Hansen-Love, who had been in two films directed by her partner, Olivier Assayas. “She had worked at Cahiers du Cinéma,” Gerwig says. “She said that the other young male writers there treated her dismissively because they thought of her as Olivier’s girlfriend, who got there because she was his girlfriend, and how they changed when she had her first movie at Cannes, when she was in her 20s. All of a sudden they looked at her like they’d never seen her before. I hung onto that story. All those little pieces I put in my pocket. I think I needed these little signs.”

Several years ago, Gerwig was at Miranda July’s house. It was early in their friendship (and before Gerwig’s turn as a punk photographer in “20th Century Women,” which was directed by Mike Mills, July’s husband). On her way out, July offered her a pair of shoes: Rachel Comey loafers that didn’t quite suit July. Not long after, Rebecca Miller, who was directing her in the romantic comedy “Maggie’s Plan,” handed over a pair of “sturdy English shoes that you can see women wearing who were on their way to work in the ’30s.” The meaning wasn’t lost on Gerwig. “I thought, If I wrote this into a movie, people would think it was too obvious of a symbol,” she says. “I was literally given shoes by two female directors. And it felt like, if you’re looking for a sign, there you go!” The shoes acquired talismanic powers. She wore them to the “Lady Bird” set whenever she needed an extra boost.

Movie sets have not historically been comfortable environments for women. Less than a month has passed since the publication of the articles in The New York Times and The New Yorker claiming sexual abuse of women by the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. That Gerwig is a confident young woman making movies about confident young women feels especially meaningful right now. It is not merely Gerwig’s being a woman that feels relevant but her directorial style. She extends the same protective impulse to her cast that she does to her characters, saying that the job of a director is to “hold the perimeter” of “a bubble of magic safety” so that actors can play. I spoke with several actors from “Lady Bird,” as well as with Sam Levy, the cinematographer, and heard again and again how cared-for, and safe, they felt on Gerwig’s set. She ran rehearsals at her apartment and conscripted the cast into awkward dance parties (a trick cribbed from Mills). She encouraged the actors to have secrets from her — things they knew about their characters that she didn’t.

“I trusted her completely,” says Metcalf, who adds that she relied on Gerwig to help her understand the character of Marion. “On the page it could just be like a nonstop aggression. But she taught me what the character was covering up.”

“I wanted Marion to secretly be the main character,” Gerwig told me. “I kind of wanted her to take over the movie.”

The history of mothers on film is one littered with angels and witches. Marion is neither. She’s tender and loving but doesn’t know how to express it; she is often impatient, can be nasty and aggressive and doesn’t support Lady Bird in the way she wants to be supported. (We might call this good mothering, in that she is helping Lady Bird to separate from home.) She doesn’t exactly take over the movie — the film ends on a shot of Lady Bird, alone, on a New York street, with Marion left behind — but she does center it. There is one scene in particular that is a kind of anchor. It shows Marion at her sewing machine, fixing a dress that Lady Bird will wear to a fancy Thanksgiving dinner at her boyfriend’s grandmother’s mansion. Marion would prefer that Lady Bird spend Thanksgiving at home, but she’s helping her anyway, first by shopping with her at the thrift store, and now by mending the dress.

The shot is framed squarely, in dim lighting, with Metcalf looking drab and dour in the center. It is very brief, a few seconds long, and silent, except for the wild thrum of the needle. It’s Gerwig’s homage to “Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles,” Chantal Akerman’s classic 1975 drama of a three-day unraveling, consisting mostly of shots of a woman doing repeated household chores. Gerwig told the audience at the New York Film Festival that she was moved by a remark that Akerman once made about the importance of seeing images of housework on film. “We value watching a woman get raped more than we value her making dinner,” Gerwig said, incredulity and disgust mixing in her voice. If there are Lady Birds in the world, it is only because there are Marions — mothers, and foremothers — who brought them up. Lady Bird will put on the dress and wear it out and think nothing of it.

On Monday morning, after America learned that Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and Manafort’s lobbying partner, Rick Gates, had been indicted and turned themselves in to federal authorities, the president tried to distance himself from the unfolding scandal. “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign,” the president wrote in one tweet . A few minutes later, he added, in another , “Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”

At almost the exact same time, news broke suggesting that the F.B.I. has evidence of collusion. We learned that one of the Trump campaign’s foreign policy aides, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his attempts to solicit compromising information on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. Despite Trump’s hysterical denials and attempts at diversion, the question is no longer whether there was cooperation between Trump’s campaign and Russia, but how extensive it was.

In truth, that’s been clear for a while. If it’s sometimes hard to grasp the Trump campaign’s conspiracy against our democracy, it’s due less to lack of proof than to the impudent improbability of its B-movie plotline. Monday’s indictments offer evidence of things that Washington already knows but pretends to forget. Trump, more gangster than entrepreneur, has long surrounded himself with bottom-feeding scum, and for all his nationalist bluster, his campaign was a vehicle for Russian subversion.

We already knew that Manafort offered private briefings about the campaign to Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The indictment accuses him of having been an unregistered foreign agent for another Putin-aligned oligarch, the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Trump wasn’t paying Manafort, who reportedly sold himself to the candidate by offering to work free. But he intended to profit from his connection with the campaign, emailing an associate, “How do we use to get whole?” If there were no other evidence against Trump, we could conclude that he was grotesquely irresponsible in opening his campaign up to corrupt foreign infiltration.

But of course there is other evidence against Trump. His campaign was told that Russia wanted to help it, and it welcomed such help. On June 3, remember, the music publicist Rob Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr. to broker a Trump Tower meeting at which a Russian source would deliver “very high level and sensitive information” as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr. responded with delight: “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.”

The guilty plea by Papadopoulos indicates what information Trump Jr. might have been expecting. An obscure figure in foreign policy circles, Papadopoulos was one of five people who Trump listed as foreign policy advisers during a Washington Post editorial board meeting last year. A court filing, whose truth Papadopoulos affirms, says that in April 2016, he met with a professor who he “understood to have substantial connections to Russian government officials.” The professor told him that Russians had “dirt” on Clinton, including “thousands of emails.” (The Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta had been hacked in March.)

In the following months, Papadopoulos and his supervisors emailed back and forth about plans for a campaign trip to Russia. According to the court filing, one campaign official emailed another, “We need someone to communicate that D.T. is not doing these trips.” D.T. clearly stood for Donald Trump. The email continued, “It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.”

Thanks to an August Washington Post story , we know that this email was sent by Manafort. Some have interpreted the exchange to mean that Manafort wanted a low-level person to decline the invitation, not to go to Russia. But the court filing also cites a “campaign supervisor” encouraging Papadopoulos and “another foreign policy adviser” to make the trip. Papadopoulos never went to Russia, but the foreign policy adviser Carter Page did.

So here’s where we are. Trump put Manafort, an accused money-launderer and unregistered foreign agent, in charge of his campaign. Under Manafort’s watch, the campaign made at least two attempts to get compromising information about Clinton from Russia. Russia, in turn, provided hacked Democratic emails to WikiLeaks.

Russia also ran a giant disinformation campaign against Clinton on social media and attempted to hack voting systems in at least 21 states. In response to Russia’s election meddling, Barack Obama’s administration imposed sanctions. Upon taking office, Trump reportedly made secret efforts to lift them. He fired the F.B.I. director James Comey to stop his investigation into “this Russia thing,” as he told Lester Holt. The day after the firing, he met with Russia’s foreign minister and its ambassador to America, and told them: “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.”

We’ve had a year of recriminations over the Clinton campaign’s failings, but Trump clawed out his minority victory only with the aid of a foreign intelligence service. On Monday we finally got indictments, but it’s been obvious for a year that this presidency is a crime.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle.
PhotoFew have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said.
A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.
“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

Because thresholds were not included in the president’s plan, brackets are combined based on the House Republican plan released in 2016.

Many important details were left for Congress to hash out, including how to pay for the tax cuts and which deductions to eliminate. Some key elements of the proposal:

(Mostly) Lower Rates for Individuals

The plan would reduce the current marginal individual income tax brackets to three from seven — 12, 25 and 35 percent, and leave open the option for a fourth, higher rate.

The plan does not specify which income levels would be taxed at each rate, but if the highest rate is set at 35 percent, it would greatly benefit the wealthiest taxpayers, who currently pay a top rate of 39.6 percent on income greater than $418,400 for single filers.

Current rates Proposed rates Income taxed 39.6% More than $418,400 $416,700 to $418,400 35% 35% 33% $191,650 to $416,700 28% $91,900 to $191,650 $37,950 to $91,900 25% 25% (The plan does not specify income thresholds.) $9,325 to $37,950 15% 12% 10% $0 to $9,325 Current rates Proposed rates (The plan does not specify income thresholds.) Income taxed 39.6% More than $418,400 35% 35% $416,700 - $418,400 33% $191,650 - $416,700 28% $91,900 - $191,650 25% 25% $37,950 - $91,900 15% $9,325 - $37,950 12% 10% $0 - $9,325 Income thresholds for current rates are for single filers. Because thresholds were not included in the president’s plan, brackets are combined based on the House Republican plan released in 2016.

While the rate applied to the lowest income bracket would increase, the plan says that typical families in the existing 10 percent bracket would be better off because of a larger child tax credit and an increase in the standard deduction. The full effects of the plan on different groups has not yet been analyzed by experts.

The plan would also eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which has critics on the left and the right, and the estate tax on inherited wealth greater than $5.49 million, a longtime Republican target.

(Mostly) Increase the Standard Deduction

The plan would nearly double the amount of the standard deduction and eliminate the personal exemption, a deduction based on the number of taxpayers and the dependents claimed on a return. The new, single deduction would be higher for many filers, except those who claim multiple children (it’s possible that a higher child tax credit could make up for the disparity).

Filing status Current deduction Current deduction & exemptions Deduction under Trump plan Single, no children $6,350 $10,400 $12,000 Married, no children $12,700 $20,800 $24,000 Married, two children $12,700 $28,900 $24,000 Source: Internal Revenue Service

Filers can choose the standard deduction or itemized deductions, but not both. Most filers — 70 percent — currently choose the standard deduction because it is higher than what they qualify for in itemized deductions.

Deductions taken by income group 20 million tax filers Higher income filers tend to itemize deductions 15 10 5 More tax filers choose the standard deduction $1K $5 $10 $15 $20 $25 $30 $40 $50 $75 $100 $200 $500 Adjusted gross income in thousands Deductions taken by income group 20 million tax filers Higher income filers tend to itemize deductions 15 10 5 More tax filers choose the standard deduction $1K 5 10 5 20 25 30 40 50 75 100 200 500 Adjusted gross income in thousands Source: Tax Policy Center | Based on 2014 data.

According to an analysis of an earlier House Republican tax plan by the Tax Policy Center, 84 percent of filers who currently itemize their deductions would take the standard deduction if it were doubled.

To help pay for the increase, the plan would eliminate other deductions, with the exception of the mortgage interest and charitable contribution deductions.

Eliminate the State and Local Tax Deduction

The biggest deduction that would be eliminated is the one for state and local taxes. That deduction primarily helps people in blue states where taxes, and often incomes, are higher.

HI States won in 2016 by: ME VT Trump WA Clinton AL AZ ID NV IA NM CA KS KY CO AK AR MI DE FL MO IL IN MT MN LA NE NH DC MS ND NC MA NY OK OH RI SD OR TN TX PA GA VA CT WV WY SC WI UT NJ MD 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% Share of tax returns claiming the state and local tax deduction HI ME VT WA States won in 2016 by: AL Trump AZ Clinton ID NV IA NM CA KS KY CO AK AR MI DE FL MO IL IN MT MN LA NE NH DC MS ND NC MA NY OK OH RI SD OR TN TX PA GA VA CT WV WY SC WI UT NJ MD 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% Share of tax returns claiming the state and local tax deduction Source: I.R.S. | Based on 2014 data.

But the political divide is not so straight-forward. A recent Tax Policy Center analysis found that of the 20 congressional districts with the highest percentage of returns claiming the deduction, nine have Republican representatives.

Create a New Tax Rate For ‘Pass-Through’ Businesses

The plan would create a new 25 percent tax rate for “pass-through” businesses — sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations that currently pay taxes at the individual rate of their owners. Pass-throughs now make up about 95 percent of businesses in the country and the bulk of corporate tax revenue for the government.

Most pass-throughs are small sole proprietorships currently paying less than a 25 percent marginal rate. But a few are quite large — 1.7 percent of pass-through businesses generate more than 40 percent of all pass-through income and are taxed at the top 39.6 percent rate. The plan would be a windfall for these high-earning pass-throughs.

Share of pass-through businesses at each marginal tax rate Share of pass-through net income at each marginal tax rate 40% 40% 30% 30% 20% 20% 10% 10% 0% 10 15 25 26* 28 28* 33 35 39.6 0% 10 15 25 26* 28 28* 33 35 39.6 Marginal tax rate Marginal tax rate Share of pass-through businesses at each marginal tax rate 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% 10 15 25 26* 28 28* 33 35 39.6 Marginal tax rate Share of pass-through net income at each marginal tax rate 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% 10 15 25 26* 28 28* 33 35 39.6 Marginal tax rate Source: *Alternative Minimum Tax | Tax Policy Center model, 2016

The plan will rely on congressional committees to adopt measures to prevent wealthy individuals from incorporating as pass-through companies to pay a lower tax rate on their income.

Lower the Corporate Rate While Eliminating Some Tax Breaks

The plan would lower the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and eliminate some business deductions and credits. The proposal says that the deduction for domestic production would no longer be necessary because of low rates, and it “envisions repeal of other business credits,” with the exception of those for research and development and low-income housing.

A recent analysis by the Tax Foundation found that eliminating all corporate tax expenditures that do not change the structure of the tax code would pay to lower the rate to 28.5 percent from 35 percent, far short of the 20 percent rate called for in the plan. Because the Trump plan calls for retaining some expenditures, Congress will have to find even more savings to pay for the tax cut.

Mr. Weissmann and his team used Mr. Gravano as an explosive ally in their bid to prosecute high-ranking mobsters.
(In 2015, Ms. Powell criticized Mr. Weissmann in an article for The New York Observer — which was owned by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law — after Mr. Weissmann was named to lead the Justice Department’s criminal fraud section.)
That was transformative.”By 2013, both Mr. Weissmann and Mr. Mueller had left the agency.","“I’m no fan of Donald Trump,” said Dan Cogdell, a Houston defense lawyer who tangled with Mr. Weissmann when Mr. Weissmann helped lead the federal task force investigating Enron in the early 2000s. “Frankly, I can’t think of two people who deserve each other more than Andrew Weissmann and Donald Trump.”

If Mr. Mueller is the stern-eyed public face of the investigation, Mr. Weissmann, 59, is its pounding heart, a bookish, legal pit bull with two Ivy League degrees, a weakness for gin martinis and classical music and a list of past enemies that includes professional killers and white-collar criminals.

Empowered by Mr. Mueller, for whom he previously worked as general counsel at the F.B.I., Mr. Weissmann has taken the lead in the government’s case against Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, whose indictment jolted the capital on Monday in a clear signal of the team’s seriousness.

Mr. Weissmann could be seen at an initial hearing in Washington with an easy smile, chatting up Mr. Manafort’s lawyer during a break in the action.

Friends describe Mr. Weissmann as relentless and boundary-grazing but fundamentally fair, a creative legal strategist whose hyperdiligence should not be confused with recklessness.

He is the prosecutor they would want if their relatives were charged with crimes they did not commit, they say, and the one they would dread if their family members were guilty.

“If there’s something to find, he’ll find it,” said Katya Jestin, a former colleague in the United States attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York, who called Mr. Weissmann’s ethics unimpeachable. “If there’s nothing there, he’s not going to cook something up.”

But many defense lawyers have chafed at what they see as a scorched-earth approach, forged in Brooklyn while facing down Mafia members and refined on the government’s unit of Enron superprosecutors, which left a mixed legacy of high-profile successes, overturned convictions and one unanimous defeat at the Supreme Court.

It was Mr. Weissmann and his team who stunned Houston society by charging the wife of Enron’s chief financial officer with tax fraud, applying pressure on the executive, who became a star witness.

It was Mr. Weissmann, more recently, who oversaw the predawn raid of Mr. Manafort’s Virginia residence in July, when federal agents picked his lock and prosecutors communicated their intention to indict him.

When that moment came this week, representatives for Mr. Manafort and his longtime associate Rick Gates were given little warning: Prosecutors bypassed the common Justice Department practice of inviting lawyers to meet and discuss potential indictments beforehand, often an opportunity for the defense to argue for leniency and for prosecutors to identify potential holes in their case. As of Friday, people close to both men said they had received no indication that an indictment was imminent.

And while Mr. Mueller has remained the chief villain in the eyes of the president’s allies in conservative news media, efforts to discredit Mr. Weissmann have picked up. For months, Mr. Trump’s defenders have sought to draw attention to thousands of dollars in past donations from Mr. Weissmann to Democrats, including former President Barack Obama.

Then came the shock-and-awe raid of Mr. Manafort’s home — a Weissmann special, both admirers and critics recognized — the Zorro “Z” to announce his presence in the case.

“There’s a name,” the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh warned listeners last week, recapping the “intimidating technique” afoot. “Weissmann.”

Prosecuting Mob Bosses

Prosecution can make strange bedfellows. And still this alliance stood out.

On one end of the negotiating table sat Mr. Weissmann, the Princeton-educated son of a psychologist and a research scientist who is credited with codiscovering, and coining the term, liposomes.

On the other was Salvatore Gravano, a hitman-turned-informant better known as Sammy the Bull.

Mr. Weissmann and his team used Mr. Gravano as an explosive ally in their bid to prosecute high-ranking mobsters.

In the case of Mr. Gigante, Mr. Weissmann and his colleagues leaned on Mr. Gravano’s testimony, in large part, to dismantle a long-held insanity defense. Mr. Gigante, nicknamed “The Oddfather,” had been known to wander Greenwich Village in a bathrobe and pajamas, mumbling incoherently, tending to a feigned image of incompetence and cluelessness. “I’ve invested many years in this crazy act,” Mr. Gravano quoted Mr. Gigante as saying during court proceedings.

Mr. Weissmann, who declined to be interviewed for this article, even demonstrated that Mr. Gigante’s bathrobes were chosen with care: In public, his coverings were soiled and tattered. Inside, he slipped into something pristine.

“They respected him,” George A. Stamboulidis, Mr. Weissmann’s trial partner, said of his colleague and their mob witnesses. “He’s very bright and to the point but also has a pretty good read of his audience. It was definitely a relationship of mutual respect.”

Geoffrey S. Mearns, a former prosecutor in the Eastern District who is now the president of Ball State University in Indiana, said Mr. Weissmann’s personality mirrored that of the office — with its collection of scrappy, ambitious obsessives out to prove their relative mettle in a city where another office, the Southern District in Manhattan, was often viewed as more prestigious.

That their targets were some of the city’s most fearsome murderers tended to focus the mind, as well.

“He was trained in this environment that we were essentially going after these entrenched mob bosses,” Mr. Mearns said. “He’s trained as a prosecutor to be aggressive.”

‘I Don’t Drink Evian’

The locals did not all take well to their visitors from the federal government, dispatched to Houston after the collapse of Enron to investigate and prosecute the company’s fraud.

“Out-of-town, carpetbagging, Evian-swilling Department of Justice lawyers,” read one description in The Houston Chronicle.

This was an outrage, Mr. Weissmann told a reporter then. “I don’t drink Evian.”

It was this swagger that helped define the government’s posture as the task force went about its work, first with Mr. Weissmann as deputy director, then later as director. (Mr. Mueller, as F.B.I. director at the time, helped form the group.)

Their triumphs were many: With little precedent for such a complex inquiry into financial wrongdoing, the team won indictments and prison terms for almost all of the company’s top executives.

Mr. Weissmann was credited with acting on a hunch that Ben F. Glisan Jr., the former Enron treasurer who had already pleaded guilty without agreeing to cooperate, might be willing to say more. United States marshals hauled in Mr. Glisan from prison, at Mr. Weissmann’s direction, to appear before a grand jury. He became a key witness.

Prosecutors also initially earned a conviction of Arthur Andersen, an accounting firm charged with illegally destroying documents related to its audit of Enron, for obstruction of justice.

Colleagues praised his resourcefulness and legal guile. Opponents accused him of overreach, citing a series of overturned convictions and higher-court losses. Among the setbacks for the task force, the Arthur Andersen victory was unanimously overturned by the Supreme Court over a narrow issue involving jury instructions. Long before that outcome, the case had drawn ferocious criticism from members of the business community, who argued that the indictment alone amounted to a death sentence for the firm.

“It’s pretty clear that Weissmann created a culture in which they presumed that the people they were investigating were guilty,” said Tom Kirkendall, a Houston defense lawyer who represented clients on Enron-related cases.

This reputation has trailed Mr. Weissmann among some defense lawyers in the years since, propagated most vocally by a lawyer and author, Sidney Powell, whose work has been taken up by Trump allies like Newt Gingrich. (In 2015, Ms. Powell criticized Mr. Weissmann in an article for The New York Observer — which was owned by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law — after Mr. Weissmann was named to lead the Justice Department’s criminal fraud section.)

But those close to Mr. Weissmann — and some others less inclined to appreciate the work of prosecutors generally — have zealously defended his ethical compass.

Peter Neufeld, a civil rights lawyer and a founder of the Innocence Project, praised Mr. Weissmann’s nerve during his time at the F.B.I., as the agency grappled with the fallout of exonerations based on erroneous testimony from forensic hair examiners.

“He realized that what had gone on in the past was wrong,” Mr. Neufeld said, recalling Mr. Weissmann’s decision to order an audit of hundreds of convictions that may have relied on faulty testimony. “He did it. That was transformative.”

By 2013, both Mr. Weissmann and Mr. Mueller had left the agency. It seemed unlikely that they would partner again.

The lead author, Kevin Hall, chief of the Integrative Physiology Section at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and his colleagues also presented their work at the Obesity Society’s annual meeting.

Although the study is very small and must be replicated, Dr. Hall said, it is the first to assess obese people years after they lost weight with state-of-the-art methods to measure the calories they had consumed and the amount of exercise they had done.

The researchers did their measurements when the contestants were chosen, and again at six weeks, 30 weeks and six years after the contest began.

After ‘The Biggest Loser,’ Their Bodies Fought to Regain Weight

“The findings here are important,” said Rena Wing, a psychiatry professor at Brown University and a founder of the National Weight Control Registry, which includes more than 10,000 people.

The food eaten “is the key determinant of initial weight loss. And physical activity is the key to maintenance,” she said.

The study also helps explain why that might be. One consequence of weight loss among the Biggest Loser participants was a greatly slowed metabolism.

The subjects were burning an average of 500 fewer calories a day than would be expected, Dr. Hall and his colleagues found. In essence, their bodies were fighting against weight loss.

Those who kept the weight off “are countering the drop in metabolism with physical activity,” Dr. Hall said.

During the initial weight loss, the equation was different. Then, the difference between how much weight “Biggest Loser” contestants lost could be explained by the number of calories they cut from their diets. The amount of exercise did not distinguish those who lost more from those who lost less.

The contestants competed for six months to see who could lose the most weight. Participants followed a grueling diet and an exhausting exercise program.

Contestants’ average weight at the start of the show was 329 pounds. At the end, it was 200 pounds, a 129-pound loss. But six years after the study ended, their average weight rebounded to 290 pounds, just 38 pounds less than when they started.

That average, though, hid wide variations.

To learn more, Dr. Hall and his colleagues divided the group of 14 into two. There were the “regainers,” the seven participants who ended up after six years weighing five pounds more on average than they had at the start.

And there were the “maintainers,” the seven who maintained an average weight loss of 81 pounds.

To measure the number of calories the contestants burned, the researchers asked the subjects to drink “doubly labeled water,” in which hydrogen and oxygen atoms are at least partially replaced by stable isotopes, which have a different atomic mass.

The oxygen isotopes appear in carbon dioxide exhaled by subjects, which allowed the researchers to estimate the average amount exhaled each day. The more calories burned, the more carbon dioxide exhaled.

Some “Biggest Loser” contestants — including the first author, Dr. Jennifer Kerns, now an obesity specialist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington — said the conclusions of the new study confirmed their own experiences.

Dr. Kerns, a contestant in Season 3 of the show, says she has managed to keep off 100 pounds only by tracking everything she eats and by exercising on an elliptical cross-trainer for 35 to 40 minutes a day. In addition, her job requires her to walk around the hospital seeing patients.

She has learned that she cannot relax this regimen if she wants to maintain her weight. “My natural tendency is to regain,” she said.

Erinn Egbert was a candidate for Season 8 of the “Biggest Loser” but ultimately did not make the cut. So she went home “to figure it out on my own.”

She hired two trainers and followed a diet and exercise program while she finished her senior year at Ohio State University. She weighed 237 pounds when the show began and lost about 120 pounds.

She has maintained a weight that is just eight pounds more. She does it with rigid portion control and regular, intense exercise — 45 minutes to an hour a day, Monday through Saturday, doing the Beachbody programs, a challenging combination of strength training and cardiovascular exercise.

Ms. Egbert, who is 30 and lives in Lexington, Ky., says she learned the importance of working consistently to stay thin, even with a slowed metabolism.

“You have got to keep at it every single day,” she said.

It’s a difficult task for virtually anyone, Dr. Kerns said: “The amount of time and dedication it takes to manage one’s food intake and prioritize exercise every day can be an untenable burden for many people.”

“It’s totally unfair to judge those who can’t do it,” she added.

Dr. Hall agreed. “The idea that people who regain lost weight are necessarily slothful and gluttonous is an unfortunate stigmatization that is not based in fact,” he said.

Danny Cahill, who is 47 and lives in Tulsa, Okla., is among those who found it increasingly difficult to keep up the sort of regimen he needed to avoid gaining weight.

He won the “Biggest Loser” competition in Season 8. He weighed 430 pounds when the show began, and lost 239 of them.

For the four years after the show, he exercised more than two and half hours a day and gained back just 40 pounds.

Then the injuries began, forcing him to cut back his workouts to one and half hours a day. His weight crept up to 235 pounds.

The next year, “my body just started breaking down,” he said. “I had a foot injury, a wrist injury. I couldn’t keep it up.” And he was exhausted.

His weight went up to 300 pounds. For the last two years, his weight has remained stable at about 340 to 350 pounds, “but only because I am eating as very little as I can,” he said.

“That’s the disheartening part,” Mr. Cahill said. Losing the pounds is one thing. Keeping them off?

Today the United States accounts for only about 13 percent of world trade, down from almost a quarter in the 1980s.","According to a trade diplomat who is aware of the goings-on, American negotiators have warned Mexicans and Canadians that if the United States leaves Nafta, they shouldn’t expect trade relations to simply snap back to W.T.O. rules, which include a tariff ceiling of 3.5 percent, on average, for Mexican exports to the United States and 7.1 percent for American exports to Mexico. The United States, they argue, won’t be bound by these constraints.

Asked for comment, Mr. Lighthizer’s office referred me to a statement from June in which he affirmed his “commitment to working closely with U.S. trading partners to increase the W.T.O.’s ability to promote free and fair trade.” But he has not been shy about expressing his gripes about the organization. Meanwhile, the United States has been chipping away at its judicial apparatus, blocking appointments to the seven-member appellate body that rules on trade disputes. The court is now two members short and will be down three when the European jurist steps down in December. The impasse prompted Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Union’s top trade diplomat, to warn that the American position risks “killing the W.T.O. from the inside.”

Battling the Deficits The United States runs trade deficits with most of the world’s largest economies. The Trump administration argues this is unfair. U.S. bilateral trade balances for trade in goods, 2016 BILLIONS 20 LARGEST COUNTRIES China – $347.0 Japan – 68.8 Germany – 64.7 Mexico – 64.4 Italy – 28.6 Korea – 27.6 India – 24.4 France – 15.6 Switzerland – 13.6 Indonesia – 13.2 11.0 Canada – Russia – 8.7 3.0 Spain – SURPLUS Britain + 1.0 Saudi Arabia + 1.1 Turkey + 1.3 Argentina + 3.9 Brazil + 4.1 Australia + 12.7 Netherlands + 23.6

While emasculating the trade organization may seem foolhardy, trade experts warn that blowing up international trade law may be the only way the Trump administration could pursue its quixotic goal of eliminating the bilateral trade deficits that it has with most countries.

And that presents the world with a sort of Catch-22. The American current account deficit — a broad measure of its trade — is the mirror image of the gap between the United States’ national savings and its national investment. Because it invests more than it saves, it draws money from abroad and spends it on foreign goods and services. Until it closes the savings gap, no amount of diplomacy, bullying or cajoling will close the gap in trade.

If the United States leaves Nafta, it’s possible that its deficit with Mexico will balloon rather than shrink, as uncertainty sends the peso into a tailspin and makes Mexican exports cheaper. But even if Mr. Trump’s Nafta gambit worked and bilateral trade came into balance, it wouldn’t necessarily change the balance of American trade over all.

Mr. Lighthizer might remember that after Canada, Japan and the European Community agreed in the early 1980s to voluntary restraint agreements limiting exports of steel to the United States, producers in countries like South Korea and South Africa simply picked up the slack.

As another Dartmouth economist, Robert Staiger, told me, unless the American savings-investment imbalance corrected itself, too, the former deficit with Mexico would simply pop up somewhere else.

“Bilateral deficits are going to keep popping up everywhere,” he said. “Trump is going to be playing Whac-a-Mole.”

And if Republicans pass their smorgasbord of tax cuts, the mushrooming budget deficit will push the savings-investment imbalance in exactly the wrong direction.

The problem for the rest of the world is that any of these situations is likely to produce great frustration in an administration that appears to believe trade balances are negotiated like real estate deals. They all put the United States on a collision course with the legal regime administered by the W.T.O.

It is unclear whether Mr. Trump has the legal authority to pull the United States out of the trade regime governed by W.T.O., or even out of Nafta. Rufus Yerxa, a former top American trade diplomat on the team that negotiated both Nafta and the Uruguay Round of multilateral talks that led to the creation of the W.T.O. in 1995, argues that whatever the legalities, the thought that Mr. Trump may pull the United States out of the trade organization is not credible.

The losses, he said, would be far too steep. Countries would discriminate at will against American products and services. “Everybody in the world could do anything they wanted to do to us,” Mr. Yerxa said. The sprawling supply chains that American companies have laid out across the world since the trade organization came into being would be under threat.

Chad P. Bown, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, agreed. “It would hurt economic activity much more than in the 1980s,” he said. “So much trade back then was in final goods. Now a lot is in intermediate parts.”

It was easy to bully Japan in the 1980s. Its security depended on the United States. It’s unlikely that Washington could pull off the same thing with China today. Though the W.T.O. would suffer a blow if the United States left, it might survive it. Today the United States accounts for only about 13 percent of world trade, down from almost a quarter in the 1980s.

What’s most mystifying to foreign diplomats and trade policy experts is how the Trump administration conceives the endgame of bringing down a legal system the United States spent so much time and effort to build. Even if Mr. Trump prevails, the United States stands to lose.

American sugar policy comes to mind. In the early 1980s, hoping to put a floor on prices in the United States, the government set up a quota system to limit sugar imports. As Professor Irwin tells it, the enterprise proved more difficult than the experts in Washington ever thought.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The American import quota got smaller and smaller to keep pace with falling prices worldwide. At one point, American sugar was so expensive that companies started importing sugary products like cake mix, iced tea and cocoa in bulk to extract and sell the sugar within. Coke and Pepsi switched from sugar to corn syrup, slashing domestic demand and forcing the Agriculture Department to reduce import quotas further. And candy makers moved abroad, to where sugar was cheaper.

In the Caribbean and Central America, sugar quotas led farmers to stop producing sugar and start cultivating illegal narcotics that were smuggled into the United States. To cap it all, in August 1986 the United States sold China 136,000 tons of sugar it had accumulated in its efforts to bolster the price. It was sugar it bought at 18 cents a pound. It sold at 5 cents. Within days, world sugar prices plummeted.

Robert Lighthizer has been involved in international trade diplomacy long enough to remember this kind of go-it-alone trade strategy.

At a March 31 meeting in a foreman’s lounge at the Trump Hotel in Washington, which was under construction, with Mr. Trump and the rest of the foreign policy team, Mr. Papadopoulos pitched the idea of a personal meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin.
But Mr. Trump listened with interest and asked questions of Mr. Papadopoulos.
In August 2016, Mr. Clovis wrote Mr. Papadopoulos encouraging him and another adviser to make the trip, “if it is feasible.” It never took place.","They have described Carter Page, an energy executive who F.B.I. agents suspected had once been marked for recruitment by Russian spies, as a gadfly who had been “put on notice” by the campaign and whom Mr. Trump “does not know.” Mr. Page’s trip to Moscow in July 2016 was one of the triggers leading the F.B.I. to open a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, and he has appeared before a grand jury in the investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel.

It is harder for the White House to distance itself from Michael T. Flynn, a retired military intelligence officer who was forced out in February after less than a month as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser. The White House has said Mr. Flynn resigned after it became clear he had not been forthright about conversations he had in late December with Sergey I. Kislyak, who was then the Russian ambassador.

The fact that so many of Mr. Trump’s foreign policy aides from that period have now acknowledged contacts with Russian officials or their intermediaries hints at Moscow’s eagerness to establish links to his campaign.

Mr. Flynn’s pro-Russian tilt was well established before he joined the Trump campaign. He had pushed for greater cooperation with Russia on counterterrorism issues while director of the Defense Intelligence Agency from 2012 to 2014. He became even more vocal after he was forced to retire by President Barack Obama, arguing that Russia was a necessary ally in a “world war” against Islamist militancy. Mr. Flynn even traveled to Russia in December 2015 for a paid speaking engagement with RT, the Kremlin-financed news network that American intelligence says is a propaganda operation. The trip also included an invitation to RT’s anniversary dinner, where he was photographed sitting at the elbow of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

It has since become clear that the White House knew before the inauguration that Mr. Flynn was already under federal investigation for secretly working as a paid agent of Turkey during the campaign. That investigation has widened to examine possible money laundering and failure to disclose payments from Russian companies, including RT.

Although as a candidate Mr. Trump touted the “many great national security people” at his side, he was reduced in large part to unknowns or carry-overs from other failed campaigns, even as late as March 2016, when he was the clear front-runner. More than 50 conservative foreign policy experts signed an open letter condemning his national security views.

And his own statements were confusing: “Yes, there is a team. There’s not a team. I’m going to be forming a team,” Mr. Trump said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on March 8, 2016.

Finally, in late March, Mr. Trump presented his team, led by Jeff Sessions, the Alabama senator and future attorney general. Among the other five he named were Mr. Page and Mr. Papadopoulos, whom he described as “an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy.”

Mr. Papadopoulos, then 28, had some minor campaign experience. After he promised to raise substantial sums from the Greek-American community, Ben Carson’s campaign hired him for $5,000 a month to serve on its national security and foreign policy advisory committee.

After Mr. Carson’s campaign collapsed, Mr. Papadopoulos moved into Mr. Trump’s orbit. According to interviews and the court papers released Monday, he discussed the campaign’s priorities with Sam Clovis, then a top policy adviser and campaign supervisor, and “understood that a principal foreign policy focus of the campaign was an improved U.S. relationship with Russia.”

In a statement from his lawyer, Victoria Toensing, Mr. Clovis denied that. “That was not Dr. Clovis’s view,” it said.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters during a news briefing on Tuesday that the Trump campaign had voluntarily given Mr. Papadopoulos’s emails to investigators.

“That is what led to the process and the place that we’re in,” Ms. Sanders said, adding that the campaign had been “fully cooperating and helping with that.”

In late March last year, Mr. Papadopoulos emailed Mr. Clovis and others that he had discussed with his contacts — a London-based professor with Moscow ties and a Russian woman whom he described as a relative of Mr. Putin’s — the possibility of a meeting between the Trump campaign and Russia’s leadership.

“Great work,” Mr. Clovis responded, according to the court documents and interviews.

At a March 31 meeting in a foreman’s lounge at the Trump Hotel in Washington, which was under construction, with Mr. Trump and the rest of the foreign policy team, Mr. Papadopoulos pitched the idea of a personal meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. Mr. Clovis and others immediately expressed doubts about the wisdom of the idea, noting that Russia was under United States sanctions and denouncing the “optics” of a meeting with Mr. Putin, according to a former campaign aide who attended the meeting.

But Mr. Trump listened with interest and asked questions of Mr. Papadopoulos. Mr. Trump “didn’t say yes, and he didn’t say no,” said the former aide, who agreed to describe the meeting on the condition of anonymity.

Finally, Mr. Sessions, as the campaign’s top national security official, spoke vehemently against the idea, asking others not to discuss it again. Mr. Trump did not challenge him, the former aide said.

Nonetheless, Mr. Papadopoulos continued to pursue the notion of some sort of meeting for several months, updating Trump campaign officials on his efforts, the court records showed.

He emailed one high-ranking campaign official saying that the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had asked if the campaign would send a representative to Russia, and he offered to go. In August 2016, Mr. Clovis wrote Mr. Papadopoulos encouraging him and another adviser to make the trip, “if it is feasible.” It never took place.

Ms. Toensing, Mr. Clovis’s lawyer, said that Mr. Clovis agreed that Mr. Papadopoulos should travel as a private individual, not as a campaign aide.

“He was hitting on everyone,” she said. “And they all ignore him and the trips didn’t occur.”

Former campaign officials say Mr. Papadopoulos peppered them with unwanted emails. After he criticized the British leadership on television, he wrote asking if he would be fired.

But again, they didn’t. The real issue here isn’t what the I.R.S. says is income. The real issue is how that code is enforced. And this is where things really break down.

There are a few ways that United States law seeks to make taxpayers declare company income in foreign bank accounts. This is where the indictment implicates both Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates and these techniques.

First, United States anti-money laundering laws require that citizens file a form, a Foreign Bank and Financials Account report, if they control (including through a company or other legal entity) foreign bank account worth over a total of $10,000.

Next, income tax Form 1040, Schedule B, Part III also requires taxpayers to check a box if they held a foreign account. According to the indictment, neither Mr. Manafort nor Mr. Gates did so. In other words, they refused to rat themselves out to the I.R.S. that they were engaging in tax evasion. What a surprise.

In addition, the United States has embarked on a policy in which it has enlisted (at the tip of a metaphorical bayonet) foreign banks to report to the United States government when its taxpayers control an account. However, the Manafort-Gates duo was allegedly careful to hide their control of their corporations and partnerships by having so-called nominee owners (the actual owner “nominates” someone else as owner). Presumably, they failed to inform those banks that they were the actual owners. In other words, once again, they refused to rat themselves out.

Of course, failure to file those forms or check those boxes is a crime in itself and punishable with a penalty. But it’s hard to imagine that additional penalties would sway the committed tax evader. It is, however, easy to see how honest people can be punished if they unintentionally fail to file forms or check boxes, exposing them to investigations and penalties that were never meant to apply to them.

Fortunately, there is a better way. Both United States law and global anti-money laundering standards require banks to report suspicious activity to government law enforcement agencies. Millions of dollars paid by dodgy Ukrainians to unknown companies in Cyprus and then to luxury car dealers in the United States for no known legal reason would certainly seem to qualify.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city.","Devastated by the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Photo

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

And this is where we drew the line, because underscoring dignity and validating the will of the people could not wait forever. In a battle for self-determination and the recognition of rights, one does not win with the first punch, especially against a state so willing to have its machinery strike millions of citizens just because they want to vote. No matter what Madrid says, Carles Puigdemont and Carme Forcadell are still the president and the speaker of our Parliament, respectively, and will continue to be until the day our citizens decide otherwise in a free election.

With the referendum’s passing vote, the Catalan Republic was born, and it is supported by the legitimacy of the ballot boxes. We Catalans need a shared strategy on the remaining stretch of the road to gradually establish a new framework of freedoms. In the coming days, we will have to make decisions, and they will not always be easy to understand.

Madrid’s will to quash self-government, to reject dialogue, to limit rights and freedoms, to persecute the representatives of the citizens, to impose the state’s brute force, forces us to persevere and to become stronger in order to prevail. Today in Catalonia there is a clear dissociation between the democratic will of citizens and the central government, which has set out to take over the people’s institutions and control them despotically.

Spain’s government has entered Catalonia with a determination to interfere in the educational curriculum, to control the media, to put our police force at its service, to convert the country into just one more province of a divided Spain that does not tolerate national plurality, to crush any dissidence, however democratic, and to kill any hope of dialogue.

We cannot allow this. It is essential to weave solid alliances with all the social and economic actors that want to build a national state truly at the service of its citizens. In spite of the obstacles being placed in our way, we must move forward. We must never give up the vote as a means of validating the republic, and we must prepare future local elections that will be essential to the consolidation of this republic.

The Spanish government’s usurpation of institutions through Article 155 of the Constitution, a tool that allows Madrid to take administrative control of Catalonia, has caused an outcry and our response to it has become a priority.

In the face of this attack we must recompose our forces, persevere and have no doubt that with the civility and peaceful attitude we have always displayed, we will continue to advance as far as we decide to go.

The factory, PT Panca Buana Cahaya Sukses, was in a poor neighborhood of Tangerang, a city of about two million just west of Jakarta, the capital.

It was built two months ago in an open field near a junior high school, neighbors said.

Surnah and Evih were close friends, their parents said. Evih was inspired to apply for a job at the factory after Surnah started working there, her father said.

The police were able to identify Surnah relatively quickly because of the braces on her teeth. After a DNA comparison with her mother confirmed her identity, they delivered a sealed coffin to the family.

Her funeral was held Saturday. Among the pallbearers was the Tangerang police chief, Harry Kurniawan, whose department is investigating the fire.

While school costs are not exorbitant, many poor families in Indonesia cannot afford to send their children beyond sixth grade.

Surnah lived with her grandparents, an aunt and uncle and a cousin in a one-bedroom house. Her mother, who has remarried, lives with her new husband.

“Surnah said, ‘It is better if I work than if I stay at home and play,’” her mother said. “Surnah said it is better for her to have income herself.”

The factory employed mostly women. Surnah worked in a group of five that had a quota of 1,000 packages a day. If they fell short, their pay would be reduced.

Like Surnah, her friend Evih wanted to be independent and to contribute to her family, her father said.

Director Gillian Robespierre’s follow-up to her bittersweet comedy “Obvious Child” follows a New York City family’s messy relationships — with one another, and with ’90s technology — after the youngest child, Ali (Abby Quinn), discovers emails from her father (John Turturro) to a secret lover on the shared family desktop. This movie can be funny, sweet, dark and playfully nostalgic, but it doesn’t leave its characters stranded amid the pop-culture references.

I think Amazon is trying to make me feel better about how much food I plan on eating Thanksgiving weekend by putting one of my favorite comedies of the year on Prime. In this semi-autobiographical romantic comedy, a stand-up comedian named Kumail (played by Kumail Nanjiani) and a grad student named Emily (Zoe Kazan, playing Nanjiani’s real-life wife, Emily V. Gordon) meet, fall in love and break up before Emily lands in the hospital with a mysterious illness. The nightmarish situation pushes Kumail to bond with her parents (played by Ray Romano and Holly Hunter, one of the year’s cutest onscreen couples), giving him hope for a chance to repair his relationship. The movie isn’t one-sided about the immigrant experience, as Kumail also has to confront the cultural and generational divisions between him and his tradition-minded parents.

Rachel Brosnahan stars as a housewife who starts telling jokes on stage — and soon becomes a sensation — after her husband leaves her. Sherman-Palladino brings her usual fast-paced, funny dialogue to a story that partly echoes the experiences of pioneering comics like Joan Rivers, and partly speaks to what it’s always been like to be a woman in showbiz.

Much less intense than Christopher Nolan’s “Dunkirk,” this movie is a charming romantic drama about the making of a movie about Dunkirk in the 1940s. In “Their Finest,” Catrin (Gemma Arterton) is a plucky secretary who lands a job as a scriptwriter for propaganda movies. She finds a story of two sisters who rescued men fleeing from Dunkirk — inspiring but not particularly exciting without a few rewrites. Despite the number of onscreen tragedies, the movie’s heroine resolutely keeps her head up and carries on. The movie also features veteran British actors like Bill Nighy, Richard E. Grant and (in a hilarious mustachioed cameo) Jeremy Irons.

Plans for venues like the Chase Center — a privately financed arena being built in San Francisco for the reigning N.B.A.","Jewel box venues like Fenway Park and Wrigley Field have survived on the charm they bring to baseball, but large single-purpose sites had mostly fallen out of favor by the mid-1960s. The concrete doughnuts that followed — which tried to mash baseball and football fields into the same space — struggled to effectively exhibit either sport. And single-purpose designs returned to the norm in the 1990s.

But the same concerns that led to the development of those rarely mourned multipurpose stadiums persist today. Single-sports structures can often lie fallow for much the year, in some cases marooned by sprawling parking lots on the outskirts of cities.

Although the cost of some new stadiums has pushed beyond the $1 billion mark, a key revenue stream shows signs it might not be the reliable income generator it once was: Weekly attendance at N.F.L. games has been mostly down this year (even before players began protesting comments by President Trump), and attendance at Major League Baseball games, while still high, has also declined slightly in recent years.

That has only intensified the need for new buildings to do double (or more) duty. Some large venues are increasingly catering to nontraditional events like monster truck rallies, marathons, black-tie banquets and conferences. MetLife Stadium, the home of the Jets and the Giants, hosted a Bollywood awards show in July.

But event planners often find that convention centers are better suited to their needs, with superior lighting and audiovisual options, extensive catering facilities and the ability to partition off floor space into multiple rooms, said Jack W. Plunkett, chief executive of Plunkett Research.

Industrywide tracking of supplemental revenue from one-off events is patchy at best. Still, “stadium managers want to maximize ancillary income from stadium event rental, but there are a lot of challenges and the competition is fierce for those dollars,” he said.

Last month, Barclays Center in Brooklyn hosted a video game tournament — a championship showdown using the first-person shooter game “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.” In the same space that has hosted Beyoncé and the hometown Nets, enormous screens conveyed the action to an audience of thousands, accompanied by pounding music, a light show and smoke effects.

“It’s super awesome — they’re putting a lot of time and money into making this a good show, taking it mainstream,” said Joseph Nelson, 18, who traveled from Scotch Plains, N.J. “I could watch this streamed at home, but I come here to be with people and enjoy the production.”

“Hyperconnectivity” of the digital sort is important, especially for younger fans, according to a report from Deloitte last year. That could take the form of virtual assistants guiding customers through team shops or informing event organizers what highlights the crowd wants to see.

Companies like VenueNext, which has worked with Super Bowl host stadiums and Churchill Downs, home to the Kentucky Derby, create custom apps to help fans track which bathrooms have the shortest waits, order food to be delivered to their seats and watch replays on their phones. Avaya Stadium, home to the San Jose Earthquakes soccer team, erected a wall of screens nearly seven feet tall to aggregate real-time statistics, social media chatter, YouTube videos and other fan-generated content.

Still, designers are worried that visitors, accustomed to a spread of entertainment options at home, will get restless at a live event. So they’re considering ways to connect fans to the live experience.

Designers envision using biometric data and motion effects to sync an entertainer’s heartbeat with pulses sent into spectators’ seats. Augmented reality stations could offer guests a digital backstage tour.

One rentable suite at Petco Park, home of baseball’s San Diego Padres, allows fans to play the video game “MLB: The Show” on PlayStation video game consoles while overlooking the field.

“The traditional arena was fundamentally designed around a static in-seat experience,” Mr. Mirakian said. “But the behavioral patterns for this next-generation visitor are dramatically different — they want to come into the building and have the ability to choose their own adventure.”

Photo

Another bonus: Flexible venues are easier to finance at a time when taxpayers are less inclined to pick up part of the tab. Last year, voters in San Diego rejected a ballot measure that would have raised hotel taxes to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars toward helping erect a new football stadium for the Chargers. (The team opted to move to Los Angeles.)

Most economic experts believe that the benefits of stadiums are very likely to be outweighed by the costs to the taxpayers who fund the projects, according to a survey this year from the Initiative on Global Markets at Chicago Booth. After all, even with a full slate of events, many of those taxpayers may never set foot in the building, which the neighborhood may end up seeing as a hulking, self-contained island, siloed from the rest of the community.

That is a criticism that new venues are trying to address by better blending into their surroundings and encouraging more visitors. Stadium and arena planners are trying to integrate hotels, lakes, parks, office buildings and other meeting places into their designs. Plans for venues like the Chase Center — a privately financed arena being built in San Francisco for the reigning N.B.A. champion Golden State Warriors that will include a waterfront park, restaurants and retail — refer to the complexes as “districts.”

Half of the concourse area used for the Little Caesars Arena, which opened last month in Detroit as the new home of the Red Wings and the Pistons, is accessible year-round, regardless of whether an event is scheduled in the main bowl. Retailers and restaurants open on to the street and the clear-roofed concourse.

Instead, he repeated his call for the European Union to step into the conflict, a plea that has been rejected by European leaders.","On Friday, Jean-Claude Juncker, the most pro-European of European leaders, said bluntly that the European Union “doesn’t need any more cracks, more splits.”

Mr. Juncker, the president of the European Commission and himself from tiny Luxembourg, said that the bloc should not intervene in “an internal debate for Spain, but I wouldn’t want the European Union to consist of 95 member states in the future.”

After Catalan separatists declared independence last Friday, Mr. Rajoy dismissed Mr. Puigdemont and his cabinet and dissolved the Catalan Parliament, calling for regional elections on Dec. 21.

In Brussels, Mr. Puigdemont welcomed the chance for separatists to win the December elections. He said he would “accept the results” and called on Madrid to make “a clear commitment” to do the same.

Mr. Puigdemont emphasized that he was not escaping Spanish justice, but he said he wanted guarantees of a fair trial and would work for now from Brussels, in “freedom and security.”

After reading the charges proposed by the Spanish attorney general, Mr. Puigdemont said he felt Catalan politicians would not be treated fairly by the Spanish judiciary.

Video

The possible charges, he argued, amounted to “a persecution” of people and their ideas rather than specific crimes. “More than a desire for justice, it is a desire for vengeance,” he said.

While he ruled out asking for political asylum from Belgium, he could do so in the future, especially if Spain seeks his arrest and extradition.

Mr. Puigdemont’s Belgian lawyer, Paul Bekaert, said that “as long as the possibility exists that Spain asks to extradite Puigdemont, it can’t be excluded that he applies for political asylum.”

Mr. Bekaert, 68, who specializes in asylum cases, has worked in the past for Basque separatists who sought asylum here to avoid trial on terrorism charges in Spain. He said he didn’t know how long Mr. Puigdemont would stay.

“He came here to work in total peace and security,” Mr. Bekaert said. “In the meantime, we are on standby.”

Earlier, Mr. Bekaert told Flemish Radio: “As a citizen of the European Union, he can in fact apply for political asylum here. Whether he obtains it is another question.”

Late Tuesday, some members of the ousted Catalan cabinet flew back to Barcelona from Brussels, triggering speculation about another possible change of mind by Mr. Puigdemont. But he was not on board the plane.

Mr. Puigdemont’s presence in Brussels was intended to add a European dimension to Spain’s most serious political crisis in decades. He is in effect proposing to lead his ousted Catalan government from a city that is home to the main institutions of the European Union, which has been unsympathetic to the push for secession, and is in a country that has its own separatist tensions.

So wary is Belgium of Mr. Puigdemont and his movement that it prevented him from holding his news conference in a government-owned building.

More important, however, the European Union is also wary of Mr. Puigdemont, whose appeal to a Europe of “democracy, liberty, free expression and nonviolence,” as he put it, indicated a romantic view of the bloc.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The Catalan separatists appear swept up in an earlier concept of a European Union of shared sovereignties, where regional identities can merge with a vague European identity and somehow supersede national ones.

That view has become outdated in a bloc under severe nationalist strains stemming from the debt crisis, the migration wave, the fear of terrorism and the populism that all of those anxieties have engendered.

Not least, a larger bloc of 28 very different nations has grown more sensitive than in many decades to the sanctity of their borders.

The European Union, facing the loss of Britain, has no desire to enlarge further or to create more fissures. Already anxious about Scotland’s previous calls for independence, states like France, Italy and even Belgium have no interest in encouraging regional secessionist movements in places like Corsica, Lombardy, South Tyrol and Flanders.

And Spain, with a strongly recovering economy, is considered a model of democratic transformation after the Franco era under the umbrella and tutelage of the European Union. A Spanish failure would be perceived as a European one, just as Brussels feels that the bloc is regaining some of its confidence.

Mr. Puigdemont and several members of his ousted cabinet made their way to Brussels on Monday just as the Spanish attorney general, José Manuel Maza, announced in Madrid that Mr. Puigdemont and other separatist leaders should appear “urgently” in court there.

Those in Brussels may avoid the Spanish courts, but they will not find much support from any European Union official. And even as Mr. Puigdemont and others sat tight in Brussels, the Spanish Supreme Court summoned a handful of other Catalan lawmakers to appear in Madrid on Thursday, including Carme Forcadell, the president of the Catalan Parliament who read out the declaration of independence last week.

Mr. Maza chose not to order the immediate arrest of the separatists, but he wants judges to allow him to pursue charges of rebellion, sedition and the misuse of public funds against those who organized and carried out an illegal independence referendum on Oct. 1.

On Tuesday, Mr. Puigdemont said the length of his Brussels stay was dependent “on the circumstances.”

“If we could be guaranteed that the trial would be fair,” he said, “without doubt I would return immediately.”

Had he and his entire cabinet stayed in Barcelona this week, he said, “with an attitude of resistance, there would have been a very violent reaction by the state,” he argued.

Mr. Puigdemont said he had not been negotiating with Belgian politicians. “I don’t ask anything from Belgian politicians, except as part of European politics,” he said.

Instead, he repeated his call for the European Union to step into the conflict, a plea that has been rejected by European leaders. “To the international community and especially Europe, I ask them to react,” he said.

While he waits, the national government in Madrid took direct administrative control of Catalonia, using emergency constitutional powers invoked by Mr. Rajoy.

Mr. Puigdemont called on Catalan citizens to oppose the dismantling of Catalonia’s institutions, while officials in Madrid welcomed the news that Mr. Puigdemont had chosen to leave Spain rather than remain in Barcelona and resist the national government’s decision to oust him.","From Brussels, the Deposed Leader of Catalonia Pleads With a Wary Europe",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/world/europe/puigdemont-catalonia-belgium-spain.html

“The foreign interference we saw was reprehensible,” Colin Stretch, Facebook’s general counsel, told senators.

The companies also acknowledged that they were struggling to keep up with the threat of foreign interference.

“The abuse of our platform to attempt state-sponsored manipulation of elections is a new challenge for us — and one that we are determined to meet,” said Twitter’s acting general counsel, Sean Edgett.

At the heart of the companies’ problems are business models that reward viral content — which can include misinformation — and an enormous advertising business that is automated and unable to easily spot ads purchased by foreign governments.

In a sign of the shifting political winds for tech giants, Republicans, who have been more restrained in their criticism of the companies, were more skeptical on Tuesday. In one contentious exchange, Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, pressed Mr. Stretch on whether Facebook could possibly police all of its advertisers.

“I’m trying to get us down from La-La Land here,” Mr. Kennedy said. “The truth of the matter is, you have five million advertisers that change every month. Every minute. Probably every second. You don’t have the ability to know who every one of those advertisers is, do you?”

Photo

Mr. Stretch acknowledged that Facebook could not track all those advertisers.

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, the chairman of the crime and terrorism subcommittee that held the hearing, said the risk went beyond Russia to other American adversaries. Talking to reporters afterward, he alluded to potential regulation of political advertising online.

“It’s Russia today; it could be Iran and North Korea tomorrow,” Mr. Graham said. “What we need to do is sit down and find ways to bring some of the controls we have on over-the-air broadcast to social media to protect the consumer.”

Facebook, Twitter and Google have not publicly opposed a bipartisan proposal to require reports on who funds political ads online, similar to rules for broadcast television. In private, their lobbyists have praised voluntary efforts to disclose political ad funding and have resisted many aspects of the bill.

Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said the legislation was essential before the midterm elections in 2018.

“Our midterms are 370 days away, and we don’t have time to mess around with dialogue anymore,” Ms. Klobuchar said in an interview after the hearing. Ms. Klobuchar introduced the bill with Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.

During the hearing, some Republicans also sought to play down the Russian effort to tip the election in favor of President Trump, stressing incorrectly that the Kremlin’s agents did not favor a particular presidential candidate in last year’s election.

“Russia does not have loyalty to a political party in the United States,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee. “Their goal is to divide us and discredit our democracy.”

That assertion was at odds with the conclusion of American intelligence agencies that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia tried to sway the election in favor of Mr. Trump, going beyond just posting disruptive content on social media. Russian operatives also hacked Democratic email accounts and released messages embarrassing to Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Mr. Graham asked Mr. Stretch of Facebook to confirm that the pattern of activity the site saw from Russia was more focused on sowing chaos in the United States than in bolstering Mr. Trump’s candidacy.

“During the election, they were trying to create discord between Americans, most of it directed against Clinton,” Mr. Graham said, addressing Mr. Stretch. “After the election, you saw Russian-tied groups and organizations trying to undermine President Trump’s legitimacy. Is that what you saw on Facebook?”

Mr. Stretch agreed. But the question was narrowly tailored, apparently intended to distance the broader Russian interference from the backing of Mr. Trump.

Though the companies promised to work with government officials, Mr. Stretch stopped short of agreeing to some suggestions.

In one heated exchange, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, asked him to reject political ad purchases in foreign currencies.

“How did Facebook, which prides itself on being able to process billions of data points and instantly transform them in the personal connections with its user, somehow not make the connection that electoral ads, paid for in rubles, were coming from Russia?” Mr. Franken said.

But Mr. Stretch hemmed, saying the rejection of a foreign currency to buy political ads would not solve the problem of foreign interference.

“The reason I’m hesitating on foreign currency is it’s relatively easy for bad actors to switch currencies,” Mr. Stretch said. “So it’s a signal, but not enough.”

That response failed to satisfy Mr. Franken, who interrupted with exasperation.

“My goal is for you to think through this stuff a little bit better,” Mr. Franken said, raising his voice.

This week, the companies admitted that the abuse of their platforms was much greater than previously acknowledged. In addition to Facebook’s admission, Google said that agents who were also from the Internet Research Agency uploaded more than 1,000 videos on its YouTube platform.

WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday essentially blamed the terrorist attack in New York City on what he characterized as soft immigration policies promoted by Democrats, singling out Senator Chuck Schumer, the state’s senior lawmaker and the party’s leader in the upper chamber.

He made clear that he was getting his information from Fox News, as he often does in the morning. “We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems,” he wrote. “We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter). @foxandfriends.”

Mr. Schumer quickly fired back at Mr. Trump in a statement saying that immigration is good for America.

“President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be focusing on the real solution — antiterrorism funding — which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement. “I’m calling on the president to immediately rescind his proposed cuts to this vital antiterrorism funding.”

The diversity visa program cited by Mr. Trump was created in 1990 by a bill supported by Mr. Schumer, passed by bipartisan votes and signed into law by a Republican president, George Bush. Mr. Schumer supported getting rid of the program as part of a comprehensive plan to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws crafted by eight lawmakers and passed by the Senate in 2013. But the plan was blocked in the House by Republicans who objected to other elements of the plan that they considered too permissive.

Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona who has broken with Mr. Trump, came to Mr. Schumer’s defense on Wednesday. “Actually, the Gang of 8, including @SenSchumer, did away with the Diversity Visa Program as part of broader reforms,” Mr. Flake wrote on Twitter. “I know, I was there.”

Democrats on Wednesday noted that Mr. Trump was quick to assail his political opponents and immigration policies less than 24 hours after the New York attack, even though his own White House declared it unseemly to talk about gun control policies in the immediate aftermath of the massacre in Las Vegas, in which a heavily armed American citizen shot and killed 58 people and injured hundreds of others.

“This is an unspeakable tragedy. Today is a day for consoling of survivors and mourning those we lost,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said at the time, scolding those who called for more gun control. “There is a time and place for political debate, but now is a time to unite as a country.”

Eight people were killed and 11 were injured when a driver rammed a pickup truck down a bicycle path in Manhattan on Tuesday in what the authorities called the deadliest terrorist attack in the city since Sept. 11, 2001. The driver, who shouted “Allahu akbar,” was shot by a police officer and was in critical condition on Tuesday night. The suspect was identified as Sayfullo Saipov, who came to the United States in 2010 from Uzbekistan and has a green card that permitted permanent legal residency.

Mr. Trump was evidently referring to a policy that creates a class of immigrants called “diversity immigrants” from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the United States. About 50,000 diversity visas are distributed annually among six geographic regions, and no single country receives more than 7 percent of the available visas in one year, according to the State Department website.

The program has been a target of conservatives, who proposed eliminating it in legislation endorsed by Mr. Trump that would crack down on legal immigration. The legislation would slash legal immigration to the United States in half within a decade by sharply curtailing the ability of American citizens and legal residents to bring family members into the country.

Whether Mr. Saipov actually came into the country through the diversity visa program was not immediately confirmed by government officials, but conservative media outlets like Fox News and Breitbart News quickly blamed the program and pointed the finger at Mr. Schumer.

Mr. Trump, who during last year’s campaign called for a complete ban on all Muslims entering the United States, has long sought to close the borders to many outsiders. He has signed several versions of a travel ban aimed mainly at countries with Muslim majorities even as courts repeatedly intervened. He has embraced plans to cut the number of refugees allowed into the country as well as legal immigrants.

Mr. Saipov came from Uzbekistan, which was not among the countries targeted by Mr. Trump’s travel restrictions. A former Soviet republic, it has over the years hosted American and other Western military forces as part of the war in neighboring Afghanistan, although it forced the United States to close a base there in 2005 after a human rights dispute following a massacre.

Likewise, Mr. Trump seemed to suggest Uzbekistan was part of Europe instead of Central Asia.

The attack on Mr. Schumer offered a timely way for Mr. Trump to change the subject from the special counsel investigation that unveiled its first criminal charges this week against three campaign advisers to Mr. Trump. It also served to reassure Mr. Trump’s conservative base, which was nervous after the president seemed to find common cause with “Chuck and Nancy,” meaning Mr. Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader.

After Tuesday evening’s attack in New York, other Republicans pressed Mr. Trump to dispense with legal protections for the suspect in New York and declare him an enemy combatant. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and a onetime critic of Mr. Trump who has lately become an ally, praised the president’s tough stance.

“The one thing I like about President Trump, he understands that we are in a religious war,” Mr. Graham told Fox News on Tuesday night, before the president’s Twitter posts about Mr. Schumer and immigration. “And to the American people, we are fighting people who are compelled by their religious views to kill us all. They kill fellow Muslims who don’t agree with their view of Islam. They kill Christians, vegetarians, libertarians, you name it. So we’re in a war.”",Trump Blames Schumer and Immigration Policies Hours After New York Terrorist Attack,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/us/politics/trump-new-york-attack-schumer-visa.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Although the police have so far charged Mr. Shiraishi only with “abandoning bodies,” news reports on Tuesday described him as a serial killer who sought people who were thinking of killing themselves and who had expressed their dark thoughts on Twitter. The police are expected to charge Mr. Shiraishi with murder.

According to news reports, the police discovered body parts from eight women and one man in Mr. Shiraishi’s apartment, along with a saw, ropes and an awl, apparently used to restrain and cut the bodies. The body parts, which included severed heads, were found in cold-storage containers and tool boxes, some covered in cat litter. The national broadcaster NHK reported that Mr. Shiraishi had said four of the victims were teenagers.

Kyodo News reported that Mr. Shiraishi, who worked as a recruiter for an escort service based in the Tokyo red-light district of Kabukicho, had confessed to sexually assaulting some of the women before killing them.

He also wanted money, according to the Kyodo report, and stole 500,000 yen, or about $4,400, from one of the victims.

The Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun reported that Mr. Shiraishi had described to investigators telling his father over the summer that his life was meaningless. Then, according to news outlets including Mainichi Shimbun, he created Twitter accounts specifically to attract people with suicidal thoughts.

The Mainichi report said that he had found his first victim on Twitter and had asked to meet up, but that she had come with her boyfriend. The three went out for a drink.

Mr. Shiraishi told the police that he later invited the woman to come alone to his apartment, where he killed her. When her boyfriend came looking for her, Mr. Shiraishi told the police, he killed him, as well.

“If the man reported her missing to the police, I thought I would be suspected, so I killed him,” the Mainichi report described Mr. Shiraishi as saying to the police.

The authorities were initially led to Mr. Shiraishi’s apartment while searching for a missing 23-year-old Tokyo woman who had posted on Twitter that she was “looking for someone who will die with me.”

Her brother reported her missing late last month, and through her Twitter account found that she had been exchanging messages with Mr. Shiraishi. The brother said she had been thinking of killing herself since the death of their mother in June, and that she had disappeared on Oct. 23 from the group home in Hachioji, a suburb of Tokyo, where she was living.

The suspect told the police that he had sent a Twitter message to the woman saying, “Let’s die together,” Kyodo reported.

The police have not yet said whether the woman’s remains were among those at Mr. Shiraishi’s apartment.

According to The Asahi Shimbun, the brother provided the police with Mr. Shiraishi’s Twitter handle, and investigators identified another woman who had been in touch with the suspect. She agreed to contact Mr. Shiraishi and to invite him to meet her at a train station while the police observed.

After the woman identified Mr. Shiraishi, the police followed him back to his apartment on Monday.

When they knocked on the door, he answered, and the police saw boxes inside. When they asked Mr. Shiraishi if he knew where the missing woman was, according to the Asahi report, he replied, “In that cooler.”

Neighbors told officers that they had noticed a sewage-like smell for at least two months, but that they had not reported it. According to Kyodo, Mr. Shiraishi told the police that he had not discarded the bodies because he was afraid of being caught.

Behold a child.

A slight girl all of 6, she leaves the modest family farm, where the father minds the livestock and the mother keeps a painful secret, and walks out to the main road. Off she goes to primary school, off to the Sisters of Mercy.

IRELAND Tuam Dublin GALWAY

Her auburn hair in ringlets, this child named Catherine is bound for Tuam, the ancient County Galway town whose name derives from a Latin term for “burial mound.” It is the seat of a Roman Catholic archdiocese, a proud distinction announced by the skyscraping cathedral that for generations has loomed over factory and field.

Two miles into this long-ago Irish morning, the young girl passes through a gantlet of gray formed by high walls along the Dublin Road that seem to thwart sunshine. To her right runs the Parkmore racecourse, where hard-earned shillings are won or lost by a nose. And to her left, the mother and baby home, with glass shards embedded atop its stony enclosure.

Behind this forbidding divide, nuns keep watch over unmarried mothers and their children. Sinners and their illegitimate spawn, it is said. The fallen.

But young Catherine knows only that the children who live within seem to be a different species altogether: sallow, sickly — segregated. “Home babies,” they’re called.

The girl’s long walk ends at the Mercy school, where tardiness might earn you a smarting whack on the hand. The children from the home are always late to school — by design, it seems, to keep them from mingling with “legitimate” students. Their oversize hobnail boots beat a frantic rhythm as they hustle to their likely slap at the schoolhouse door.

A sensitive child, familiar with the sting of playground taunts, Catherine nevertheless decides to repeat a prank she saw a classmate pull on one of these children. She balls up an empty candy wrapper and presents it to a home baby as if it still contains a sweet, then watches as the little girl’s anticipation melts to sad confusion.

Everyone laughs, nearly. This moment will stay with Catherine forever.

After classes end, the home babies hurry back down the Dublin Road in two straight lines, boots tap-tap-tapping, and disappear behind those Gothic walls. Sometimes the dark wooden front door is ajar, and on her way home Catherine thrills at the chance of a stolen peek.

Beyond those glass-fanged walls lay seven acres of Irish suffering. Buried here somewhere are famine victims who succumbed to starvation and fever a century earlier, when the home was a loathed workhouse for the homeless poor.

But they are not alone.

Deep in the distant future, Catherine will expose this property’s appalling truths. She will prompt a national reckoning that will leave the people of Ireland asking themselves: Who were we? Who are we?

At the moment, though, she is only a child. She is walking home to a father tending to the cattle and a mother guarding a secret, away from the Irish town whose very name conjures the buried dead.

Ritual and Remembrance

In Ireland, the departed stay present.

You might still come across old-timers who recall how families in rural stretches would clean the house and set out a drink on the first night of November — the eve of All Souls’ Day — in the belief that the dead will return. How it was best to stay in the center of the road when walking at night, so as not to disturb the spirits resting along the wayside.

Even today, the Irish say they do death well. Local radio newscasts routinely end with a recitation of death notices. In a country where the culture of Catholicism, if not its practice, still holds sway, this alerts the community to a familiar ritual: the wake at the home, the funeral Mass, the long gathering at the pub, the memorial Mass a month later, and the anniversary Mass every year thereafter.

Wry acceptance of mortality lives in the country’s songs, literature, and wit. A standard joke is the Irish marriage proposal: “Would you like to be buried with my people?” A standard song describes a thrown bottle splattering whiskey – from the Irish for “water of life” — over a corpse. Thus the late Tim Finnegan is revived at his wake; see how he rises.

Respect for burial grounds runs deep, with crowds gathering in their local cemetery once a year to pray as a priest blesses the dead within. This reverence for the grave may derive from centuries of land dispossession, or passed-on memories of famine corpses in the fields and byways, or simply be linked to a basic desire expressed by the planting of a headstone:

To be remembered.

Some 60 years have passed since Catherine’s primary school days. It is a gloomy June afternoon, and she is walking the grounds once hidden behind those shard-studded walls. As rain falls from the crow-flecked sky, she drapes her black jacket over her head, almost like a shawl.

Her name now is Catherine Corless, née Farrell. At 63, she is a grandmother with a smile not easily given, and any fealty to Catholicism long since lost.

True, she occasionally volunteers to paint the weathered statues outside the local country churches: the blue of the Blessed Virgin’s eyes, the bronze in St. Patrick’s beard. But this is for the community, not the church. She finds deeper meaning in her garden, in the birds at the feeder outside her kitchen window, in the earth here at her feet.

Few photographs exist of the grim building that once loomed over this corner of Tuam (pronounced Chewm), perhaps because few desired the memory. In its place stand drab rows of subsidized housing and a modest playground. A silvery swing set, a yellow slide, a jungle gym.

One day, a few years back, Catherine began to inquire about the old home that had stoked her schoolgirl imagination. She set out on an amateur’s historical quest, but whenever she focused on the children who lived there, so many questions arose about the children who died there — the ones who never made it to the classroom, or even past infancy.

What, then, of Patrick Derrane, who died at five months in 1925, and Mary Carty, at five months in 1960, and all those in between, children said to have been “born on the other side of the blanket”? The Bridgets and Noras and Michaels and Johns, and so many Marys, so many Patricks, their surnames the common language of Ireland.

Would people pause at their graves? Would they be remembered?

In asking around, what Catherine heard was:

Ah, them poor children. Them poor children.

The more she dug, the more a distant time and place was revealed. Now, standing on the sodden grass, she can nearly see and hear all that was. The polished halls and bustling dormitories, the babies’ nappies and nuns’ habits, the shouts, the whimpers, the murmur of prayer.

‘Waiting for the Crucifixion’

The women and their newborns often arrived after the inquisitive streetlamps of Tuam had dimmed. They came from towns and crossroads with names like snatches of song. Portumna and Peterswell, Claremorris and Lettermore, Moylough and Loughrea.

And now they were here at the St. Mary’s Mother and Baby Home, a massive building the color of storm clouds, a way station for 50 single mothers and 125 children born out of wedlock.

The building opened in 1846 as a workhouse, but almost immediately it began receiving victims of the Great Hunger, a famine so horrific that the moans of the dying, The Tuam Herald reported, were “as familiar to our ears as the striking of the clock.” It later became a military barracks, serving the new Irish government formed after a treaty between Irish rebels and Great Britain in 1921. One spring morning during the civil war that followed, six prisoners — republicans who disagreed with concessions in the treaty — were marched into the yard and executed against the ashen wall.

The government repurposed the building to be among the institutions intended as ports of salvation where disgraced women might be redeemed. These state-financed homes were invariably managed by a Catholic order, in keeping with the hand-in-glove relationship between the dominant church and the fledgling state.

Given the misogyny, morality, and economics that informed the public debate of the time — when a pregnancy out of wedlock could threaten a family’s plans for land inheritance, and even confer dishonor upon a local pastor — imagine that naïve young woman from the country: impregnated by a man, sometimes a relative, who would assume little of the shame and none of the responsibility. She might flee to England, or pretend that the newborn was a married sister’s — or be shipped to the dreaded Tuam home, run by a religious order with French roots called the Congregation of Sisters of Bon Secours.

Their motto: “Good Help to Those in Need.”

You rose early and went down to the nursery with your infant. Mass at 8, then porridge and tea for breakfast. Breast feeding next, after which you rinsed your child’s diapers before moving on to your daily drudgery. You might polish the dormitory floors with beeswax or clean bedsheets stained with urine.

“An awful lonely ould hole,” recalled Julia Carter Devaney.

Born in a workhouse and left in the care of the Bon Secours, Julia became an employee who lived in the home for almost 40 years. Although she died in 1985, her rare insight into this insulated world — one she described as “unnatural” — lives on in taped interviews.

The gates remained unlocked to accommodate deliveries, but so powerful was the sense of cultural imprisonment that you dared not leave. Save for the chance gift of a cake from the bread man, you starved for love or consolation over the loss of your innocent courting days.

“Many a girl shed tears,” Julia said.

The Bon Secours sisters who watched your every move were doing the bidding of Irish society. They, too, existed in a repressive patriarchy with few options for women. They might have experienced a spiritual calling as a young girl, or simply desired not to be a farmer’s wife, having seen overworked mothers forever pregnant, forever fretting. A vocation offered education, safety and status, all reflected in clean, freshly pressed habits.

And Julia remembered them all.

Mother Hortense had a big heart, yet was quick to punish; Mother Martha was more enlightened, but a thump from her could “put you into the middle of next week.” This one hated the mere sight of children, while that one used kindness the way others used the rod. So it went.

The sisters frequently threatened banishment to the mental asylum in Ballinasloe, or to one of the Magdalen Laundries: institutions where women perceived to be susceptible or errant — including “second offenders” who had become pregnant again — were often sent to work, and sometimes die, in guilt-ridden servitude.

You preferred instead to suffer at the mother and baby home, bracing for that day when, after a year or so of penitent confinement, you were forced to leave — almost always without your child. Waiting for that moment of separation, Julia recalled, was “like Our Lady waiting for the Crucifixion.”

Typical is the story of one unmarried woman who had been sent to the home from a remote Galway farm. Determined to remain close to her child, she took a job as a cleaner at a nearby hospital and, for several years, she appeared at the home’s door on her day off every week to say the same thing:

That’s my son you have in there. I want my son. I want to rear him.

No, would come the answer. And the door would close.

For the children left behind, there were swings and seesaws and donated Christmas gifts from town, but no grandparents and cousins coming around to coo. They lived amid the absence of affection and the ever-present threat of infectious disease.

“Like chickens in a coop,” Julia said.

Many survivors have only the sketchiest memories of those days, a haze of bed-wetting and rocking oneself to sleep. One man, now in his 70s, remembers being taken for a walk with other home babies, and the excitement of seeing themselves in the side-view mirrors of parked cars.

“We didn’t even know it was a reflection of ourselves in the mirror,” he recalled. “And we were laughing at ourselves. Laughing.”

Until they were adopted, sent to a training school or boarded out to a family, the older children walked to one of the two primary schools along the Dublin Road, some of them calling out “daddy” and “mammy” to strangers in the street. Shabby and betraying signs of neglect, they sat at the back of the classroom, apart.

“I never remember them really being taught,” Catherine said. “They were just there.”

Teachers threatened to place rowdy students beside the home babies. Parents warned children that if they were bad they’d go right to “the home.” And even though the babies were baptized as a matter of routine, there remained the hint of sulfur about them.

“They were the children of the Devil,” recalled Kevin O’Dwyer, 67, a retired principal who grew up just yards from the home. “We learned this in school.”

Still, when a bully targeted a young Kevin during one recess, the child who came to his rescue was a home baby. You leave him alone, the older girl warned. I see you doing that to him again, I’ll get ya.

The man has never forgotten his protector’s name: Mary Curran.

One September day in 1961, a rare and ferocious hurricane howled across Ireland, downing power lines, destroying barley fields, battering cottages. As gales flicked away slates from the roof above, Julia helped lock the doors of the mother and baby home for good. Its conditions were poor, some of its staff untrained, and County Galway officials decided not to proceed with a planned renovation.

Abandoned, the massive H-block building devolved into an echoing, eerie playscape, where games of hide-and-seek unfolded in dull halls once polished with beeswax. Even the old chapel became a place where children became the priests and confessors. “Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I shot Brother Whatever,” Kevin recalled. “That kind of thing.”

The years passed. Galway County moved forward with plans to demolish the home and build subsidized housing. And the memories of hobnailed pitter-patter faded, replaced by the faint sounds of children outracing the home baby ghosts that inhabited the property at night.

In Pain, Finding Purpose

Catherine still wonders what led her to the story of the mother and baby home. Chance, perhaps, or distant memories of the little girl she once teased. Despite her bone-deep modesty, there are even times when she feels chosen.

She thinks back to her solitary childhood, her best friend a dog she called “Puppy,” her time spent navigating the sadness that enveloped her mother. She admired the woman’s deep empathy for others, but was puzzled by her refusal to say much about her own people back in County Armagh, a good 140 miles northeast of Tuam. Sure they’re all dead and gone, is all she’d say, and God help you if you pried much further.

“A troubled soul,” her daughter said.

Catherine graduated from secondary school, left a Galway art college for fear of lacking the necessary talent, and found satisfaction as a receptionist. In 1978, she married Aidan Corless, a man as gregarious as she was shy, a fine singer, nimble on the accordion, comfortable on the community theater stage.

Four children quickly followed. Before long, Catherine was minding the children of neighbors as well, immersing herself in the homework, play and exuberance of the young.

Her mother, Kathleen, died at 80 in 1992, leaving behind so much unsaid. Catherine eventually headed up to Armagh to examine public records that might explain why her mother had been so withholding, so unsettled.

As if part of some cosmic riddle, the answer was provided in the absence of one. On her mother’s birth certificate, in the space reserved for the name of the father: nothing.

Her mother had been conceived out of wedlock.

Other telltale strands to the woman’s early years came to be known: Fostered out, moving from family to family before finding work as a domestic. Then harboring until death a secret she found shameful enough to keep from her husband.

“That she went through her life, that she didn’t like telling us,” Catherine said. “That she was ashamed to tell us…”

In this patch of pain and regret, a seed was planted.

The revelations about her mother fueled in Catherine an interest in understanding the forces that shape who we are and how we behave. While attending a rigorous night course in local history, she learned an invaluable lesson:

“If you don’t find something, you don’t leave it. You ask why it’s not there. You use ‘why’ a lot.”

With the children grown, Catherine began contributing essays to the journal of the Old Tuam Society about local history, all the while grappling with debilitating headaches and anxiety attacks. The episodes might last for days, with the only relief at times coming from lying on the floor, still, away from light.

Burrowing deep into the past, though, provided welcome distraction, and at some point she chose to delve into the subject of the old mother and baby home: its beginnings as a workhouse, its place in Tuam history, the usual. Nothing deep.

But there were almost no extant photographs of the home, and most of the locals were reluctant to talk. Every question Catherine raised led to another, the fullness of truth never quite within reach. Why, for example, did one corner of the property feature a well-manicured grotto centered around a statue of the Blessed Virgin?

Oh that, a few neighbors said. A while back an older couple created the peaceful space to mark where two local lads once found some bones in a concrete pit. Famine victims, maybe.

The story made no sense to Catherine. The famine dead weren’t buried that way.

Who were these boys? What did they see?

Frannie Hopkins was about 9, Barry Sweeney, about 7. The two were at the fledgling stage of boyhood mischief as they monkeyed around some crab apple trees, all within view of the deserted home that figured in their fertile imagination.

Some evenings, Frannie’s father would delay his pint at the Thatch Bar, at the top of the town, until he had watched his son race down the Athenry Road, dodging ghosts from the old home to his left and the cemetery to his right, all the way to the family’s door. But on this autumn day in the early 1970s, the boys were daring in the daylight.

Jumping into some overgrowth at the property’s southwest corner, they landed on a concrete slab that echoed in answer. Curious, they pushed aside the lid to reveal a shallow, tank-like space containing a gruesome jumble of skulls and bones.

Frannie nudge-bumped Barry, and the younger lad fell in. He started to cry, as any boy would, so Frannie pulled him out and then the two boys were running away, laughing in fun or out of fright. They told everyone they met, prompting Frannie’s father to say he’d get a right kick in the arse if he went back to that spot.

County workers soon arrived to level that corner of the property. The police said they were only famine bones. A priest said a prayer. And that was that.

In adulthood, Barry Sweeney would go to England to find work, and Frannie Hopkins would travel the world as an Irish soldier. Both would return to Tuam, where their shared story would come up now and then in the pub or on the street.

People would tell them they were either mistaken or lying. Barry would become upset that anyone would doubt a story that had so affected him, but Frannie would take pains to reassure him.

Barry, he would say. The truth will out.

The Marys, Patricks and Johns

Now, 40 years later, here was Catherine Corless, amateur historian, trying to unearth that truth, applying what she had learned in her community center research class: Use “why” a lot.

When her headaches and panic attacks eased, she pored over old newspapers in a blur of microfilm. She spent hours studying historic maps in the special collections department of the library at the national university in Galway City. One day she copied a modern map of Tuam on tracing paper and placed it over a town map from 1890.

And there it was, in the cartographic details from another time: A tank for the home’s old septic system sat precisely where the two boys had made their ghastly discovery. It was part of the Victorian-era system’s warren of tunnels and chambers, all of which had been disconnected in the late 1930s.

Did this mean, then, that the two lads had stumbled upon the bones of home babies? Buried in an old sewage area?

“I couldn’t understand it,” Catherine said. “The horror of the idea.”

Acting on instinct, she purchased a random sample from the government of 200 death certificates for children who had died at the home. Then, sitting at the Tuam cemetery’s edge in the van of its caretaker, she checked those death certificates against all the burials recorded by hand in two oversize books.

Only two children from the home had been buried in the town graveyard. Both were orphans, both “legitimate.”

Neither the Bon Secours order nor the county council could explain the absence of burial records for home babies, although it was suggested that relatives had probably claimed the bodies to bury in their own family plots. Given the ostracizing stigma attached at the time to illegitimacy, Catherine found this absurd.

In December 2012, Catherine’s essay, titled “The Home,” appeared in the historical journal of Tuam. After providing a general history of the facility, it laid out the results of her research, including the missing burial records and the disused septic tank where two boys had stumbled upon some bones.

“Is it possible that a large number of those little children were buried in that little plot at the rear of the former Home?” she wrote. “And if so, why is it not acknowledged as a proper cemetery?”

She also shared her own memories, including that joke she and a classmate had played on two home babies long ago. “I thought it funny at the time how those little girls hungrily grabbed the empty sweet papers, but the memory of it now haunts me,” she wrote.

Her daring essay implicitly raised a provocative question: Had Catholic nuns, working in service of the state, buried the bodies of hundreds of children in the septic system?

Catherine braced for condemnation from government and clergy — but none came. It was as if she had written nothing at all.

There was a time when Catherine wanted only to have a plaque erected in memory of these forgotten children. But now she felt that she owed them much more. “No one cared,” she said. “And that’s my driving force all the time: No one cared.”

She kept digging, eventually paying for another spreadsheet that listed the names, ages, and death dates of all the “illegitimate” children who had died in the home during its 36-year existence.

The sobering final tally: 796.

Five-month-old Patrick Derrane was the first to die, from gastroenteritis. Weeks later, Mary Blake, less than 4 months old and anemic since birth. A month after that, 3-month-old Matthew Griffin, of meningitis. Then James Murray, fine one moment, dead the next. He was 4 weeks old.

In all, seven children died at the mother and baby home in 1925, the year it opened. The holidays were especially tough, with 11-month-old Peter Lally dying of intestinal tuberculosis on Christmas Day, and 1-year-old Julia Hynes dying the next day, St. Stephen’s Day, after a three-month bout of bronchitis.

Measles. Influenza. Gastroenteritis. Meningitis. Whooping cough. Tuberculosis. Severe undernourishment, also known as marasmus.

Nine home babies died in 1930. Eleven in 1931. Twenty-four in 1932. Thirty-two in 1933.

The Tuam home was not alone. Children born out of wedlock during this period were nearly four times more likely to die than “legitimate” children, with those in institutions at particular risk. The reasons may be many — poor prenatal care, insufficient government funding, little or no training of staff – but this is certain: It was no secret.

In 1934, the Irish parliament was informed of the inordinate number of deaths among this group of children. “One must come to the conclusion that they are not looked after with the same care and attention as that given to ordinary children,” a public health official said.

Thirty died in the Tuam home that year.

In 1938, it was 26. In 1940, 34. In 1944, 40.

In 1947, a government health inspector filed a report describing the conditions of infants in the nursery: “a miserable emaciated child…delicate…occasional fits…emaciated and delicate…fragile abscess on hip…not thriving wizened limbs emaciated…pot-bellied emaciated…a very poor baby…”

That year, 52 died.

Catherine felt obligated to these children. Continuing to plumb the depths of the past, she eventually cross-checked her spreadsheet of 796 deceased home babies with the burial records of cemeteries throughout counties Galway and Mayo. Not one match.

“They’re not in the main Tuam graveyard where they should have been put initially,” she remembers thinking. “They’re not in their mothers’ hometown graveyards. Where are they?”

Catherine, of course, already knew.

The Truth Outs, a Nation Reels

Catherine lives simply, almost monastically. She favors practical clothing, usually black, and has never been one for a night at the pub. She doesn’t drink alcohol or eat meat. Give her a bowl of muesli at the kitchen table and she’ll be grand.

Those headaches and anxiety attacks, though, remain a part of her withdrawn life. Aidan, her husband, has become accustomed to attending wakes and weddings by himself. A few years ago, he booked a Mediterranean cruise for two; he traveled alone.

“A very quiet, introverted person, wrapped up in her own thoughts,” Aidan said of his wife. “Suffering, if you like.”

But thoughts of the dead children of Tuam pushed Catherine beyond her fears. Believing that the body of even one “legitimate” baby found in a septic tank would have prompted an outcry, she suspected that the silence met by her essay spoke to a reluctance to revisit the painful past — a past that had consumed her own mother.

Now she was angry.

Adding to her fury was the knowledge that when a Tuam hospital run by the Bon Secours closed in 2002, the religious order disinterred the bodies of a dozen nuns and reinterred them in consecrated ground outside the nearby pilgrimage town of Knock.

“I feel it at times: that those poor little souls were crying out for recognition, a recognition they never got in their little, short lives,” Catherine said. “It was a wrong that just had to be righted some way.”

Seeing no other option, she contacted a reporter for The Irish Mail on Sunday, a national newspaper. Not long after, in the spring of 2014, a front-page story appeared about a certain seven acres in Tuam.

It became the talk of Ireland.

All who had been quiet before — the clerics, politicians and government officials — now conveyed shock and sadness, while the besieged Bon Secours sisters hired a public relations consultant whose email to a documentarian did little for the religious order’s reputation:

“If you come here, you’ll find no mass grave, no evidence that children were ever so buried and a local police force casting their eyes to heaven and saying ‘Yeah, a few bones were found — but this was an area where Famine victims were buried. So?’”

The news from Tuam had shocked many in the country, but the dismissive email reflected the lurking doubts about Catherine’s work. She was, after all, only a housewife.

Mary Moriarty was getting her light-blond hair done at a salon in Tuam one day when the beauty-parlor chatter turned to this troublemaker Catherine Corless.

The entire matter should be forgotten and put behind us, someone said.

Mary, a grandmother well known in town for her advocacy work, would have none of it.

Well, she said. Every child is entitled to their name, and their mothers could be any one of us but for the grace of God.

She left the salon, introduced herself by telephone to Catherine, and recounted a story that she rarely shared.

In 1975, Mary was a young married mother living in one of the new subsidized houses built on the old mother and baby home property. One morning, close to Halloween, a neighbor told her that a boy was running about with a skull on a stick.

The boy, Martin, said he had found his prize in the overgrown muck, and there were loads more.

What the boy mistook for a plastic toy was actually the skull of a child, with a nearly complete set of teeth. “That’s not plastic, Martin,” Mary recalled saying. “You have to put it back where you found it.”

Mary and a couple of neighbors followed the boy through the weeds and rubble, across the soft wet ground. Suddenly, the earth beneath her feet began to give, and down she fell into some cave or tunnel, with just enough light to illuminate the subterranean scene.

As far as she could see were little bundles stacked one on top of another, like packets in a grocery, each about the size of a large soda bottle and wrapped tight in graying cloth.

When her friends pulled her up, Mary’s legs were scratched and her mind was on fire. What had she seen? That very morning, she reached out to a person in town who might know. Soon a stout older woman arrived on a bicycle, her faithful dogs trotting by her side.

Julia Carter Devaney, who used to work at the home.

“Ah, yeah, that’s where the little babies is,” Mary recalled her saying as she came to a stop.

Julia bent down at the hole and peered in. Mary never forgot what the older woman said next: “Many a little one I carried out in the nighttime.”

Mary did not know what to make of this. Perhaps these were the bodies of stillborns – and therefore unbaptized. Stillborns. Yes, that’s what they must be.

Eighteen months after falling into the hole, Mary gave birth to her son Kevin at a Tuam hospital run by the Bon Secours sisters. After breakfast, a nun presented her with her newborn, who was swathed like a little mummy. The young mother’s mind instantly recalled those stacks of graying bundles, and straightaway she unwrapped her precious child.

Now, after listening to the woman’s tale, Catherine asked whether Mary would be willing to tell her story on national radio.

Of course.

The Dead and the Living

The veteran geophysicist guided her mower-like contraption over the thick grass, back and forth across a carefully measured grid. Equipped with ground-penetrating radar, the machine sent radio waves through the topsoil and down into the dark earth.

The curious machine was hunting for secrets concealed in the ground of the old mother and baby home, all beneath the gaze of a statue of the Blessed Virgin.

This subterranean trawling was being conducted on an early autumn day in 2015 for the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, a panel created by an embarrassed government in response to Catherine’s research. Its charge: to examine a once-accepted way of Irish life in all its social and historical complexity.

The commission’s investigation into the homes — a network that by the late 1970s was falling into disuse — is focused on 18 institutions scattered across Ireland: in the capital city of Dublin, and in Counties Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kilkenny, Meath, Tipperary and Westmeath. The high infant mortality rate in some of these facilities was startling. In the Bessborough home in Cork, 478 children died from 1934 to 1953 — or about one death every two weeks.

The investigation’s broad mandate also includes scrutiny of the network’s links to the notorious Magdalen Laundries. The apparent coercion of unmarried mothers to surrender their children for adoption, often to Catholic Americans. The vaccine trials carried out on mother-and-baby-home children for pharmaceutical companies. The use of home-baby remains for anatomical study at medical colleges.

It was all part of a church-state arrangement that, decades earlier, a longtime government health inspector named Alice Litster had repeatedly denounced, mostly to silence. This system marginalized defenseless Irish women, she asserted, and turned their unfortunate offspring into “infant martyrs of convenience, respectability, and fear.”

The Tuam case incited furious condemnation of a Catholic Church already weakened by a litany of sexual abuse scandals. Others countered that the sisters of Bon Secours had essentially been subcontractors of the Irish state.

But laying the blame entirely on the church or the state seemed too simple — perhaps even too convenient. After all, many of these abandoned children had fathers and grandparents and aunts and uncles.

The bitter truth was that the mother and baby homes mirrored the Mother Ireland of the time.

As its investigation continued, the commission would occasionally provide cryptic updates of its work in Tuam. In September 2016, for example, it announced that forensic archaeologists would be digging trenches to resolve questions “in relation to the interment of human remains.”

While she waited for the commission to complete its work, the woman responsible for this national self-examination, Catherine Corless, returned in a way to those days when her children and the children of neighbors packed the house. Only now the ones gathering about her were in their 60s and 70s, with hair of silver.

Home babies.

Often lost in the uproar over the many children who died at the Tuam home were the stories of those who had survived. And once Catherine’s research became international news, they began calling and emailing her, seeing in this introverted woman their only hope of trying to find out who their mothers were, who their siblings were — who they were.

Catherine assumed the role of pro bono private detective, following paper trails that often led to some cemetery in England, where many unmarried mothers had gone to start anew. The children they were separated from, she said, needed to hear that their mother had “fared all right.”

Before long, some of these survivors were gathering at the Corless house for a cup of tea and a chat. In their habits and manners of speech, they reminded Catherine of someone close to her who also had been born out of wedlock.

“They all have a kind of low self-esteem,” she said. “They feel inadequate. They feel a bit inferior to other people. It mirrored, really, the way my mother was.”

During her research, Catherine had built a detailed, wood-and-clay model of the home, large enough to cover a dining-room table. It had helped her to visualize.

Now she and Aidan would occasionally remove the model from a high shelf in the barn out back so that survivors could do the same. They would touch the gray walls and peer into the small windows, as if to imagine themselves in the arms of their mothers.

P. J. Haverty, a retired mechanic, sat at the Corless kitchen table one day, sipping tea and eating a ham-and-butter sandwich. He was born in 1951, the son of a 27-year-old woman who had been left at the home by her father when she was eight months pregnant. Eileen was her name, and she seemed to vanish a year after giving birth.

The white-haired man remembers only a few snapshot moments of the home. Wetting the bed mattresses that would then be propped against the window to dry. Seeing himself for the first time in a car’s side-view mirror. Walking out the door with his new foster parents, the father choosing him because he looked sturdy for farm work, the mother because he had smiled at her.

P. J. was happy enough until his teens, when he was called a “bastard,” and people avoided the pew he sat in, and girls at a dance tittered at the sight of him. “If the parents found out,” he said, “they’d tell them to keep away from that lad, you don’t know where he came from.”

He considered drowning himself in the fast-moving river that coursed through his foster father’s field. “The things that I was called,” he said. “I just thought everyone was against me.”

Thanks to a hint dropped here, a secret whispered there, P. J. managed in adulthood to locate his birth mother in South London. Plump and with graying hair, she reassured him that she hadn’t abandoned him. After leaving the Tuam home, she had taken a cleaning job at a nearby hospital and, for more than five years, returned every week to demand that she be given back her child — only to be turned away at the door.

P. J.’s voice caught as he recalled what his mother, now dead, had said she told the nuns to no avail.

“That’s my son you have in there. I want to rear him. I want to look after him.”

‘Chamber of Horrors’

It was true.

In early March of this year, the Mother and Baby Homes Commission reported that “significant quantities of human remains” had been discovered on the grounds of the Tuam home.

The ground-penetrating radar and delicate excavation had revealed what appeared to be a decommissioned septic tank. And in 17 of that septic system’s 20 chambers, investigators found many human bones. A small sampling revealed that they were of children, ranging in age from 35 fetal weeks to three years, and all dating from the home’s 36 years of operation.

Expressing shock, the commission vowed to continue its investigation into “who was responsible for the disposal of human remains in this way.”

Once again, Ireland’s past had returned to haunt.

His voice trembling with passion, the prime minister, Enda Kenny, addressed the Irish legislature on what he called the “chamber of horrors” discovered in Tuam. In the “so-called good old days,” he said, Irish society “did not just hide away the dead bodies of tiny human beings.”

“We dug deep and we dug deeper still,” he said. “To bury our compassion, to bury our mercy, to bury our humanity itself.”

Though the prime minister said that “no nuns broke into our homes to kidnap our children,” others directed their wrath at the Catholic Church and, of course, the Bon Secours order, whose only response so far has been to express its “continued cooperation and support” for the commission’s work.

The Corless household, meanwhile, became an international newsroom, with family members fielding the constant telephone calls and accommodating the television crews forever at the door. Catherine answered every question out of duty, not vanity. But when Ireland’s most popular television program, “The Late Late Show,” invited her to appear as a guest, she balked.

There was her ever-present anxiety, which now limited her driving to little more than weekly five-mile runs to the SuperValu grocery in Tuam. More than that, she feared being accused of self-aggrandizement at the expense of dead children.

With her family all but demanding that she accept — Imagine how many home-baby survivors, suffering in silence, might be reached — Catherine reluctantly consented, but only if she would already be seated when the program returned from a commercial break. She did not want to be summoned from the curtain to unwanted applause.

Aidan drove her into Galway City to buy an outfit: black pants and a black top, of course, brightened slightly with a silver trim. Then up to Dublin.

“I was a mess,” Catherine recalled. “But I said: ‘This is it. I have to do it.’”

When she finished telling the story of the Tuam home on live television, the audience rose in what the host described as a very rare standing ovation. Catherine nodded, smiled slightly, tightly, and exhaled. Watching on a monitor in an adjacent room, her husband fought back tears.

“I’m married to her for 40 years,” he said later, still astonished. “And I don’t know her at all.”

Catherine’s Final Quest

Photographs of grandchildren adorn the tan walls. A silver kettle rests on the stove. A laptop computer sits open on the counter, beside a window that looks out on a garden, a bird feeder and, beyond, an undulating field of grass.

This is the kitchen of Catherine Corless, and her office. She conducts her online research here, and keeps assorted documents on the kitchen table for easy retrieval when yet another call comes in. Can you help me find my mother, my sister, my… She never refuses.

The future of the Tuam grounds that her questioning disturbed has yet to be revealed. The government is grappling with many complexities, including the sad fact that the remains of infants and children, the Marys and Patricks, the Bridgets and Johns, are commingled.

One option is to leave everything as is. Another is to disinter the remains for possible identification and proper burial — although it is unclear whether DNA evidence can be recovered from those who died so young, and so long ago.

Other issues also need resolution. Potential compensation for home baby survivors; litigation against the Bon Secours sisters, who run a vast health-care network; the propriety of children playing above the bones of other children.

And there remains the maddening mystery of why a Catholic order of nuns would bury these children in such a manner. Was it to save a few pounds for the cost of each burial? Was it meant as a kind of catacombs, in echo of the order’s French roots?

The baptism of these children entitled them under canon law to a funeral Mass and burial in consecrated ground. But perhaps the baptismal cleansing of their “original sin” was not enough to also wipe away the shameful nature of their conception. Perhaps, having been born out of wedlock in an Ireland of another time, they simply did not matter.

Her auburn hair cut short, Catherine stands now at her computer, gazing through the window at the garden that blesses her with a sense of oneness with it all. Her begonias are blood-red bursts, her lobelias the bluest of blue, her mind forever returning to the past.

A candy wrapper. Empty.

She has searched school and government records many, many times. So far, though, she has been unable to find the name of one particular little girl from the mother and baby home, her long-ago classmate.

“It would be nice to meet her,” Catherine says, leaving no doubt as to what she would say if given the chance.",The Lost Children of Tuam,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/28/world/europe/tuam-ireland-babies-children.html

Those who have heard Mr. Trump’s message that insurance premiums are way up may not realize that the subsidies that help low- and middle-income Americans pay those premiums will rise as well.

The enrollment period for the federal marketplace has been cut in half, to 45 days, with hardly any publicity by federal officials. No one is sure how well government call centers and computer systems will handle the expected surge of applications leading up to the Dec. 15 deadline for people to enroll through HealthCare.gov.

In Washington and across the nation, supporters of the law are doing what they can to combat misperceptions.

“Consumers are unclear whether the marketplaces still exist, whether they still have an obligation to get coverage, whether the mandate exists, whether they can get financial assistance,” said Kelley Turek, a policy analyst at America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group. “Our message is: Come back. The marketplaces are still here.”

Here in Georgia, what had been the largest navigator group, Insure Georgia, lost 86 percent of its $2.3 million federal grant and had to lay off half its staff, leaving Mr. Branch and 10 other counselors to provide enrollment assistance for all 159 counties in the state. Humana is leaving the insurance marketplace here, and while three other insurers will remain, all but 10 counties will have a single company selling coverage for next year. Rates for popular silver-level “benchmark” plans are rising by 47 percent on average here, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, although most customers will qualify for subsidies that will grow by a similar amount. The department found that premiums for benchmark plans are increasing by 37 percent nationwide, compared with 24 percent last year.

Other types of plans may be less expensive, because to compensate for the funds they will lose now that Mr. Trump has ended the cost-sharing payments, insurers have generally raised the price of silver plans more than those in the bronze, gold and platinum categories. As a result, some gold plans will now be less expensive than some silver plans, even though gold plans cover more of the costs of a typical consumer.

Sorting through these complications will be difficult for many consumers.

At a Halloween “safety expo” at Coliseum Medical Centers here on Saturday, several hundred parents and children filed past an Insure Georgia table by the front door, where Amber Higgins, another navigator, asked over and over, “Do y’all have health insurance? You know anyone who’s doing without it?”

“My niece who just moved here from Ohio,” said one woman, taking a flier.

“My sister in Texas,” said another.

“Me,” said yet another woman, scanning the income requirements for receiving subsidies, which Ms. Higgins had placed in a frame.

The response was not surprising. Georgia has the nation’s fourth-highest number of uninsured residents, after Texas, California and Florida. In some of the state’s rural counties, enrollment under the Affordable Care Act dropped by as much as 36 percent this year, according to a new report, which pointed to the diminishing choice of insurers in rural areas as a likely reason.

Briana Zoellick, 26, told Ms. Higgins she had checked the HealthCare.gov website when it started allowing people to preview their options last week and was astonished to learn that her family’s subsidy would be a lot bigger next year even though their income has risen. Ms. Zoellick, a medical assistant and mother of two, said she and her husband, a graphic designer, canceled their coverage earlier this year because they could not afford their portion of the premium, about $140 a month.

Next year, she has learned, their subsidy will rise to more than $800, from $650 — “incredible,” she said — and their share will be less than before.

Yet Ms. Zoellick said her husband remained wary of signing up because of everything he had heard about Mr. Trump ending the payments to insurers. Many customers are mistakenly assuming that what he is blocking is premium subsidies, which are separate and not affected by Mr. Trump’s action.

“He was like, ‘I don’t know if that’s going to actually happen because of what Trump’s doing,’ ” Ms. Zoellick said, referring to their higher subsidy.

The California marketplace, run by an independent state agency, is spending $111 million on advertising, more than 10 times as much as the federal government intends to spend for the entire country. The New York marketplace, run by the state Health Department, is spending $15 million.

“Despite attempts at the federal level to take health care from New Yorkers, our marketplace is ready to open Nov. 1 as strong as ever,” said Donna Frescatore, the executive director of the New York insurance marketplace. “For many consumers, prices in 2018 will be the same as this year, or lower for the same level plan.”

In some states that run their own insurance exchanges, consumers will have more time to sign up. The deadline is Jan. 14 in Minnesota, Jan. 15 in Washington State and Jan. 31 in California and New York.

While many consumers will have fewer choices and will face higher premiums next year, the situation varies greatly from state to state.

In Tulsa, Okla., seven health plans will be available, all from one company. For the most popular plans, the average premium for a 35-year-old will be about $560 a month, according to HealthCare.gov. In Phoenix, consumers will have a choice of five plans, all from one company. For the two popular silver plans, premiums for a 35-year-old average $470 a month.

Mike Kreidler, the insurance commissioner in Washington State, approved rate increases averaging 36 percent last week, and he attributed 10 percentage points of the increase to Mr. Trump’s decision to cut off the subsidies known as cost-sharing reduction payments.

“I fear that many will go uninsured,” Mr. Kreidler said, while noting that some plans would not be affected by the president’s action.

In Macon next year, 13 plans will be available, all from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia. A 50-year-old woman with income of $30,000 will be eligible for a subsidy of $597 a month. That subsidy would lower her premium to an average of $236 a month for silver plans and $77 a month for bronze plans, according to HealthCare.gov.

But for a 50-year-old woman in Macon with annual income of $50,000, costs would be much higher. She would not be eligible for financial assistance and would have to pay $768 a month — more than 18 percent of her income — for the cheapest silver plan. Prices in rural southwest Georgia and a few other parts of the state will be even higher, although in Atlanta they will be lower.

For Pat and John Curry of Augusta, who are both 57 and own a small coffee-roasting business, options will range next year from a bronze plan for $1,526 a month with a $13,500 family deductible to a gold plan for $3,142 a month and a $3,900 family deductible. Blue Cross is the only insurer selling in their county. The couple, who each have chronic conditions and take multiple daily medications, said they would research whether buying a plan directly from Blue Cross would be cheaper.

Ms. Curry will also consider buying coverage only for her husband, who is getting follow-up care for cancer.

Back Story

Have you ever gotten a job without the qualifications?

It happened to Michelangelo, a sculptor by trade, who painted the ceiling in the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican, unveiled to the public on this day in 1512.

Photo

Commissioned by Pope Julius II, Michelangelo’s ceiling, about 130 feet long and 45 feet wide, took four years to paint. (You can take a virtual tour here.)

Believing he was being set up to fail, Michelangelo was paranoid at the beginning and a physical wreck by the end, writing a poem that began:

I’ve already grown a goiter from this torture

hunched up here like a cat in Lombardy

(or anywhere else where the stagnant water’s poison).

The centerpiece is the Creation of Adam, one of nine scenes from the biblical Book of Genesis.

The frescoes have required only one restoration in the modern era, in the 1980s and ’90s, but the effect of more than five million visitors a year is causing concern.

The work’s popularity is understandable. As the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe noted, “Without having seen the Sistine Chapel, one can form no appreciable idea of what one man is capable of achieving.”

Thomas Furse contributed reporting.

The Reformation and its wars did indeed diminish religious authority, secularize politics and allow certain kinds of individualism to flourish. But they also empowered (and were exploited and worsened by) the great new gods of modernity, the almighty market and the centralizing state, which claimed their own kind of authority over everyday life, making the divided churches into handmaidens or scapegoats, and using Christianity as an excuse for plunder rather than a restraining counterforce to worldly lust.

This simultaneous expansion of commercial power and state power made the Western world more orderly and rationalized and much, much wealthier. It also licensed cruelty and repression on an often extraordinary scale. It produced some remarkable experiments in religious tolerance, our own Constitution among them. It also encouraged secular inquisitions that made the original look tame. It opened new opportunities for the rational and industrious. It also weakened or destroyed the places where one might retreat from commerce or refuse the world. It led to huge leaps forward in health and life expectancy for all. It also brutalized religious resisters, stacked non-European bodies like cordwood … and eventually revived the worst tendencies of the old Christendom, anti-Semitism and millenarianism, in fascist and Communist experiments that added the genocide of millions to the modern state’s list of crimes.

Even in our republic’s mother country, England, which escaped some of the worst horrors of the Continent, the Reformation’s religious conflict ended in victories for a brutal centralizing form of power. It was religious fanaticism that burned heretics and stripped altars and briefly raised up a Puritan theocracy. But the rapaciousness of Henry VIII and the police state of Elizabeth I, the evisceration of the old Catholic culture and the suppression of popular protest and dissent, the ethnic and religious cleansings carried out on England’s Celtic fringe — these were very modern projects, and their purpose wasn’t liberty but subjugation, not religious tolerance so much as the elimination of any religious challenge to the state.

In Hilary Mantel’s popular novels about Reformation England, “Wolf Hall” and “Bring Up the Bodies,” the figure of Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII’s enforcer, is presented as a sympathetic proto-modern alternative to the dueling zealotries of popery and Calvinism — more broad-minded and humane and secular, less bigoted and ascetic.

But Cromwell was also a ruthless killer who served a cruel tyrant. Which makes him an apt choice, even if Mantel does not intend it, to embody the secularizing forces that triumphed over Protestants as well as Catholics — because Cromwellism, mass murder in the service of secular power and commercial wealth, has just as strong a claim as liberty or individualism to define the world that succeeded Christendom’s collapse.

Here the objection will be that, yes, the road to modern liberalism was a bloody one, but it all could have been much worse. And indeed, worse could be imagined. It is possible to imagine a world where Western Christendom remained united but Europe refused the gifts of science and the church sank into permanent corruption, with Ottoman armies delivering a coup de grâce. It is also possible to imagine a world where an undivided Roman church harnessed science and technology to its own sort of religious-totalitarian ends, and became a theocratic boot stamping on a human face, forever.

So perhaps the modern world as we know it was the best we could do, the only path to liberty and pluralism and mass prosperity, however many Cromwells it required to get here.

But my own (biased, Catholic) guess is that given the technological and social changes already at work in early modern Europe, the great new modern powers, the state and the commercial interest, would have come to bestride the world no matter what happened to Christian unity. So a church that remained undivided probably wouldn’t have been able to strangle modern science or capitalism in the crib even had it wanted to. But it might have served as a stronger moral check on the new powers, a stronger countervailing force against greed and secular absolutism, than the divided churches that Europe had instead.

It is hard to read the history of Western colonial ventures, in which for hundreds of years it was mostly the intensely religious (as compromised and corrupted as their churches often were) that remonstrated against mass murder and enslavement, that sought to defend natives and establish norms for their protection, and not suspect that a still-united Western church would have found it easier to turn its moral critiques into more effective practical restraints. And it is harder still to read the history of the 20th century and have any kind of confidence that the world made by Thomas Cromwell and his successors was better than a world where Protestants and Catholics did not divide.

Indeed in secular liberalism there is an implicit tribute to this possibility, a kind of yearning for a vanished Christendom, that arose in part as a response to the horrifying place where secular politics ended up last century. What are our pan-national institutions, our United Nations and European Union, all our interlocking NGOs, if not an attempt to recreate a kind of ecclesiastical power, a churchlike form of sovereignty, on the basis of thinner, less dogmatic but still essentially metaphysical ideas — the belief in human dignity and human rights?

As the church did before its crackup, and might have done thereafter, these modern ecclesiastical agencies do have some gentling effect. But they are a made-up religion whose acolytes at some level know it — and the thinness of their metaphysics, their weak claim on human loyalties, makes them mostly just a pleasing cloak over the dark power that’s actually stabilized the modern world, the terrifying threat of nuclear war.

I’m being grim on purpose; more optimistic views than this are possible. But since the unity of Christendom isn’t coming back any time soon and our own society has a thousand incentives to lie to itself about how religious division was for the best, it’s worth considering the dark version of the long view.

The modern world offers many gifts, and the fact that Catholics and Protestants now dwell together without bloodshed is certainly one of them. But to assume that this division was a necessary means to a happy secular and liberal ending is to assume that we actually know the ending — even though the story so far has given us many novel forms of tyrannies as well as greater liberties, and the price of the modern experiment has been millions of unremembered dead.",Who Won the Reformation?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/opinion/protestant-reformation.html

She “stunned” at the Emmy awards, he writes, “in a red gown cut at the ankle with the most exquisite silver roping around the neckline.”

He reserves his barbs for the likes of Jane Fonda, ”the leftist actress,” who “in a faux, Beyoncé-esque ponytail looked like she had developed a classic case of ‘trying to be a teeny-bopper.’ Give it up, Jane.” Samantha Bee, “liberal Hollywood’s talk show darling,” fared no better, pretty much a train wreck, Mr. Binder writes, “a leprechaun in her shoulder-padded, emerald green ensemble.”

For Mr. Binder, 25, delivering tart commentary is all in a day’s work. He is the fashion critic for Breitbart News.

Yes, Breitbart has a fashion critic (!), a man who by his own account is uniquely cut out for the job. Mr. Binder has been following his twin passions, fashion and politics, since his student days at Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond, La. His professors were all too predictably liberal, he said in a phone conversation last week. Which left Mr. Binder, a contrarian by nature, to take an opposing position. “The university turned me into a total right-winger,” he said.

All the same, he remained enthralled by the celebrity culture that spoke to his more progressive peers. “I loved music, the whole punk rock era, all of those things,” he recalled, such attractions all the more compelling to a boy with a nose perpetually pressed to the glass.

“I don’t live this grand fabulous lifestyle,” said Mr. Binder, who was reared in Slidell, La., near New Orleans, the youngest of eight siblings in a family of moderate means. “I don’t come from a place of growing up in a grand apartment in the West Village, from a place of having the same opinion as everyone else.”

His opinions, as might be expected, are in line with those of his employer. At its founding a decade ago, Breitbart dedicated its ideologically right-leaning coverage to celebrity culture. “One of our governing principles,” said Alex Marlow, the site’s editor in chief, “is that culture is upstream from politics. Meaning that the culture in influencing our political climate more than our political climate is influencing the culture.”

Mr. Marlow, who hired Mr. Binder in April, would like those priorities reflected on the site’s home page. “I want people to go there and find something amusing,” he said, “and not regard it purely as a place where readers get outraged.”

The site attracts its audience through, among other things, Mr. Binder’s relentless — O.K., obsessive — monitoring of Mrs. Trump, a click magnet, Mr. Marlow noted, to both male and female readers, and “the member of the first family that gets the highest approval rating.”

Mr. Binder places her on a pedestal alongside a couple of his other revered tastemakers, “the greatest living women,” in his phrase: Victoria Beckham and the Olsen sisters, Mary-Kate and Ashley.

In part, he admires his seemingly unlikely idols for their skillful self-branding. Ms. Beckham, in particular, works a kind of uniform, he noted: “With her perfect hair, oversize sweaters, pants and a handbag, you can’t imagine her any other way. In that sense she is very much like Melania.”

The first lady, he said, rarely veers from her signature formality, cleaving to a daytime wardrobe of crisp shift dresses or tailored suits. Never mind that she flaunted a $51,500 Dolce & Gabbana coat during a visit to Sicily. Or got down in the dirt at the White House in September, gardening in a Balmain tartan shirt that costs $1,380. Or that she walked tall in stilettos en route to Houston in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.

Even in that time of crisis, Mr. Binder enthused the other day, “she was unapologetic and fabulous.”

That sort of boosterism may not raise his stock with fashion insiders, but Mr. Binder is unfazed. In his view the first lady is a bellwether. Until recently, if you were fashionable, you wore sneakers, he said, “even if they cost $2,000 and were Gucci. You didn’t want to look expensive or as if you were trying too hard.”

“With Melania, all that has gone out the window,” he said. “She is transitioning us into a kind of bitch-goddess ultra-femininity.”

Of course, his column is not all Melania, all the time. Mr. Binder shuttles between coverage of style and — wait for it — immigration. His recent reports on that politically freighted beat, which takes up roughly 60 percent of his time, include an account of a California woman who obtained United States citizenship without being able to speak, read or write English. And he wags a finger at Ivanka Trump, not a current Breitbart favorite. At a recent dinner panel, Ms. Trump referred to the young immigrants covered by the DACA program as “innocent people,” while failing to mention, Mr. Binder writes, “some of the egregious crimes committed by illegal aliens.”

How does he reconcile his fashion reporting with his coverage of immigration? Not a problem, Mr. Binder said. “We’re one of the very few news outlets that cover immigration from the point of view of the American worker.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

His style analysis is in line with that mission, he said. “We’re reporting with the gaze of ordinary people who want to look at photos of beautiful women in beautiful clothes.”

Enthralled as he is with his subjects’ appearance, he is no feminist. The movement “has denigrated women,” he said, “reducing those who feel that their chief purpose is to raise children to feeling that they are not on a par with these yuppies on the Upper East Side.”

He acknowledged that such views tend to color his coverage. He reported on the harassment charges against the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein but now focuses much of his ire on fashion designers and editors, calling out their silence as disingenuous. “They seemed to know things, but acted as if they didn’t know,” Mr. Binder said.

Dear Sugars,

I’m stuck and I have no idea what to do. I’m 21 and I work as a waitress. I have no education past a high school diploma. I feel so trapped in my small town. I want my life to change. It’s like I can see it already playing out. I work seven days a week and still earn just enough to pay the bills. I want to go to school but have always had trouble in that area. I never had a chance to see the world. I can’t stand this routine.

I spend about twenty percent of my day picturing my life across the country. I know I’m going to get there one day, but it’s almost unbearable waiting because the money seems like it’s never going to be there. My question is how do I make the steps to get there? I’m so incredibly uninspired. I want to wake up and feel energy and love. I want to feel that I know I’m where I’m supposed to be. But I’m scared that I’ll be stuck waitressing forever.

Broke

Cheryl Strayed: You’ll only be stuck waitressing forever if you decide to be, Broke. Your life is up to you. You’re not trapped in anything but your own despair. You hold the key. Stop telling yourself you don’t have the power to open the door. Everything about the language you use in describing your circumstances tells me you’re not aware of that. You write: “I want my life to change” rather than “I’m going to change my life.” The former is a passive expression of a desire; the later is an active decision. You can’t do the things you hope to do until you believe you have the capacity to do them. So that’s where to begin: by having a word with the inner voices of doom in your head and telling them to hush up. I understand why you might have those voices in your head (as someone who grew up poor in a small town and worked as a waitress, I really do), but the story you’ve told yourself about being “stuck forever” isn’t true and it doesn’t serve you. It’s time to tell yourself a different story instead.

Steve Almond: One way to begin telling that new story is to focus on the sort of life you want to lead. What emerges from your letter is mostly a desire to get out of town. But an exit plan isn’t the same thing as a destination. I love that you spend a lot of time picturing your life across the country. It tells me you’re ambitious and imaginative. What I want to know is what you envision yourself doing over there. How exactly do you want to spend your precious time on this earth? This may seem like a grandiose question, given how hard you’re working just to pay the bills on time. But it’s really not.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Yes, hi, remember yesterday, when I said that you might as well solve the Friday because it wasn’t as hard as you would imagine it to be and besides, the Saturday puzzle would be much harder? Well, they don’t pay me the medium-sized bucks for nothing. Today’s puzzle by Samuel A. Donaldson and Brad Wilber is a real ... let’s just call it a learning experience, O.K.?

The bottom line on this very worthy puzzle: It’s tough, but it’s not tougher than you. Forget the horse-drawn carriage at 15A and the sainted archbishop of Canterbury at 19A for a second and drop in REID for TARA of the “Sharknado” films. There is no shame in knowing that. It will help you get the crossings. Maybe. If you know that Adobe makes the software that creates PDFs, put that in at 27A. Now you’ve got _ _ _ _ RP at 1D, which is a musical note. That’s got to be a SHARP note, right? Fill that in to help you get started on the northwest. You can come back for the first letter later. Now continue on like that until you get your toehold.

As tough as it is, it is also as close to a perfect Saturday crossword as they come. The grid is pristine, even if you are not familiar with some of the answers. The entries fluctuate between highly entertaining (HOSTESS TWINKIES) and hard to reach without help (IMARETS, which I feel like I should have known), but each of them are exquisite gems and they are all clued nearly perfectly. It just may take some reliance on outside references. The cluing is ramped up to 11, as evidenced, for one, by “Jet launcher” for GEYSER. That Kellogg brand at 40A is EGGO, of course.

Kudos to Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Wilber for debuting seven fabulous entries, the best of which, in my opinion, is COSMIC JOKE.

Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina who had traveled to New York City to celebrate a 30-year high school reunion. Another was a visitor from Belgium. They were among the eight victims killed when a 29-year-old man rammed a pickup truck down a crowded bike path along the Hudson River in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday afternoon.

Little else was known so far about those killed in what officials have described as the deadliest terror attack on the city since Sept. 11, 2001. But Belgian and Argentine officials provided information on social media on Tuesday night describing some of the dead and injured as citizens of their countries. The global representation of the victims underscores New York City’s role as a major tourist destination.

The rampage unfolded shortly after 3 p.m. north of the World Trade Center site and ended after about 20 blocks when the driver, Sayfullo Saipov, slammed the pickup truck into a school bus, the police said. He jumped out of the truck, waving what turned out to be a pellet gun and a paintball gun, and shouted “Allahu akbar,” Arabic for “God is great.” He was shot in the abdomen by an officer and was in critical condition on Tuesday night.

Mr. Saipov left a roughly mile-long scene of carnage with mangled bodies and crumpled bicycles strewn along the bike path.

“Chefs are part of that trend now, too,” Mr. Ottenhoff said. “They’re starting to say, ‘Look, people are in need of not just food but good food, and we know how to serve large quantities of good food very quickly.’”

Kimberly Grant, the chief executive of Mr. André’s Think Food Group, which runs 27 restaurants, put it like this: “Who else can take raw ingredients that are seemingly unassociated and make them into delicious food and do it under extreme pressure?”

Restaurateurs have long offered food when trouble hit their communities.

Kitchens near the World Trade Center in New York served thousands of meals each day to emergency workers after 9/11. In response to the 2004 earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, the celebrity chef Cat Cora started Chefs for Humanity. Competition barbecue teams that headed to Joplin, Mo., after the 2011 tornadoes organized themselves into Operation BBQ Relief, a nonprofit group that has since responded to more than 40 disasters.

Two weeks ago, a food writer in Northern California tapped the region’s best chefs to provide a steady stream of meals for people who had lost homes to wildfires. The restaurateur and TV personality Guy Fieri, who had to evacuate his Santa Rosa residence, organized a team of volunteers and began serving mashed potatoes and pork loin to firefighters and others in a parking lot.

Mr. Andrés helped out after Hurricane Sandy, but his first big lesson in emergency food relief came in August, when he rallied local chefs in Houston to help feed survivors of Hurricane Harvey.

Other Houston chefs and caterers started a website called “I Have Food I Need Food” and used social media to create a system to organize donations, cook food and get it delivered. They codified their effort in a manual and sent it to chefs in Miami who were staring down Hurricane Irma, which landed 16 days later.

Mr. Andrés went to Houston in part to study how to expand the scope of World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit association of chefs he established in 2011 after helping Haiti earthquake victims a year earlier. The idea was to learn how he and Brian MacNair, World Central Kitchen’s executive director, could add emergency food relief to an agenda that already included building school kitchens, organizing culinary training and offering other forms of support in several countries.

But nothing prepared Mr. Andrés for what he faced in Puerto Rico. After taking one of the first commercial flights to the island after the storm, he realized that things were worse than anyone knew.

He found his friend Jose Enrique, the chef who has been leading Puerto Rico’s farm-to-table resurgence. Mr. Enrique had no electricity to run his Restaurant Jose Enrique, in the Santurce district of San Juan. Rain poured through the roof. But he had food in the freezer. Other chefs did, too. Someone had a generator.

“We decided we would just start cooking,” Mr. Enrique said.

The next morning, Mr. Andrés went to a food distributor and loaded up his car. “I was already smart enough to know I would need aluminum pans, so I bought every aluminum pan I could,” he said.

They began cooking big pots of the classic island stew called sancocho on the street in front of Mr. Enrique’s small restaurant. Word spread and the lines grew. They sent food to people waiting in 10-hour lines at gas stations. They heard that workers at the city’s biggest medical clinic were going hungry, so they added it to what was now a makeshift delivery schedule. “Every day it would just double,” Mr. Enrique said.

Mr. Andrés didn’t realize that his was the biggest hot-food game on the island until a week or so after they started. Someone from the Salvation Army pulled up and asked for 120 meals.

“In my life I never expected the Salvation Army to be asking me for food,” he said. “If one of the biggest NGOs comes to us for food, who is actually going to be feeding Puerto Rico? We are. We are it.”

More cooks arrived to help. Partnerships were forged with other aid groups and large food companies. Sandwiches and fruit were added to their repertory of rice dishes.

The team moved its base of operation to the island’s largest arena. To pay for it all, at least in the beginning, they used Mr. Andrés’s credit cards, or cash from the pockets of the Orvis fly-fishing vest he wore like a battle jacket.

Mr. Andrés left the island only a few times, the first after 11 days on the ground. He had lost 25 pounds and became dehydrated.

His team deployed food trucks, like a strike force, to isolated neighborhoods and towns that needed help. Agents of Homeland Security Investigations, a division of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, were serving as emergency workers, and staying in the same hotel as Mr. Andrés’s crew. The chef persuaded them to load food into their vehicles every morning as they headed out to patrol.

With limited ability to communicate, the crew organized everything with satellite phones, WhatsApp and a big paper map of all the feeding stations on the island, which Mr. Andrés carried like a general at war.

He negotiated with a chain of vocational schools around the island to let culinary students cook there. During visits to his kitchens, 18 in all, he admonished volunteers to add more mayonnaise to sandwiches, keep the temperature up on the pans of rice or serve bigger portions.

Photo

The Compass Group, a giant American food-service operation that Mr. Andrés recently partnered with, sent someone who understood what it takes to feed several thousand people at a time.

Mr. Andrés recruited his own chefs, too. David Thomas, accustomed to making $540 suckling pigs as the executive chef at Mr. Andrés’s Bazaar Meat restaurant in Las Vegas, suddenly found himself trying to figure out how to make meals out of donations that might include 5,000 pounds of lunch meat one day and 17 pallets of yogurt the next.

The operation grew so big that at one point you couldn’t find any sliced cheese in all of Puerto Rico. The team had bought it all up for sandwiches.

Eventually, the effort would cost World Central Kitchen about $400,000 a day, paid for by donations from foundations, celebrities and a flood of smaller donors, as well as two Federal Emergency Management Agency contracts — one early on to cover the cost of 140,000 meals, and another for $10 million to cover two weeks’ worth of meals while Mr. Andrés’s team scaled down the operation.

Mr. Andrés, who often rolls right over regulations and ignores the word “no,” clashed more than once with FEMA and other large organizations that have a more-seasoned and methodical approach. In meetings and telephone calls, FEMA officials reminded him that he and his people lacked the experience needed to organize a mass emergency feeding operation, he said.","José Andrés Fed Puerto Rico, and May Change How Aid Is Given",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/dining/jose-andres-puerto-rico.html

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Photo

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Photo

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

One crucial implication of this finding is that political elites have enormous power to dictate ideological terms to their rank-and-file supporters.
For a healthy chunk of conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats, the “liberal” and “conservative” position on most issues is whatever their party leaders say it is.

Recent surveys have shown that most Americans — including majorities of Republican voters — support increasing federal financing of health care and oppose cutting taxes for the wealthy.","The political scientist Philip Converse first brought the first reality to national attention in 1964. In his classic essay “The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics,” Mr. Converse demonstrated that only 17 percent of American voters could both correctly assign the terms “liberal” and “conservative” to the nation’s two major political parties and offer a sensible description of what those terms meant. The rest of the electorate did not understand politics as a fight over abstract theories of good government but rather a conflict between interest groups. Ordinary voters did not select the party that most faithfully represented their political philosophy — they picked the one that appeared to best represent their people, a group they might define with reference to class, region, religion, race or partisanship itself.

This make intuitive sense: The left-to-right political spectrum is a construct born of seating arrangements during the French Revolution. The impulse to define oneself in relation to an in-group — and opposition to an out-group — is a survival strategy that’s been with us since the dawn of our species.

And in their recent book “Neither Liberal Nor Conservative: Ideological Innocence in the American Public,” the political scientists Donald Kinder and Nathan Kalmoe show that the electorate is scarcely more ideological today, at the peak of partisan polarization, than it was at the height of the New Deal consensus (when Mr. Converse published his landmark study).

Thus, while it’s true that fewer Americans self-identify as liberal than as moderate or conservative, this tells us almost nothing about voters’ policy views. “Moderates” do not actually display a preference for “centrist” positions, but merely for ideologically inconsistent ones. In fact, the Stanford political scientist David Broockman has shown that moderates are just as likely to subscribe to “extreme” policy positions as other voters are: In the United States, there are self-identified “moderates” who support a $1 million maximum income, prohibiting gays and lesbians from teaching public school and the mass deportation of all undocumented immigrants.

Meanwhile, the number of genuine “liberals” and “conservatives” is far smaller than meets the eye. Most voters who identify with those terms are partisans first, and ideologues second. Or as Mr. Kinder and Mr. Kalmoe conclude an analysis of four decades of voter survey data, “ideological identification seems more a reflection of political decisions than a cause.” In other words: The average conservative Republican isn’t a Republican because she’s a conservative — she self-identifies as a conservative because she’s a Republican.

One crucial implication of this finding is that political elites have enormous power to dictate ideological terms to their rank-and-file supporters. For a healthy chunk of conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats, the “liberal” and “conservative” position on most issues is whatever their party leaders say it is. Donald Trump’s success at redefining conservative voters’ consensus views on free trade, American policy toward Russia and the relevance of personal morality to effective political leadership offers a particularly vivid illustration of this phenomenon.

When we look past ideological self-identification to polling on discrete public policy questions, America appears to be far more center-left than center-right. In a recent analysis of Democracy Fund Voter Study Group survey data, the political scientist Lee Drutman found that 73.5 percent of the 2016 electorate espoused broadly left-of-center views on economic policy.

That finding is supported by polling on individual fiscal issues over the past year. Recent surveys have shown that most Americans — including majorities of Republican voters — support increasing federal financing of health care and oppose cutting taxes for the wealthy. And there’s little evidence that the Democrats’ left flank is exhausting the public’s tolerance for government intervention in the economy: Recent polls have found that over 60 percent of Americans support tuition-free public college (a majority that includes 58 percent of independents and 47 percent of Republicans); that over 60 percent of all voters favor Medicaid and Medicare buy-in programs, while a slim majority likes the sound of single-payer; and that 82 percent of voters, including 70 percent of Republicans, support new legislation expanding access to paid family and medical leave.

The Democratic Party has failed to translate the popularity of progressive economics into electoral success for a variety of reasons. The most fundamental is the one we’ve already observed: Most voters cast their ballots on the basis of identity, not policy. And America’s rapidly changing demographics — and the right’s steadfast efforts to inflame and exploit anxieties about those changes — have made racial identity increasingly salient to white voters, particularly rural ones. This development, combined with the disproportionate influence that our political system awards to white rural voters, has given Republicans a structural advantage.

Democrats have all kinds of ways of addressing this problem. One would be to cultivate the class identity of white voters by embracing populist rhetoric that paints “the billionaire class” as an out-group they can define themselves against. Another would be to invest more resources into registering nonwhite voters. According to the Census Bureau, 74 percent of non-Hispanic whites are registered to vote in the United States. For African-Americans, that figure is 69 percent; for Hispanics, 57; and for Asian-Americans, 56. As the policy analyst Sean McElwee has noted, this means that even if every registered Latino voter in America went to the polls last November, Latinos’ overall turnout rate still would have been lower than it was for whites (63 percent).

Embracing a more conservative economic agenda, however, would solve none of the Democrats’ problems. At a time of historic inequality, rampant corporate consolidation and environmental crisis, the case for more robust redistributive social programs and public-interest regulations is strong. When centrist Democrats claim that making such a case is electoral suicide, they reveal less about the American public’s stubbornly center-right convictions than about their own.",America Is Not a ‘Center-Right Nation’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/opinion/democrats-economic-policy.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

What: A man in a Home Depot rental truck barreled down a bike bath near the Hudson River, striking pedestrians and cyclists before crashing the truck into a school bus, officials said. He jumped out of the vehicle with a pellet gun and a paintball gun in hand, shouted “Allahu akbar” (“God is great” in Arabic) and was shot by an officer, authorities said.

When: The attack began just after 3 p.m.

Where: The driver entered the West Side Highway bicycle path at Houston Street and began driving south. His truck collided with a school bus at Chambers Street, nearly a mile away.

Who: Officials identified Sayfullo Saipov, 29, who moved to the United States from Uzbekistan in 2010, as the driver of the truck. He had apparently lived in Paterson, N.J., and Tampa, Fla. After he was shot in the abdomen by the police, he was taken into custody and transported to a nearby hospital. He remained in stable condition as of early Wednesday morning, according to the police.

Why: It is still not known what motivated the attack. Investigators found handwritten notes in Arabic near the truck that indicated allegiance to the Islamic State, but they are treating the episode as a case of an attack “inspired” by the group.

Here’s what else is happening:

Weather

Welcome to November: It’s cool and gray.

Temperatures this morning may dip into the low 40s, but the sun will accompany you on your commute.

The rest of the day is a trade off: More clouds will roll in this afternoon, but temperatures should rise to 57.

The final debate of the mayoral campaign is tonight.

It’s the second meeting of Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat; Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican; and the independent businessman Bo Dietl.

Undoubtedly, yesterday’s terrorist attack will be on everyone’s mind, and the topic of terrorism and safety will almost certainly come up.

A few other points to watch:

• Mr. de Blasio has some explaining to do.

Since the last debate, Jona S. Rechnitz, a wealthy real estate developer, testified that he bought access to the city’s political and law enforcement circles in exchange for favors for himself and others.

“The moderator is going to want to talk about it. His opponents are going to want to talk about it. He’s not going to want to talk about it,” said Shane Goldmacher, who covers New York politics.

• It’s an important night for Ms. Malliotakis.

“People want to know what would look different in an administration of Nicole Malliotakis and I’m not sure she’s articulated that,” said J. David Goodman, who covers City Hall. “This is sort of her last chance to convince voters that she has the stature and gravitas to be mayor.”

• Expect a quieter debate than the first, if only because the crowd size will be smaller.

The debate begins at 7 p.m. and will be broadcast on CBS2, 1010WINS, WCBS 880 and at NYDailyNews.com.

Today’s Theme

Four famous lines from well-known movies are offered in the grid, clued with just the titles: Your job is to match them to the actors who said them. Those entries are also part of the theme: CRUISE LINE (59A), for example, is the answer to the SHOW ME THE MONEY (42A) line from “Jerry Maguire.” It’s also a real phrase in its own right, and is clued as “Carnival, say, or a further hint to 42-Across.”

Tricky Clues

6A: Is it GIF with a hard G or a soft G? No one knows for sure, although it’s said that because the G stands for “graphics,” which has a hard G, GIF should be pronounced that way. Either way, surely we have better things to argue about.

13A: “Canine supporters” could be all the wonderful rescue organizations that abound (Like Elayne Boosler’s Tails of Joy), but today we’re talking teeth, so the answer is GUMS.

“Downtown is bursting at the seams,” said Mr. Momo, a partner in the Terra Momo restaurant group, which owns the nearby Terra Momo Bread Company, Teresa Caffe and Mediterra restaurant. “This is right on the seam, so I said, ‘Let’s do something here.’”

The lot already had “a 100-plus-year-old” dilapidated house on it, Ms. Dowling said, which had been abandoned for many years.

“We bought it thinking we were going to save the front half,” she continued, while extending the house with an addition on the back. “But it was so rotted and poorly cared for that we couldn’t salvage it.”

So they gave the porch to an architect working on the renovation of a house down the street, where the singer, actor, athlete and civil rights activist Paul Robeson was born in 1898, and slated the rest for demolition.

Ms. Dowling drew up plans for a new building using existing setback requirements as her guide, while looking to maximize space. The house had to be 10 feet from either side of the 40-foot-wide lot, and 35 feet from the rear lot line. The height was limited to 30 feet.

She started with a two-story box that precisely traced those limits, and then carved out space for the carport and a double-height kitchen to get the total indoor area down to 2,298 square feet — just two square feet shy of the maximum 2,300 allowed.

She submitted her plans to Princeton’s building department and received a construction permit before whispers about the movement to create a historic district reached her. “I started hearing from neighbors saying, ‘Can you show us what you’re doing? We’d like to be included,’” she said.

Hoping to demonstrate that she and Mr. Momo had every intention of being good neighbors, she organized a community meeting at the local library to share her design, and went door to door distributing fliers. “I built a model. I made poundcake. It was a real good-will effort,” she said. “Three people showed up.”

Demolition began in April 2015, without incident. Fifteen months and about $1 million later, Ms. Dowling, Mr. Momo and their 14-year-old daughter, Anna, moved into the completed three-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom house, built by R. Faucett Construction.

Ms. Dowling and Mr. Momo now spend much of their time in the airy kitchen, where soaring walls of operable windows bring in abundant natural light and breezes. “I’m the cook; she’s the baker,” Mr. Momo said.

The living room has large sliding glass doors opening onto steps that lead down to the grassy backyard designed by Peter Soderman, where their dog, Pepper, goes to play. In the basement, a home office serves as the East Coast outpost of Dowling Studios.

“Could I have come in and done some quasi-colonial thing, as other builders around town are doing? Sure,” Ms. Dowling said. “But what’s the better response: to build something that looked like what was here or something that is designed for today?”

The couple’s feelings on the subject are clear — and at least some of their neighbors seem sympathetic. Shortly after the house was completed, representatives of the historic district contacted Mr. Momo.

“They invited me onto the board,” he said, adding that he initially felt conflicted as the owner of a modern home.

“I tried to decline,” he said. “But they wanted me anyway.”",A Modernist Box Among the Victorians,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/realestate/modernist-box-among-victorians.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Mr. Joseph was a successful filmmaker at the time, directing music videos for artists like Flying Lotus, and was later nominated for an Emmy as one of the directors of Beyoncé’s visual album “Lemonade.”

But in 2014, Mr. Joseph had just completed a 14-minute film that he couldn’t release. It was based on work he’d done for Mr. Lamar, after the release of his album “Good Kid, M.A.A.D City.” Blending home video from Mr. Lamar’s family with original footage filmed in Compton, Calif., Mr. Joseph had made something new. But it was not a traditional music video, and Mr. Lamar was not interested in putting it out, Mr. Joseph, 36, recalled in a recent interview.

That’s when Mr. Joseph’s brother advised him to turn it into an installation for the Underground Museum. Projected on two screens arranged in a V shape, the film, “m.A.A.d,” was a striking success, drawing a host of new visitors to the space. “All of a sudden, I’m a fine artist,” Mr. Joseph said. “All thanks to my brother.”

Among the transfixed viewers was Helen Molesworth, the chief curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. “I literally drove back to the museum and put it on the schedule,” she said.

The film’s triumphant run at the Museum of Contemporary Art was followed by more work, including “Lemonade” and “Music Is My Mistress,” a project for the fashion house Kenzo.

Then, last year, came the invitation from the New Museum: Could Mr. Joseph create a new film, a sort of New York-based companion piece to “m.A.A.d.”?

For the first time in his career, Mr. Joseph faced a blank slate. There was no song, no album, no core material to draw on. But he quickly found that “it’s impossible not to think about all your heroes and references when you write,” he said.

In addition to Mr. DeCarava, the photographer, Mr. Joseph drew on the work of Chris Marker, whose film “Sans Soleil” offers an extended meditation on memory and time. With “Fly Paper,” Mr. Joseph pays homage to a host of literary and cultural figures, splicing and mixing in references among its scenes of fictional characters. Some figures skate away, while others recur.

The film builds in layers, with vérité footage from the street interspersed with elegant, vividly staged scenes. A woman places a handbag on a bed; an elegant gentleman (Ben Vereen) climbs a set of stairs, then reclines, fully dressed, in a bathtub. He visits an art gallery. He dances in an empty room and with the Brooklyn-born flex dancer Storyboard P. The soundtrack leaps, too. Music collides with the sounds of the city: drums, bass, an ambulance, a train.

“I wanted people to feel like they saw a Harlem that they can’t see,” Mr. Joseph said. “You can take a tour bus around Harlem and see the exterior.”

His hunt for the heart of the neighborhood also shows the influence of Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts, author of the 2011 book “Harlem Is Nowhere” (its title is from a 1948 essay by Ralph Ellison). The neighborhood’s role as a capital of American culture, and exuberant celebration of African-American life is a voice in his work, which includes a passage read from Ms. Rhodes-Pitts’s book.

But some of the ghosts are his own. A middle-aged man in an overcoat gets into a cab. He’s on a gurney, proceeding down a hospital hall. He’s in a chair, head shaved, a surgical scar circling one side of his skull, watching ESPN.

That would be Mr. Joseph’s father, the sports and entertainment attorney Keven Davis, who lived in Harlem until his death in 2011 at 53. That shock still reverberates for Mr. Joseph. “I remember having no concept that my parents could ever pass away,” he said. “They seemed like these eternal experiences.”

The next shock came in 2015, when Noah, his brother, died at 32. “You think you have a lot of time with people, when you’re young,” Mr. Joseph said. “They’re going to live until they’re at least 70. Right?”

Photo

It was a struggle to edit “Fly Paper,” because of its deeply personal nature, and only late in the process did Mr. Joseph decide to include footage of his family. Searching through video he had shot in 2011 during his father’s last months, he said, “led to a wormhole, all this stuff that I totally forgot I shot, because I was in such automatic mode.”

Again, he was inspired by Mr. DeCarava’s work, noting how the photographer included portraits of his wife and daughters in his 1996 MoMA retrospective, alongside his depictions of jazz greats like Billie Holiday and Miles Davis.

“He was able to not compartmentalize,” Mr. Joseph said. “That’s why I started to include my family. That’s my big reference to Roy. That was his big genius.”

The loss of his father and brother also contributed to the erosion of Mr. Joseph’s sense of time, he said — a huge preoccupation for a filmmaker. “Our understanding of time as linear is completely false,” he said. In the film, it’s rarely clear whether everything is happening in the same period, across generations, or in a kind of eternal loop.

Visitors at the New Museum show wander in, not knowing quite what to expect. But that kind of serendipity is fine with Mr. Joseph, who compared it to his youthful experience of flipping TV channels, only to happen across a movie in progress. “The likelihood that I would finish the film was probably increased by coming in somewhere in the middle, not knowing where I am,” he said.

A sense of dislocation defines the film, which slips from one visual format to another — from 35-millimeter color film to coruscating black-and-white to bleary hand-held video — in a way that recalls the rapidly shifting frames of a dream.

In the coda, just after the final shot of Mr. Joseph’s father, there is a sequence of video clips from the 1990s, highlights from the career of the former Detroit Lions star running back Barry Sanders, who abruptly retired before the 1999 season. Mr. Joseph warmly recalled that during his father’s final months they would bond over sports, and Mr. Sanders, a particular favorite.

“I’ve always been drawn to the ballet-like nature of his specific play,” Mr. Joseph said. He also praised the athlete’s decision to step away from the sport at the peak of his powers. “It was like a Zen samurai principle thing, right?”

In the clips, which last a minute or so, the football star streaks across the field, again and again, a flash of joy that sharply contrasts with the painful hospital scenes. It may seem like a jarring shift in mood, but it is in keeping with the film’s essayistic form.

“I really love filmmaking, to be honest,” Mr. Joseph said. “More than plot.”",Kahlil Joseph’s New Film Is Steeped in Harlem’s History. And His Own.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/arts/design/kahlil-joseph-film-new-museum-fly-paper-roy-de-carava.html

The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.
Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.","Joao Silva came of age as a photographer documenting social upheaval in South Africa. Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Photo

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

Photo

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

Photo

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

‘What Do You Think Caused World War II, a Zoning Issue?’

Stephen Colbert took a break Tuesday from his focus on the Russia investigation to address some controversial comments by the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly. In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Mr. Kelly praised Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general, and said the Civil War took place only because of “the lack of an ability to compromise.”

“What do you mean, there was a lack of compromise? The Civil War happened because of compromise: the Missouri Compromise, the Three-Fifths Compromise. You’re a general and you don’t know why the Civil War happened? What do you think caused World War II, a zoning issue? ‘I vant to build a strip mall in the Sudetenlands!

The New York Times Company continued its march toward a digital future in the third quarter of 2017, as strong growth in digital advertising and new online subscriptions helped counteract a further collapse in print advertising.

The company said on Wednesday that digital advertising revenue in the quarter rose 11 percent, to $49 million. The company also added 105,000 net digital-only subscriptions for its news product, helping to push digital subscription revenue to $86 million, a 46 percent increase compared with the same period a year ago. Over all, the company said, total revenue increased 6 percent in the quarter, to $386 million.

Including subscriptions for its crossword and cooking products, The Times now has nearly 2.5 million digital-only subscribers.

The Times, however, has not been immune to the punishing, industrywide downturn in print. Print advertising revenue fell 20 percent in the quarter, fueling a 9 percent decrease in total advertising revenue.

The sound, if not earth-shattering, financial results were announced as The Times fundamentally reshapes itself into a business no longer rooted in newsprint. In the past several months, it has eliminated its copy desk, offered buyouts to employees and reorganized the structure of its newsroom.

But on a recent afternoon at the Great Western pub, a cozy, beer-scented den in Wolverhampton, people worried that such sentiments were being overwhelmed by the economic realities of Brexit.

The pub has been doing a brisk business, owing to the success of the local soccer team, the Wolverhampton Wanderers, whose stadium is within walking distance. But customers were nursing woes.

“Brexit is a disaster,” said Richard Lloyd, 48, the proprietor of a local construction company, as he hoisted a pint of Guinness. “It’s thrown a lot of people into uncertainty. Companies are certainly delaying investment. They are being very cautious.”

Two years ago, Mr. Lloyd employed as many as 20 people. These days, he has only four. “If things were going really swimmingly, I’d hire more,” he said.

Time itself has become a threat. As negotiations yield headlines about sniping within Britain’s governing Conservative party, each week that passes absent clarity amplifies pressure on companies to shift people and operations to Europe.

For Nim’s Fruit Crisps, the variables of Brexit have advanced British self-sufficiency.

Previously reliant on a supplier in Belgium for most of its fruits and vegetables, the company has in recent months found domestic suppliers for every needed variety except pineapple, limiting its exposure to the vagaries of exchange rates. Today, Nim’s buys apples, parsnips, cucumbers and a range of other crops from British farmers.

The fall in the pound has also made Nim’s products cheaper outside Britain, bolstering its exports, which now make up more than half of total sales. Nim’s snacks are sold in Germany, France, Italy, India, Israel and — soon — Saudi Arabia.

“What I’ve learned is that Europe isn’t the only market for us,” said Ms. Raja, whose Nim’s business card identifies her as TheBoss.

Yet as she seeks to complete a deal putting her crisps on the shelves of a major British supermarket chain, Ms. Raja worries that the needed volumes will exceed the capacities of Britain.

“I suddenly have to find 100 tons of apples,” she said.

Opposition research is standard practice in politics, and it’s not pretty. It involves looking for dirt on an opponent and then publicizing that dirt. When you read an exposé in a major media organization about a political candidate, it sometimes started with old-fashioned investigative reporting — but other times it started with a handout from the opposition-research arm of a competing campaign.

Fusion is known for doing opposition research. During the Republican primaries, a conservative website funded, in large part, by Paul Singer, a Republican billionaire who didn’t want Trump to win the nomination, hired Fusion to look into Trump. After he did win the nomination, the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C. hired Fusion and, through the law firm, paid for the research.

Fusion worked with a well-regarded former British spy named Christopher Steele to produce a dossier that accused the Trump campaign of colluding with Russia. The dossier also included salacious — and unproven, if not false — stories about Trump’s personal behavior.

Trump and his media allies have tried to downplay his campaign’s Russia dealings by saying the Clinton campaign’s financing of the dossier was even worse. It’s classic whataboutism, and it’s part of Trump’s effort to sow confusion about the allegations against him.

It’s also a silly comparison. Clinton’s campaign was engaging in the usual, if tough, practice of trying to uncover information that makes an opponent look bad. Trump’s campaign, by contrast, was potentially colluding with a foreign government hostile to the United States to disseminate stolen material — with Trump then lying about it and trying to prevent a federal investigation of it.

“Trump’s entire defense amounts to elementary school taunt: ‘I know you are, but what am I?’” writes Max Boot, summarizing a piece he’s written for Foreign Policy.

The dossier intrigue is part of a “frantic effort to distract attention from what we do know, which is … that Russia tried to meddle in the election,” Ruth Marcus has said on CBS. “Not for the first time,” The Los Angeles Times’s editorial board notes, “the president and his allies are seizing on a sideshow to distract attention from the main event.”

Uluru has, for many in Australia, come to symbolize the struggle for Indigenous rights. Mr. Wilson said some people in the government wanted to keep the rock open to hikers, but “it’s not their law that lies in this land.”

Traditional owners do not climb Uluru out of respect, and they worry that hiking will damage the stone. Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park is a Unesco World Heritage Site.

There has been opposition to the climbing ban. Last year, Adam Giles, a politician with an Indigenous heritage who was then the Northern Territory chief minister, called the idea “ludicrous.”

But Sally Barnes, Australia’s director of national parks, said it was a “significant moment for all Australians” that “marks a new chapter in our history.”

“It clearly says we put country and culture first when managing this place for all Australians and our visitors from around the world,” she said on Wednesday.

About 250,000 people visit Uluru every year, according to the park’s website. In recent years, the number of visitors wishing to climb the rock has dropped significantly, to less than 20 percent, according to Ms. Barnes. Tour operators now offer alternatives to climbing Uluru, including camel tours around its base.

I had previously embarked on only one journey of the duration I was now contemplating. Shortly after college, I took the California Zephyr from Chicago to San Francisco, and the Empire Builder, across Montana and the Dakotas, back. I was 23 then and slept sitting up in my seat. That would not cut it this time. I was older and required comfort. A private room fit in with my train-travel dreams, but I had always assumed such luxury prohibitively expensive. I was pleased, then, to find a fare of $280 one-way. The fare included a “roomette,” the smallest private compartment on offer. (I booked way ahead of time. By my departure date, that number had more than doubled.)

We arrived at Penn Station with an hour to spare. There were no obvious signs of hell, except that we were put on the Silver Meteor, which goes to Miami. Normally, the Crescent makes the entire trip from NYC to NOLA, but construction at Penn Station allowed it no further north than D.C.

Photo

A porter directed us to our car. We boarded and were immediately funneled into those narrow hallways that remind you of old movies.

The room was as “-ette” as advertised — 3’6” by 6’8” — but well-organized, like one of those multipurpose pocket gadgets advertised on late night TV. There was a place to hang my garment bag in one corner. Opposite was a toilet; above that a sink that folded into the wall. There were towels and soap and a paper-cup dispenser on top of the sink. A cavity in the wall so high you would easily miss it swallowed up the luggage. Between the two facing, and rather commodious, seats, there was a retractable table with a checkerboard pattern on it. Switches above each seat controlled three lights: ceiling, wall and reading.

This was all fine by me. My height (6’1”) notwithstanding, I have always felt most comfortable in snug spaces. One-bedroom apartments relax me; McMansions give me the jitters.

Once we pulled out of the station, it became apparent that we not only had one long window but a second upper window, slightly hidden by the upper berth. The roomette was flooded with light.

Photo

A woman name Brenda came by and offered us bottled water. We tipped her, figuring we would need to rely on her in the future.

Train travel presents certain immediate advantages over air travel. It forces you to relax, as you have time on your hands. Even in a roomette, you’re afforded more space than on a plane. Furthermore, you can stock your quarters with items the airlines would never permit, including well-stuffed suitcases; snacks (in case the onboard fare wasn’t up to par — a safe bet); and the makings of cocktail hour.

We called Brenda for ice. Once 5 o’clock hit, out came a bottle of Pimm’s, a half-liter of ginger ale, a cucumber and a knife. Pimm’s Cups were built and enjoyed, under the glow of the coming sunset. I read some Fitzgerald and smiled, thinking of all the suckers shoehorned into seats on United or American.

The train was full, so meal seatings were staggered. We were called at 5:45. The dining car was bustling and had an appealing, quasi-art deco feel to it. There was no selecting of tables. We were slipped into booths like files. “Side by side,” instructed the waiter when we tried to sit opposite each other. “Side by side.”

Photo

The menu had a section titled “ACAT Inspired Special.” ACAT stood for Amtrak Culinary Advisory Team. Only one such item, a “vegetarian Asian noodle bowl,” was available. I opted for the “Field & Sea Combo” instead, based on the waiter’s recommendation. It was composed of steak, seared shrimp, baked potato and mixed vegetables. It came quickly and wasn’t bad, though it wasn’t good, either; about on par with what you might find at Ponderosa.

At Washington’s Union Station, we changed trains. The Crescent was right across the platform. Our new roomette looked exactly like the old one.

We asked Pat, our new attendant, for more ice, and I poured out pre-mixed martinis I had smuggled aboard in a flask. We sipped contentedly. “The only problem with this train is not enough martinis,” my companion said.

As darkness fell on northern Virginia, Pat set up the berths. The limited machinery that effected the change was too much for us. Pat, stout and short, did it in a second. She bid us a good night and added, “Let’s see if we get through the Carolinas.” Why wouldn’t we?, I wondered.

Photo

The bottom berth, amazingly, accommodated my long frame. Sleeping on the upper, said my companion, felt like getting an M.R.I. But we both slept well. My expectation that the train’s motion would rock us to slumber had not been bunk (as it were).

We woke in South Carolina. Red clay lined the tracks. The rising sun made the pine trees look burnt yellow. Mobile homes and country lanes drifted by. Washing up and shaving in the shower down the hall required agility. The lurching train threw my body from wall to wall. I felt vaguely like an Army recruit.

In Atlanta, I detrained for the first time. Raised on the train stations of the northeast, I expected something as grand. But the station was a remarkably meager affair. There was a small waiting room with wooden benches and a few vending machines. An older Amtrak employee discoursed to some customers about past civil rights achievements of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.

At lunch, we were seated opposite a Birmingham family returning from a jaunt to New York. We ordered one of those ACAT culinary specials, a “Thai-spiced pulled coconut pork slider.” The Boston-based chef Jamie Bissonette was the supposed author. The table quieted when the dish arrived. For a slider, it was as big as a burger. The gray meat inside resembled dog food. A few bites were all that were needed for us to plead for the Hebrew National hot dog my companion had spotted on the kids’ menu. The frankfurter was split open, grilled and served with relish. It was delicious, easily the best thing we ate on the trip.

Photo

Outside the window, I saw thick foliage, small country post offices and handmade signs advertising boiled peanuts. Mmm, I thought, boiled peanuts.

Shortly after lunch, the train stopped outside of Birmingham. I had been napping off and on, so I didn’t notice until an hour had passed. It was then that Pat communicated the cruel secret of the Crescent. Beyond the northeast corridor, Amtrak doesn’t own the tracks it runs on. By law, Amtrak trains must be given priority. But, in practice, it doesn’t always work out that way, resulting in regular delays. In this case, a freight had stalled. We sat still for three hours. (“Let’s see if we get through the Carolinas,” Pat had said.)

The charm of train travel lies in constant motion, minute-by-minute adventure. When that motion ceases, the charm evaporates. Alabama was the longest state. There were two more delays, as we played less-precious cargo to loads of grain, chemicals and coal. I no longer felt smarter than plane people.

Around Tuscaloosa, we had dinner. The dining car didn’t have the style of that on the Silver Meteor. Nothing on the Crescent did. However, the Field & Sea Combo was strangely better, the steak juicier, the shrimp well grilled. Our waitress, Ashley, said they had a good chef on board. I found the idea of an Amtrak chef being good or bad, or even existent, highly suspect. But maybe there were differences from train to train.

Photo

We finally crossed into Mississippi, then crawled to Louisiana. I lost track of the delays — none were announced — and of Pat. Many of the passengers had disembarked at Birmingham. The Crescent felt like a ghost train. Were we the only ones foolish enough to pay full passage?

The train had been due at 9 p.m. We arrived in New Orleans at 2 a.m. I stumbled, nearly hallucinating from exhaustion, onto the platform and into a taxi. We told the driver our tale of woe. He was not moved. “Last night, it got in at 4.”

People were still impressed when we told them how we got to New Orleans. When pressed for details, I demurred and muttered darkly about Birmingham.

Socially, we get cues about how to respond to fear from those around us, said Margee Kerr, a sociologist and author of the book “Scream: Chilling Adventures in the Science of Fear.” Early on, that’s taking notes from our parents about how to deal with distress. Later, experiencing stressful situations with others can cultivate social bonds.

Part of that has to do with emotional contagion, or a communal response to shared experiences, Dr. Kerr said. If your friend is captivated by the horror movie you are watching together, you process that by recreating the same feeling in your own mind, and that can bring you closer together. People also tend to hold onto memories of fear more intensely, she said, so if you have positive associations with a scary situation, like going to a haunted house, you’ll likely want to do it again.

Fear-seeking can also be a way of testing oneself. Josh Randall and Kristjan Thor, creators of Blackout, a haunted house experience that consistently tops rankings of “Most Extreme Haunted Houses,” said they see many people coming to their events with a goal of self-fortification. “It’s almost like a dare to themselves,” Mr. Thor said. “People want to be able to conquer something.”

For many, being scared is a jolting escape from daily life. When immersed in a scary situation, you can suspend your disbelief and live in the moment — and that loss of control can feel really good. This is key for Blackout, Mr. Randall said: “For a finite period of time, that audience member can turn off the real world, and live in a fantasy world.”

After talking with the experts, I was starting to see why some friends love getting spooked. But why do I hate being scared so much?

It could be because I was never exposed to horror movies or haunted houses growing up, so by the time I did experience these things, I was ill-prepared. It could be that the regions in my brain involved in coding fear and anxiety are more sensitive. Most likely, it is a mix of many different factors. Regardless of the reason though, “it’s perfectly O.K. not to like scary things,” Dr. Kerr said.

Shepherds tend their flock while young men hunt wild game, fish along ancient tributaries or kayak over rapids. This pleated landscape of rolling hills and jagged mountains is most verdant in spring, when the junipers are full, the grass a vibrant emerald.

These quiet moments and images are not often associated with Iraq. But the Kurdish region, in the country’s northern reaches, is home to such reprieves. Beyond the oil fields of Taqtaq and Kirkuk, far east of Mosul and many miles north of Baghdad, the semiautonomous region often feels timeless and progressive, restive and at peace.

What the Vietnamese photographer Lam Duc-Hien first imagined of Iraq before traveling there on assignment were the usual media tropes from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq — tanks and violence, surges and refugees. Mr. Lam, who was working for nongovernment organizations and a French newspaper, said he had never heard of the Kurdish people, who by then were fleeing Saddam’s oppressive and violent Baath Party. But after he settled down in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a region he documented for more than two decades, he found the country to be vastly different than what he had expected.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.

Photo

Over the years he has lived and worked there, he often traveled with the peshmerga, the Kurdish military, while on duty and off. “When I spend time with them, we always go to the mountains,” he said. “For me, it is like coming back to the 19th-century, because we are fishing with Kalashnikovs. For me, it’s incredible.”

Often referred to as a people without a country, the Kurds have for many years sought refuge in the mountains that abut Turkey and Iran. “I focused specifically on different ethnic groups and different religions in Kurdistan,” he said. “It’s small place, but it is very diverse.”

The robust culture of daily Kurdish life is captured in Mr. Lam’s photographs, a collection that stretches from the 1990s through to the war against the Islamic State. The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said. “I spend more time with them than taking pictures of them.”

A child leans in for a kiss from his little companion beneath a tree in the village of Badawan; a group of women in traditional Kurdish dresses dance atop a mountain plateau; families gather on the first day of Eid al-Adha to break the Ramadan feast at the grave of a loved one. “Each time I get back here,” Mr. Lam said, “I feel like I have a link with the people.”

Photo

Though Mr. Lam’s images sometimes show refugees and internally-displaced persons living in camps within the Kurdish region, he often shied away from the violence that has wracked the region and nearly divided the country, choosing instead to focus on the vitality of the people, not their blemishes.

Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq. He has heard whispers of secession since 1991. “One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.

But that dream has become a nightmare for many following an independence referendum in September. Disputed areas controlled by Kurdish forces were reclaimed by the Iraqi army. Flights were suspended to and from the region. A number of Kurds have since been killed or maimed in clashes with federal forces.

Photo

The recent infighting reminded Mr. Lam of a time when, during travels in the areas outside the Kurdish region, he lost that sense of fellowship — and safety — he had felt among the Kurdish people. After two bombs exploded in Baghdad’s Sadr City in 2013, with corpses littering the streets as he worked, Mr. Lam reluctantly fled the country.

“When you get involved with the Kurdish soul or friendship,” Mr. Lam said, “it’s very difficult to get out.”

He returned to Erbil soon after.

But the pricing chaos has also created great deals for some consumers, who can sign up during open enrollment beginning today.

If you qualify for big discounts on deductibles and co-payments, it’s probably best to stick to the cheapest silver plan.

If you earn below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $24,000 for a single person, you can get lower out-of-pocket medical costs because the government pays insurers to give you discounts.

The Trump administration ended these subsidies, but the law requires that insurers still give the discounts to consumers. That means a silver plan is still going to be the best deal, since you will be able to get a rich set of benefits for a fraction of your income.

While premiums have risen over all, there are still many places where the cost of the least expensive silver plan will cost less for people like you, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.

It’s worth looking at the different silver options to see which ones cover the doctors and hospitals you care about.

If you get premium subsidies but not big discounts, you may be better off with a gold or bronze plan.

If you earn between 200 percent and 400 percent of the poverty level, about $24,000 to $48,000 for a single person, you qualify for help paying your premiums from the federal government.

Because most states are increasing prices on silver plans, which are used to calculate your subsidy, you are likely to have more buying power this year if you want to buy a gold plan, with a lower deductible. In the past, the cheapest gold plans have always cost more than the cheapest silvers.

If you are older than 40 or earn less than $30,000, there may be even more places where you can find a free bronze plan.

Even if you are not in a place where you can benefit from a cheaper gold or free bronze plan, the law’s subsidy structure still protects you from price increases. Indeed, many people who buy the least expensive silver plans for 2018 will pay less out of pocket than they did this year.

If you don’t get any government subsidies, you are probably better off looking outside the Obamacare marketplace.

If you make over 400 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $48,000 for a single person, you can’t collect a subsidy, and you’re on the hook for the whole price of your coverage.

But in many states, though not all, there will be silver plans you can buy directly from an insurer that will cost less than the plans that are sold on the Obamacare marketplace. A human or online broker can help you explore all those options.

Look at the example below, to get a sense of the better deals you may be able to find outside the state exchange.

If you have Obamacare coverage this year, don’t just renew your coverage without exploring all your options.

This is such an odd year for price increases that switching may get you better coverage for less money.

Republican leaders also confirmed they would maintain a federal tax deduction for at least some state and local property taxes paid, while eliminating comparable deductions for income and sales taxes.
In the afternoon, Mr. Ryan met with Mr. Trump and then with more than a dozen conservative groups on the tax bill, including the Heritage Foundation and Americans for Prosperity.
Republicans had proposed wiping out the entire deduction for state and local taxes, which is particularly valuable to high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California.
“The Democrats will say our tax bill is for the rich, but they know it’s not,” he said.","As Republicans rushed to lock down support from their members and key interest groups earlier on Tuesday, some new details of the bill began to trickle out.

Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, told conservative groups on Tuesday afternoon that the draft bill would cut the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent immediately, and not phase it in over a period of years, as had been discussed, according to a meeting attendee.

Mr. Ryan also said that the plan would include a higher rate for the wealthiest earners, which would be above the 35 percent that Republicans have identified as their top tax rate in the framework released in September. He did not indicate whether the wealthiest would continue to pay the current top rate of 39.6 percent or if it would be higher or lower.

Attendees were also told by Mr. Ryan that Republicans would phase in a full repeal of the estate tax over several years.

The House bill will include a worldwide minimum tax on multinational corporations’ profits, two people with knowledge of the drafting said, in an effort to prevent companies from shifting money abroad as the United States transitions to a so-called territorial tax system, which would subject only income earned domestically to the American corporate tax rate. The tax would be on all global income, and not on a country-by-country basis, as some companies had feared.

Republican leaders also confirmed they would maintain a federal tax deduction for at least some state and local property taxes paid, while eliminating comparable deductions for income and sales taxes.

Other issues remained in flux or unknown outside of a select group of lawmakers and congressional staff. Those include the size of an expanded child tax credit; whether to phase in or sunset some rate cuts; and the specifics of how the plan might affect tax-free retirement savings.

Mr. Trump invited nearly two dozen leaders of major business groups — including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Petroleum Institute and the American Farm Bureau Federation — to the White House on Tuesday morning to discuss the bill. In the afternoon, Mr. Ryan met with Mr. Trump and then with more than a dozen conservative groups on the tax bill, including the Heritage Foundation and Americans for Prosperity.

Each of those groups — and in many cases, individual companies — will be watching for how lawmakers change tax breaks large and small in their overhaul of the tax code. Business leaders, in particular, are ready to applaud or attack the bill depending on how those changes affect their bottom lines.

“We’re trying to see, and evaluate with a calculator at the end of the day, are the incentives going to be right to help the economy to grow?” said David Stevens, the president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, whose industry has much at stake in the rewrite of the tax code.

A Halloween-themed news release from Mr. Ryan’s office on Tuesday suggested that Republicans are prepared for many business groups to oppose the bill when it is released. “The special interest ghouls will do anything to protect all their little tricks and treats,” the release said. “They will haunt the hallways and demonize our plan. They will conjure up new scare tactics and spread wicked tales.”

Party leaders are already struggling to kill off some tax breaks they had targeted for elimination. Republicans had proposed wiping out the entire deduction for state and local taxes, which is particularly valuable to high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California. After running into resistance from lawmakers, Mr. Brady said over the weekend that the coming tax plan would include “an itemized property tax deduction to help taxpayers with local tax burdens.”

In an interview on Tuesday with the radio host Hugh Hewitt, Mr. Brady said the tax bill would not include a deduction for state or local income taxes.

“Our lawmakers in those high-tax states really believe their families are being punished the most by property taxes,” Mr. Brady said, adding that those taxes “are not based on your ability to pay — they’re just painful.”

Mr. Brady also signaled the deduction for property taxes could be limited. Asked if there would be no cap on that deduction, Mr. Brady responded, “To be determined.”

Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, said on Tuesday it was clear that the original plan to fully eliminate the deduction for state and local taxes was “not going to occur.”

“I think that shows a demonstration by our leadership and by the powers to be that we recognize that this issue needs to be resolved,” Mr. Reed told reporters. He said that retaining a deduction for property taxes was “gaining traction as we get to the finish line here.”

It did not appear on Tuesday that the compromise was sufficient to win over all the blue-state House Republicans who had raised concerns.

Democrats criticized the compromise. “Go figure that high property-tax states like Texas, Chairman Brady’s state, would be better off under the proposal,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader. “Picking winners and losers like this doesn’t solve the problem. The new state and local compromise is still a nearly trillion-dollar tax hike on the middle class to pay for tax giveaways to big corporations and the very wealthy.”

Mr. Trump pushed back on Democratic criticism in his meeting with business leaders.

“The Democrats will say our tax bill is for the rich, but they know it’s not,” he said. He added, “The Democrats want to raise taxes and really create obstruction, and the Republicans want to lower taxes, and we want to get rid of regulations.”","Republicans Delay Releasing Tax Bill, Signaling Trouble for Party",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/us/politics/trump-house-republicans-tax-cut-rollout-wednesday.html

Amazon showed on Thursday how it continues to play by rules that cause fits of despair among conventional retailers. For a company its size and age, it reports meager profits, choosing to plow the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.

Amazon said its net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $256 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $252 million, also 52 cents a share, during the same period last year.

But Amazon also gave investors the numbers they love to see, a 34 percent jump to $43.7 billion in revenue, as it continued to nibble away at the pocketbooks of customers. The company’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, jumped 30 percent to $4.58 billion in revenue, which Wall Street loves because it accounts for most of what little profit the company reports.

Amazon’s recent acquisition of Whole Foods Markets has sparked concerns from rivals that the company could become a terrifying new force in the huge category of grocery retailing. During the quarter, Amazon said, Whole Foods added $1.3 billion to its overall revenue.

The most remarkable sign of Amazon’s growth may be its rise in head count, most of which occurs in its warehouses. At the end of September, Amazon had 541,900 employees, up 77 percent from a year earlier.

The average earnings estimate compiled from analysts by Thomson Reuters was 3 cents a share, and the average revenue estimate was $42.14 billion.

On a conference call with financial analysts, Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, and Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive officer, were not asked about Google’s pending appearance before Congress.

Unlike Amazon, Alphabet gushed profits. Alphabet reported net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share — surpassing Wall Street’s earnings forecasts by more than a dollar. The company is bringing in more revenue — up 24 percent — while squeezing more profit from every dollar it brings in.

In July, when Alphabet previously reported quarterly results, investors shrugged off a $2.7 billion fine from the European Commission, the European Union’s administrative arm. The fine temporarily hit the company’s bottom line but did little to slow revenue growth or demand for its advertising.

Alphabet accounts for about 32 percent of all global digital advertising spending, according to research firm eMarketer. When it is combined with Facebook, the pair account for roughly half of all internet ad spending in the world.

With earnings showing no signs of slowing, Alphabet continues to amass a cash war chest. The company’s stockpile of cash and marketable securities topped $100 billion — or roughly the market value of Goldman Sachs.

Microsoft is mentioned less frequently as a potential target for regulators, in part because it already went through an agonizing antitrust saga in the 1990s and 2000s, one that hobbled it when big shifts in technology were looming.

But in the past several years, Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has revived the company, in part by redoubling its focus on cloud computing, where it has emerged as a credible No. 2 competitor to Amazon.

While Microsoft is not the fearsome leviathan it once was, it is still a moneymaking machine. On Thursday, the Redmond, Wash., company reported net income of $6.58 billion, or 85 cents a share, up from $5.67 billion, or 73 cents a share, the previous year. Revenue was up 12 percent to $24.54 billion.

The average earnings estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters was 72 cents a share, with revenue of $23.56 billion. Its shares jumped 3 percent.

Microsoft executives credited much of the company’s success in the quarter to growth in its cloud computing business, which encompasses everything from online storage to internet-based versions of Microsoft’s Office applications that customers subscribe to rather than purchase.

The company said its commercial cloud business had brought in $5 billion in revenue, up 56 percent from the previous year.

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

His twin brother seemed to be invited to a party a week. Why were the families of kids with special needs different? Was the idea of reaching out too painful because it meant the risk of rejection?

When I finally invited another child for a play date, his mother wept with astonishment and appreciation. Our kids were doing something everyone else’s kids did.

This inspired me to have a little end-of-year celebration for my son’s small preschool class in our backyard. Everyone came and some brought wrapped gifts even though it wasn’t a birthday party. It was clear that this was the first party most of the children had been invited to. I had a few more parties, but as kids grow older, parents naturally step back, leaving the kids to bond with the friends of their choosing — the typical way.

In elementary school, my son with disabilities lagged behind his twin in friendships and maturity. He could not see faces clearly and missed social cues. It wasn’t until middle school, a time I feared the most for him, that he truly connected with a friend. This boy lived right in our neighborhood but had attended a different elementary school, so they didn’t know each other. Then they started riding the middle school bus together and bonded because the other boy also had some visual struggles. They found that they both loved cats and video games, so they started to hang out.

My son used his white cane to walk to this friend’s house, which turned out to be just around the block. I would stand at my dining room window and watch him disappear around the corner with his cane swaying back and forth in front of him just as he had been trained to do. I felt anxious about letting him go, worrying that he might get lost, but I was proud of his courageous independence.

His friend’s family even took him with them for an overnight trip to Cape Cod. My son, who is medically fragile, had an incident at the beach that required medical assistance, which his friend’s mom handled like a pro.

My son is now a sophomore in high school and has made several friends through school and our church youth group. Despite his limited vision, he has found a passion in film, photography and editing videos. He even films the high school football games for his TV production class and has wonderful teachers and fellow classmates who support him.

His confidence is growing daily. When he visited one friend’s house, the dad texted my husband ahead of time to make sure they had some of our son’s favorite snacks, which was so sweet.

Last Halloween, he went trick-or-treating with a friend whose dad gleefully accompanied them, dressed in full costume himself. He went along to help keep our son safe in the dark, because of his limited vision and his own son’s special needs. This dad innately understood the importance of their friendship.

Although our son still shares activities with his twin, the social validation of spending time with other children his age who actively choose his company is something precious. As parents, our job is to be there to encourage and guide but stay out of the way, too. As much as we may want to intervene and orchestrate at times, friendships form through exposure to other kids with shared interests; true friendships need time and space to develop.

Mind What Experts Know About Men Who Rape Image A dissertation called “The Undetected Rapist” included articles with these headlines. The author suggested that they contribute to misconceptions about rapists, most of whom do not appear in news stories or in court. Credit

In 1976, a Ph.D. candidate at Claremont Graduate University placed a rather unusual personal ad in newspapers throughout Los Angeles:

Image Credit Samuel D. Smithyman

He sat by his phone, skeptical that it would ring. “I didn’t think that anyone would want to respond,” said Samuel D. Smithyman, now 72 and a clinical psychologist in South Carolina.

But the phone did ring. Nearly 200 times.

At the other end of the line were a computer programmer who had raped his “sort of girlfriend,” a painter who had raped his acquaintance’s wife, and a school custodian who described 10 to 15 rapes as a means of getting even with “rich bastards” in Beverly Hills.

By the end of the summer, Dr. Smithyman had completed 50 interviews, which became the foundation for his dissertation: “The Undetected Rapist.” What was particularly surprising to him was how normal these men sounded and how diverse their backgrounds were. He concluded that few generalizations could be made.

Over the past few weeks, women across the world have recounted tales of harassment and sexual assault by posting anecdotes to social media with the hashtag #MeToo . Even just focusing on the second category, the biographies of the accused are so varied that they seem to support Dr. Smithyman’s observation.

But more recent research suggests that there are some commonalities. In the decades since his paper, scientists have been gradually filling out a picture of men who commit sexual assaults.

The most pronounced similarities have little to do with the traditional demographic categories, like race, class and marital status. Rather, other kinds of patterns have emerged: these men begin early, studies find. They may associate with others who also commit sexual violence. They usually deny that they have raped women even as they admit to nonconsensual sex.

Clarifying these and other patterns, many researchers say, is the most realistic path toward curtailing behaviors that cause so much pain.

“If you don’t really understand perpetrators, you’re never going to understand sexual violence,” said Sherry Hamby , editor of the journal Psychology of Violence. That may seem obvious, but she said she receives “10 papers on victims” for every one on perpetrators.

This may be partly connected to a tendency to consider sexual assault a women’s issue even though men usually commit the crime. But finding the right subjects also has complicated the research.

Early studies relied heavily on convicted rapists. This skewed the data, said Neil Malamuth, a psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has been studying sexual aggression for decades.

Men in prison are often “generalists,” he said: “They would steal your television, your watch, your car. And sometimes they steal sex.”

But men who commit sexual assault, and are not imprisoned because they got away with it, are often “specialists.” There is a strong chance that this is their primary criminal transgression.

More recent studies tend to rely on anonymous surveys of college students and other communities, which come with legal language assuring subjects their answers cannot be used against them. The studies avoid using terms such as “rape” and “sexual assault.”

Instead, they ask subjects highly specific questions about their actions and tactics. The focus of most sexual aggression research is acknowledged nonconsensual sexual behavior. In questionnaires and in follow-up interviews, subjects are surprisingly open about ignoring consent.

Men who rape tend to start young, in high school or the first couple of years of college, likely crossing a line with someone they know, the research suggests.

Some of these men commit one or two sexual assaults and then stop. Others — no one can yet say what portion — maintain this behavior or even pick up the pace.

Antonia Abbey, a social psychologist at Wayne State University, has found that young men who expressed remorse were less likely to offend the following year, while those who blamed their victim were more likely to do it again.

One repeat offender put it this way: “I felt I was repaying her for sexually arousing me.”

There is a heated debate among experts about whether there is a point at which sexual assault becomes an entrenched behavior and what percentage of assaults are committed by serial predators.

Most researchers agree that the line between the occasional and frequent offender is not so clear. The recent work of Kevin Swartout , a professor of psychology and public health at Georgia State University, suggests that low-frequency offenders are more common on college campuses than previously thought.

“It’s a matter of degree, more like dosage,” said Mary P. Koss , a professor of public health at the University of Arizona, who is credited with coining the term “date rape.”

Dosage of what? Certain factors — researchers call them “risk factors” while acknowledging that these men are nonetheless responsible for their actions — have an outsize presence among those who commit sexual assaults.

Heavy drinking, perceived pressure to have sex, a belief in “rape myths” — such as the idea that no means yes — are all risk factors among men who have committed sexual assault. A peer group that uses hostile language to describe women is another one.

Yet there also seem to be personal attributes that have a mediating effect on these factors. Men who are highly aroused by rape porn — another risk factor — are less likely to attempt sexual assault if they score highly on measures of empathy, Dr. Malamuth has found.

Narcissism seems to work in the other direction, magnifying odds that men will commit sexual assault and rape.

What about the idea that rape is about power over women? Some experts feel that research into hostile attitudes toward women supports this idea.

In general, however, researchers say motives are varied and difficult to quantify.

Dr. Malamuth has noticed that repeat offenders often tell similar stories of rejection in high school and of looking on as “jocks and the football players got all the attractive women.”

As these once-unpopular, often narcissistic men become more successful, he suspects that “getting back at these women, having power over them, seems to have become a source of arousal.”

Most subjects in these studies freely acknowledge nonconsensual sex — but that does not mean they consider it real rape. Researchers encounter this contradiction again and again.

Asked “if they had penetrated against their consent,” said Dr. Koss, the subject will say yes. Asked if he did “something like rape,” the answer is almost always no.

Studies of incarcerated rapists — even men who admit to keeping sex slaves in conflict zones — find a similar disconnect. It’s not that they deny sexual assault happens; it’s just that the crime is committed by the monster over there .

And this is not a sign that the respondents are psychopaths, said Dr. Hamby, the journal editor. It’s a sign that they are human. “No one thinks they are a bad guy,” she said.

Indeed, experts note one last trait shared by men who have raped: they do not believe they are the problem.

These efforts at obfuscation and misdirection would be laughable, but they are linked to a very real and dangerous move by Trump allies throughout right-wing media and the government to shut down the Russia investigation for good.

It’s no secret that Mr. Trump has been itching to get rid of Mr. Mueller since soon after his appointment as special counsel in May. Mr. Trump’s advisers have told him that would be a terrible idea and have reportedly talked him out of it more than once.

Mr. Trump would be wise to continue to ignore these loony ideas and restrain his own authoritarian reflexes. The president of the United States, no less than any citizen, lives under the law, not above it; Mr. Mueller’s investigation is the embodiment of that fact. Removing him now, after he has already secured two indictments, including one for Mr. Trump’s former campaign chief, and a guilty plea by a foreign-policy adviser, would send the message that Mr. Trump and his aides are accountable to no one.

Over the last several weeks, a few top Republicans have found the courage to say out loud what a majority of Americans have known for a long time: With his erratic behavior and antidemocratic eruptions, Donald Trump is presenting a profound danger to security of the nation and the stability of the world order. So far, these dissidents have beat their chests in a safe space, giving eloquent speeches on their way out the door.

But it will not be hard for them to turn their words into actions if Mr. Trump gives in to an impulse to fire Mr. Mueller. Do the math: Three Republican senators (looking at you, Mr. McCain, Mr. Corker and Mr. Flake), joining with 48 Democrats, could bring the Senate to a halt until Mr. Mueller was reinstated — no tax cuts, no more judges confirmed.

The scenario in which Mr. Mueller loses his job, or Mr. Trump further abuses his pardon power, is hypothetical — and may it remain so — but if it materializes, it will fall to Congress to defend the foundations of American democracy, the separation of powers and the rule of law.",That Crazy Talk About Robert Mueller,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/opinion/that-crazy-talk-about-robert-mueller.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“The idea that people who regain lost weight are necessarily slothful and gluttonous is an unfortunate stigmatization that is not based in fact,” he said.","The study was published on Tuesday in the journal Obesity. The lead author, Kevin Hall, chief of the Integrative Physiology Section at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and his colleagues also presented their work at the Obesity Society’s annual meeting.

Although the study is very small and must be replicated, Dr. Hall said, it is the first to assess obese people years after they lost weight with state-of-the-art methods to measure the calories they had consumed and the amount of exercise they had done.

The researchers did their measurements when the contestants were chosen, and again at six weeks, 30 weeks and six years after the contest began.

After ‘The Biggest Loser,’ Their Bodies Fought to Regain Weight

“The findings here are important,” said Rena Wing, a psychiatry professor at Brown University and a founder of the National Weight Control Registry, which includes more than 10,000 people.

The food eaten “is the key determinant of initial weight loss. And physical activity is the key to maintenance,” she said.

The study also helps explain why that might be. One consequence of weight loss among the Biggest Loser participants was a greatly slowed metabolism.

The subjects were burning an average of 500 fewer calories a day than would be expected, Dr. Hall and his colleagues found. In essence, their bodies were fighting against weight loss.

Those who kept the weight off “are countering the drop in metabolism with physical activity,” Dr. Hall said.

During the initial weight loss, the equation was different. Then, the difference between how much weight “Biggest Loser” contestants lost could be explained by the number of calories they cut from their diets. The amount of exercise did not distinguish those who lost more from those who lost less.

The contestants competed for six months to see who could lose the most weight. Participants followed a grueling diet and an exhausting exercise program.

Contestants’ average weight at the start of the show was 329 pounds. At the end, it was 200 pounds, a 129-pound loss. But six years after the study ended, their average weight rebounded to 290 pounds, just 38 pounds less than when they started.

That average, though, hid wide variations.

To learn more, Dr. Hall and his colleagues divided the group of 14 into two. There were the “regainers,” the seven participants who ended up after six years weighing five pounds more on average than they had at the start.

And there were the “maintainers,” the seven who maintained an average weight loss of 81 pounds.

To measure the number of calories the contestants burned, the researchers asked the subjects to drink “doubly labeled water,” in which hydrogen and oxygen atoms are at least partially replaced by stable isotopes, which have a different atomic mass.

The oxygen isotopes appear in carbon dioxide exhaled by subjects, which allowed the researchers to estimate the average amount exhaled each day. The more calories burned, the more carbon dioxide exhaled.

Some “Biggest Loser” contestants — including the first author, Dr. Jennifer Kerns, now an obesity specialist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington — said the conclusions of the new study confirmed their own experiences.

Dr. Kerns, a contestant in Season 3 of the show, says she has managed to keep off 100 pounds only by tracking everything she eats and by exercising on an elliptical cross-trainer for 35 to 40 minutes a day. In addition, her job requires her to walk around the hospital seeing patients.

She has learned that she cannot relax this regimen if she wants to maintain her weight. “My natural tendency is to regain,” she said.

Erinn Egbert was a candidate for Season 8 of the “Biggest Loser” but ultimately did not make the cut. So she went home “to figure it out on my own.”

She hired two trainers and followed a diet and exercise program while she finished her senior year at Ohio State University. She weighed 237 pounds when the show began and lost about 120 pounds.

She has maintained a weight that is just eight pounds more. She does it with rigid portion control and regular, intense exercise — 45 minutes to an hour a day, Monday through Saturday, doing the Beachbody programs, a challenging combination of strength training and cardiovascular exercise.

Ms. Egbert, who is 30 and lives in Lexington, Ky., says she learned the importance of working consistently to stay thin, even with a slowed metabolism.

“You have got to keep at it every single day,” she said.

It’s a difficult task for virtually anyone, Dr. Kerns said: “The amount of time and dedication it takes to manage one’s food intake and prioritize exercise every day can be an untenable burden for many people.”

“It’s totally unfair to judge those who can’t do it,” she added.

Dr. Hall agreed. “The idea that people who regain lost weight are necessarily slothful and gluttonous is an unfortunate stigmatization that is not based in fact,” he said.

Danny Cahill, who is 47 and lives in Tulsa, Okla., is among those who found it increasingly difficult to keep up the sort of regimen he needed to avoid gaining weight.

He won the “Biggest Loser” competition in Season 8. He weighed 430 pounds when the show began, and lost 239 of them.

For the four years after the show, he exercised more than two and half hours a day and gained back just 40 pounds.

Then the injuries began, forcing him to cut back his workouts to one and half hours a day. His weight crept up to 235 pounds.

The next year, “my body just started breaking down,” he said. “I had a foot injury, a wrist injury. I couldn’t keep it up.” And he was exhausted.

His weight went up to 300 pounds. For the last two years, his weight has remained stable at about 340 to 350 pounds, “but only because I am eating as very little as I can,” he said.

“That’s the disheartening part,” Mr. Cahill said. Losing the pounds is one thing. Keeping them off?

The ocean is full of plastic. Eight million tons are dumped in the seas every year. Plastic bags have been found in the guts of dead sea turtles, which mistake them for jellyfish. More than 200 species have been documented eating plastic, which looks colorful and edible but can kill them.

In lab experiments, even tiny corals, the organisms that make up reefs, have been observed nibbling on a confetti of broken down plastic fragments similar to what swirls through the depths. But they aren’t just eating whatever floats by. Instead, according to a new study in Marine Pollution Bulletin, some of the chemicals infused in the plastic may actually taste like food to the corals.

It isn’t yet clear how much plastic is consumed by corals in the wild, or what harm it might do to these important marine organisms, which are already threatened by environmental dangers like warming seas and pollution. But understanding why plastic might appeal to them is important, especially because some particles appear to get stuck in the corals, potentially disrupting their digestive process.

Hundreds of chemicals are mixed into plastics to achieve certain textures or other characteristics. Because the corals sense the presence of food with receptors, it would not be all that surprising if some chemical additives mimicked substances that set off the corals’ appetites, suggested Alexander Seymour and Austin Allen, who were both graduate students at Duke University when they led this study.

In their experiment, the researchers offered corals collected from North Carolina’s coastal waters two different kinds of plastic to see what would be more popular: plastic dipped in seawater and covered with a thin layer of bacteria, or weathered plastic without added bacteria. The corals seemed to prefer the bacteria-free plastic, ingesting more of it than the other shards.

For one thing, the nation can’t come to terms with a tricky five-letter word: merit. Michael Young, a British sociologist, coined the pejorative term “meritocracy” over a half-century ago to describe a future in which standardized intelligence tests would crown a new elite. Yet as Rebecca Zwick explains in her new book “Who Gets In?” the meaning has shifted. The word “merit,” she writes, has come to mean “academic excellence, narrowly defined” as grades and test scores.

But that’s just one way to think of an applicant’s worthiness. Dr. Zwick, professor emeritus at the University of California at Santa Barbara, has long been a researcher at the Educational Testing Service, which develops and administers the SAT. She disputes the notion that testing prowess — or any other attribute, for that matter — entitles a student to a spot at his chosen college. “There is, in fact, no absolute definition of merit,” she writes.

That brings us to you, the anxious applicant, the frazzled parent, the confused citizen, all wondering what colleges want. It’s worth taking a deep breath and noting that only 13 percent of four-year colleges accept fewer than half of their applicants. That said, colleges where seats are scarce stir up the nation’s emotions. Each year, the world-famous institutions reject thousands and thousands of students who could thrive there.

Yes, rejection stings. But say these words aloud: The admissions process isn’t fair. Like it or not, colleges aren’t looking to reel in the greatest number of straight-A students who’ve taken seven or more Advanced Placement courses. A rejection isn’t really about you; it’s about a maddening mishmash of competing objectives.

Just as parents give teenagers a set of chores, colleges hand their admissions leaders a list of things to accomplish. When they fail, they often get fired.

“We don’t live in a cloud — the reality is, there’s a bottom line,” said Angel B. Pérez, vice president for enrollment and student success at Trinity College, in Hartford. “We’re an institution, but we’re also a business.”

On many campuses, financial concerns affect decisions about whom to admit. A recent report by the National Association for College Admission Counseling found that about half of institutions said an applicant’s “ability to pay” was of at least “some importance” in admissions decisions. Among other targets is geographic diversity, which is now seen as an indicator of institutional strength and popularity. (Some presidents have been known to gripe if the freshman class doesn’t represent all 50 states.) A campus might also need a particular number of engineering majors or goalies.

Indeed, a college could accept 33 percent of all applicants, but that doesn’t mean each applicant has a one-in-three chance. Success depends on what a student brings to the table.

Generally, nothing carries more weight in admissions than grades (plus strength of the high school curriculum) and ACT/SAT scores. With limited time and resources, those metrics offer a relatively quick way to predict who will succeed. But the measures have drawbacks. Grade inflation has complicated the task of evaluating achievements, and so has the variance in high school grading policies. Standardized test scores correlate with family income; white and Asian-American students fare better than black and Hispanic students do. Also, when colleges talk about predicting “success,” they usually mean first-year grades — a limited definition.

And so, many colleges rely on “holistic” evaluations, allowing colleges to contextualize applicants’ academic records and to identify disadvantaged students who might lack the sparkling credentials of their affluent peers. Did they attend low-performing high schools or well-resourced ones? Did they participate in extracurricular activities? Do they have leadership experience?

What colleges look for sends a powerful message about what matters, not just to admissions officers but in life, and students often respond accordingly.

Dr. Pérez, a first-generation college student who grew up in a low-income family, recently revamped Trinity’s process to better identify promising students, particularly the disadvantaged. While reading applications, its admissions officers now look for evidence of 13 characteristics — including curiosity, empathy, openness to change and ability to overcome adversity — that researchers associate with successful students. These are also qualities that the liberal-arts college values, inside and outside the classroom.

Trinity’s officers can check as many qualities as apply using a drop-down box labeled “Predictors of Success.” They must note where they saw evidence of each quality in the application. “It can’t be just a hint,” Dr. Pérez said. He recalls a teacher recommendation describing how an applicant had taken a stand on a controversial social issue in class, even though other students vocally disagreed with him. Impressed, Dr. Pérez checked the box for “Comfort in Minority of 1,” a sign, perhaps, that the student would contribute to campus dialogues. Also on the drop-down: “Delayed Gratification” and “Risk Taking.”

While Trinity still values conventional measures, the new model has expanded the staff’s understanding of merit. “We’re trying to give students more credit for these characteristics, especially those who’ve had some challenges,” Dr. Pérez said. The new approach, along with the college’s recent decision to stop requiring ACT/SAT scores, has helped it diversify its classes. Low-income and first-generation students represent 15 percent of this fall’s freshman class, up from 8 percent three years ago.

“I’m trying to increase the tools we have, and get beyond a system that is absolutely antiquated,” Dr. Pérez said. “As the country becomes more diverse, as we learn more about the correlation between standardized test scores and wealth, we have to be a lot more creative in predicting for success in college.”

What most colleges ask for from applicants doesn’t reveal much about the many skills and talents a student might possess. But what if colleges asked for more?

The admissions process at Olin College of Engineering includes a live audition. After completing a traditional application, selected students visit the campus, in Needham, Mass., for an intense two-day tryout. In addition to sitting for interviews, they work in small groups to complete a tabletop design challenge, such as building a tower that can hold a specific weight. On the second day, they are given another task, like designing a campus building. This time, evaluators observe each student, noting how well they communicate with others and adapt on the fly.

The experience is meant to help prospective students understand Olin’s collaborative culture, while giving the college a better glimpse of each applicant before finalizing acceptance. “It’s hard to nail down a student’s mind-set from the traditional elements of the application,” said Emily Roper-Doten, the dean of admission and financial aid. “This allows us to see them in motion, in an educational moment.”

A desire to see what students can do with their hands inspired a recent change at one of the world’s most renowned campuses. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (motto: “Mens et manus,” Latin for “Mind and hand”) now gives applicants the option of submitting a Maker Portfolio to show their “technical creativity.”

Applicants can send images, a short video and a PDF that shed light on a project they’ve undertaken — clothing they’ve made, apps they’ve designed, cakes they’ve baked, furniture they’ve built, chain mail they’ve woven. M.I.T. also asks students to explain what the project meant to them, as well as how much help they got. A panel of faculty members and alumni reviews the portfolios.

Last year, about 5 percent of applicants submitted a Makers Portfolio. “It gives us a fuller picture of the student,” said Stuart Schmill, dean of admissions and student financial services. “Without this, some applicants might not be able to fully get across how good a fit they are for us.”

M.I.T.’s experiment has sparked discussions among admissions deans, some of whom say they plan to offer similar opportunities for applicants to send evidence of project-based learning. They describe the Makers Portfolio as an intriguing glimpse of how a college might better align its process with its culture and values. The catch: Reviewing all those portfolios takes time, something admissions offices lack. Even a small college like Olin, which welcomed fewer than 100 new students this fall, must scramble to pull off its elaborate evaluations. Larger campuses couldn’t even consider such an approach.

Thorough review has become more challenging over the last decade, with waves of applicants overwhelming big-name colleges, victims of their own popularity. The University of California at Los Angeles received more than 100,000 applications for about 6,000 spots this fall. Stanford got 44,000 for just over 1,700 spots, and M.I.T. juggled more than 20,000 for 1,450 seats.

Most colleges are considering more incremental ways to enhance evaluations. The Coalition for Access, Affordability and Success, with more than 130 prominent campuses as members, recently established an application platform with a feature called a virtual college locker, a private space where students can upload materials, such as videos and written work, that they could later add to their applications. Among its stated goals: to make admissions more personal.

So far, most of its members aren’t asking applicants to send anything different than before. But that could change. A handful of colleges are planning experiments using alternative ways to measure student potential. One hopes to enable applicants to demonstrate their “emotional intelligence,” or E.Q., to showcase their ability to work with others, according to Annie Reznik, the coalition’s executive director. Another seeks a way for prospective students to display their “fire” for learning.

“We want better inputs,” said Jeremiah Quinlan, dean of undergraduate admissions and financial aid at Yale. “The inputs we have predict success academically. Now, we have the ability to get to know a student better, from a different type of submission.”

Like many deans, Mr. Quinlan has grown wary of polished personal essays in which applicants describe their achievements. “They feel like they have to show off, because we’re so selective,” he said, “and it’s completely understandable.” Technology, he believes, can help colleges get to know the student beneath the surface of a résumé, to gain a better sense of their passions, the kind of community member the applicant might be.

Last year, Yale allowed students using the coalition’s application to submit a document, image, audio file or video in response to a prompt (they also had to reflect, in 250 words or less, on their submission). When Justin Aubin heard about that option last fall, he thought, “Cool!”

Mr. Aubin, from Oak Lawn, Ill., was then a high school senior hoping to attend Yale. The following prompt caught his eye: “A community to which you belong and the footprint you have left.” He submitted a short video documenting his Eagle Scout project, for which he oversaw the construction of a monument honoring veterans. Even a well-written essay, he figured, couldn’t capture his experience as well as four minutes of footage, shot by his older brother.

The content of the video impressed Yale’s admissions committee. “People sat up in their chairs,” Mr. Quinlan said. “You could see how he handled his leadership role, and we felt like we got a good sense of him in a way that we didn’t get from recommendations.”

Mr. Aubin is now a freshman at Yale.

Did the video tip the scales? “That was a difference-maker,” Mr. Quinlan said.

•

Even as colleges consider innovation, it’s worth asking which fixtures of the admissions process, if any, they are willing to discard. Some prevalent practices seem to stand in the way of meaningful change.

Giving an advantage to the sons and daughters of alumni is one such practice. Some colleges admit legacies (and the children of potential donors) at a much greater rate than non-legacies. Legacies make up nearly a third of Harvard’s current freshman class, The Harvard Crimson has reported. Princeton’s class of 2021 is 13 percent legacy, according to the university’s website.

While a handful of prominent institutions, including the University of Georgia and Texas A&M University, stopped considering legacy status more than a decade ago, most colleges seem unlikely to remove that variable from the admissions equation anytime soon. “I don’t think an applicant’s legacy status is a crazy thing to look at, especially in the financial climate some colleges are in,” said Rick Clark, director of undergraduate admission at Georgia Tech, where nearly a fifth of freshmen are legacies. “Colleges have to think about their longevity.”

The benefits of legacies go beyond maintaining good will with alumni who might open their wallets, Mr. Clark said. In his experience, they tend to be enthusiastic students who help foster community on campus, the kind of relationships that help other students feel at home and succeed. “Multigenerational ties to a place add value, creating this passionate, magnetic source of energy,” he said.

The key, Mr. Clark believes, is not to lower standards, or to enroll so many legacies that other priorities, such as increasing racial and socioeconomic diversity, suffer as a result. “Those two goals aren’t mutually exclusive,” he said.

Other measurements used by selective colleges have nothing to do with a student’s accomplishments or attributes — and everything to do with a college’s agenda.

About one in five institutions allot “considerable importance” to “demonstrated interest,” the degree to which applicants convey their desire to enroll if accepted, according to a survey by the National Association for College Admission Counseling. The strongest expression of demonstrated interest is applying for binding early decision, a policy that favors affluent students who don’t need to compare financial aid offers and one that some colleges use to fill half their seats.

Beyond that, technology has made it easier to track the number of times an applicant engages with a college (by visiting the campus, contacting an admissions officer, responding to an email). This valuable information helps officers gauge who’s most likely to enroll, which can influence who gets admitted in the first place. A higher “yield,” the percentage of accepted students who actually enroll, is widely seen as a measure of status.

The problem is that savvy students who know colleges are watching them can tilt the odds in their favor, said Nancy Leopold, executive director of CollegeTracks, a Maryland nonprofit group that helps low-income and first-generation students get into college: “Demonstrated interest is biased against kids who don’t know the game exists, or who don’t have the time or money to play it.”

What do colleges really cherish? The answer is influenced greatly by the entities they seek to impress. U.S. News & World Report and other college guides, not to mention bond-rating agencies, rely heavily on conventional admissions metrics like ACT/SAT scores and acceptance rates to evaluate institutions. A college president might wish to attract more creative thinkers, but accomplishing that goal won’t help his college’s ranking.

Generally, colleges are risk-averse. Rocking the boat with a newfangled admissions process could hurt their reputations. “The challenge for many admissions offices is to make a change, but not so much change or innovation that you’re risking the position you’re in,” said Ms. Roper-Doten of Olin. Asking students to do more could scare off would-be applicants.

“Colleges seek validation,” said Lloyd Thacker, executive director of the Education Conservancy, a nonprofit group that has sought to reform college admissions. “Without a real external incentive for colleges to care about broadening their understanding of what makes an applicant promising, they don’t seem likely to change the definition on their own.”

A recent campaign called “Turning the Tide,” a project of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, is urging admissions deans to rethink the qualities they consider in applicants. In a report signed by representatives of about 200 campuses, colleges are asked to promote ethical character and service to others through the admissions process.

Although some deans say they have no business assessing the character of still-maturing teenagers, the push has prompted a handful of institutions to tweak their applications. The University of North Carolina now emphasizes contributions to others when asking about extracurricular activities. M.I.T. added an essay question asking students to describe how they’ve helped people.

Richard Weissbourd, a senior lecturer at Harvard, who leads the initiative, recommends that colleges define service in ways that might resonate with disadvantaged students. “Many students don’t have opportunities to do community service,” he said. “They’re taking care of their siblings, or they’re working part-time jobs to help their families. Colleges need to say, ‘That matters to us.’ ”

•

In the end, increasing racial and socioeconomic diversity in higher education is a matter of will. A college can prioritize it or not, said Shaun R. Harper, a professor at the University of Southern California’s Rossier School of Education who studies race and student success.

In September, Dr. Harper gave a keynote speech at the annual conference of the National Association for College Admission Counseling, in Boston. He urged his audience to think hard about racial inequality and “things you perhaps inadvertently and unknowingly do to support it.”

He cited as examples high school counselors who discourage promising minority students from applying to highly selective colleges; college leaders who say they “just can’t find enough” qualified black applicants even as their athletics coaches comb the nation for black students who excel at sports; admissions officers who recruit at the same high schools year after year, overlooking those full of underrepresented minorities.

As Dr. Harper spoke, many listeners applauded; a few scowled. He concluded his remarks by criticizing the lack of racial diversity among admissions deans themselves. He received a standing ovation.

In a subsequent interview, Dr. Harper elaborated on his concerns. “When the demographics of the profession have not changed, particularly at the senior level,” he said, “I don’t know that we can expect a major change, especially in terms of diversifying the class.”

Although Dr. Harper believes colleges rely too heavily on ACT/SAT scores, he says that the major barriers arise well before the application process even begins. Colleges, he said, must do more in terms of outreach to encourage underrepresented students to apply.

Dr. Pérez, at Trinity, has similar concerns. Although he is convinced that the selection process can be successfully revamped, he doesn’t think that will solve the No. 1 problem he sees in admissions. “The problem is money,” he said. “If I had more funding, my class would be more diverse. The conversation we’re not having in this country is: How do we fund colleges and universities?”

However the admissions process might evolve, it surely will continue to serve the interests of colleges first and foremost. Even if someone invents a better, more equitable way to gauge applicants’ potential, a college’s many wants and needs wouldn’t change. Deans would still seek to balance their classes by enrolling a diverse mix of majors from many states and countries. Colleges would still need enough oboe players and theater-arts majors.

“What compels institutions to change is deep discontent,” said Marie Bigham, director of college counseling at Isidore Newman School, in New Orleans. “If they’re only making changes on the margins, it indicates that they’re mostly content with the way things are.”

That leads to a big question in an age of widening social inequality. How unhappy are the wealthiest colleges, really, with the status quo? Some of the nation’s most selective institutions enroll more students from the top 1 percent of the income ladder than from the bottom 60 percent. Is that simply because of lack of preparation in the K-12 system? Flaws within the selection process? Or is it evidence, as Dr. Harper suggests, of a systemic lack of will to change those numbers?

Jon Boeckenstedt, associate vice president for enrollment management and marketing at DePaul University, says that it is the high-profile colleges that have the power to redefine the admissions process.

“Unless and until something changes at the top, nothing else is going to change,” he said. “That’s because, at a lot of colleges, people will go to their graves trying to imitate the Ivy League.”",What Colleges Want in an Applicant (Everything),https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/education/edlife/what-college-admissions-wants.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

It is easy to ignore the recent story of four U.S. servicemen killed in Niger, the giant state in central Africa, because the place is so remote and the circumstances still so murky. That would be a mistake. Niger highlights a much larger problem — just how foolish, how flat-out dumb President Trump is behaving.

Trump is a person who doesn’t connect dots — even when they’re big, fat polka dots that are hard to miss. Rather, he thinks inside narrow little boxes built from his own simplistic impulses and applause lines — and that tendency is leading us into a web of contradictions abroad. Niger is a perfect example.

I know something about Niger because I did a documentary there last year for National Geographic’s “Years of Living Dangerously” climate series and wrote several columns about it for The Times. To understand why groups affiliated with ISIS and Al Qaeda are popping up in that region of central Africa, you have to connect a lot of dots, and recognize the linkages between a number of different problems — not just say, in effect: There are bad guys there. I will call “my generals.” They will kill them. I will take credit.

As defense systems expert Lin Wells once put it: To ameliorate problems in places like Niger, you must never think in the box. You must never think out of the box. “You must always think without a box.”

Why? Because what is destabilizing all of these countries in the Sahel region of Africa and spawning terrorist groups is a cocktail of climate change, desertification — as the Sahara steadily creeps south — population explosions and misgovernance.

Desertification is the trigger, and climate change and population explosions are the amplifiers. The result is a widening collapse of small-scale farming, the foundation of societies all over Africa. And that collapse is leading to a rising tide of “economic migrants, interethnic conflicts and extremism,” Monique Barbut, who heads the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and guided me in Niger, explained.

A few numbers: Niger, with rampant poverty and poor access to contraception, has one the highest birthrates in the world: 7.6 children per woman. I met a man there who boasted of 17 kids. Neighboring Nigeria is growing so fast it will replace the U.S. as the third-most-populous country in the world by 2050. Nigeria is a third bigger than Texas.

Meanwhile, climate change in the region is so severe that nearby Senegal’s national weather bureau says that from 1950 to 2015, the average temperature there rose two degrees Celsius and the average annual rainfall declined by about two inches. The Paris climate accord was designed to keep global average temperatures from rising two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by 2100.

In other words, parts of sub-Saharan Africa are already at heat levels that Paris was supposed to prevent by the end of the century — and the region is heading for a four-degree rise, which will lead to the collapse of even more small farms and lead to a mad scramble of refugees toward Europe, competition for food and more unemployed males ready to join ISIS for $50 a month.

Barbut, as I reported, reinforced her point by showing me three maps of Africa with dots concentrated in the middle of the continent. Map No. 1: the most vulnerable regions of desertification in 2008. Map No. 2: conflicts and food riots in 2007 and 2008. Map No. 3: terrorist attacks in 2012. All the dots of all three maps cluster around Niger and its neighbors. Hello?

And what is Trump’s response to this reality? It’s to focus solely on using the U.S. military to kill terrorists in Africa while offering a budget that eliminates U.S. support for global contraception programs; appointing climate-change deniers to all key environmental posts; pushing coal over clean energy; and curbing U.S. government climate research.

In short, he’s sending soldiers to fight a problem that is clearly being exacerbated by climate and population trends, while eliminating all our tools to mitigate these trends.

That’s just stupid, reckless and irresponsible — and it evinces no ability to connect the dots or think without a box.

But this is not only in Africa: Trump was obsessed with defeating ISIS in Syria and Iraq — but with as few U.S. troops as possible. The only way he could do that was by tacitly allying with Iran, Syria’s regime, Russia, pro-Iranian Shiite militias, and pro-U.S. Kurds, who were the main anti-ISIS forces on the ground. We could not defeat ISIS or stabilize Syria and Iraq without all of them.

And what is Trump’s strategy now? I have no clue. We’ve distanced ourselves from the Kurds, moved to tear up the nuclear deal with Iran and added U.S. troops in Afghanistan, a country we also can’t stabilize without the tacit help of Iran next door. If you know how these dots connect, please write.

Also: How do we stabilize our border with Mexico and maintain our neighbor’s cooperation in holding back the main source of illegal immigration today — refugees from Central America — while pursuing trade policies that have weakened the Mexican peso and the Mexican economy and could lead that country to elect its own anti-American populist-nationalist?

Nothing Trump ever says has a second paragraph. His whole shtick is just a first paragraph: Build a wall, tear up the Iran deal, tear up TPP, defeat ISIS, send troops to Niger and Afghanistan to kill terrorists, kill climate policy, kill family planning, cut taxes, raise military spending. Every box just marks an applause line he needed somewhere to get elected. Nothing connects — and we will pay for that.

Indeed, if you want to know what it looks like when a country follows a leader with no second paragraph and no ability to connect dots, visit London. I was there last week. Britain’s political system is in turmoil and its economy is facing declining growth prospects , because a bare majority voted to follow leaders with no second paragraph — we’ll just quit the European Union and everything will be fine, they said.

Well, now it’s a fine little mess they have. The ruling Conservatives have no clue how to quit the E.U. without doing even more damage to their country’s future. That’s what happens when you vote for “disrupters” who never spent a second thinking through how all of their disruptions connect the morning after the morning after.

Sound familiar?

Subaru said company rules designating who was allowed to inspect cars had been inconsistent with government guidelines for 30 years.
Subaru, which is one of Japan’s smaller carmakers, with production of about one million vehicles a year, said that 245 workers in Japan were authorized to conduct final vehicle inspections.
Those junior workers would mark inspection certificates using the name stamps of qualified supervisors, Subaru said.
“Rules are rules.”","“I’m distressed that our company is responsible for something that could cast doubt on the quality of Japanese manufacturing,” Yasuyuki Yoshinaga, chief executive of Subaru Corporation, said at a news conference on Friday. “This will be reported around the world.”

The inspection problem involves final quality checks that automakers perform on vehicles before they leave factories for dealerships.

After a car rolls off an assembly line, workers look it over and run it on rollers to ensure it is in working order. Points on their checklists include: Do the seats adjust properly? Do the headlights shine at the correct angle? Does the speedometer work accurately?

Such checks are a standard part of automobile manufacturing. But in Japan, the law requires that carmakers produce a special certificate for every vehicle to show it has passed examination; only then can it be registered as road worthy.

Government guidelines specify that workers who conduct these inspections must be “qualified” — though the authorities leave the details up to manufacturers. The car companies have the responsibility of deciding what training is required and of authorizing employees to work as qualified inspectors.

Nissan and Subaru stumbled on that step. They allowed some workers who had not completed training programs or who had not been formally authorized to be “final inspectors” to perform the checks.

The corner-cutting appears to have been long-established. Subaru said company rules designating who was allowed to inspect cars had been inconsistent with government guidelines for 30 years. Nissan says it is still investigating the scope and duration of its failure, but several news reports have suggested that it too may have been using unqualified inspectors for decades.

Independent specialists say it is unlikely that the inspection practices resulted in unsafe cars.

Automotive manufacturers and their suppliers perform multiple safety tests during development and production, and serious but hard-to-find faults — say, unstable chemicals inside an airbag inflater, which are believed to have caused the Takata hazard — are unlikely to be spotted by a limited, mostly external once-over.

Some commentators have suggested that part of the blame belongs with Japanese regulators, whose guidelines regarding inspectors appear simultaneously burdensome and vague. Cars made for export are not subject to the same rules, because governments outside Japan do not require final vehicle inspections to be carried out by workers with special training and qualifications.

“The checks are a formality, and it would not be an exaggeration to say they require no special know-how,” Hisao Inoue, a veteran Japanese automotive journalist, wrote on the website of the magazine Gendai Business after the initial admission by Nissan.

He said the inspection regulations should be reviewed, though he added that it was “absolutely wrong” for Nissan to have broken the rules.

Yoshio Tsukuda, founder of the Tsukuda Mobility Research Institute, an auto industry study firm, said Nissan and Subaru had risked their reputations and shown a disregard for following the rules, but had probably not endangered their customers.

“It makes you question how well they are managing what’s happening on the factory floor,” Mr. Tsukuda said. “Even if there is not a safety problem, users of their products will feel uneasy.”

Mr. Tsukuda said a shrinking car market in Japan may have increased the temptation to cheat. The country’s automakers are selling more and more vehicles abroad, as demand at home declines because of Japan’s falling population. Nissan, for instance — a particularly foreign-focused producer — sells 90 percent of its cars outside Japan.

That increases the cost, relative to sales, of complying with domestic-only rules — in this case by putting workers through special courses to become authorized inspectors, a process that can take them away from their normal duties over a period of weeks or even months.

“The Japan market is becoming an afterthought,” Mr. Tsukuda said.

The carmakers’ crisis management capabilities are now being tested.

In particular, critics have complained that Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan’s chief executive, failed to show sufficient contrition at a news conference about the company’s lapse. In a country where apologies are highly ritualized, even his bow — briefer and shallower than those of most executives seeking the public’s forgiveness — became a target of criticism.

Subaru, which is one of Japan’s smaller carmakers, with production of about one million vehicles a year, said that 245 workers in Japan were authorized to conduct final vehicle inspections. It said a much smaller group of employees — between four and 17 at any given time — who were studying to be inspectors but had not yet qualified, would also certify vehicles, contrary to government guidelines.

Those junior workers would mark inspection certificates using the name stamps of qualified supervisors, Subaru said.

“It was not our intention to deceive anyone, but what we did was not appropriate,” Mr. Yoshinaga said. “Rules are rules.”","Subaru Admits Inspection Failings, in Another Blow to Japan’s Carmakers",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/business/subaru-inspection-japan.html

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

The indictments on Monday of the former Trump campaign officials Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have some prominent conservatives openly considering desperate measures. The Wall Street Journal editorial board called on the special counsel whose investigation led to the indictments, Robert Mueller, to resign, arguing that he lacks the “critical distance” to carry out the inquiry. So did the New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin.

But the most radical suggestion came from two former Republican administration lawyers. To forestall a deepening crisis that could cripple the Trump White House, these lawyers, David B. Rivkin Jr. and Lee A. Casey, urged the president to issue a blanket pardon to anyone involved with Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. This isn’t just a fringe possibility. A reporter raised the idea on Tuesday; Mr. Trump didn’t answer the question.

Though such a move would not violate the Constitution, it would provoke a political disaster.

President Trump has tweeted that he has the “complete power to pardon.” As someone who supported the broadest reading of executive power as a deputy assistant attorney general during the George W. Bush administration, I think that Mr. Trump has the Constitution about right. Article II declares that the president “shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.” President Trump can clearly pardon anyone — even himself — subject to the Mueller investigation.

But unless Mr. Trump wants to meet the same end as Richard Nixon, he should resort only to pardons that promote the central purpose of the power. As Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 74, the Constitution creates a pardon power out of “humanity and good policy” to allow for “mitigation from the rigor of the law.”

So far, nothing in the Mueller inquiry cries out for considerations of mercy. Far from it.

If the facts of the indictment are to be believed, Mr. Manafort and his associate wove a dark web of shell companies and foreign bank accounts to launder millions of dollars and avoid taxes on unreported income paid by Ukraine, its former president and its pro-Russia political party. The president tweeted on Monday that “this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign.” That’s true.

The release of the twin reports on the collisions came a day after the Navy held closed-door briefings for lawmakers on Capitol Hill on its findings and recommendations, and sent officers crisscrossing the country to brief family members of the sailors killed. A broader review of the Seventh Fleet’s pace of operations, training, equipment and maintenance is to be released on Thursday.

Senator Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi, attributed the two fatal collisions to dwindling Navy resources in the Pacific, combined with judgment and training errors — a sentiment echoed by lawmakers as they left Tuesday’s private hearing.

“In general, we’re asking too few ships to do too many things,” Mr. Wicker said.

Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Tuesday also pointed to the automatic budget cuts on the Pentagon since 2013, known as sequestration, as one of the primary culprits behind the combined 17 deaths aboard the two destroyers.

“We’ve deprived them of the funds to do it,” Mr. McCain said of the continuous operations in the Pacific. “We’re putting those men and women in harm’s way to be wounded or killed because we refuse to give them the sufficient training and equipment and readiness. It’s a failure of Congress. It’s on us.”

Already the fallout from the two fatal crashes as well as two others in the western Pacific this year, has been dramatic.

The commander of the Navy’s Pacific Fleet, Adm. Scott H. Swift, took early retirement after being notified that he was no longer in the running to take charge of the Pentagon’s overall Pacific Command, which would oversee any military operations against North Korea.

Vice Adm. Joseph P. Aucoin, the former head of the Seventh Fleet, based in Japan and the Navy’s largest overseas, was removed in connection with the accidents. The Navy’s top officer for ships worldwide, Vice Adm. Thomas S. Rowden, has also said he will retire early.

Several other senior officers in the Seventh Fleet chain of command, as well as the commanding officers of the Fitzgerald and John S. McCain, have also been relieved of their duties.

Even before the more comprehensive review was conducted by Adm. Phil Davidson, the head of the Fleet Forces Command in Norfolk, Va., urgent new orders went out in early September for United States Navy warships.

These directives included more sleep and no more 100-hour workweeks for sailors. Ships steaming in crowded waters like those near Singapore and Tokyo were ordered to broadcast their positions as do other vessels. And ships whose crews lack basic seamanship certification will probably stay in port until the problems are fixed.

These were all seemingly obvious standards, military officials said, except that the Navy rushed the remedies into effect only after the two deadly collisions in two months, despite repeated warnings about the looming problems from congressional watchdogs and the Navy’s own experts dating to 2010.","Navy Collisions That Killed 17 Sailors Were ‘Avoidable,’ Official Inquiry Reports",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/us/politics/navy-collisions-avoidable.html

In a separate statement on Tuesday, the president of Dartmouth, Philip J. Hanlon, said the university was cooperating with the criminal investigation of the three professors, identified as Todd F. Heatherton, 56; William M. Kelley, 45; and Paul J. Whalen, 54.

Dr. Heatherton leads a center for social brain sciences and, according to the college’s website, conducts research in social behavior focusing on self-regulation, self-esteem and self-referential processing. He had been an unpaid visiting scholar at New York University since July, with no classroom duties, but his time there ended last Thursday “by mutual agreement,” according to John H. Beckman, an N.Y.U. spokesman.

“N.Y.U. was unaware of the Dartmouth investigation until quite recently,” Mr. Beckman said. “The university was given no specifics about its nature or duration.”

Dr. Kelley’s work focuses on memory and self-regulation, according to the website.

Dr. Heatherton and Dr. Kelley were among the authors of a 2012 research study on how images of food and sex affect the brain. As part of the research, 58 female college freshmen underwent brain scans shortly after arrival on campus while viewing 80 images each of animals, environmental scenes, food items and people — some involved in sexual scenes or consuming alcohol. Six months later, they were called back to the lab, weighed and questioned on their sexual behavior.

The study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, found that the students whose brains reacted to food and sexual stimuli gained more weight and reported greater sexual desire in the follow-up questioning. The study was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Dr. Whalen was listed as having assisted in that study.

Dr. Whalen, a popular professor who delivered a TedXDartmouth talk, runs the Whalen Lab, which conducts research on a part of the brain known as the amygdala. His published research papers include a collaboration with Drs. Kelley and Heatherton and others on the question of whether the brains of men and women react differently to attractive facial features in members of the opposite sex. That paper was published in 2008 in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience.

None of the professors could be reached for comment.

“I want to say in the most emphatic way possible that sexual misconduct and harassment are unacceptable and have no place at Dartmouth,” Mr. Hanlon said. “Such acts harm us as individuals and as members of the community.”

Mr. Hanlon’s statement referred the campus community to Dartmouth’s “sexual respect” website.",Dartmouth College Professors Investigated Over Sexual Misconduct Allegations,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/us/dartmouth-professors-sexual-misconduct.html

Papers are free — the money comes from the authors, who must pay to be published. There are well-respected open-access journals, with standards as high as traditional ones.

What happened, and what few expected, was the birth of open-access journals that will take just about any paper, for a fee. They don’t bother with the pesky expense of reviewers and they publish only online, so their costs are minimal. They send blandishing emails to scientists, inviting them to publish with them. There are now thousands of them, about as many as there are legitimate journals.

And because the names of these journals often mimic those of respected ones, some researchers have been tricked into submitting papers. I was first introduced to the phenomenon of predatory journals a few years ago, when a professor of medicine at Stanford told me he had learned of a journal with almost the same name as a prestigious one he edited. His was called Clinical Trials. The other was called Clinical Trials & Patenting. There was, he and others said, a world of difference between the two.

Along the way they earned the “predatory” epithet, because they were thought to be taking advantage of innocent scientists. But, I learned, predation is only a small part of the story. Many — probably most — academics who publish in these journals know exactly what they are doing. They are padding their résumés, taking advantage of the fact that colleges may not know if a journal is legitimate or not. When the number of publications a person has can determine his or her chances for advancement, some decide to take the easy route.

So what is a journalist to do? We don’t want to be tricked by flimsy science. But it turns out to be a lot easier for us to avoid than you might think.

Here’s the little secret of most science journalism. We usually rely on experts who publish in the most prestigious journals for advice on the legitimacy of papers. I keep an extensive and ever growing list of researchers who are knowledgeable, honest, and tuned in to the latest research and its implications. If a paper looks interesting I will call on one or two of them and ask: “Is the work credible? Does it advance the field? Are there caveats I should know about?” And when we are looking for major advances or breaking news, we rely on papers from those prestigious journals.

I have changed one of my practices, though. I used to use Google Scholar when I was looking into an area that was new to me. But now that I know that Google Scholar does not vet the journals it lists, I avoid it. Of course, as the chocolate debacle showed, not everyone who writes about science does so exclusively or has a network of experts to consult. And some papers seem so tantalizing that they are, as we say caustically, “too good to check.”

In fact, it seemed so natural that I began to wonder what other kinds of dedicated pet spaces animal lovers might have made for their pets. If I, with my limited funds and square footage, had devoted a room — albeit a very small one — to my furry friends, what kinds of over-the-top spaces were animal enthusiasts with larger budgets creating for their pets?

With a little research, I discovered such efforts could range from a living room wall transformed into a cat jungle gym to an entire studio apartment dedicated to a family of pets, including three parrots, a feral cat and a 35-year-old tortoise. Many animal lovers in New York and beyond, it seems, think nothing of the cost involved in creating a special space for their pets — even when that sort of customization might cut into the profits when it comes time to sell their homes.

Hunt Slonem, an artist celebrated for his whimsical paintings of animals (particularly bunnies), carved 1,200 square feet out of his 30,000-square-foot studio in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, for his bird family.

Mr. Slonem has kept birds as pets for most of his life, and he currently has about 60 of them, all rescues, including a 75-year-old macaw called Sebastian and a cockatoo named Clyde that follows him everywhere.

The space he has devoted to the birds features dozens of suspended cages, often left open so the birds can fly free, and tile imported from Nicaragua that Mr. Slonem said helps to “define the space and stylishly conceal the droppings.”

Inside this indoor avian community, Mr. Slonem’s birds are free to talk, spat and mate — some for life, as they see fit. The space is so open and accommodating that many of the more social birds, including a close-knit clique of Amazon parrots, make regular house calls to each other’s cages. Feeding the birds, which takes up to five hours a day, requires the full-time services of a professional bird minder who has worked for Mr. Slonem for 35 years and who serves them a fresh salad of leafy greens, melons, bananas, grapes and tofu.

In Mr. Slonem’s latest book, “Birds,” he describes them as his muses and confidantes. He regularly paints among them, and whenever he is within earshot of the aviary, he said, the birds begin to chant his name in unison. “They’re as smart as three-year-olds,” Mr. Slonem said. “And they have huge personalities. They’re my dear friends, a relief from the humdrum of life.”

While Mr. Slonem shares his sprawling studio with the birds, he hasn’t given up any of his own living space. But other New Yorkers have.

In New York by Gehry building in Manhattan, Lucy Swift Weber’s 10-year-old Yorkie, Chauncey, is recovering from cancer. When things got particularly rough last year, Ms. Weber decided to convert the guest bedroom in her two-bedroom apartment into Chauncey’s room, to “give him the space to heal.”

Along with an en-suite bathroom — good for quick water refills and easy cleanup — the dog’s bedroom has a set of customized pet stairs, a plush floor-pillow lounge and a six-foot-tall headboard that Ms. Weber upholstered in a fabric she designed herself. “It’s become this warm, comfortable world where Chauncey can relax and rehabilitate,” Ms. Weber said. “I tried to make the room both calming and cheerful enough that he would want to spend time there, and it worked. He’s in there all of the time by choice.”

But even once he is in better health, Ms. Weber said, Chauncey will continue to have a room of his own; she and her boyfriend just moved into a larger, three-bedroom apartment on another floor of the same building, so that her boyfriend’s college-age sons won’t have to sleep in Chauncey’s room when they visit.

Caroline Stern, who owns three condos on the same floor of her building on Central Park West, went a step further and dedicated an entire 650-square-foot studio to her pets, where they can sleep and roam free when they’re not with her.

Next door to Ms. Stern’s apartment, the pet condo is home to three parrots — Apricot, Sinbad and Roxanne (a Moluccan cockatoo that serves as an emotional support animal) — a feral cat named Butch and an Russian tortoise named Alberta.

To accommodate these animals, Ms. Stern filled the condo with hand-built oversized aviaries, towering bird trees and an ultraviolet-lighted reptile area with a special water bath for Alberta. “Birds are loud,” Ms. Stern said. “It’s comforting to have a soothing place to put them when I can’t deal with the screaming.”

Ms. Stern’s neighbors are more than aware of her pet condo, but for the most part, she said, they are more charmed than perturbed. “It’s an animal-friendly building,” she said. “People stop by to visit; they know they’re lucky pets.”

Such devotion raises an obvious question: When designing extravagant spaces for pets, is property value even worth taking into consideration? As adorable as some of these animal rooms are, they often come at a hefty real estate cost.

“Whether it’s for a person or a parrot, customizing a property always makes it more difficult to sell,” said Ryan Serhant, of Nest Seeker’s Serhant Team. “An animal-dedicated space makes it even more challenging, because they often leave behind lingering smells and damaged surfaces that scare prospective buyers into thinking they’d have to renovate.”

There are, however, less expensive and less intrusive ways to create inviting pet habitats.

In Penfield, N.Y., Jill Sanders sacrificed a single wall in her 15-foot-wide living room to accommodate Nadia, a one-year-old Siberian cat she has been fostering for the last seven months and plans to adopt. Three months ago, when Mrs. Sanders decided to bring home two puppies, she knew she would have to get creative to keep Nadia comfortable. So she called on Mike Wilson and Megan Hanneman, founders of Catastrophic Creations, to devise a dedicated space for Nadia along the living room wall, where the cat could play and escape from the dogs when necessary.

More than 10 feet tall and five feet off the ground, the cat playground is composed of several floating sisal post steps, scratching posts, landing shelves, canvas hammocks and a rope bridge. “Everyone that sees it is blown away by its design-savviness,” Mrs. Sanders said. “I just wanted to give her something that brought her as much joy as she brings our family.”

And in Chicago, Guita Griffiths enlisted the help of Shelley Johnstone, of Shelley Johnstone Design, to create a practical but comforting place for Margaux, her 70-pound yellow Labrador retriever, in her 110-square-foot mudroom.

“Margaux’s a big dog,” Mrs. Griffiths said. “We needed a space to keep her when guests came over, where she wouldn’t feel trapped or anxious.” The result is a 5-by-8-foot space devoted entirely to the 3-year-old dog.

Along with luxuries like heated marble floors, an overstuffed dog bed and canine-printed wallpaper, the room has a spacious sink for Margaux’s baths, storage for her leashes and toys, and a Dutch door, so she can be shut inside without feeling claustrophobic.

And why not?

As Mrs. Griffiths said, “Margaux is just like any other member of our family.”","A Bedroom for Rover, Maybe Even a Condo",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/realestate/a-bedroom-for-rover-maybe-even-a-condo.html

Mohammed Fairouz, Psalm 14

At its heart, Mr. Fairouz said, this psalm is about “believing in something bigger than yourself,” even while living in divisive times.

In writing his setting, “Diversions,” he felt the psalm’s message was ultimately one of hope. The piece unfolds in three parts: a poem by Michael Bembenek Jr. that opens darkly (“Fresh corpses line the boulevard”); text by Isaac Newton, including his famous phrase “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants”; and Psalm 14, which ends with the feeling, Mr. Fairouz said, that “if you look at the world we’re living in today, the opportunities are tremendous.”

William Knight, Psalm 21

Mr. Knight, a British tenor who grew up singing sacred music, is familiar with this psalm. Still, he said, “it was interesting to read it and interpret it in a new way.”

He found himself drawn to the psalm’s message about eternal life — something that “can be achieved through remembrance,” he said — and the concept of divine right. He thought of world leaders using religion to justify their actions, but pointed to the second half of the text, which depicts a wrathful God who has more power than any king.

Zad Moultaka, Psalm 60

Reading this psalm for the first time was difficult for Mr. Moultaka, a composer from Lebanon now based in Paris. “There is a lot of violence in it,” he said, pointing to moments in the text where, for example, God tramples down enemies.

Mr. Moultaka said that while revisiting this psalm for his piece, “Sakata” (its text in Aramaic), he interpreted it as: “We are lost, and we have to find a new way, maybe, to relate and find a new space together.”

Nico Muhly, Psalm 63

Choral music, especially sacred music, is Mr. Muhly’s home base. “It’s the first music that I loved and the first music that I made,” he said, adding that he enjoys setting psalm text “because it can bear the weight of a variety of musical interpretations.”

His setting, “Marrow,” takes its title from the line “My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and fatness.” Anchoring the piece is a musical texture in three-quarter time — “a kind of wet aquatic idée fixe,” as Mr. Muhly called it.

Isidora Zebeljan, Psalm 78

Ms. Zebeljan, a Serbian composer, translated her psalm into Portuguese because “there is a very special melody in this language,” she said. The words fit naturally into the tone of her piece, which she described as a slow dance.

Even though the psalm deals in holy fury, Ms. Zebeljan said she wanted the music to reflect the line in which God remembers that people are “but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.” She said she tried to capture that breeze as “a brief dance of changing and passing,” like the danse macabre that closes Ingmar Bergman’s film “The Seventh Seal.”

Caroline Shaw, Psalm 84

This psalm opens with one of the most memorable lines in Brahms’s “A German Requiem”: “How beloved is your dwelling place.” Ms. Shaw, who wrote the beginning of her setting like an Anglican chant, made sure to preserve that line while treating the rest of the text more liberally.

Ms. Shaw said the psalm made her think of the immigration crisis, which she alludes to her repeated use of the phrase “the sparrow found a house.” She added that she wanted to set that phrase “in a way that feels urgent and not calm.”

David Lang, Psalm 101

Mr. Lang, who describes himself as religious, rewrote the psalm for his setting, “if i sing.” The piece straddles the line between sacred and secular, as does “the little match girl passion,” his Pulitzer-winning oratorio inspired by Hans Christian Andersen and Bach’s “St. Matthew Passion.”

The psalm “is really like a bargain,” Mr. Lang said. “It’s like, ‘If I do this, will that work? Will you come to me?’” That question is present in nearly every line. By the end, it appears as a plea: “Come to me.”

Evelin Seppar, Psalm 129

“This is about overcoming difficulty,” Ms. Seppar, an Estonian composer, said of her psalm setting. “Something horrible has been done to you for a long time, but you haven’t given up.”

She aimed to create a dense, sea-like structure “with lots of voices, so that you can’t really tell what exactly is the harmony. I wanted this almost drowning feeling, that you’re in the water and it’s pulling you.”

Yet Ms. Seppar’s message is ultimately one of perseverance. “It ends in unison,” she said. “I don’t normally finish pieces like this, but after this turmoil it felt like clarity was necessary.”",Hear 9 New Psalm Settings for Challenging Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/arts/music/psalms-white-light-festival-lincoln-center.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The Nuevo Amanecer Mariachi Academy is one of those places where the traditions of Mexico are passed onto new generations. Students between the ages of 6 and 20 meet in a church basement in East Elmhurst, Queens, to learn violin, trumpet or guitar, while more experienced students rehearse for gigs in local restaurants and churches.

Mariana Vincenti, a Venezuelan photojournalist, followed a group of these students for several months earlier this year. Far from Caracas, she wanted to explore the identities of Latin American immigrants and their children.

“They are a generation in transition since they are the first to be born here, yet they have not lost their roots,” said Ms. Vincenti, 28. “They are American, but they consider themselves Mexican, too.”

The young people, she said, approach their studies eagerly, unlike those of us who balked at weekly piano lessons as children. Even in their spare time, they kick back and play their instruments just for the fun of it. Recently, a group of teenage students formed their own band, Mariachi Luna Mixteca.

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

There’s always an angle. A new biography, “Vivian Maier: A Photographer’s Life and Afterlife,” by Pamela Bannos, strives to rescue Maier all over again, this time from the men who promulgated the Maier myth and profited off her work; chiefly Maloof, who controlled her copyright for a time. After a legal battle — “the Vivian Mire,” one critic called it — her estate passed into a trust last year, where it will be held for possible heirs and eventually released into the public domain.

The book braids together three strands: a brisk, rather generic history of American photography; a biography of Maier; and a withering account of how the artist has been represented since her death. “My goal was always to recognize and give Maier agency within her own story,” Bannos writes. She tries to dislodge the portrayal of Maier as a mysterious, freakish figure, and to see a person where others have seen mostly pathology: her hoarding and possible paranoia.

Bannos makes the case that Maier lived a much larger, more varied life than assumed. This famous recluse once took a five-month trip around the world as well as a subarctic train expedition, both times traveling with just her camera for company. As for her notorious secrecy, it served a purpose, at least in the beginning. Her parents were frantic dissemblers who struggled to conceal scandals of illegitimacy, abandonment and institutionalization. Of course Maier was wary about sharing her personal details, Bannos reasons: Who would hire a nanny with such a sordid family life?

Photo

Nor should we be so struck that Maier never wanted to show her work to anyone. Sharing comes easily, too easily, to us. Not so for Maier, who told a friend that “if she had not kept her images secret, people would have stolen or misused them” — how prophetic that now seems. And her compulsive photographing prefigured our own relationship with our phones, Bannos says, our own desire to constantly document our lives.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In this way, almost point by point, Bannos refutes how Maier has been marketed. And she looks at how it has benefited Maloof et al. to present Maier as a strange, incapable wraith, how it made them look all the more heroic, and allowed them to cavalierly overlook her absolute unwillingness to show her work publicly.

In a strange coincidence, Bannos reports, 21 years after Maier lived on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, where she cared for the dark-haired girl who often appears in her photos, Susan Sontag would move into the penthouse of the very same building and begin the essays in “On Photography.” “Photographs alter and enlarge our notions of what is worth looking at and what we have a right to observe,” Sontag wrote in the opening pages of that book. “They are a grammar and, even more importantly, an ethics of seeing. Finally, the most grandiose result of the photographic enterprise is to give us the sense that we can hold the whole world in our heads.”

Biographies and documentaries can tempt us the same way. They can offer the fantasy of absolute knowledge, absolute possession (perhaps this is how Maloof went astray). The achievement of Bannos’s intelligent, irritable self-reflexive study is in its restraint. She unseats the ghost and restores to us the woman — but in her own words and images, and without psychologizing. It’s a portrait as direct as any of Maier’s, and what a distinct pleasure it is to meet her gaze again.","Vivian Maier, Through a Clearer Lens",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/books/review-vivian-maier-biography-pamela-bannos.html

These women’s work might be as uncompromising as it ever was, but age, they know, has also neutralized them in men’s eyes, removed some of their sting and danger.","Part of what makes Tompkins’s work so enduringly potent today, and what made it too shocking for its time, is not just its frank sexuality: It’s that the art of Tompkins, Bernstein and their peers seethes with lust, ego, wisecracks and profanity. While other feminists of their era were embracing “central core” imagery related to the womb or vulva and reclaiming traditionally female crafts like needlepoint, these artists demanded attention the way men did — through shock and awe.

Bernstein’s colossal drawings of screws, which unambiguously resemble erect penises, provoked a kind of castration anxiety. “One dealer told me that my work made men of his age feel uncomfortable,” she says. One of her works was censored from a show of women’s art at the Museum of the Philadelphia Civic Center in 1974 after its director, John Pierron, claimed that it “offends me on behalf of the children of this city.” In the late 1960s, a male dealer at Knoedler gallery, then the oldest commercial gallery in New York, told Juanita McNeely that the slides of her work she’d shown him — violent paintings of nude women bleeding — couldn’t have been made by a woman. At another gallery, she brought the canvases to prove it, but as she unrolled them onto the floor the dealer kicked them out of his path and walked away. These artists’ work, at the time and ever since, has been an act of announcement, of provocation by existence. They threatened to take up male territory, which museums and galleries then almost exclusively were.

Although most of these women identified (and still do) as feminists, their work was too outré even for the radical feminism of the 1960s and ’70s, which found its focus in the politics of sexual oppression, and its voice in people like the lawyer and activist Catharine MacKinnon, who argued that “all pornography is made under conditions of inequality.” The artists of this generation didn’t quite fit in with anyone — not women (MacKinnon’s stance meant a brief, uneasy alliance between feminism and right-wing censors), not critics and not other artists: At the time that these so-called blood-and-guts artists were first appearing, minimalism, a nearly asexual style that championed form over feeling, was the dominant trend — leagues away from these women’s lusty, leaky, fleshy aesthetic. Feminists criticized Tompkins for cutting and cropping images from her husband’s pornographic magazines and thus perpetuating male sexist fantasies. (“I was not active in the feminist art movement,” she says. “I couldn’t find it. Nobody told me where the meetings were.”) Bernstein, now 75, was a member of the all-woman cooperative gallery A.I.R., which was founded in 1972 and is still active, but she too never felt the movement embraced her. “I observed men and their behavior. A lot of feminists didn’t take that as being feminism.”

Especially scandalizing was the fact that many of the women — who are almost exclusively heterosexual — made men the objects of desire. When Sylvia Sleigh’s 1975 portrait of a young nude man went on view at the Bronx Museum, then housed in a room of a courthouse, a judge complained about the “explicit male nudity in the corridor of a public courthouse.” The curator wondered in response why he had never complained before about the “coyly draped, bare-breasted females” that adorned the elevators of the same building.

The arrival of queer art in the early ’70s forced the discussion of art and sex — who got to depict it; what it should look like — into the culture at large. Conservatives and the Christian right turned their attention toward gay male artists like Robert Mapplethorpe and David Wojnarowicz, both of whom depicted male desire in their work, and both of whom had been censored by museums. There was a philosophical kinship between these phallic feminists and this first major generation of queer artists, who were all representing anatomy in abrasive ways.

Photo

But while queer art became a cause for museums and galleries — Mapplethorpe and Wojnarowicz were anointed figureheads in a battle between progressive and conservative values, which ultimately exposed their work to wider audiences — these women artists remained obscure. Mapplethorpe’s solo show featuring photographs of male nudes at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., was canceled in 1989 after pressure from members of Congress, but the exhibition was quickly moved to the Washington Project for the Arts. Crowds lined up to see it, and America’s near-return to the 1950s seemed to have been at least temporarily thwarted. And yet the female artists received no new recognition, no new regard. The third wave of feminists that emerged in the ’90s allied with queer theorists and activists of color — and dismissed the previous generation’s feminism as too straight, white and privileged.

NOW, 50 YEARS after these women began making work, the culture has finally caught up to them. These days, pornography streams on phones; many curators determining museum programming came of age reading feminist theory; and there is a diversity, and plurality, of young women artists who have made sex, and the female body, their primary subject, and who have found recognition doing so: 27-year-old Darja Bajagic, who collages hardcore porn with images of murdered women, or 28-year-old Amalia Ulman, whose fictional Instagram personas post selfies in bras and thongs, or 25-year-old Emma Sulkowicz, whose 2014 performance, in which she marched around the campus of Columbia University lugging the mattress on which she was allegedly raped by a fellow student, quickly became an emblem of the current debate surrounding campus sexual assault.

But the sudden popularity of Tompkins and Bernstein is not just about the abundance and easy accessibility of explicit material to which we have all become desensitized. Young women today face some of the same battles that were fought by their mothers and grandmothers at a time when these artists were just beginning their careers. January’s Women’s March was a kind of communion of the previous generations of feminism, a present-tense call to action, but it was also an acknowledgment of the past. The signs carried by protesters contained all the iconography that these artists once traded in and still do — all the explicit depictions of male and female anatomy and bodily functions that had once alienated them had become, over time, the symbols of an age of resistance.

Photo

And while these artists’ shamelessness as young women was outrageous, their shamelessness as old women is revolutionary. What’s perhaps most astonishing is that they never stopped making their work, despite years of disregard: There is something radical about their very stubbornness, their dogged persistence. “In the 1960s and early ’70s, every gallery rejected my work,” says the 78-year-old Carolee Schneemann, who won a lifetime achievement award at this year’s Venice Biennale and is the subject of a retrospective currently on view at PS1. The show was a long time coming. At a notorious 1975 performance at a women’s art festival in East Hampton, Schneemann unrolled a scroll from her vagina and read from it. (The text was about a male “structuralist filmmaker” who criticized the “diaristic indulgence” of her art.) She, like her peers, has bittersweet feelings about their recent recognition. On the one hand, they’re enjoying the success — “Oh my god, it’s fabulous,” Bernstein says. “I take cabs everywhere” — but they’re skeptical of the forces that enabled it. There is a perpetual cycle in the art world of women not being taken seriously until they are old or dead: This was the case with Louise Bourgeois, who only had her first retrospective in 1982, after she turned 70, or the painter Carmen Herrera, who recently had her retrospective at the Whitney ... at the age of 101. These women’s work might be as uncompromising as it ever was, but age, they know, has also neutralized them in men’s eyes, removed some of their sting and danger. Now that they’re postmenopausal, their sexual disobedience doesn’t matter as much to men, who “don’t want to sleep with us anymore,” Schneemann says. “We’re not as threatening as younger women,” says Bernstein.

Other things, though, haven’t changed. Bernstein still lives and works in the same Chinatown studio she’s had since 1967, cluttered with a collection of stuffed animals and toys for her two Persian cats. It used to be crammed with decades of unsold paintings, but now that she can finally afford storage space, the only work present on a recent visit was her new series of fluorescent black-light paintings of testicle-headed Donald Trumps and vagina-faced Hillary Clintons, which are now on view at the Drawing Center in downtown Manhattan.

The poet Ted Hughes, who once translated “Blood Wedding,” observed that “Lorca cannot be Englished.” Perhaps.","He evoked duende perhaps most fully in his “Gypsy Ballads,” published in 1928. It’s a canonical book in Spain. Here was a highly cultivated poet reworking Andalusian folk culture and myth. The high-low effect was startling. It was as if Robert Lowell had made a murderous little book that drew its inspiration from Harry Smith’s “Anthology of American Folk Music.”

The poet and translator Sarah Arvio is here now with “Poet in Spain,” a new translation of Lorca’s poems into English. It is the first major undertaking of its kind since “Collected Poems: A Bilingual Edition” (1991), the work of several translators and edited by Christopher Maurer.

Unlike Maurer, Arvio omits Lorca’s intemperate and political and Whitman-inflected New York poems, written after he visited the city in 1929 and 1930. (These were published after his death under the title “Poet in New York.”) She focuses instead entirely on what she calls his “moonlit earthbound Spanish poems.”

About Lorca’s New York versus his Spanish poems, Arvio writes, “To my ear, these voices are so different they could almost be the voices of two different poets.” The crucial word here is “almost.” The absence of these vital poems immediately renders Arvio’s book less necessary than Maurer’s in terms of seeing this complicated poet whole.

There are consolations. Arvio is a supple translator, and she has delivered a personal book. She has felt free to shift Lorca’s poems around in sequence, as he himself often did when putting together his books. Most notably she has shorn the poems of punctuation, as Lorca sometimes did in his drafts.

The spare effect can be riveting. Take this snippet of “Dreamwalking Ballad”:

Compadre can I swap

my horse for your house

saddle for your mirror

knife for your blanket

compadre I come bleeding

from the Cabra passes

If I could young friend

the deal would be done

But I’m no longer me

my house isn’t mine

At other moments, the punctuation is missed. You feel Lorca has been tamped down. His poem “Cazador” (“Hunter”), for example, begins with these words: “¡Alto pinar!” Arvio translates this, with a vast diminution in energy, as “High grove of pines.”

Lorca wrote in an exclamatory style that gave his work a flamenco brashness. Witness the first stanza of “Árboles” (“Trees”) from 1919:

¡Árboles!

¿Habéis sido flechas

Caídas del azul?

¿Qué terribles guerreros os lanzaron?

¿Han sido las estrellas?

Arvio renders this in telegraphic yet somewhat lobotomized fashion:

Were you once arrows

falling from the sky

What terrible warriors shot you

Were they the stars

At other moments, Arvio’s translations are both less accurate and less felicitous than those in Maurer’s edition. The opening lines of “Reyerta” (“Brawl” or “Feud”), for example, read this way: “En la mitad del barranco / las navajas de Albacete, / bellas de sangre contraria, / relucen como los peces.”

Arvio gives us this translation: “Halfway down the gully / the blades from Albacete / glisten like fishes / flush with fighting blood.”

In Maurer’s book, it is: “Halfway down the gorge / knives of Albacete, / beautiful with enemy blood, / shine like fish.”

Beautiful with enemy blood. That isn’t just a gorgeous phrase, ripe with meaning, but it comports more exactly with Lorca’s Spanish.

The poems in this book include not only “Gypsy Ballads,” but the “Dark Love Sonnets,” with their death-haunted homoeroticism, and poems about the deadly goring of Lorca’s friend the bullfighter Ignacio Sánchez Mejías, among others.

Lorca’s poems from Spain are a poetry of dreams and journeys and glimpses from balconies, of sunbaked meadows and realms of erotic yearning. He went to the well often for the same elemental imagery: the sea, the wind, the moon, flowers and trees. His mind worked feverishly enough to induce hallucinations.

He completed 13 plays and nine books of verse between 1917 and 1936. This book includes one of those plays, a rich and gripping retranslation of “Blood Wedding,” written in 1932. It’s an unconventional choice to print it in a book of poems, but Arvio argues and then demonstrates that the language in it is of a piece with Lorca’s blood-warm verse.

The poet Ted Hughes, who once translated “Blood Wedding,” observed that “Lorca cannot be Englished.” Perhaps. But his life and work offer mysteries we’re still profitably untangling.",‘Poet in Spain’ Offers New Translations of Lorca’s Soulful Work,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/books/review-poet-in-spain-federico-garcia-lorca-sarah-arvio.html

Plans for venues like the Chase Center — a privately financed arena being built in San Francisco for the reigning N.B.A.","Jewel box venues like Fenway Park and Wrigley Field have survived on the charm they bring to baseball, but large single-purpose sites had mostly fallen out of favor by the mid-1960s. The concrete doughnuts that followed — which tried to mash baseball and football fields into the same space — struggled to effectively exhibit either sport. And single-purpose designs returned to the norm in the 1990s.

But the same concerns that led to the development of those rarely mourned multipurpose stadiums persist today. Single-sports structures can often lie fallow for much the year, in some cases marooned by sprawling parking lots on the outskirts of cities.

Although the cost of some new stadiums has pushed beyond the $1 billion mark, a key revenue stream shows signs it might not be the reliable income generator it once was: Weekly attendance at N.F.L. games has been mostly down this year (even before players began protesting comments by President Trump), and attendance at Major League Baseball games, while still high, has also declined slightly in recent years.

That has only intensified the need for new buildings to do double (or more) duty. Some large venues are increasingly catering to nontraditional events like monster truck rallies, marathons, black-tie banquets and conferences. MetLife Stadium, the home of the Jets and the Giants, hosted a Bollywood awards show in July.

But event planners often find that convention centers are better suited to their needs, with superior lighting and audiovisual options, extensive catering facilities and the ability to partition off floor space into multiple rooms, said Jack W. Plunkett, chief executive of Plunkett Research.

Industrywide tracking of supplemental revenue from one-off events is patchy at best. Still, “stadium managers want to maximize ancillary income from stadium event rental, but there are a lot of challenges and the competition is fierce for those dollars,” he said.

Last month, Barclays Center in Brooklyn hosted a video game tournament — a championship showdown using the first-person shooter game “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.” In the same space that has hosted Beyoncé and the hometown Nets, enormous screens conveyed the action to an audience of thousands, accompanied by pounding music, a light show and smoke effects.

“It’s super awesome — they’re putting a lot of time and money into making this a good show, taking it mainstream,” said Joseph Nelson, 18, who traveled from Scotch Plains, N.J. “I could watch this streamed at home, but I come here to be with people and enjoy the production.”

“Hyperconnectivity” of the digital sort is important, especially for younger fans, according to a report from Deloitte last year. That could take the form of virtual assistants guiding customers through team shops or informing event organizers what highlights the crowd wants to see.

Companies like VenueNext, which has worked with Super Bowl host stadiums and Churchill Downs, home to the Kentucky Derby, create custom apps to help fans track which bathrooms have the shortest waits, order food to be delivered to their seats and watch replays on their phones. Avaya Stadium, home to the San Jose Earthquakes soccer team, erected a wall of screens nearly seven feet tall to aggregate real-time statistics, social media chatter, YouTube videos and other fan-generated content.

Still, designers are worried that visitors, accustomed to a spread of entertainment options at home, will get restless at a live event. So they’re considering ways to connect fans to the live experience.

Designers envision using biometric data and motion effects to sync an entertainer’s heartbeat with pulses sent into spectators’ seats. Augmented reality stations could offer guests a digital backstage tour.

One rentable suite at Petco Park, home of baseball’s San Diego Padres, allows fans to play the video game “MLB: The Show” on PlayStation video game consoles while overlooking the field.

“The traditional arena was fundamentally designed around a static in-seat experience,” Mr. Mirakian said. “But the behavioral patterns for this next-generation visitor are dramatically different — they want to come into the building and have the ability to choose their own adventure.”

Another bonus: Flexible venues are easier to finance at a time when taxpayers are less inclined to pick up part of the tab. Last year, voters in San Diego rejected a ballot measure that would have raised hotel taxes to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars toward helping erect a new football stadium for the Chargers. (The team opted to move to Los Angeles.)

Most economic experts believe that the benefits of stadiums are very likely to be outweighed by the costs to the taxpayers who fund the projects, according to a survey this year from the Initiative on Global Markets at Chicago Booth. After all, even with a full slate of events, many of those taxpayers may never set foot in the building, which the neighborhood may end up seeing as a hulking, self-contained island, siloed from the rest of the community.

That is a criticism that new venues are trying to address by better blending into their surroundings and encouraging more visitors. Stadium and arena planners are trying to integrate hotels, lakes, parks, office buildings and other meeting places into their designs. Plans for venues like the Chase Center — a privately financed arena being built in San Francisco for the reigning N.B.A. champion Golden State Warriors that will include a waterfront park, restaurants and retail — refer to the complexes as “districts.”

Half of the concourse area used for the Little Caesars Arena, which opened last month in Detroit as the new home of the Red Wings and the Pistons, is accessible year-round, regardless of whether an event is scheduled in the main bowl. Retailers and restaurants open on to the street and the clear-roofed concourse.

“This way, we don’t have these massively long runs of inactive street frontage when there’s no game or concert,” said Ryan Gedney, a senior project designer at HOK, the architecture firm behind the arena. “It becomes a much harder-working venue day to day.”",More Than Sports: Stadiums Try Video Games and Surfing,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/business/arenas-stadiums-design.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

At LinkedIn, researchers identified the skills most in demand. The top 10 last year were all computer skills, including expertise in cloud computing, data mining and statistical analysis, and writing smartphone applications.

In a recent analysis, Edward Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, focused on the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment forecasts in STEM categories. In the decade ending in 2024, 73 percent of STEM job growth will be in computer occupations, but only 3 percent will be in the physical sciences and 3 percent in the life sciences.

A working grasp of the principles of science and math should be essential knowledge for all Americans, said Michael S. Teitelbaum, an expert on science education and policy. But he believes that STEM advocates, often executives and lobbyists for technology companies, do a disservice when they raise the alarm that America is facing a worrying shortfall of STEM workers, based on shortages in a relative handful of fast-growing fields like data analytics, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and computer security.

“When it gets generalized to all of STEM, it’s misleading,” said Mr. Teitelbaum, a senior research associate in the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School. “We’re misleading a lot of young people.”

Unemployment rates for STEM majors may be low, but not all of those with undergraduate degrees end up in their field of study — only 13 percent in life sciences and 17 percent in physical sciences, according to a 2013 National Science Foundation survey. Computer science is the only STEM field where more than half of graduates are employed in their field.

IF physicists and biologists want to enjoy the boom times in the digital economy, a few specialist start-ups will train them and find them jobs as data scientists and artificial intelligence programmers.

Insight Data Science Fellows Program, which has offices in New York, Boston, Seattle and Palo Alto, Calif., began its first training program five years ago and now has 900 alumni working at companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, Airbnb, Amazon and Microsoft. Jake Klamka, a physicist who founded the program, kept hearing from Silicon Valley executives that they had considered hiring traditional scientists, but converting them to technologists seemed time-consuming and risky. So Mr. Klamka decided he would start a company to provide scientists a smoother pathway into the tech industry.

Carlos Faham made that passage. He had an impressive academic career, with a string of grant awards and fellowships. His Ph.D. from Brown University was in dark-matter physics. After Brown, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Dr. Faham loved the research, but after nearly two years he was feeling the strain of that life. By then, he had spent 12 years in college, graduate school and postgraduate research. His next step would be to compete for a handful of tenure-track teaching openings across the country. For the pricey Bay Area, he wasn’t making enough. A postdoc researcher typically makes $40,000 to $60,000 a year.

Dr. Faham had done serious programming for his physics research. He applied to tech companies, figuring they would be eager to hire someone with his intellectual firepower. He couldn’t get an in-person interview. He was told his background was too academic. He fumbled a couple of phone screening interviews because the statistical and machine-learning problems were unfamiliar to him.

“It was like hitting a wall running at full speed, really humbling,” he recalled.

Dr. Faham joined the seven-week Insight Data Science Fellows program in 2015. There was no formal course work. Other than a few tutorials by industry people, the time was spent creating a product — his was software for recognizing and tracking faces in video — and training for interviews. That involved solving a programming problem on a white board and explaining his thinking. “Interviewing is a muscle and you have to exercise it again and again,” he said. After the program, he received six job offers. He accepted the offer from LinkedIn. (Insight is free for participants; hiring companies pay an undisclosed fee.)

Today, Dr. Faham, 33, is a senior data scientist, working on a team that uses machine learning and statistical models to detect illicit activity on the social network, including fake job listings, ad fraud, spam and bot attacks.

The range of data-intensive detective work, he said, is “extremely rich” and “it moves so much faster than my previous world.” He makes a “pretty good six-figure salary,” about five times what he did as a postdoctoral researcher.

About 90 percent of those who enter the Insight program have landed jobs as data analysts, the company says, with a dropout rate of about 3 percent.

Anasuya Das made a similar career move, but not one as far from her academic training. After the program, Dr. Das, whose Ph.D. is in neuroscience, joined the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, where she is now a senior data scientist. She works on a team that creates software tools for the center’s doctors, nurses and researchers. One current project is a program to recommend the most promising clinical trials for individual cancer patients, based on their medical histories, age, gender and genetics.

Data science is distinctly different from neuroscience, Dr. Das said, but some of the tools she employs, like a machine-learning technique called artificial neural networks, do take their inspiration from the brain. Her experience points to the larger trend that digital technologies like data science and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used in nearly every discipline. So technology and the other STEM fields merge.

That is the thinking behind a new division of data sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, that started in July. The division is a response to student demand and advancing technology. Berkeley’s “Foundations of Data Science” course attracted 1,200 students from more than 50 majors in the last academic year.

The choice of the term “division” rather than “institute,” explained David Culler, the interim dean for data sciences, underlines its approach. “We want this to be something foundational across the university, innovating with other disciplines, not differentiating from them,” he said. “This is the academic world mirroring what is happening in the larger economy.”",Where the STEM Jobs Are (and Where They Aren’t),https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/education/edlife/stem-jobs-industry-careers.html

What: A man in a Home Depot rental truck barreled down a bike bath near the Hudson River, striking pedestrians and cyclists before crashing the truck into a school bus, officials said. He jumped out of the vehicle with a pellet gun and a paintball gun in hand, shouted “Allahu akbar” (“God is great” in Arabic) and was shot by an officer, authorities said.

When: The attack began just after 3 p.m.

Where: The driver entered the West Side Highway bicycle path at Houston Street and began driving south. His truck collided with a school bus at Chambers Street, nearly a mile away.

Who: Officials identified Sayfullo Saipov, 29, who moved to the United States from Uzbekistan in 2010, as the driver of the truck. He had apparently lived in Paterson, N.J., and Tampa, Fla. After he was shot in the abdomen by the police, he was taken into custody and transported to a nearby hospital. He remained in stable condition as of early Wednesday morning, according to the police.

Why: It is still not known what motivated the attack. Investigators found handwritten notes in Arabic near the truck that indicated allegiance to the Islamic State, but they are treating the episode as a case of an attack “inspired” by the group.

Here’s what else is happening:

The final debate of the mayoral campaign is tonight.

It’s the second meeting of Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat; Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican; and the independent businessman Bo Dietl.

Undoubtedly, yesterday’s terrorist attack will be on everyone’s mind, and the topic of terrorism and safety will almost certainly come up.

A few other points to watch:

• Mr. de Blasio has some explaining to do.

Since the last debate, Jona S. Rechnitz, a wealthy real estate developer, testified that he bought access to the city’s political and law enforcement circles in exchange for favors for himself and others.

“The moderator is going to want to talk about it. His opponents are going to want to talk about it. He’s not going to want to talk about it,” said Shane Goldmacher, who covers New York politics.

• It’s an important night for Ms. Malliotakis.

“People want to know what would look different in an administration of Nicole Malliotakis and I’m not sure she’s articulated that,” said J. David Goodman, who covers City Hall. “This is sort of her last chance to convince voters that she has the stature and gravitas to be mayor.”

• Expect a quieter debate than the first, if only because the crowd size will be smaller.

The debate begins at 7 p.m. and will be broadcast on CBS2, 1010WINS, WCBS 880 and at NYDailyNews.com.

The screams seemed too vivid from the start, too visceral to belong to crowds celebrating a crisp and sunny Halloween in Lower Manhattan. The tragedy had unfolded in just minutes, and for hours and hours it remained too senseless to believe.

Sirens and police tape surrounded the white pickup truck that a 29-year-old assailant transformed into an instrument of terror when he began hitting cyclists and joggers along the West Side Highway bike path. A mangled school bus sat next to it.

Bodies lay strewn along the way. For those who encountered the scene on Tuesday, the aftermath was as confusing as it was gruesome.

Tom Kendrick, 36, a lawyer from the West Village, said he was jogging uptown just north of Chambers Street when he began noticing the mayhem on the bike path. He saw a battered body and bicycle in the bushes alongside the path. Farther along he found three bodies close together, also battered cyclists.

“I approached to see if I could help and they did not need help — they appeared to be dead,” Mr. Kendrick said. “They were bloody and unconscious, with some limbs hanging,” he added. “It was gruesome. It was grisly. It was surreal.”

“These people were gone,” he said. “I’m in shock. I’m looking at dead bodies.”

At least eight people lost their lives in what was the deadliest terrorist attack to strike New York City since Sept. 11, and about a dozen more were injured.

Hiro Kimura, 15, a sophomore at Stuyvesant High School, said that he and his friends first heard “a big car crash.” Then they heard shooting.

“We saw flocks of children running” from the scene, Hiro said.

The New York City police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, detailed a preliminary timeline of the violence, which he called an “act of terror,” in a news conference Tuesday evening that shed light on the scene.

The white truck entered the bicycle path alongside West Street by Houston Street at 3:05 p.m. and drove south, hitting pedestrians and cyclists along the way. The runaway truck, labeled with Home Depot logos, drove 20 blocks before ramming into a school bus at Chambers Street. Two adults and two children who were on the bus were reportedly injured in the crash.

The 29-year-old man driving the truck exited the vehicle with what appeared to be two handguns, Mr. O’Neill said, at which point a uniformed police officer approached the man and shot him in the abdomen. Early reports suggested that the assailant may have yelled “Allahu akbar,” Arabic for “God is great,” at some point after exiting his vehicle. A paintball gun and a pellet gun were recovered from the scene later.

Many of the children attending schools in the area were horror-struck.

The mother of a 13-year-old girl who came face to face with the suspect said her daughter was “too traumatized” to talk. The woman, her daughter and two other children were being escorted from the scene by a police officer. She did not want to give her name or her child’s name for security reasons, she said. The girl’s face was red and tear-streaked, and she had curled her hands into the sleeves of her blue hooded sweatshirt. Her mother said she was a student at Intermediate School 289 on Warren Street, yards from where the truck came to a rest after crashing into the school bus.

“She was right in front of the shooter. He had two guns,” the woman said of her daughter. She said she did not remember much else.

Olivia Raykhman, 14, glimpsed the wrecked school bus in the immediate aftermath of the episode. “They were sawing through a school bus window. They broke all of the windows and were trying to pull kids out. There was a man covering a child with a blanket. There was one kid who was stuck,” she said.

“We ran into the building and they told us to hide,” said Olivia, a freshman.

She took shelter in what she called a “cellar” with a group that was at first just 15 people. Around 50 more soon joined.

As Olivia and her friends ran inside, students on the upper floors of Stuyvesant had been shooting video of what happened in the street. Videos posted on Facebook and then circulated over Snapchat showed what appeared to be the suspect, a bearded man in dark clothing heading down the street with his weapons in his hands, next to a white pickup truck.

Adria Menezes, 45, said she saw the suspect firing one of his weapons at cars on West Street.

Ms. Menezes had just arrived at Public School 89, which shares space with I.S. 289 on Warren Street, at 3:03 p.m. to pick up the two children she babysits for, when she suddenly heard cars crashing on West Street and saw a yellow school bus “drive like crazy.”

Then roughly 15 feet away, she saw a tall man with dark hair and wearing a hat. He was walking quickly, screaming something indiscernible, and shooting at the cars, causing further mayhem.

“When I saw the man shooting at all the cars, we threw ourselves to the ground,” she said in Spanish by phone from inside the school, which remained locked down.

Marie Hui was visiting New York City with several friends from Vancouver, and had been in SoHo shopping before the attack. Several of her friends were at the 9/11 Memorial at the time, where they sheltered in place.

“We’re from Vancouver,” she said. “This doesn’t happen over there.”","A Mangled School Bus, Bodies Everywhere; ‘It Was Surreal’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/nyregion/nyc-scene-terror-attack-truck-witnesses.html

These efforts at obfuscation and misdirection would be laughable, but they are linked to a very real and dangerous move by Trump allies throughout right-wing media and the government to shut down the Russia investigation for good.

It’s no secret that Mr. Trump has been itching to get rid of Mr. Mueller since soon after his appointment as special counsel in May. Mr. Trump’s advisers have told him that would be a terrible idea and have reportedly talked him out of it more than once. But the calls for such a move are now coming from some of the most influential voices in conservative media, as are other equally bad proposals, like urging that Mr. Mueller resign and that Mr. Trump pardon anyone and everyone caught up in the Russia investigation — including himself.

Mr. Trump would be wise to continue to ignore these loony ideas and restrain his own authoritarian reflexes. The president of the United States, no less than any citizen, lives under the law, not above it; Mr. Mueller’s investigation is the embodiment of that fact. Removing him now, after he has already secured two indictments, including one for Mr. Trump’s former campaign chief, and a guilty plea by a foreign-policy adviser, would send the message that Mr. Trump and his aides are accountable to no one.

Over the last several weeks, a few top Republicans have found the courage to say out loud what a majority of Americans have known for a long time: With his erratic behavior and antidemocratic eruptions, Donald Trump is presenting a profound danger to security of the nation and the stability of the world order. So far, these dissidents have beat their chests in a safe space, giving eloquent speeches on their way out the door.

But it will not be hard for them to turn their words into actions if Mr. Trump gives in to an impulse to fire Mr. Mueller. Do the math: Three Republican senators (looking at you, Mr. McCain, Mr. Corker and Mr. Flake), joining with 48 Democrats, could bring the Senate to a halt until Mr. Mueller was reinstated — no tax cuts, no more judges confirmed.
