The fact is, the siege mentality arises from overgeneralization: They are all out to get us.","The odd thing is that the siege mentality feels kind of good to the people who grab on to it. It gives its proponents a straightforward way to interpret the world — the noble us versus the powerful them. It gives them a clear sense of group membership and a clear social identity. It offers a ready explanation for the bad things that happen in life.

Most of all, it gives people a narrative to express their own superiority: We may be losing, but at least we are the holy remnant. We have the innocence of victimhood. We are martyrs in a spiteful world.

Leaders, even sports coaches, try to whip up the siege mentality, because it makes their job easier. After all, this mentality encourages people to conform and follow orders. Resentment can be a great motivator. It’s us against the world!

The siege mentality also excuses the leader’s bad behavior. When our very existence is on the line we can’t be worrying about things like humility, sexual morality, honesty and basic decency. In times of war all is permissible. Even molesting teenagers can be overlooked because our group’s survival is at stake.

In the end, though, the siege mentality ends up being self-destructive. Groups smitten with the siege mentality filter out discordant facts and become more extreme versions of themselves, leading to further marginalization. They take mainstream loathing as a badge of honor and wind up taking pleasure in their most unattractive instincts.

The siege mentality ends up displacing whatever creed the group started with. Evangelical Christians, for example, had a humane model for leadership — servant leadership — but, feeling besieged, they swapped it for Donald Trump, for gladiator pagan leadership.

Why is this mind-set so prevalent now? Well, it’s partially because the country is divided and many groups feel under assault. According to a Pew Research Center poll, 64 percent of Americans believe that their group has been losing most of the time.

But that’s not the main reason the siege mentality is so prevalent. It’s because we’re in a historic transitional moment and the very foundations of society are now open to question.

In the 1960s the civil rights leaders suffered injustice and oppression. But they had a basic faith in the foundations of society. They wanted a place at the table.

Today people are more likely to think the table itself stinks, or there is no common table. Today Christians are more likely to argue that the liberal order itself is intolerant toward faith. Social justice warriors are prone to argue that America is racist and oppressive in its very bones. The evil is inherent in the basic structure.

How should one respond to the siege mentality, to the Alabamians now rallying around Roy Moore? Well, it’s right to be disgusted, and it feels good to be contemptuous. But contempt only breeds contempt. Contempt for the conservatives in Alabama will just justify their siege mentality and make the social disorder that flows from it worse.

The fact is, the siege mentality arises from overgeneralization: They are all out to get us. It shouldn’t be met with a counter-overgeneralization: Those people are all sick.

It should be met with confident pluralism. We have a shared moral culture, and some things are beyond the boundaries, like tolerating sexual harassment. But within the boundaries of our liberal polity, we’re going to give one another the benefit of the doubt.

Suppose America’s leaders had gone to conservative evangelicals a decade ago and said: Look, we understand that changing attitudes about gay marriage put you in a tough position. We’re not going to stop doing what we think is right, but we’re going to try to work out some accommodation with you on religious liberty so you can feel at home here and practice your faith.

That might have felt more like a conversation than a siege. That might have spared us the populist revolts that brought us Roy Moore, and Donald Trump, and the repugnant habits of mind that now excuse them.",The Siege Mentality Problem,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/opinion/roy-moore-conservative-evangelicals.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Tommy, 50, of Queens, N.Y., who takes Abilify for schizoaffective disorder, participated in a clinical trial for digital Abilify.","But, he added, “if used improperly, it could foster more mistrust instead of trust.”

Patients who agree to take the digital medication, a version of the antipsychotic Abilify, can sign consent forms allowing their doctors and up to four other people, including family members, to receive electronic data showing the date and time pills are ingested.

A smartphone app will let them block recipients anytime they change their mind. Although voluntary, the technology is still likely to prompt questions about privacy and whether patients might feel pressure to take medication in a form their doctors can monitor.

Dr. Peter Kramer, a psychiatrist and the author of “Listening to Prozac,” raised concerns about “packaging a medication with a tattletale.”

While ethical for “a fully competent patient who wants to lash him or herself to the mast,” he said, “‘digital drug’ sounds like a potentially coercive tool.”

Other companies are developing digital medication technologies, including another ingestible sensor and visual recognition technology capable of confirming whether a patient has placed a pill on the tongue and has swallowed it.

Not all will need regulatory clearance, and some are already being used or tested in patients with heart problems, stroke, H.I.V., diabetes and other conditions.

Because digital tools require effort, like using an app or wearing a patch, some experts said they might be most welcomed by older people who want help remembering to take pills and by people taking finite courses of medication, especially for illnesses like tuberculosis, in which nurses often observe patients taking medicine.

The technology could potentially be used to monitor whether post-surgical patients took too much opioid medication or clinical trial participants correctly took drugs being tested.

Insurers might eventually give patients incentives to use them, like discounts on copayments, said Dr. Eric Topol, director of Scripps Translational Science Institute, adding that ethical issues could arise if the technology was “so much incentivized that it’s almost is like coercion.”

Another controversial use might be requiring digital medicine as a condition for parole or releasing patients committed to psychiatric facilities.

Abilify is an arguably unusual choice for the first sensor-embedded medicine. It is prescribed to people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and, in conjunction with an antidepressant, major depressive disorder.

Many patients with these conditions do not take medication regularly, often with severe consequences. But symptoms of schizophrenia and related disorders can include paranoia and delusions, so some doctors and patients wonder how widely digital Abilify will be accepted.

“Many of those patients don’t take meds because they don’t like side effects, or don’t think they have an illness, or because they become paranoid about the doctor or the doctor’s intentions,” said Dr. Paul Appelbaum, director of law, ethics and psychiatry at Columbia University’s psychiatry department.

“A system that will monitor their behavior and send signals out of their body and notify their doctor?” he added. “You would think that, whether in psychiatry or general medicine, drugs for almost any other condition would be a better place to start than a drug for schizophrenia.”

The newly approved pill, called Abilify MyCite, is a collaboration between Abilify’s manufacturer, Otsuka, and Proteus Digital Health, a California company that created the sensor.

The sensor, containing copper, magnesium and silicon (safe ingredients found in foods), generates an electrical signal when splashed by stomach fluid, like a potato battery, said Andrew Thompson, Proteus’s president and chief executive.

After several minutes, the signal is detected by a Band-Aid-like patch that must be worn on the left rib cage and replaced after seven days, said Andrew Wright, Otsuka America’s vice president for digital medicine.

The patch sends the date and time of pill ingestion and the patient’s activity level via Bluetooth to a cellphone app. The app allows patients to add their mood and the hours they have rested, then transmits the information to a database that physicians and others who have patients’ permission can access.

Otsuka has not determined a price for Abilify MyCite, which will be rolled out next year, first to a limited number of health plans, Mr. Wright said. The price, and whether digital pills improve adherence, will greatly affect how widely they are used.

Questions about the technology’s ability to increase compliance remain.

Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, chairman of psychiatry at Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, said many psychiatrists would likely want to try digital Abilify, especially for patients who just experienced their first psychotic episode and are at risk of stopping medication after feeling better.

But he noted it has only been approved to track doses, and has not yet been shown to improve adherence.

“Is it going to lead to people having fewer relapses, not having unnecessary hospital readmissions, being able to improve their vocational and social life?” he asked.

He added, “There’s an irony in it being given to people with mental disorders than can include delusions. It’s like a biomedical Big Brother.”

Abilify, a widely used drug, went off patent recently, and while other companies can sell the generic form, aripiprazole, Otsuka, has exclusive rights to embed it with Proteus’s sensor, said Robert McQuade, Otsuka’s executive vice president and chief strategic officer.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“It’s not intended for all patients with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar,” he added. “The physician has to be confident the patient can actually manage the system.”

Dr. McQuade said, “We don’t have any data currently to say it will improve adherence,” but will likely study that after sales begin.

Proteus has spent years bringing its sensor to commercial use, raising about $400 million from investors, including Novartis and Medtronic, Mr. Thompson said.

Until now, the sensor could not be embedded in pills, but pharmacies could be commissioned to place it in a capsule along with another medication.

In 2016, the encapsulated sensor started being used outside of clinical trials, but commercial use is still limited, Mr. Thompson said.

Nine health systems in six states have begun prescribing it with medications for conditions including hypertension and hepatitis C, the company said, adding that it has been found to improve adherence in patients with uncontrolled hypertension and others.

AiCure, a smartphone-based visual recognition system in which patients document taking medicine, has had success with tuberculosis patients treated by the Los Angeles County Health Department and is working with similar patients in Illinois, said Adam Hanina, AiCure’s chief executive.

He said AiCure has shown promising results with other conditions, including in schizophrenia patients whose pill-taking would otherwise require direct observation.

A Florida company, etectRx, makes another ingestible sensor, the ID-Cap, which has been or is being tested with opioids, H.I.V. medication and other drugs.

Made of magnesium and silver chloride, it is encapsulated with pills and avoids using a patch because it generates “a low-power radio signal that can be picked up by a little antenna that’s somewhere near you,” said Harry Travis, etectRx’s president, who said the company plans to seek F.D.A. clearance next year.

The signal is detected by a reader worn around the neck, but etectRx aims to fit readers into watchbands or cellphone cases.

“I get questions all the time, ‘Hey is the government going to use this, and can you track me?’” said Eric Buffkin, an etectRx senior vice president. “Frankly, there is a creepiness factor of this whole idea of medicine tracking.

“The thing I tell them first and foremost is there’s nothing to reach out of this technology to pry your mouth open and make you take a pill. If you are fundamentally opposed to this idea of sharing the information, then say, ‘No thank you.’”

Seeking to address concerns about privacy and coercion, Otsuka officials contracted with several bioethicists. Among them, I. Glenn Cohen, a Harvard law professor, said safeguards adopted include allowing patients to instantly stop physicians and others from seeing some or all of their data.

Asked whether it might be used in circumstances like probation or involuntary hospitalization, Otsuka officials said that was not their intention or expectation, partly because Abilify MyCite only works if patients want to use the patch and app.

How patients will view Abilify MyCite is unclear. Tommy, 50, of Queens, N.Y., who takes Abilify for schizoaffective disorder, participated in a clinical trial for digital Abilify.

Tommy, who withheld his last name to protect his privacy, encountered minor issues, saying the patch was “a little bit uncomfortable” and once gave him a rash.

A compliant patient, Tommy said he does not need monitoring. “I haven’t had paranoid thoughts for a long time — it’s not like I believe they’re beaming space aliens,” he said. If offered digital Abilify, he said, “I wouldn’t do it again.”

But the method might appeal to patients who want to prove their compliance, build trust with their psychiatrist, or who feel “paranoid about getting accused of not taking their medicine.”

Steve Colori, 31, of Danvers, Mass., who wrote a memoir about his illness, “Experiencing and Overcoming Schizoaffective Disorder,” said he took Abilify years ago for symptoms including believing,“I was a messiah.”

Although he sometimes stopped taking medication, he would consider digital pills “overbearing and I think it stymies someone and halts progress in therapy.”

William Jiang, 44, a writer in Manhattan with schizophrenia, took Abilify for 16 years. He said he steadfastly takes medication to prevent recurrence of episodes of paranoia when “I was convinced everybody was trying to murder me.”

He said some noncompliant patients might take digital Abilify, especially to avoid Abilify injections recommended to patients who skip pills.

“I would not want an electrical signal coming out of my body strong enough so my doctor can read it,” Mr. Jiang said.

“But right now, it’s either you take your pills when you’re unsupervised, or you get a shot in the butt.

The twice-a-year fashion weeks in New York, London, Milan and Paris have dominated the industry calendar for decades.

In recent years, however, new contenders have started jostling for attention, including Dubai, where Arab Fashion Week begins on Wednesday.

Expect a broad mix of both Western-style ready-to-wear and modest clothing in the catwalk collections. As a growing global chorus of women demands attire in tune both with Islam and the societies around them, designers are responding with flowing printed tunics and colorful head scarves. Interestingly, designers from abroad are often the more conservative.

Modest fashion is becoming a commercial phenomenon. The global Muslim clothing market is forecast to be worth $368 billion by 2021, according to the latest Global Islamic Economy report.

With its blend of trends from around the world, Arab Fashion Week is playing a considerable role in reshaping perceptions of 21st-century Muslim identity in ways that go far beyond the veil.

And Finally ...

The Great Los Angeles Walk lets people see the city from a different vantage point. Sometimes that means the mundane, like an unexplored shop, and sometimes the memorable: the Lakers icon Magic Johnson, the aftermath of a crane collapse, and lots and lots of weddings.

The horde of walkers itself, however, may be the most jarring sight in a sprawling city known for its traffic.

“Every year we manage to surprise people,” said Michael Schneider, the walk’s founder and organizer, “because they don’t expect to see an army of Angelenos walking down the street. It shocks some people, but it inspires others.”

About 40 people participated in the first walk, along Wilshire Boulevard in 2006. Melrose Avenue and a bevy of boulevards — Pico, Sunset, West Adams, Hollywood, Ventura and Olympic — have been explored since.

This year’s 17-mile walk will travel along Beverly, one of the city’s oldest boulevards, for the first time. An expected crowd of several hundred people will begin at the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo at 9 a.m. on Saturday, with plans to reach Santa Monica State Beach by sunset. Along the way, walkers will amble past City Hall, Walt Disney Concert Hall and CBS Television City.

You truly don’t need a car to explore Los Angeles, and Mr. Schneider recommends older neighborhoods that are walkable, including Los Feliz, Larchmont, Atwater Village and Highland Park.

The annual walk across the city is one way to encourage people to turn off the ignition, to gaze at street art. There is no finish line.

“Some people treat it almost as a marathon, and that’s not the point of this walk,” Mr. Schneider said. “This is all about taking your time and exploring.”

Myth 4: Liberal arts majors are unemployable.
The liberal arts is a favorite target of politicians, with the latest salvo coming from the governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin.
Interpretive dance may not be in demand, but the competencies that liberal arts majors emphasize — writing, synthesis, problem solving — are sought after by employers.
One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job.","Take the median lifetime earnings of business majors, the most popular undergraduate degree. The typical graduate earns $2.86 million over a lifetime. When you put business graduates side by side with those who graduated with what are considered low-paying majors, you’ll see that those who are slightly above the median salary in their fields are not that far behind the business grads. For example, an English major in the 60th percentile makes $2.76 million in a lifetime, a major in psychology $2.57 million and a history major $2.64 million.

Myth 2: Women want to have it all.

Women are now the clear majority on college campuses, making up 56 percent of students enrolled this fall. They are also more likely than men to graduate.

But when it comes to selecting a major, what women choose tends to segregate them into lower paying fields, such as education and social services, according to a report that Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce will publish later this year. Just look at some of the highest paying fields and the proportion of women who major in them: business economics (31 percent), chemical engineering (28 percent), computer science (20 percent), electrical engineering (10 percent), mechanical engineering (8 percent).

“Women can’t win even as they dominate at every level of higher education,” said Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Georgetown center.

Dr. Carnevale wouldn’t speculate as to why women make their choices. But he notes that if the proportion of women in fields where men dominate increased by just 10 percent, the gender pay gap would narrow considerably: from 78 cents paid to women for every dollar men receive to 90 cents for every dollar men receive.

Myth 3: Choice of major matters more than choice of college.

Not so. In seven states — Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington — students can search public databases for early earnings of graduates of institutions within the state. And those databases show that students who graduate from more selective schools tend to make more money. After all, the better the college, the better the professional network opportunities, through alumni, parents of classmates and eventually classmates themselves.

These undergraduates are more able to pursue majors in lower paying fields because their networks help them land good jobs. Arts, humanities and social science majors are more prevalent on elite campuses than at second-tier colleges, where students tend to pick vocational majors like business, education and health. In all, more than half of students at less selective schools major in career-focused subjects; at elite schools, less than a quarter do, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight of the 78 “most selective schools” in Barron’s rankings, compared with 1,800 “less selective schools.”

“Students at selective colleges are allowed to explore their intellectual curiosity as undergraduates because they will get their job training in graduate school or have access to a network that gets them top jobs, regardless of their undergraduate major,” Dr. Carnevale said.

They are also more likely to have two majors than students at second-tier colleges, who tend to be more financially needy and have to work, affording less time to double major.

One tip: Complementary majors with overlapping requirements are easier to juggle, but two unrelated majors probably yield bigger gains in the job market, said Richard N. Pitt, an associate professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University who has studied the rise of the double major. “It increases your breadth of knowledge,” he said.

Myth 4: Liberal arts majors are unemployable.

The liberal arts is a favorite target of politicians, with the latest salvo coming from the governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin. “If you’re studying interpretive dance, God bless you, but there’s not a lot of jobs right now in America looking for people with that as a skill set,” Governor Bevin said in a speech in September.

Interpretive dance may not be in demand, but the competencies that liberal arts majors emphasize — writing, synthesis, problem solving — are sought after by employers. A 2017 study by David J. Deming, an associate professor of education and economics at Harvard, found jobs requiring both the so-called soft skills and thinking skills have seen the largest growth in employment and pay in the last three decades.

One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job. But a study by Burning Glass Technologies, a Boston-based company that analyzes job-market trends, concluded that if liberal arts graduates gain proficiency in one of eight technical skills, such as social media or data analysis, their prospects of landing entry-level jobs increase substantially.

The long-held belief by parents and students that liberal arts graduates are unemployable ignores the reality of the modern economy, where jobs require a mix of skills not easily packaged in a college major, said George Anders, author of “You Can Do Anything: The Surprising Power of a ‘Useless’ Liberal Arts Education.” In his book, Mr. Anders profiles graduates with degrees in philosophy, sociology and linguistics in jobs as diverse as sales, finance and market research.

“Once C.E.O.s see liberal arts graduates in action,” Mr. Anders said, “they come aboard to the idea that they need more of them.”

Myth 5: It’s important to choose a major early.

Why settle on a field of study before experiencing the smorgasbord college has to offer, be it study abroad, a club activity or a surprising elective?

Of students who said they felt committed to their major when they arrived on campus, 20 percent had selected a new major by the end of their first year, according to a national survey by the University of California, Los Angeles.

Changing majors can cost you a semester or two, especially if you switch to one unrelated to your first choice. To reduce that risk, several schools, including Arizona State University, Georgia State University and Lehman College in the Bronx, have created “meta-majors,” which group majors under a larger academic umbrella.

“We have moved away from trying to get students to choose their majors as they enter,” said Timothy Renick, Georgia State’s vice provost and vice president for enrollment management and student success.

Instead, all incoming students choose from one of seven meta-majors, representing large academic and work force fields, such as business, education and STEM. First semester, students gather in learning communities and register for a block of general-education courses within that meta-major. Programming is designed so that students get to know the differences between majors within the field.

“Students in our business meta-major get to understand the difference between finance, accounting, management and marketing so they can choose their major from an informed perspective,” Dr. Renick said. They usually do by the end of their first year.

Myth 6: You need a major.

A handful of colleges, including Indiana University and the Evergreen State College, offer the option to ignore the official list of majors and design a course of study. Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for The Times, designed his at Indiana — enigmatology.

“Majors are artificial and restrictive,” said Christine Ortiz, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on leave to design a new nonprofit university that will have no majors, and also no lectures or classrooms.

“Majors result from the academic structure of the university, tied to the classic academic disciplines. There is no reason they need to be boxed up like that. They don’t take into account emerging fields that cross disciplines.”

Majors tend to lag behind changes in the workplace. No wonder fewer than a third of college graduates work in jobs related to their majors. And picking one based on today’s in-demand jobs is risky, said Dr. Webber of Temple, especially if the occupation is threatened by automation.

“I would argue against majoring in accounting,” he said, “or anything that a computer can be programmed to do.”",Six Myths About Choosing a College Major,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/education/edlife/choosing-a-college-major.html

Judge Walls noted his objection, but disagreed.

Outside the federal courthouse here, Mr. Menendez again professed his innocence and his belief that the jurors would find him not guilty.

“All of these jurors, save one, have been deliberating since Monday, and I would hope that at the end of the day, after they finish tomorrow, that those who continue to believe in my innocence will stand strong and that at the end of the day no juror will be coerced,” he said. “I believe no juror should be coerced.”

Mr. Menendez and a co-defendant, Dr. Salomon Melgen, a wealthy eye doctor from Florida, have been accused on various corruption charges, including bribery and conspiracy. Prosecutors say Mr. Menendez used his office to provide favors to Dr. Melgen in exchange for gifts, rides on his private plane and political contributions. Both men have denied the charges.

As he awaits his fate, any changes to Mr. Menendez’s political future have the potential to reverberate far beyond New Jersey. With Republicans holding a slim majority in the Senate, much of President Trump’s legislative agenda has stalled or failed. If Mr. Menendez were to be exonerated, or if there were a mistrial, and he decided to run for re-election, he could face an uphill battle after weeks of politically damaging testimony. But the senior senator from New Jersey has shown no willingness to step down.

The note from jurors came three hours after they had started a new round of deliberations after the juror was excused on Thursday so she could on a vacation that had been planned before the trial began. Her excusal, and subsequent media interviews, injected drama into a case that had been relatively staid.

“I’m praying for him that they do not find him guilty,” Evelyn Maultsby, the excused juror, told reporters on Thursday.

Ms. Maultsby’s comments, including accusing fellow jurors of preventing her from expressing her opinion, were widely broadcast, bringing national attention to the trial.

On Monday morning, four jurors admitted in court to having seen news reports about Ms. Maultsby’s comments, even though they had been warned by Judge Walls against following any trial coverage.

Mr. Lowell said Ms. Maultsby’s complaint that she was prevented from giving a note to the judge, represented the “potential that there was misconduct.”

But Judge Walls was emphatic that the trial would proceed. “If you were suggesting that somehow this is a genesis of a mistrial, I am saying that you’re off target,” he said. “You’re way off target. There is no way in God’s green earth that this judge is going to grant a mistrial when we have available to us a new jury.”

Nonetheless, the judge asked the jurors if any of them had seen news reports about Ms. Maultsby. He then interviewed those who had said yes in his chambers, with the defense and prosecution present, before returning to the bench and instructing the jury to restart deliberations.

“You are now a new jury,” Judge Walls said. “You are to disregard whatever you negotiated or deliberated on last week. You’re starting fresh.”

He also issued new instructions. “Every juror has the right to communicate at any and all times with regard to deliberations,” Judge Walls said. “All you need to do is to step outside the door. The guards are there, and he’s on hand to take whatever message you want to give to me in writing.”

Ms. Maultsby’s comments represented a rare moment: an excused juror offering a window into the usually secretive deliberation process while sitting jurors were still debating.

Excusing a juror because of a planned vacation, while uncommon, is not unheard-of. What is unusual is learning details about an ongoing deliberation.

Shira A. Scheindlin, a former federal judge, said, “The only thing is I’m surprised about is that he didn’t instruct her not to say anything.”

Ms. Scheindlin said that “jurors are always free to speak to the press after the verdict,” but “not while it’s going on.” And while a judge cannot legally prohibit an excused juror from speaking to reporters, they often issue a warning to wait until a verdict has been rendered. Judge Walls did not give any such warning.

Now in its 11th week, the trial had been estimated to last six to eight weeks. During jury selection in August, Judge Walls agreed to let Ms. Maultsby go on vacation if the trial had not concluded by Nov. 10.

As the day approached, Judge Walls reminded both sides and the jury of the arrangement.

In 2004, after 23 years at the same company, Ms. Rosenfeld left Kraft to run the Frito-Lay division of PepsiCo.
But Ms. Rosenfeld was undeterred by Mr. Buffett or the British, and the $20 billion deal got done.
At a management meeting in July of 2010, Ms. Rosenfeld said, she surveyed the room and realized she was looking at two companies.
Ms. Rosenfeld has dealt with both men for years, and Mr. Peltz now sits on the Mondelēz board.","Ms. Rosenfeld has kept up with the move toward globalization, shifting away from the United States and Europe and into emerging markets like Asia and Latin America, and introducing some healthier options.

Along the way, she tangled with the British government, Warren Buffett and hedge fund activists including William A. Ackman and Nelson Peltz — not to mention the groups advocating for healthier foods in a much more health-conscious era.

By many measures, she was successful. Through acquisitions, spinoffs, disposals and dividends, she made billions of dollars for investors and a fortune for herself.

“She has focused on building shareholder value successfully by increasing margins with no dewy-eyed nostalgia over changing conditions,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. “She is an honorable leader who has survived an industry going through wrenching change and pressure from tough, vocal short-term activists.”

Ms. Rosenfeld was richly rewarded for her work. In her 11 years as C.E.O. — first of Kraft Foods and now of Mondelēz — she has made about $231 million, according to Equilar. That does not include her compensation before 2006, or a retirement package, yet to be announced, that will surely be worth many millions more.

But as consumer tastes change, millennials are embracing upstart brands. Health concerns over processed foods are on the rise. Mondelēz sales were falling until the company reported an uptick last month, and the stock has barely budged in the last year.

Ms. Rosenfeld and the company say it was her decision to step down. “I’ve been doing this for over a decade,” Ms. Rosenfeld said. “Ever since I announced my retirement, I’ve been sleeping better.”

But the board was ready for change and began looking for her replacement in the spring. Dirk Van de Put, head of frozen food maker McCain Foods, will take over Mondelēz, leaving one fewer woman at the helm of a major company.

“It’s painful for her to leave,” said Lois Juliber, who is on the board of Mondelēz. “I’m not sure she feels like she feels like the job is done yet.”

Born in Brooklyn in 1953, Ms. Rosenfeld grew up on Long Island and went to college at Cornell, where she played basketball and gained advanced degrees in business, and marketing and statistics.

After school, she went to work for an advertising firm, and then in 1981 joined General Foods, which made Oscar Mayer meats and Maxwell House coffee. General Foods was acquired by cigarette maker Philip Morris in 1989, which at that time also owned Kraft.

As her responsibilities expanded to overseeing consumer research, beverages and desserts, she learned some key lessons that would inform her career.

For one, she said, it was important to invest and innovate, which wasn’t easy as a subsidiary of a cigarette maker when tobacco makers were paying big settlements for health related lawsuits. “The parent company was pressuring the food business to deliver cash,” she said.

But perhaps the most important truth she came to understand was an obvious one: People like to eat cookies. They like to eat chips. They like to snack.

“It’s an exceptionally impulse-driven set of products, so consumption is expandable,” she said. “The more displays we would put up in a store like this, the more products we would sell.”

But with those sales successes came the negative connotations associated with peddling “junk food’’ to a nation of consumers who increasingly sought out healthier and fresher options. Noting that “there is an accelerating interest in well-being everywhere in the world,” Ms. Rosenfeld said Mondelēz took the issue seriously, removing genetically modified ingredients from Triscuits, offering resealable packages of Oreos and introducing relatively healthy brands like Véa, a new biscuit line.

Kraft went public in 2001 and Ms. Rosenfeld ran the Canadian business, the operations group, and, by 2002, all of North America.

But the higher she rose, the fewer women there were by her side. Ms. Rosenfeld said she did experience sexism on the job, but declined to provide details.

“I grew up in the industry at a time when there weren’t that many women and in key positions,” she said. “There was always a sense that we needed to work just a little harder, and we had to stand up for ourselves in the face of managers who weren’t as respectful as they ought to have been.”

Ms. Rosenfeld said she thought her athleticism gave her an edge, and that men were impressed that she could often beat them at tennis and golf during company retreats. “I held my own in a lot of these corporate outings,” she said. “I came with a sharply honed competitive instinct.”

In the wake of a flurry of sexual harassment revelations in the business world, Ms. Rosenfeld encouraged female professionals to have a zero-tolerance policy for abuse. “Do what in your heart you know is right,” she said. “It is easy to get caught up in your ambitions, but no job is worth not being true to yourself.”

And Ms. Rosenfeld said she had championed women in the workplace. Fourteen of her employees have gone on to become C.E.O.s of major companies, including Denise Morrison of Campbell Soup and Michele Buck of Hershey.

In 2004, after 23 years at the same company, Ms. Rosenfeld left Kraft to run the Frito-Lay division of PepsiCo. She would have stayed there longer, but in 2006 she got an offer to run her old company, and became the C.E.O. of Kraft Foods.

At the time, Kraft was dominated by big American brands like Velveeta and its eponymous boxed Macaroni & Cheese. Ms. Rosenfeld set out to change that. She acquired Lu, a cookie maker with a big business in Europe. And she set her eyes on Cadbury, the British chocolatier.

After waiting and watching for two years, Ms. Rosenfeld approached Cadbury with a hostile takeover bid in 2009. The company resisted, depicting her as a greedy outsider, and appealed to the British public to protect a cherished national brand. “In an effort to defend themselves, the company draped itself in the Union Jack,” she said.

To attend meetings during the takeover campaign, she would land at airports outside London so as not to be detected, and check into hotels using the pseudonym Debbie Friedman, her favorite Jewish folk singer.

Some Kraft shareholders, including Warren Buffett, disapproved of the acquisition. “One of the reasons Buffett was concerned was he didn’t want to be diluted,” she said.

But Ms. Rosenfeld was undeterred by Mr. Buffett or the British, and the $20 billion deal got done.

At a management meeting in July of 2010, Ms. Rosenfeld said, she surveyed the room and realized she was looking at two companies. So in 2011, she announced the company would be halved — with Kraft focused on savory American staples, and a new company, Mondelēz, focused on a global snacks business. (The name is a Romance language mash-up suggesting a world — “monde” — that’s delicious.)

Mondelēz stock has risen more than 50 percent over the last five years, but hedge fund managers like Mr. Ackman and Mr. Peltz are rarely satisfied. Ms. Rosenfeld has dealt with both men for years, and Mr. Peltz now sits on the Mondelēz board. She grudgingly accepts that activists are here to stay, but said “there is a short-term orientation that is not necessarily healthy for sustainable businesses.”

As her career winds down, Ms. Rosenfeld — who earned a fortune breaking glass ceilings and shaped the fates of so many important brands — remains a company loyalist to the end. She even sees the steady progress of women in the workplace — something she has championed — as a tailwind for her business.

I became good enough, at least, that I was enlisted to make birthday cakes for my friends. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that I became obsessed with a single-subject Tumblr account at this exact time. The site, called Doom Cakes, cataloged cakes that cast long, dark, menacing shadows in films like “The Birds” and “Ghosts of Girlfriends Past.” While I waited for yellow layers to cool in their tins, I’d watch Matthew McConaughey in a shiny waistcoat, struggling to hold up a structurally unsound four-tier wedding cake, and failing. The intricately decorated layers would splatter, finally, in extravagant chaos. Genre didn’t matter. In animation, thrillers and romantic comedies, a cake was vulnerable, and usually a sign of imminent disaster.

These horrifying clips should have put me off, or slowed me down, but instead they propelled me to attempt more and more complicated techniques, and produce more elaborate cakes. A classic Opera cake for my mother’s birthday at home, the almond layers soaked in a boozy coffee syrup. A strawberry-and-cream sandwich built in an acetate-lined ring, carried to friends in Prospect Park on a dangerously warm day. I took a thick roll of spongecake filled with yuzu curd to my boyfriend’s father in the hospital and left it on a plastic folding table with a note, and built a wobbly whirly-domed charlotte that was grotesquely beautiful, serving it after a lunch at home of salad and fried chicken. At a friend’s apartment in Brooklyn, I glazed a sheet cake layered with mint buttercream and chocolate ganache, piping tiny, unnecessary patterns all over it out of melted dark chocolate. What I found was that I baked well with a shiver of dread, that I liked the feeling of rushing ahead without knowing with any certainty that everything would turn out all right. Dread motivated me in the kitchen, in the same way a looming deadline motivated me at my laptop.

When two of my closest friends in New York married, they didn’t ask me to make the cake, but they did give me the navy blue stand mixer they received as a wedding present. Before that, I did everything by hand, switching arms when I got tired, or turning to an ancient, wheezing electric whisk that would bend if it met cold butter and whir to a halt after a minute or two. The stand mixer made me feel superhuman, taking over all the hard work of creaming fats and sugars, whisking stiff meringues, mixing boiling hot sugar syrups into buttercream.

I still feel mildly anxious about making a beautiful cake, though it’s not necessary: If you read recipes a few times before you start, a cake is not, in fact, a mysterious adventure, revealing itself in snippets as you go. If it has been some time since you last baked, you can make sure you have all the ingredients ahead of time, and check the levels in your tin of baking powder and your pan sizes. The things that seem obvious now didn’t always. I occasionally take the temperature of my oven, to make sure it matches up with what’s on the dial (it usually doesn’t, and I adjust accordingly). I buy rolls of parchment paper to line the bottom of every pan. I use a digital scale and weigh everything out before I start. I let cakes cool, completely, before cutting or frosting them.

All year long, I’ve baked cakes I’ve read about on blogs and in books, and found my way to some favorites. A gingerbread cake, full of spice and warmth, doesn’t always need a frosting, Genevieve Ko reminded me. She makes a version with spelt flour and rehydrated prunes, hot with ginger, cinnamon and clove, and finishes it with a dusting of cocoa powder. It’s excellent right away, particularly light and tender and full of flavor, but it seemed to get even more mellow on Day 2. It came together quickly and required no decorating, simply taking on the curves of the Bundt pan.

Helen Goh and Yotam Ottolenghi’s lemon cake, frosted with black-currant buttercream, had been in the back of my mind since this past summer. It looked simple enough, but cut open, revealed several bright vertical layers, like a kind of magic trick. The technique was unusual — instead of making a long, skinny jellyroll out of the large sponge, they cut the cake into three pieces, connecting them to make one shorter, thicker roll, and then sitting it upright. I followed the recipe at home, amazed. By then it was fall, so I replaced the black currants with frozen cranberries, and the tart frosting turned a beautiful shade of pink.

Few recipe writers are as precise as Stella Parks, a former pastry chef whose instructions always fill me with a sense of clearheaded confidence. The batter for her devil’s-food cake comes together in a single pot, without any special equipment. But to call it a dump-it cake would be a kind of disservice: It bakes into an exceptional, sturdy but somehow very tender chocolate cake, buttery with a soft edge of bitterness. Stacked in three layers, covered with a thick meringue frosting, then torched like a giant marshmallow, it’s one of those cakes that defines the genre of showstopper.

I anticipate all kinds of minor catastrophes when my family gets together. I always do. This year, none of them have anything to do with cake.

Cranberry-Lemon Stripe Cake

When I first started baking in Melbourne, I made a simple chocolate cake, and it ended up on the front page of the weekend paper with the headline “World’s Best Chocolate Cake.” From then on, I had this cult following, and in a way, it was a lot of pressure. I didn’t have much experience, but it spurred me on to live up to this reputation.

I still have my practice as a psychologist in London; I also develop cakes for Ottolenghi, Yotam’s cafes in London. These have to be visually appealing, cut neatly and keep well in the window, because it’s an unrefrigerated counter. When Yotam rang me up, saying we needed more color in our cookbook, I had the idea that the best way to get color into a cake would be fruit. (My mother used to say, “Fruit is God’s candy.”)

I had seen a vertical-stripe technique before, and it isn’t difficult to do, once you get your head around it. The thing with this spongecake is to separate the yolks and whites. The meringue uses a little sugar, because if you whip it without sugar, it gets airy and dry. With sugar, you get a very glossy, slightly denser meringue, and when you fold it into the batter, it doesn’t break down as much. It’s strong but light, and still airy from the meringue. It’s quite a rich cake to eat. When you roll it up, sometimes the seam finishes really neatly, and sometimes it doesn’t, depending on the exact pan size you use. But I don’t worry about it too much: The buttercream covers it all up.

Devil’s-Food Cake With Toasted-Marshmallow Frosting

Stella Parks Author of the cookbook “BraveTart” See the Recipe

I’ve been making cakes since I was a child; we had a babysitter who would come over to the house with a box of cake mix and a tub of frosting, and we had a blast making cakes. By the time I was 9 or 10, I was ready to graduate from a mix and make them myself. I got super into it, and I made my first wedding cake, for money, at 16. I can remember the sheer terror of delivering it: My dad drove, and I was allowed to sit on the floor of the van with the cake, unbuckled, in case the layers moved around. This was what led me to culinary school, to a baking-and-pastry program, to restaurants. I thought, I want to really figure this out, because this is so fun I could do it forever.

Historically, a devil’s-food cake would have been a chocolate cake made with all butter, egg yolks, hot coffee and cocoa powder. A lot of cakes use the creaming method, because there’s so much sugar and butter that the batter is really dense, by nature. The way the ratio of mine is formulated, it’s not that dense, which means it doesn’t have the deep need for aeration that some batters do. I didn’t intend to develop a one-pot recipe, but that’s how it evolved.

Sugarplum Gingerbread Cake

Genevieve Ko Author of the cookbook “Better Baking” See the Recipe

I grew up in a Chinese-American family in Southern California, the first generation born here, and I didn’t taste gingerbread until well into adulthood. Both of my grandmothers lived with us — one from China and the other from Hong Kong — and they both loved sweets. As a treat, they’d offer me candied ginger, which can be hot and intense, along with many varieties of dried plums. And they’d buy cakes from Chinese bakeries, which would be very light and fluffy, not that sweet.

I didn’t taste gingerbread, but I always had a fantasy of gingerbread, as a warming cake that kids ate in snowy cabins. Once I started working at American food magazines, tinkering every year with gingerbread recipes, I wished for something different, and lighter in texture. I came back to this confluence of ginger and dried plums, the flavors that had been with me my whole life. Dried plums are earthy and almost a little funky. They have a gentle tannic quality that I also find in molasses, just on the edge of bitterness, which softens the harshness of the gingerbread and gives it layers of complexity. Rehydrated, the plums make up the liquid base of the batter, which keeps the cake’s texture light. So does the spelt flour, which has a natural, round sweetness. Because it’s an oil-based cake, it stays tender for days. This is the gingerbread I was always chasing.",Three Gorgeous Cakes for the Holidays,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/magazine/yotam-ottolenghi-stella-parks-genevieve-ko-cranberry-lemon-devils-food-gingerbread-cakes.html

And Finally ...

The Great Los Angeles Walk lets people see the city from a different vantage point. Sometimes that means the mundane, like an unexplored shop, and sometimes the memorable: the Lakers icon Magic Johnson, the aftermath of a crane collapse, and lots and lots of weddings.

The horde of walkers itself, however, may be the most jarring sight in a sprawling city known for its traffic.

“Every year we manage to surprise people,” said Michael Schneider, the walk’s founder and organizer, “because they don’t expect to see an army of Angelenos walking down the street. It shocks some people, but it inspires others.”

About 40 people participated in the first walk, along Wilshire Boulevard in 2006. Melrose Avenue and a bevy of boulevards — Pico, Sunset, West Adams, Hollywood, Ventura and Olympic — have been explored since.

This year’s 17-mile walk will travel along Beverly, one of the city’s oldest boulevards, for the first time. An expected crowd of several hundred people will begin at the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo at 9 a.m. on Saturday, with plans to reach Santa Monica State Beach by sunset. Along the way, walkers will amble past City Hall, Walt Disney Concert Hall and CBS Television City.

You truly don’t need a car to explore Los Angeles, and Mr. Schneider recommends older neighborhoods that are walkable, including Los Feliz, Larchmont, Atwater Village and Highland Park.

The annual walk across the city is one way to encourage people to turn off the ignition, to gaze at street art. There is no finish line.

“Some people treat it almost as a marathon, and that’s not the point of this walk,” Mr. Schneider said. “This is all about taking your time and exploring.”

Last June, they rented a one-bedroom on East 85th Street for $2,450 a month, putting their cavalier attitude toward personal space to the test. Ms. Mulhall took the bedroom — which has two good-sized closets and overhead storage — and Mr. Robison has a loft bed in the living room. Underneath it, he keeps his clothes on a garment rack and in a large wicker trunk he found on the street.

“People will just throw stuff out at the end of the month — their couches, their beds,” Mr. Robison said. “It’s entertaining just to see all the random stuff.”

They split the rent, with Ms. Mulhall shouldering the utilities, which run about $150 a month.

“We must have seen at least 80 apartments,” she said. Their broker, Kim Bloomfield, of Citi Habitats, convinced them to look on the East Side for more space and a shorter commute. At the time, Ms. Mulhall was doing package design in White Plains, N.Y.

“We’d walk into a place, and Kim would look at my face and be like, ‘No, never mind,’” Ms. Mulhall said. “Or we’d go in and be like, ‘Where would the bed fit in the living room?’ And she’d be like, ‘A bed doesn’t fit in here. Let’s go.’”

By the time Mr. Robison saw their current place, they had already lost out on several places they loved. He immediately called Ms. Mulhall to tell her that it was the ideal layout: The living room and bedroom were on opposite ends of the apartment, with the kitchen and bathroom in between, so neither one getting up in the middle of the night would disturb the other.

“If we wait,” he warned, “it will be gone.”

There was only one major drawback: a mini fridge rather than a full-size one (though, oddly enough, there is a full-size dishwasher).

But while they’re a very short walk from many major train lines, Ms. Mulhall still wishes they had found something on the Upper West Side. “I feel like it’s sunnier over there,” she said ruefully. “The buildings are shorter.”

“But you could not fit this couch into most places we saw,” said Mr. Robison, perching on the arm of the big sofa they bought for $65 on Craigslist.

“And it doesn’t feel crammed — it feels open,” he said of the apartment, which is cheery and spacious, with large, storybook-like casement windows, high ceilings and a kitchen with a pretty blue-and-white tile backsplash.

Names: Caitlin Mulhall and Matthew Robison Ages: 22 and 23 Occupations: Ms. Mulhall, who studied advertising and graphic design in school, is currently freelancing. Mr. Robison works as a server at Ocean Prime, a restaurant on 52nd Street, and does real estate staging with Anne Kenney Associates. Rent: $2,450, split evenly. Ms. Mulhall, who has the bedroom, pays the $150 or so a month in utilities.No co-signers or guarantors: The landlord agreed to accept an extra month’s rent up front in lieu of a guarantor, since neither had immediate family in the tri-state area. Biggest issue with sharing a one-bedroom: The storage — the apartment lacks a living room or hall closet. “We have definitely tried to buy more storage,” Ms. Mulhall said, pointing out the ottoman and coat rack/entrance bench. How to live with a mini-fridge: “You have to grocery-shop every day. And the freezer is this big,” Ms. Mulhall said, holding her hands a tiny distance apart. “We can’t get ice cream; you have to eat the whole thing in a sitting.” What they share: Food, cooking duties, overhead storage in the bedroom and a hamper that hangs on the back of the bathroom door.

“Not even when we have other people over,” Ms. Mulhall agreed, pointing out that they often invite friends — and even her mother — to stay over on the sofa.

It was her mother’s stories about working in New York in her 20s that made Ms. Mulhall want to move to New York. But the first job she got out of school — both she and Mr. Robinson attended the Columbus College of Art and Design in Ohio — was in the Bay Area, designing packaging for E. & J. Gallo Winery. Mr. Robison had also gone west and was doing set design in Los Angeles. During one late-night phone call, Ms. Mulhall told Mr. Robison that she wanted to move east and that he had to come with her.

“I didn’t know anyone in L.A.,” Mr. Robison said. “All my family is from Ohio and Pennsylvania.”

“I love it,” Ms. Mulhall said of New York. “This is where I’m supposed to be. There’s so much to do here: Carl Schurz Park, Central Park, tempting shopping on 86th.”

Mr. Robinson added: “Once this summer, we went to Coney Island and it only took us 45 minutes on the Q. And you can order food in the middle of the night.”

And as for sharing a one-bedroom?

“Sometimes I feel like I’m intruding on his space, because I’m always out here,” Ms. Mulhall said. “And then I’ll go in my room and he’ll be like, ‘Why are you in here?’”

The only awkward thing about their living situation, they agreed, is the neighbor whose kitchen is directly opposite Ms. Mulhall’s bedroom.

But there are also some new aspects to this latest money grab. This time around, much more clearly than before, the goal seems to be to favor wealth, especially inherited wealth, over work. And buried in the legislation are multiple measures that would make it much harder for the children of the middle and working classes to work their way up.

So, about the wealthy: The prime example is the way G.O.P. plans would eliminate or sharply reduce taxes on inherited wealth, which currently apply only to a tiny number of huge estates. Yes, Republicans are still pretending that this is about helping small family businesses and family farms, but at this point that’s a sick joke: The best estimates suggest that only around 80 — eight-zero — of such businesses and farms pay any estate tax each year. This is about making wealthy heirs even wealthier — full stop.

There are other big examples, like a new tax loophole that would benefit business owners — but only as long as they don’t actually run their businesses. And there’s more. But let me shift focus instead to what Republicans are trying to do to ordinary families.

We’re still waiting for detailed analysis of the Senate bill, but the House bill doesn’t just raise taxes on many middle-class families: It selectively raises taxes on families with children. In fact, half — half! — of families with children will see a tax hike once the bill is fully phased in.

Suppose that a child from a working-class family decides, despite limited financial resources, to attend college, probably taking out a loan to help pay tuition. Well, guess what: Under the House bill, that interest would no longer be deductible, substantially raising the cost of college.

What if you’re working your way through school and your employer contributes toward your education expenses? The House bill would make that contribution taxable income.

What if your parent is a university employee, and you get reduced tuition as a result? That tuition break becomes taxable income. So would tuition breaks for graduate students who work as teaching or research assistants.

So what we’re looking at here are a variety of measures that will close off opportunities for children who weren’t clever enough to choose wealthy parents.

Meanwhile, funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which covers more than eight million children, expired a month and a half ago — and so far, Republicans have made no serious effort to restore it. This is surely the shape of things to come: If tax cuts pass, and the deficit explodes, the G.O.P. will suddenly decide that deficits matter again and will demand cuts in social programs, many of which benefit lower-income children.

So this isn’t just ordinary class warfare; it’s class warfare aimed at perpetuating inequality into the next generation. Taken together, the elements of both the House and the Senate bills amount to a more or less systematic attempt to lavish benefits on the children of the ultra-wealthy while making it harder for less fortunate young people to achieve upward social mobility.

Or to put it differently, the tax legislation Republicans are trying to ram through Congress with indecent haste, without hearings or time for any kind of serious study, looks an awful lot like an attempt not simply to reinforce plutocracy, but to entrench a hereditary plutocracy.",Republican Class Warfare: The Next Generation,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/opinion/republican-taxes-next-generation.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Two years after Paris, the world is still off track

Under the Paris deal, nearly 200 countries submitted proposals for cutting their greenhouse gas emissions. Yet not one of the major industrialized nations is on course to hit those goals.

And even those goals are just a starting point — emissions would have to be cut even further to stop global average temperatures from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels, the point at which scientists say drastic consequences will be unavoidable.

• Where do the countries stand now, what have they pledged and what will they eventually need to achieve? These charts lay it out:

• Separately, a study released on Monday was another indication that the world has not turned the corner on cutting emissions. Industrial emissions had been steady for the past three years, but are projected to rise to record highs this year:

The United States is in an awkward position

• The Trump administration has sent a delegation to Bonn, but the American negotiators will be hashing out the details of a climate deal that President Trump has vowed to abandon — “like a spouse who demands a divorce but then continues to live at home,” as our reporter put it.

• A shadow American delegation is also at the talks, led by former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Gov. Jerry Brown of California, who have vowed that states, cities and businesses are “still in” the Paris agreement, even if the federal government is not.

• The Trump administration sent representatives from energy companies to promote coal, natural gas and nuclear power. Mr. Trump has pledged to support those industries, but the presentation was met with jeers from protesters.

• Syria announced last week that it would join the Paris climate accord, meaning that every country in the world has now signed on to the pact or intends to join — and only one, the United States, has signaled its intention to withdraw from it. (Nicaragua, another holdout, said last month that it would join the agreement.)

• On the Friday before the conference opened, 13 federal agencies released a comprehensive scientific report that affirmed that humans are to blame for most of the global warming that has occurred since the start of the 20th century. That will not surprise anyone at the Bonn conference — but it does directly contradict statements from some top Trump administration officials.

“I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay.
In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.
The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat.
“The humidity of Key West made a lot of things a little ripe, but the photos are beautiful,” Scott DeWolfe said.","It seems fitting that during Walker Evans’s one-month stay in Havana in 1933 he would befriend Ernest Hemingway. The two shared an appreciation of a spare style that would influence countless others in photography and literature. In fact, Evans entrusted Hemingway with a trove of original prints to ensure they would not be confiscated by the authorities who were violently suppressing popular outrage against the dictator Gerardo Machado.

Now, 46 of those vintage prints are being sold by DeWolfe and Wood Rare Books of Alfred, Me., and Michael Brown Rare Books of Philadelphia, and are featured in a catalog whose comprehensive introductory essay was written by Mr. Brown. The collection is owned by Benjamin Bruce, known as Dink. His father, Telly Otto Bruce, known as Toby, was Hemingway’s friend and factotum and had safeguarded the images for decades in Key West, Fla., where Hemingway had lived.

Photo

Evans had gone to Cuba to make pictures for “The Crime of Cuba,” a book by Carleton Beals that was a fierce critique of American adventurism. “The Beals book is an expose of our misgovernment in Cuba, and the disgraceful part we have played in her tragic history past and present, economic, social, political,” read the review in Kirkus. “Sins of omission perhaps even more than sins of commission. The story of Cuba is the story of tyranny-Spain, the United States, Wall Street, and now, closely linked with the immediate past, the dictatorship of Machado, which makes Mussolini look like a Sunday School picnic.”

Evans got a taste of that supercharged political climate in his earliest days there, according to Mr. Brown’s essay, where a bus ride could turn into a journey of intrigue as who-knows-who was tailing him as he tried to meet with opposition figures. At the same time, the city thrilled him.

“When you are still bewildered,” Evans wrote in his diary, “you notice more things, as in a drunk. I was drunk with a new city for days.”

That feeling became literal when he met Hemingway, likely through an introduction by one of Beals’s newspaper contacts on the island. “I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay. “Drinking every night. He was at loose ends … and he needed a drinking companion, and I filled that role for two weeks.”

Photo

But as the essay also noted, Hemingway’s prose style may have had an influence on Evans, whose vision had been influenced earlier by a stay in Paris, where he came to appreciate the work of Eugène Atget. The images — out of a total of 400 taken during his one-month sojourn, betray that influence in photos of facades and streets. Some of them show more isolated, intimate scenes in public, from a haggard looking country family to beggars. In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.

The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat. Once there, the images ended up in storage either behind, or next to, Sloppy Joe’s, the famous Key West saloon.

“The humidity of Key West made a lot of things a little ripe, but the photos are beautiful,” Scott DeWolfe said. “What is fascinating is I think Evans was printing these where he was able to. Unlike later prints, most of these are uncropped, and slightly different. One print has Evans’s thumbprint. It’s as close to a first generation print you could possibly find.”

Media reporters and male competitors routinely trivialize her accomplishments. Never once during her tenure does she work up the nerve to ask for a proper raise, even after Vanity Fair becomes profitable and Harper’s Bazaar starts to court her. (She eventually enlists the help of a superagent.) Even she suffers from a self-esteem gap.

When Brown was first offered the job to rescue the recently revived (and incompetently revived) Vanity Fair, in 1983, she was just 29 years old. The magazine was an outpost of confusion in those days, and Condé Nast was a castle of paranoia, its towers filled with schemers hoping to avoid defenestration.

It took a while for Brown to master the politics of this byzantine kingdom, and it took a while for her to arrive at the formula that would ultimately be responsible for the magazine’s success: A mix of celebrity chronicles, foreign reportage, true-crime stories, profiles of power brokers and extravagant photo spreads — all sitting side by side in the back of the same limo.

If these diaries have a theme, it’s status anxiety. There was no finer moment than the ’80s to explore status anxiety. The book teems with gossip from that bygone era, with the Kissingers, Reagans and a thousand high-haired socialites in starring roles. (Along with our current president. “It feels, when you have finished it, as if you’ve been nose to nose for four hours with an entertaining con man, and I suspect the American public will like nothing better,” Brown writes in 1987, having just decided to excerpt “The Art of the Deal.”)

There’s swing in Brown’s voice and vinegar in her pen. Walter Mondale is “a decent, intelligent, slightly boring fellow who would make an excellent prime minister of Norway.” Michael Huffington, the ex-husband of Arianna, is “a tall glass of water with a weak smile.” Almost everything she shares about the Kissingers is perfect. The best, perhaps: when a friend cattily asks, “Have you noticed their dining room is an exact replica of the State Department’s?”

For legacy-media freaks, “The Vanity Fair Diaries” is a bound volume of crack. Tina Brown’s moment wasn’t just predicated on the excesses of Wall Street. It was predicated on the excesses of the magazine business, of a time when editors still had time and money to burn. A crisis in Brown’s world was being seated at the wrong table at the Four Seasons, or being forced to coordinate coverage of Andy Warhol’s death by speakerphone because the person best suited to do it was off in Gstaad.

Yet after reading these diaries, I still wonder how much of an audience exists for them. Pages upon pages are filled with stories about dinners with doyennes who, even in their day, were only a big deal in one or two ZIP codes. Many of its barons are long forgotten, dead or disgraced. The dish about Condé Nast’s kings and queens regnant will be tasty to those who know them, but will anyone beyond their own (dwindling) clan even care?

Tolstoy can ask you to remember hundreds of characters. I don’t think Tina Brown can.

Brown also never satisfactorily reconciles why she wanted to insert herself into the endless cocktail surf of the ’80s. She professes to be an introvert, and she repeatedly laments New York’s materialism, posturing and social churn. Yet she often writes these plaintive entries from her beach house in the Hamptons. “Why do I keep seeking out the very things I deride?” she asks.

Her reply — “perhaps because I was born to chronicle them” — suggests that large parts of her desires remain unexamined. She lived and celebrated these values as much as she chronicled them. “Vanity Fair’s fifth anniversary party!” she writes on March 1, 1988. “Maybe the best party in Manhattan since Truman Capote’s Black and White Ball.”

To me, Brown’s truest and most heartfelt confessions are about her maternal guilt and ambivalence. She’s beset by fears that her jet-engine work drive will never be compatible with a sane family life. “The weekend was hard, with G” — her toddler son, George — “being very difficult and Harry chained to his computer as bloody always,” she writes in 1989. “Two workaholics don’t make a rightaholic, particularly when it comes to raising kids.”

Knowing that her son has Asperger’s syndrome — Brown has written about it in recent years — makes certain entries especially painful. Gradually, we see her realize that her son is perseverating, mixing uneasily with other kids, missing crucial developmental milestones. Before he’s properly diagnosed, a neurologist chalks up his differences and delays to his premature birth. “Was it my fault for working too hard and long?” Brown asks herself. Your heart dissolves. It’s so hard to imagine a high-powered father asking himself this same question.

Brown may have been a complicated feminist figure. But she was also a trailblazer, willing to take risks and get battered and bruised in the arena. In 1992, she took over The New Yorker and had the temerity to transform it. She even dared to add photographs. I hope she also kept a diary during those years.

LeBron James has bullied the Knicks during his 15-year N.B.A. career. He’s dominated them on the court and rejected them in free agency. He helped turn a generation of stars against their team president and eliminated them from the playoffs.

The Knicks, enfeebled for most of the past two decades, have been unable to push back.

But Monday night, in the final minute of the first quarter, the Knicks showed a backbone, and the display of defiance came from a rookie: Frank Ntilikina. As James hovered over him following a dunk, Ntilikina drove his shoulder in his torso, then grazed him again as he walked past. When James stared down Ntilikina, Enes Kanter ran in to confront James, and the two were quickly separated by a referee.

“I don’t care who you are,” Kanter said after the game. “What you call yourself — King, Queen, Princess, whatever you are. We’re gonna fight. No one out there is going to punk us.”

The Knicks’ performance Monday night may have been the best sign yet that they are divorcing themselves from their haphazard identity of the recent past. A victory over the Cavaliers at Madison Square Garden would have been nice, too, but the Knicks are not yet ready to have it all. Instead, they took a 104-101 loss as James got the best of them once again.

Cleveland was down by as many as 23 points late in the third quarter but gobbled up that deficit quickly, scoring 43 points in the fourth quarter. The Cavaliers took their first lead in the fourth when James knocked down a 3-pointer from the left wing with 1 minute 23 seconds to go, then hopscotched back down the court.

The Cavaliers, with a record of 7-7, might have their problems , but James provided a reminder of his potency with 23 points, 12 assists and 9 rebounds.

Yet the Knicks, after years of losing basketball that numbed their fans and helped run off the star forward Carmelo Anthony and Phil Jackson, the former team president, proved they are fun and feisty again. While Anthony is adapting to his new life in Oklahoma City, the Knicks have moved on. Despite the defeat, they have won seven of their last 10 games following an 0-3 start, and are unafraid to poke the defending Eastern Conference champions.

Kristaps Porzingis is developing into a full-fledged star, regularly scoring upward of 30 points per game. He scored 20 Monday night and had seven rebounds.

The Knicks have had stars before, but this team seems to be developing a legitimate identity while providing Porzingis with effective help. Kanter, who scored 20 points and grabbed 16 rebounds, gives them an imposing force at center. Tim Hardaway Jr., who scored a team-high 28 and notched 10 rebounds, is a spry wing on the perimeter. The cast of journeyman and veterans surrounding them has contributed to some early success.

Ntilikina, however, is the pillar beside Porzingis. He does not possess Porzingis’s highlight-reel abilities or Twitter-friendly nickname. He remains young (19) and unproven, but there is early evidence that the franchise made the right choice by taking him with the eighth overall pick in the N.B.A. Draft in June.

James might not agree — he engaged the Knicks in another verbal tiff this weekend by saying he believed the club should have chosen Dennis Smith Jr., who went to Dallas, instead. James insisted later it was a jab at Jackson, not Ntilikina.

The two are acquainted now.

“That’s good,” Knicks Coach Jeff Hornacek said. “A young kid to stand up to the best player in the league.”

Ntilikina has yet to become an effective offensive player but he is a capable thief on the court, picking six steals against Cleveland, and has played steady defense. He has given the Knicks glimmers of the prospect they believe can one day be their starting point guard.

And thirteen games into a season that is supposed to be a bridge to what the franchise hopes is a bright future, there are, at least, signals that the Knicks have hope.

“The respect will be earned in the future,” Porzingis said. “With everybody.”

Correction : An earlier version of this article misstated the number of assists and rebounds that LeBron James had against the Knicks. He had 12 assists and 9 rebounds, not 12 rebounds and 9 assists.

“I hope you find something that does someone some good,” said Clarence Matthews, 110, who allowed his blood to be drawn as a final contribution to the database last year at his Indian Wells, Calif., home while I watched at his side.

The rare cache of supercentenarian genomes, the largest yet to be sequenced and made public, comes as studies of garden-variety longevity have yielded few solid clues to healthy aging. Lifestyle and luck, it seems, still factor heavily into why people live into their 90s and 100s.

To the extent that they have a genetic advantage, it appears to come partly from having inherited fewer than usual DNA variations known to raise the risk of heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease and other afflictions.

That is not enough, some researchers say, to explain what they call “truly rare survival,” or why supercentenarians are more uniformly healthy than centenarians in their final months and years.

Rather than having won dozens of hereditary coin tosses with DNA variations that are less bad, scientists suggest, supercentenarians may possess genetic code that actively protects them from aging.

But the effort to find that code has been “challenged,” as a group of leading longevity researchers put it in a recent academic paper, in part by the difficulties in acquiring supercentenarian DNA.

The New England Centenarian Study, one of a handful of longevity research groups around the world focusing on supercentenarians, now turns down prospective DNA donors under age 103: “We tell them they’re too young,” said Dr. Thomas Perls, the study’s director.

The DNA sequences being released this week were acquired almost single-handedly by James Clement, 61, the founder of a company advised by the prominent Harvard geneticist George Church.

A professed citizen-scientist, Mr. Clement collected blood, skin or saliva from supercentenarians in 14 states and seven countries over a six-year period. Many were still gardening, arguing, driving and flirting. Ms. Michelson, for one, was fond of reading and reciting Shakespeare.

The usefulness of such a small group for a genetic study is unclear, which is one reason Mr. Clement’s company, now defunct, has turned into a crowdsourcing project.

Complex traits like height, body mass index and disease risk — phenotypes, as they are known in genetics-speak — typically arise from a combination of hundreds of places in the genome where the DNA alphabet differs between individuals.

Zeroing in on which variations affect which phenotypes requires the statistical power of tens of thousands of DNA samples — almost certainly a dealbreaker when it comes to supercentenarians, whose verified number, worldwide, hovers at around 150.

On large swaths of the planet, where birth records are sketchy or nonexistent, identifying verified supercentenarians is virtually impossible. In the United States, researchers say supercentenarians account for about one in five million people.

Amateur genealogists dedicated to validating the ages of the world’s oldest people estimate that even the unverified total comes to only about 1,000.

Still, some researchers hope that despite the limited number of available genomes, it will be possible to identify the secret sauce of supercentenarians with methods used to uncover the genetic basis for other rare conditions. No one quite knows how many genomes might be necessary.

“This is what we call an ‘extreme phenotype,’ ” said Dr. Church, who ultimately arranged for the genomes to be sequenced so that Mr. Clement could release them through a nonprofit. “The farther out you go on the bell curve, the more likely you are to find something, even with a small sample size.”

As the goal of slowing aging to extend human “health span” has gained traction in the scientific mainstream, research has largely been limited to animal studies.

A secretive Google spinoff called Calico, for California Life Company, is said to be scrutinizing the genome of the naked mole rat, celebrated for a life span 10 times longer than that of most of its rat cousins. Federally funded scientists are testing a drug on monkeys based on an experiment that doubled the lives of roundworms.

And in laboratories across the world, the markers of age in over-the-hill mice, rats and turquoise killifish are, sometimes, being reversed.

But what works in shorter-lived organisms often does not translate to humans, whose average life span in developed countries is approaching 80 years. So despite the limitations of Mr. Clement’s database, several prominent researchers have already expressed interest in it.

“This could show the utility of starting a bigger collection,” said Paola Sebastiani, a longevity researcher at Boston University.

An account of what Mr. Clement calls the Supercentenarian Research Project offers a glimpse at what that might entail, including perseverance, compassion and a sense of humor that trends toward dark.

Life or Death

It was an inauspicious start, Mr. Clement admitted in an email to a friend in January 2011. The first supercentenarian Mr. Clement had lined up to visit, Mississippi Winn, had died at 113 before he could get from his home in San Jose, Calif., to hers in Shreveport, La.

Photo

“RIP Miss Winn,” he posted on the Facebook page that family members had set up for Ms. Winn, believed to be the last living child of African-Americans born into slavery.

Such condolences would become a familiar refrain. Of the 70,000 or so Americans who live to be 100, only some two dozen are typically alive at 110.

Once that milestone is reached, as Mr. Clement quickly learned, the chance of dying within the next year is roughly 50 percent. After 113, the odds are closer to 66 percent. The oldest person on record, Jeanne Calment, was 122 when she died in 1997; only one other person is known to have lived beyond age 118.

“Even while you’re packing the car, the person may fall ill and say they’re not up to it,” Mr. Clement said, after the first of several plans for me to observe a DNA donation was abruptly canceled.

Mr. Clement could extract DNA from post-mortem samples, with permission from the family and assuming he could reach the funeral home in time. Exhumation is also possible, in theory, to obtain samples.

But for understandable reasons, he said, family members most often ended communications with him at the time of a supercentenarian’s death. To improve the odds of getting samples — and the gender balance, since supercentenarians are nearly all women — he lowered his target age from 110 to 106.

“It’s better to get there when they’re alive,” he said.

Guided by the World’s Oldest People email list, whose moderator, Robert D. Young, verifies ages on behalf of Guinness World Records and tracks supercentenarians for the Gerontology Research Group, Mr. Clement placed decal dots designating the locations of prospective participants on a map pinned to the wall of his home office.

He created Google alerts for the phrases “109th birthday,” “110th birthday,” and “111th birthday,” and for the obituaries of known supercentenarians.

Unlike so-called blue zones, where centenarians are said to cluster, there is no geographical shortcut for netting supercentenarians. So he called, emailed and sent Facebook friend requests to whatever contacts he could find, wherever he could find them.

A Birthday Invitation

There was, nominally, the prospect of making money.

But with a business plan that, even to some of his investors, sounded more like a research project, Mr. Clement seems to have undertaken the task largely because it provided the chance to act on a longstanding interest in human longevity, including his own.

A self-described transhumanist who eats mostly low-glycemic vegetables and nuts and walks seven miles a day, Mr. Clement has accumulated an eclectic résumé that includes starting a brew pub, practicing international tax law and cofounding a futurist magazine.

He harbors what he prefers to call a “healthy love of life,” rather than an aversion to death, and he is possessed of an apparently genuine conviction that longer lives would make humans more humane.

“My hat was off to someone who was willing to take the time out of his life to go get these precious specimens,” said Dr. Church, the Harvard geneticist, who has devoted a portion of his laboratory to research into the reversal of aging.

The kind of ultrarare mutations that supercentenarians might harbor, Dr. Church believed, were not likely to be detected with standard techniques, which scan only the places in the genome where DNA is already known to vary between individuals.

To look for as-yet-uncataloged variations would require sequencing all of the supercentenarians’ six billion genetic letters, a far more expensive procedure. When he and Mr. Clement first discussed the idea in 2010, the cost was about $50,000 per genome.

But the price was falling. And with the financial support of a handful of like-minded wealthy individuals who agreed to invest in the exploratory phase of the project, “it just seemed,” Mr. Clement said, “like something I could do.”

Even with the Harvard name as a calling card, several of the families he contacted over the next few years did not respond to his inquiries. A few, Mr. Clement knew, had already been approached by laboratories at Stanford and Boston University, which were collecting their own stashes of supercentenarian DNA.

“She already did her DNA donation,” Paul Cooper, the grandson of Besse Cooper, a 116-year-old former suffragist, told Mr. Clement, who had driven several hundred miles to her Monroe, Ga., nursing home in 2012.

Walter Breuning, of Great Falls, Mont., one of just a handful of men known to have lived to 114, replied in late 2010 that it was his preference not to risk winter meetings. He died early the next spring.

An invitation to the 111th birthday party of James Sisnett in Barbados finally served as Mr. Clement’s entree in February 2011. He died two years later.

Mr. Sisnett, who grew his own food until he was 105, was “still fascinated by seeing a nice-looking backside” when he was in his 110s, his daughter, Everine Carter, 88, recalled in a telephone interview.

Losing Precious Samples

The best time to get DNA from a supercentenarian, Mr. Clement found, is midmorning. By lunchtime, they would prefer to be eating. After lunch, they might be groggy or napping.

Most, like Dorothy Peel of London, then 108, had sharp minds. Ms. Peel inspected the informed consent form through her reading glasses and peppered him with questions about other supercentenarians he had met.

Crisscrossing Europe in 2011, Mr. Clement hit his collecting stride. But there were some bumps.

He had ordered an inexpensive kit that allowed him to prick a supercentenarian’s finger and deposit a drop of blood on a card to preserve it, often used by geneticists in the field.

Within a few months he had blood drops from 15 donors, including Ralph Tarrant of Sheffield, England, who at 108 completed the London Times crossword puzzle every afternoon.

Not until he had switched to hiring a phlebotomist to perform blood draws with a needle did he learn that the cards with the original 15 samples were defective. “We could not detect any DNA,” read a 2011 email from the laboratory.

Mr. Clement confessed the news to Dr. Church in a meeting at his Harvard office. “You didn’t test the cards?” the geneticist asked him gently.

Still, Mr. Clement had 23 good samples in hand, and the cost of sequencing by this time had fallen to some $15,000 per genome. With his remaining funds, he sequenced 15, leaving the rest in cold storage.

Photo

Mr. Clement quickly discovered 2,500 differences between the supercentenarian DNA and those of controls. But even with help from graduate students in Dr. Church’s lab, it was hard with such a small group to know which, if any, were significant.

So over the next few years, Mr. Clement, working without a salary, collected samples whenever he could, adding another dozen from supercentenarians across the United States.

In the spring of last year, a company Dr. Church had co-founded, Veritas Genetics, announced that it would sequence human genomes for $1,000 each. Dr. Church told Mr. Clement that Veritas would sequence the remaining samples, and so he set out to collect a few more.

Advice From America’s Oldest Man

In July 2016, I was invited to accompany Mr. Clement to Mr. Matthews’s home in California. As much as I looked forward to meeting my first supercentenarian, I was not prepared to envy his win in the genetic longevity lottery.

I had feared he would be lonely, a concern echoed by several of the Facebook viewers who watched me ply him with questions over a live video stream the morning we met. “I don’t want to outlive my friends and family,” one typed. “That’s no fun.”

The prospect of shifting today’s average life span to that of the known limit of all humanity is disorienting. An average life expectancy of 80 in some ways seems generous — it was just 48 when Mr. Matthews was born in 1906. Most of us expect around 80 years on the planet, assuming nothing horrendous happens.

“When you have children the first time, it don’t come with a manual, and it don’t come with a manual when your dad gets to be 100, then 105, then 110,” said Mr. Matthews’s son, Steve, 75, who also gave blood the day we visited.

But Mr. Matthews asserted without hesitation that he still enjoyed life. Pleasures included his lunchtime smoothie, his family, the kindness of his caregiver, and — this with a nod to a New York Times photographer and a rakish grin — “having my picture taken.”

He reminisced fondly about his second wife, Katherine, who died in 1980 and with whom he had loved to dance.

At 110, he said he had never been diagnosed with a serious illness. The younger Mr. Matthews recalled that his father had played a one-under-par, 18-hole golf game on his 99th birthday. Having built a successful real estate business, he provided financial support to his last surviving sibling, a sister who was 105.

Talking to him, it was hard not to fantasize about the possibility that, as another Facebook participant suggested, “by the time we get to that age, we may all be living to 110.”

At the time the oldest man in America, Mr. Matthews sometimes strained to hear, but his sense of humor and perspective were intact. If that was what we wanted, he advised, “Keep breathing.”

Mr. Matthews died this summer. His DNA was sequenced a few weeks later, and last month Mr. Clement uploaded it to the database. Like all normal human genome sequences, the beginning of his first chromosome reads like this:

Mr. Trump blames Mr. Sessions for the cloud of the Russia investigation that has hovered over his 10-month presidency, saying that if Mr. Sessions had never recused himself from the inquiry this year, the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, would never have been appointed.

On Tuesday, Mr. Sessions is scheduled to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, where he is expected to be questioned sharply by both Republicans and Democrats. The letter was a reply to formal requests from congressional Republicans for a Justice Department inquiry into various Clinton-related issues.

Although Mr. Sessions has recused himself from all matters related to the election, he and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, will oversee the prosecutors’ decision to appoint the special counsel, the letter said.

“These senior prosecutors will report directly to the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, as appropriate, and will make recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources, or whether any matters merit a special counsel,” Stephen E. Boyd, an assistant attorney general, said in the letter to the House Judiciary Committee.

Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, criticized the Justice Department’s letter.

Republicans have long tried to link Mrs. Clinton to the uranium deal, which was revealed in the run-up to her 2016 presidential campaign. The deal was approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States when she was secretary of state under President Barack Obama and had a voting seat on the panel.

Conservative news outlets have kept the story line alive and pushed the allegations as part of a continuing narrative that the Clintons are corrupt. They claim Mrs. Clinton was part of a quid pro quo in which the Clinton Foundation received large donations in exchange for support of the deal.

As the special counsel’s investigation into Mr. Trump and his associates has intensified in recent weeks, Mr. Trump has asked allies and advisers why Mr. Mueller is not investigating the Uranium One case, according to a person familiar with the president’s discussions on the matter.

The allies and advisers have told Mr. Trump that Mr. Mueller’s purview is only to look into Russian interference in the 2016 election, the person said. In response, Mr. Trump has protested that Uranium One also relates to Russia.

However, White House officials in recent days have played down questions about whether the president or his immediate advisers were seeking a new special counsel.

It was before leaving for a 12-day trip to Asia this month that Mr. Trump publicly vented about how the Justice Department had operated under Mr. Sessions.

“I’m really not involved with the Justice Department,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “I’d like to let it run itself.”

“But, honestly, they should be looking at the Democrats,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “And a lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me.”

Mr. Trump has been repeatedly criticized for trying to intervene in the Justice Department’s investigations since he took office.

In May, it was revealed that Mr. Trump had asked James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to end the investigation into Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser — a disclosure that led to the appointment of Mr. Mueller. Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized Mr. Mueller’s investigation — which has intensified in recent weeks as three Trump campaign members were charged — as a witch hunt.

During his Senate confirmation hearing this year, Mr. Sessions said he would not name a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs. Clinton even if ordered to do so by the president.

“This country does not punish its political enemies,” he told the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Mr. Trump, who closely monitors the conservative news media ecosystem for ideas on how to attack his opponents, has cited reports from those outlets to aides and friends as examples for why a special counsel should be appointed.

One commentator in particular, the Fox News host Jeanine Pirro — who is a friend of Mr. Trump’s and whose show he rarely misses — has aggressively denounced Mr. Sessions as weak for not investigating the uranium deal. In addition to making scathing critiques on her show, Ms. Pirro — who had interviewed to be the deputy attorney general, according to three transition officials — recently met with the president to excoriate the attorney general.

In an Oval Office meeting on Nov. 1, Ms. Pirro said that a special counsel needed to be appointed, according to two people briefed on the discussion. Through a Fox News spokeswoman, Ms. Pirro said, “Everything I said to President Trump is exactly what I’ve vocalized on my show, ‘Justice with Jeanine.’”

After his victory last November, Mr. Trump struck a far different tone on prosecuting Mrs. Clinton.

“Look, I want to move forward, I don’t want to move back,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times. “And I don’t want to hurt the Clintons. I really don’t.”

“She went through a lot. And suffered greatly in many different ways. And I am not looking to hurt them at all,” he said. “The campaign was vicious. They say it was the most vicious primary and the most vicious campaign. I guess, added together, it was definitely the most vicious; probably, I assume you sold a lot of newspapers.”",Justice Dept. to Weigh Inquiry Into Clinton Foundation,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/us/politics/justice-department-uranium-one-special-counsel.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

For their part, Alabama Republicans are warning of the perils of barring Mr. Moore from the Senate.
Mr. Moore, because of his statewide fame, has never had to raise much money.
Mr. Moore tried one approach Monday afternoon: trying to tap into the grass-roots loathing on the right toward Mr. McConnell.
“Mitch McConnell’s plot to destroy me,” Mr. Moore wrote in the subject line of a fund-raising email.","The day’s events seemed to harden the resolve of Senate Republicans to avert what they fear would be a nightmare situation going into the midterm elections next year: being associated with a man accused of preying on children.

“It’s drip by drip, cut by cut,” said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Alabama’s senior lawmaker. “It doesn’t look good.”

Mr. Moore responded with fury, not only refusing to quit the race but stating that the person who needed to step aside was Mr. McConnell.

“He has failed conservatives and must be replaced,” said Mr. Moore in a statement, appending President Trump’s trademark: “#draintheswamp.”



Publicly, Mr. McConnell, appearing at a news conference in Louisville, said he was “looking at” drafting a write-in candidate for the Dec. 12 special election. Privately, Mr. McConnell was doing more than merely looking. One idea being discussed, first brought up by two different White House officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, would be for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to run as either a write-in candidate or to be appointed to what was his seat should Mr. Moore win and be immediately removed from office.

Mr. McConnell is supportive of the idea and discussed it on Monday in a telephone call with Vice President Mike Pence that was chiefly about the Republican tax overhaul proposal, according to party officials briefed on the call. Mr. Sessions remains popular among Alabama Republicans, but his relationship with Mr. Trump has frayed since he recused himself from the investigation of the role that Russia played in last year’s presidential campaign.

The swap would be something of a win-win for Mr. McConnell and Mr. Trump — the senator is eager to rid himself of Mr. Moore and the president has been open about his disappointment with Mr. Sessions.

That they even discussed such a radical maneuver spoke to the desperate straits that Republicans find themselves in. If Doug Jones, the Democratic nominee, wins, it would narrow the Republican advantage in the Senate to a single seat.

But Republicans increasingly believe that enduring such a narrow majority may be a price they are willing to pay if it means keeping Mr. Moore from their ranks.

Should Mr. Moore prevail, Republicans believe the debate over whether he should be allowed to take and keep his seat could drag on for months. The Republicans’ legislative agenda, including on taxes, already faces uncertain prospects and could be swallowed in a maelstrom of controversy around Mr. Moore and his fitness to serve.

The implications for the 2018 elections could be even graver, Republicans fear, with several party strategists predicting that Democrats would brand them as the party of child sex abuse.

For their part, Alabama Republicans are warning of the perils of barring Mr. Moore from the Senate. A write-in campaign, they suggested, would prove fruitless and perhaps help the Democrats, while a move to block or expel Mr. Moore would further poison the relationship between the Republican Party’s leaders and its populist wing.

“If the people of this state go forward and select their U.S. senator as Roy Moore, it will be because there is a deep suspicion of what has been coined as the establishment in D.C.,” said State Senator Phil Williams, whose district includes Mr. Moore’s home county. “And if the establishment then chooses and tries to unseat, or in some way disavow, that candidate, it will create a backlash the likes of which the party has never seen before.”

Democrats, who have been restrained about their prospects in such a conservative state, tried to avoid inserting themselves into the Republican crossfire. But, they said, as more information comes out, Mr. Moore’s case that he is being smeared in a single newspaper article will crumble. By Monday night, an article in The New Yorker asserted that Mr. Moore had been barred from the mall in his hometown, Gadsden, for bothering young women, a memory that many in the town said they shared, though no one has found direct evidence.

“The more people that come out of the woodwork, the more women with similar stories, the more credible it becomes,” said Zac McCrary, a Democratic pollster based in Alabama. “It’s going to become easier to see through Roy Moore’s nondenial denials.”

Mr. Jones is also quietly benefiting from the support of national liberals. He is to be in Washington on Tuesday for a $500 per person cocktail reception partly sponsored by a raft of well-known Democrats, including Senator Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, according to an invitation circulating among Democratic lobbyists.

Mr. Jones has been raising substantial money out-of-state — Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut helped him bring in $125,000 with a single email and handful of Twitter messages — and has had Alabama’s airwaves nearly to himself in recent weeks: He has aired nearly $2 million worth of commercials since Mr. Moore won the nomination in September while Mr. Moore has spent only about $300,000 on ads, according to strategists tracking the race.

Mr. Moore, because of his statewide fame, has never had to raise much money. But now that he is fighting for his political life, he urgently needs to recast the race to focus on some of Mr. Jones’s liberal views on guns and abortion.

But he may not have the money to mount any such assault and, with his party leaders shunning him, it is not clear who will fill the gap. Mr. Moore tried one approach Monday afternoon: trying to tap into the grass-roots loathing on the right toward Mr. McConnell.

“Mitch McConnell’s plot to destroy me,” Mr. Moore wrote in the subject line of a fund-raising email.

“Apparently Mitch McConnell and the establishment G.O.P. would rather elect a radical pro-abortion Democrat than a conservative Christian,” he added.",Roy Moore Is Accused of Sexual Misconduct by a Fifth Woman,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/us/politics/roy-moore-alabama-senate.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Now, high blood pressure will be defined as 130/80 millimeters of mercury or greater for anyone with a significant risk of heart attack or stroke. The previous guidelines defined high blood pressure as 140/90. (The first number describes the pressure on blood vessels when the heart contracts, and the second refers to the pressure as the heart relaxes between beats.)

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death among Americans. The new criteria, the first official diagnostic revision since 2003, result from growing evidence that blood pressure far lower than had been considered normal greatly reduces the chances of heart attack and stroke, as well as the overall risk of death.

Recent research indicates this is true even among older people for whom intensive treatment had been thought too risky. That finding, from a large federal study in 2015, caught many experts by surprise and set the stage for the new revision.

That calculation must be individualized, and experts are recommending that patients use a calculator developed by the guidelines committee at ccccalculator.ccctracker.com.

Nearly half of all American adults, and nearly 80 percent of those aged 65 and older, will find that they qualify and will need to take steps to reduce their blood pressure.



Even under the relatively more lenient standard that had prevailed for years, close to half of patients did not manage to get their blood pressure down to normal.

“Is it going to affect a lot of people, and is it going to be hard to meet those blood pressure goals?” asked Dr. Raymond Townsend, director of the hypertension program at Penn Medicine. “The answer is a pretty significant yes.”

According to the new guidelines, anyone with at least a 10 percent risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next decade should aim for blood pressure below 130/80.

But simply being age 65 or older brings a 10 percent risk of cardiovascular trouble, and so effectively everyone over that age will have to shoot for the new target.

Younger patients with this level of risk include those with conditions like heart disease, kidney disease or diabetes. The new standard will apply to them, as well.

People whose risk of heart attack or stroke is less than 10 percent will be told to aim for blood pressure below 140/90, a more lenient standard, and to take medications if necessary to do so.

If there is any good news for patients here, it is that nearly all the drugs used to treat high blood pressure are generic now. Many cost pennies a day, and most people can take them without side effects.

In formulating the guidelines, the expert committee reviewed more than 1,000 research reports. But the change is due largely to convincing data from a federal study published in 2015.

That study, called Sprint, explored whether markedly lower blood pressure in older people — lower than researchers had ever tried to establish — might be both achievable and beneficial.

The investigators assigned more than 9,300 men and women ages 50 and older who were at high risk of heart disease to one of two targets: a systolic pressure (the higher of the two blood pressure measures) of less than 120, or a systolic pressure of less than 140.

In participants who were assigned to get their systolic pressures below 120, the incidence of heart attacks, heart failure and strokes fell by a third, and the risk of death fell by nearly a quarter.

Those patients ended up taking three drugs on average, instead of two, yet experienced no more side effects or complications than subjects in the other group.

Some experts in geriatrics had expected many more complications among older patients receiving more intense treatment, especially increased dizziness, falls and dehydration.

Instead, the benefits for older people were impressive. With a lower risk of heart attacks and strokes, they were more likely to maintain their independence.

“They had half the rate of disability,” said Dr. Jeff Williamson, head of the Sticht Center on Aging at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center and the only geriatrician on the committee drawing up the new guidelines.

But more intensive drug treatment in so many more patients may increase rates of kidney disease, some experts fear. In the Sprint trial, the incidence of acute kidney injury was twice as high in the group receiving drugs to reduce their systolic pressure to 120.

“Although the lower goal was better for the heart, it wasn’t better for the kidney,” said Dr. Townsend of Penn Medicine, who is a kidney specialist. “So yeah, I’m worried.”

While agreeing that lower blood pressure is better, Dr. J. Michael Gaziano, a preventive cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the VA Boston, worries about having doctors and patients fixating on a particular goal.

It’s true, he said, that doctors ought to be more aggressive in treating people at high risk. But, he added, “If a patient comes in with a blood pressure of 180, I will not get him to 130.”

Lifestyle changes like diet and exercise can help many patients lower blood pressure. But many of the newly diagnosed are likely to wind up on drugs, said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale University.

“This is a big change that will end up labeling many more people with hypertension and recommending drug treatment for many more people,” he said.

The current treatment strategy has not been so successful for many patients, he noted.

“How they tolerate drugs, whether they want to pursue lower levels, are all choices and should not be dictated to them,” said Dr. Krumholz. “Or we will have the same situation as today — many prescriptions that go unfilled and pills untaken.”","Under New Guidelines, Millions More Americans Will Need to Lower Blood Pressure",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/health/blood-pressure-treatment-guidelines.html

And Finally ...

The Great Los Angeles Walk lets people see the city from a different vantage point. Sometimes that means the mundane, like an unexplored shop, and sometimes the memorable: the Lakers icon Magic Johnson, the aftermath of a crane collapse, and lots and lots of weddings.

The horde of walkers itself, however, may be the most jarring sight in a sprawling city known for its traffic.

“Every year we manage to surprise people,” said Michael Schneider, the walk’s founder and organizer, “because they don’t expect to see an army of Angelenos walking down the street. It shocks some people, but it inspires others.”

About 40 people participated in the first walk, along Wilshire Boulevard in 2006. Melrose Avenue and a bevy of boulevards — Pico, Sunset, West Adams, Hollywood, Ventura and Olympic — have been explored since.

This year’s 17-mile walk will travel along Beverly, one of the city’s oldest boulevards, for the first time. An expected crowd of several hundred people will begin at the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo at 9 a.m. on Saturday, with plans to reach Santa Monica State Beach by sunset. Along the way, walkers will amble past City Hall, Walt Disney Concert Hall and CBS Television City.

You truly don’t need a car to explore Los Angeles, and Mr. Schneider recommends older neighborhoods that are walkable, including Los Feliz, Larchmont, Atwater Village and Highland Park.

The annual walk across the city is one way to encourage people to turn off the ignition, to gaze at street art. There is no finish line.

“Some people treat it almost as a marathon, and that’s not the point of this walk,” Mr. Schneider said. “This is all about taking your time and exploring.”

Donald doesn’t back Ivana up then or afterward, but rather is displeased that she didn’t knuckle under: “Why didn’t you just have a friggin’ steak?” “Raising Trump” also provides a window into Donald’s pettiness when he pulls on Ivanka’s ski pole during a family race down the slope in order to win — cheating to beat his own young daughter!

Meet Marla Maples, the mistress Ivana refers to as “the showgirl.” Ivana divulges nothing of what was said in the heat of the ensuing battle with her husband back at the chalet, one of the many frustrating cloth-drops over the parrot cage in this book. The marital rupture inflicted a string of indignities on Ivana as the New York tabloids engaged in dueling headlines, the most infamous being Maples’s “Best Sex I Ever Had” boast on the front page of The Post. With her faint air of Zsa Zsa Gabor and madcap aplomb, Ivana aerated Trump’s persona during their marriage — gave his brash, crass excess a dash of dynasty dazzle and camp. Once their partnership was sundered, Ivana took her blithe esprit and comic malaprops to enjoy the high life elsewhere (“In 2006, my yacht was parked at Cannes for the film festival, and I was having a party with two hundred people on it”), a pity since she might have been a more inspiriting first lady than the inscrutable, animatronic Melania. As someone who grew up in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia and witnessed Russian tanks crushing the Prague Spring, Ivana would have been more sensitive and perhaps even resistant to Russian interference than our current White House has been. Hurt and humiliated as she was by Donald’s infidelity, however, Ivana remains a loyalist, proclaiming, “I believe he’ll be a great president,” perhaps the first in a family dynasty. Of Ivanka, she suggests, “Who knows? One day, she might be the first female — and Jewish — POTUS.” I’vana throw up.

The subtitle to Jerry Oppenheimer’s “The Kardashians: An American Drama” evokes the panoramic scope and muted trumpets of a Ken Burns epic, but crack open the book and the whiff of cheese is unmistakable. It’s almost comforting knowing that we are in the able, busy hands of a veteran journeyman with few pretensions to subtlety, scene-painting and the stately march of history. The author of biographies of the Clintons, Rock Hudson, Anna Wintour, Martha Stewart, Barbara Walters and other two-legged notables, Oppenheimer doesn’t doodle around — he hacks away. The prologue kicks off with a classic bit of ooga-booga involving a Christian prophetess who told the then-obscure lawyer Robert Kardashian that, in his words, “one day my name, the Kardashian name, would be known around the world.” And, lo, the curse came to pass. On June 17, 1994, the day that the white Ford Bronco chase covered live from coast to coast entered American lore, Robert Kardashian — friend, legal defender and personal exculpator of the former football great and “Naked Gun” co-star O.J. Simpson — read aloud his client’s rambling letter of professed innocence concerning the slashing homicides of his wife, Nicole, and her friend Ronald Goldman to a locust swarm of international press. He was identified on TV screens as “Robert Kardashian, Simpson Friend,” and from that moment the “Kardashian” name has become pop culture’s most persistent rash. Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, Rob and their half sisters, Kendall and Kylie … all those freaking Kardashians, but the K who counts the most is, of course, Robert’s then-wife, Kris: Kristen Houghton Kardashian and the future Kris Jenner — schemer, dreamer, mother, impresario and “cougar extraordinaire.” It was she who would convert Kardashian from an instant household name into a self-perpetuating media brand and meme.

It can’t be said that Oppenheimer is in Kris’s corner as she bops her way to the top. Even as a high schooler she’s tagged as a “shallow opportunist,” and the chapter where the teenage Kris meets her first lover, a 28-year-old professional golfer, is titled “Hole in One.” Her marriage to Robert in 1978 would have been a parodic misalliance under balmier circumstances. For most readers, Ira Levin’s 1972 best-selling novel “The Stepford Wives” was a satire and cautionary tale; for the future Mrs. Kardashian, the 1975 thriller movie it inspired was a training manual. While dating Kris, Robert insisted that she listen to instructional audiocassettes to stock the bare pantry of her mind with knowledge, mistakenly assuming she would be an obedient helpmate. Unfortunately for this, Kris’s favorite mini-series was “The Thorn Birds,” that passion-tossed ’80s show about forbidden love in the kangaroo outback.

Despite these premarital misgivings, they wed and dutifully reproduced, but this Beverly Hills housewife was never going to relegate herself to hostess duty. Living large and spending big, Kris outfitted herself with fake boobs after seeing Nicole Simpson’s new pair (“I thought, I want two of those, please!”), and cheated on her husband with a young soccer player (“You can be a good mother and still be a tramp,” as one interested bystander puts it, words to live by). Divorce follows, and Robert Kardashian’s life becomes one sad, long, dribbling anticlimax. Basking in the celebrity glory of membership in O. J.’s dream team, after the shocking acquittal he found himself shunned, mocked and blackballed, and a couple of marriages later he died at age 59 from esophageal cancer. Meanwhile, Kris flourishes still, her subsequent union with the former Olympian Bruce Jenner (later Caitlyn) supplying a second-stage booster rocket to the Kardashian brand.

Kim’s infamous sex tape with her then-boyfriend Ray J provided the initial liftoff. Modestly titled “Kim Kardashian, Superstar,” it surfaced in 2007, the same year that the reality series “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” debuted on E!, executive-produced by the inescapable Ryan Seacrest and with Kris presiding as the “momager” of this ever-expanding family enterprise. One sympathizes with Oppenheimer as he tries to keep track of all these loose marbles, but his chronicle of the Kardashian Kids carries unpleasant racial overtones to which he appears tone-deaf. He mentions Khloe’s marriage to “the 6-foot-10 black pro basketball player Lamar Odom,” cites Kim’s divorce from Damon Thomas, “the first of her three African-American husbands,” and later circles back to Khloe, who “apparently had a real thing about romancing giant-size African-American hoop stars” (my agog italics). Composing himself, Oppenheimer covers the controversy over the Kardashians’ appropriation of black culture and iconography, as epitomized by Kim’s bare-backsided cover shot for Paper magazine (the one that “broke the internet”), but by then it’s too late in the book to be affecting a furrowed brow and going all Charlie Rose on us.

In the epilogue, Oppenheimer notes that all is not ducky in Kardashiana. The ratings for “Keeping Up” (now in its 14th season) are eroding and Kardashian mugs on the covers of slick magazines have become newsstand underperformers. During Fashion Week in 2016 Kim was robbed of $11 million-worth of jewelry by masked gunmen who broke into her Paris hotel suite and left her gagged — a crime that aroused suspicion that it was all a publicity stunt (it wasn’t, according to follow-up reports) and a hardy chorus of schadenfreude across social media. Oppenheimer floats the scenario that the wily Kris has one last shazam! act to pull: a daredevil leap for the biggest prize of all, the presidency. Citing Trump’s 2016 victory, he draws the obvious, dreary parallels between their reality-TV roots and social media reach, and explains that Kris and her family “have a big following among young African-American men, a bloc that eluded Trump, and have huge support among millennial women 18 to 34, and support in the transgender community — especially if Caitlyn, a staunch Republican, plays ball and stumps for her ex-wife if she, indeed, runs for elective office as she’s suggested.”

Please, stop. First Ivanka’s name is floated, now Kris’s, as if the most powerful office in the shrinking free world is a glorious bauble awarded after long devotion to celebrity, self-enrichment and the family brand, public service be damned. Why keep feeding their ravenous egos? Shouldn’t their brazen success be enough for them? It’d be nice if the first woman president were someone who’d actually done some good.","In ‘Raising Trump’ and ‘The Kardashians,’ Two Portraits of Modern American Matriarchy",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/books/review/the-kardashians-jerry-oppenheimer-raising-trump-ivana-trump.html

But things have definitely changed.” Then, after a pause, he seemed to have a change of heart: “ESPN thought they were going to get Barstool without Barstool.
In his office, I asked Portnoy why he thought ESPN had been interested in partnering with Barstool in the first place, given its past.","So on a balmy day in October, Portnoy — who looks like Mark Zuckerberg after five years of hard drinking and even harder tanning — called an “emergency press conference” in his offices to address the cancellation of “Van Talk.” Portnoy’s addresses to readers tend to ramble and veer off on tangents, but they do so triumphantly. This one was no different: He sidled up to a makeshift lectern made out of a water jug, stared straight into a camera and delivered an unapologetic seven-minute rant. “We’re not going to let Mickey Mouse push us around,” he said, referring to Disney, which owns ESPN. “There is actually nothing that ESPN could have done to illustrate” — he meant better illustrate — “why we are rising and they are falling.”

El Presidente, who grew up in Swampscott, Mass., an upper-middle-class suburb, isn’t the most obvious choice for a champion of the common man, but he does describe his own life as thoroughly, unceasingly average. He says he did O.K. in school and was an O.K. baseball player. He considers himself an average-looking guy. He attended the University of Michigan, where, he says, he had average fun with his average friends. His rise to prominence came not from his skills as a sports analyst but from his ability to sniff out untapped markets. After graduating from Michigan in 1999, he worked in the sales department of a consulting firm in Boston but quickly tired of corporate life. He wanted to start his own business, preferably in the gambling scene. In 2003, on a trip to Las Vegas, he met with people in the online-gaming industry and found them desperate for places to advertise. Portnoy’s idea was to start a sports publication that might be attractive to poker advertisers — and because the only ad model that seemed viable at the time was in print, he planned to pass it out as a tabloid at T stops throughout Boston.

Early in the decade, the only sports blogs with any significant audience were Sports by Brooks — which mostly aggregated news — and the writer Bill Simmons’s column on AOL’s Digital City Boston. (I later worked for Simmons for three years at Grantland, the ESPN website where he was editor in chief.) Portnoy revered Simmons and agreed with his assessment that Boston’s sports coverage, which was still centered in the column inches of The Globe and The Herald, had grown stale and out of touch with the common man. Not so for Portnoy: In an early mock-up, calling himself Devilfish Dave, he wrote that “the people at Barstool Sports are a bunch of average Joes, who like most guys love sports, gambling, golfing and chasing short skirts.”

Barstool went through the usual spate of early hardships, and there’s every chance that had it been born out of some actual journalistic ideal, it would have folded within the year. But Portnoy’s talent was for gathering feedback from readers and advertisers and tweaking his product accordingly: “We could pivot really easily,” he told me, “and chase money.” The first breakthrough came when a local photographer told Portnoy he should start putting photos of area women on the tabloid’s covers — and offered to take the pictures himself. (A version of this idea still exists on the website, under the title “Local Smokeshow of the Day.”) Around the same time, Portnoy noticed that readers seemed to respond more to stories about drinking, women and gambling than day-to-day sports news. He sold ads to bars and breweries and catered more and more to a certain archetypal Boston bro — the type who puts on a collared shirt to get blackout drunk every weekend while ruefully cheering on the Red Sox. His writing voice fell into a distinct rhythm, half-cocked and prone to fits of anger. When he finally mustered up a web version of Barstool, it looked like a relic from the 1990s and often crashed, but he called such inconveniences “the Barstool difference” — a sign, he maintained, of true authenticity.

By the time Barstool began publishing, Simmons had started a national column for ESPN and moved to Los Angeles to write for television. Portnoy had Boston to himself. “When Bill was writing on Digital Cities, he was reaching regular guys like me,” Portnoy told me. “I’m reaching the new me.”

Whether he knew it or not, Portnoy was also building a modern online-media business well before its time — with low overhead, an investment in brand loyalty and diversified revenue streams that could withstand fluctuations in advertising. He started hawking T-shirts and merchandise on the site, another venture that fell prey to the Barstool difference; printing and shipping could take months. He built up a network of bloggers in other cities, like Dan Katz in Chicago and Kevin Clancy in New York — Big Cat and KFC, per their Barstool nicknames. When Portnoy realized that readers were more invested in these bloggers as personalities than in their opinions on sports, he began turning the site into a sort of online reality show: Every office argument and personal-life development was written up and fed to a growing legion of “Stoolies.”

Part of what Barstool offered these readers was escapism, something that retains a lot of power among sports fans who still see games as a nightly release from their responsibilities. The site’s enduring slogan, “Saturdays Are for the Boys,” promises a day free from girlfriends and wives. Search for the phrase on social media, and you’ll find videos of Stoolies relaxing at beach houses, on boats or at tailgates, surrounded by nothing but shirtless men; in some, they actually push women out of the camera’s frame. Sports could also be a reprieve from office work. In his initial mock-up, in 2003, Portnoy wrote that “we don’t take ourselves very seriously and view working at Barstool Sports as a way to avoid becoming slaves to cubicle life.” When Clancy, who calls himself “the king of average,” started writing Barstool New York, he was working as an accountant at Deloitte; when he saw that his tales of mind-numbing corporate boredom were getting traction with readers, he began writing a column called “Cubicle Chronicles,” grumbling rancorously about everything from bad coffee to the “fat secretary blasting Dominic the [expletive] Donkey” around Christmas.

The only thing the Stoolies wouldn’t do, it turned out, was “politics.” For the most part, Portnoy and his readers employed the time-honored bro tactic of saying they had no problem with anyone — until, of course, “anyone” started complaining. A particularly illustrative example of this can be found in an article from 2009, in which a reader informed Portnoy about the “Fagbug,” an art installation aimed at raising awareness about homophobic violence. “I could give a [expletive] less if somebody is gay or not,” Portnoy responded, insisting that, much as he enjoyed the female anatomy, if another man preferred the male one, then “more power to him.” But what, he asked, was the point of the installation? “I thought gay dudes hated being called fags? Or is this like when a black person uses the N-word as a compliment?” He closed by saying all this “fag talk” reminded him of last night’s television: Did anyone else see Adam Lambert on “American Idol”? Every line was aimed directly at dudes who, like Portnoy, would not identify as bigots, but who also scratched their heads at the weird tendencies of anyone who wasn’t exactly like them, self-proclaimed common men.

By 2010, Barstool was doing well enough that Portnoy had an office in Milton, Mass., local pages for New York, Chicago and Philadelphia and a handful of employees, including the future YouTube megastar Jenna Mourey, a.k.a. Jenna Marbles. That year, he hired a local white rapper named Sammy Adams and set up a tour of New England colleges. “When we showed up on the campuses, they had our signs on their dorms, people were rushing after our bus,” he told me. “That was the first time I really thought this might be bigger than I anticipated.”

The following year, he started a nationwide party tour called “Barstool Blackout.” The college students who attended danced under blacklights and occasionally — the obvious implication — drank until they blacked out. (One of the slogans: “By the C- student, for the C- student.”) It was Barstool’s first real encounter with controversy. Early in 2012, students in the Boston area demonstrated against the Blackout Parties, claiming that they promoted rape culture and circulating Portnoy’s writings on the subject. “Just to make friends with the feminists,” he’d written on the site, “I’d like to reiterate that we don’t condone rape of any kind at our Blackout Parties in mid-January. However, if a chick passes out, that’s a gray area though.” And: “Though I never condone rape, if you’re a Size 6 and you’re wearing skinny jeans, you kind of deserve to be raped, right?” The parties, which were held at private spaces near campuses, went ahead as planned. Portnoy issued no retractions or apologies. “I think the controversy probably helped us,” he says now. “Our fans liked that we didn’t back down. They realized that I was on their side.”

In January 2016, Portnoy stood in Times Square, dressed in a tuxedo and flanked by Clancy, Katz and a Barstool editor, Keith Markovich. After a few bars of Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York,” he made what he called a “shocking” announcement: “I am no longer the majority owner of Barstool Sports. We have taken investment from an investment company called Chernin Digital.” He went on to describe Peter Chernin — head of the Chernin Group, the former president of News Corporation and the Fox film executive who greenlit “Titanic” and “Avatar” — as a “big swinging [expletive] at the cracker factory,” and alluded to Barstool’s business and technological shortcomings, all of which would presumably be fixed soon. “When you’re a young comedian in the ’80s,” he said, “and you graduate, right, you had to send your résumé to ‘S.N.L.’ Five years, all these little kids, all these beautiful people — there’s only going to be one place to send their résumé: Barstool Sports.”

In a blog post about the sale — which concluded with the coy signoff “PS — I’m kinda rich now” — Portnoy added something prescient: “Chernin knows about the Size 6 skinny-jean joke. They know about Babygate.” (The “Babygate” controversy stemmed from Portnoy’s speculating about the size of Tom Brady’s baby’s penis.) “They know about Al Jazeera.” (In this one, Clancy questioned the legitimacy of any news outlet with an Arabic-sounding name.) “They get it.”

The Barstool acquisition was engineered by the president of Chernin Digital, Mike Kerns. “When I got access to Barstool’s Google analytics, I knew this was something different,” he told me. “They had something like 20 percent of their visitors coming back about 20 times a day. I’ve been in this business for two decades, and all their numbers bucked the usual trends.” Portnoy kept full editorial control; Chernin’s bet was that it could serve cheap content to his loyal fan base, which would then pay for things like T-shirts, events and premium content. The brand would be scaled up into something that could be sold to advertisers, big media partners and even sports leagues. Every Barstool executive I spoke to mentioned the possibility of opening branded sports bars across the country; all of them talked about partnerships with networks. Since its acquisition, Barstool has released a raft of popular podcasts — including “Pardon My Take,” which, with downloads running up to one million per episode, is one of the biggest sports podcasts in the country. It has partnered with Facebook on a roving pregame college-football show (since canceled) and produced a widely watched baseball show that regularly features former major-league players.

This bullish transition has been helmed by Erika Nardini, a 42-year-old former marketing executive who once served as the chief marketing officer for AOL. Nardini, who grew up playing sports with her younger brother, seems uniquely qualified to deal with both the business of turning Barstool into a national brand and the inevitable public- and human-relations disasters that will arise along the way. She is also a woman, and despite its growth since the Chernin acquisition, Barstool still has to work around how bad its worst moments can get — from Portnoy’s rape jokes to posts like the one a blogger named Chris Spagnuolo wrote this summer: “Is Rihanna Going to Make Being Fat the Hot New Trend?”

The Rihanna incident highlighted how much has changed since the Chernin acquisition, but also how much has stayed more or less the same. The post was quietly taken down, and Spagnuolo was fired. But Portnoy also opined on the site that he thought the post wasn’t “as bad as many are making it out to be,” and that he was angry mostly because Spagnuolo had given “feminists” fodder to say “there goes Barstool being Barstool again.” And yet Portnoy himself cannot seem to stop personally offering up more and more of that fodder. A controversy last month, involving the terms of a contract offered to a sports personality named Elika Sadeghi, began on relatively professional footing. Within days, though, Barstool had released a seven-minute animated video in which a cartoon Portnoy says Sadeghi’s surname sounds like “the monkey from ‘The Lion King.’ ” It also portrays her hanging upside down over a boiling caldron.

I spoke to several women in sports media who have had run-ins with Barstool. All described the same pattern: They would tweet something critical of Barstool’s statements about women, which would prompt a response from Portnoy or one of his bloggers. Then came the swarm of Stoolies on social media, who would harass them with misogynist slurs and threats, often for days. Even random sports fans have been targeted. A few years ago, a Cubs fan named Missy suffered a brain injury after a fall; during her recovery, she found that she had trouble reading anything longer than a paragraph, so she moved her usual sports-media consumption over to Twitter. When she saw an article detailing the way Clancy and an army of Stoolies had responded to the Al Jazeera incident, Missy tweeted her support for the author of the article and women she felt had been abused online. Stoolies responded almost immediately, with three days of the usual misogynist epithets and vague threats. A year later, she says, after another comment critical of Barstool, a reader found photos she had posted memorializing a cousin who died of cancer — and reposted them on Twitter, tagging Barstool writers to do God knows what with them.

There’s a uniform response from Barstool employees about the worst of the Stoolies. “I hate seeing it,” Katz told me. “But it’s just a few idiots who have nothing better to do, and it sucks that people use them to smear an entire company.” The average Stoolie, Portnoy, Clancy and Markovich all argue, is not a misogynist abuser but has been painted with a broad brush by other media outlets. “I’m used to it by now,” Nardini said of the constant negative press surrounding Barstool’s attitudes toward women. “Every time anyone mentions us in the media, they’re always going to write that requisite paragraph.” She used to be part of a network of female executives, she told me, but “after they heard I was coming here, every single one of them dropped me like a bad habit.”

The wrath of the Stoolies can occasionally extend to Barstool’s own employees. “There wasn’t a single day that would go by without me seeing the N-word in the comments,” Maurice Peebles, Barstool’s first black employee, told me. Peebles ran Barstool’s Philadelphia page for three years. His administrator access allowed him to see that the racial slurs were coming mostly from a concentrated number of IP addresses, which meant that only a few readers were posting the slurs, and over time the site’s filters became better at blocking them. But he doesn’t absolve Barstool of all responsibility. “They could’ve done more about it,” he says. “None of the guys who worked at Barstool ever said anything racist to me, but I don’t know if they all understand what it’s like to see that word every day.”

Barstool’s reputation “was certainly listed as a risk,” Kerns says. “But I think time is on our side. The younger folks within agencies and brands get Barstool and recognize the world is increasingly taking itself less seriously.” Over the past year, that time seemed to have already arrived. Dunkin’ Donuts, the advertiser most associated with Boston sports, had long been wary of dealing with Portnoy, but this year, Barstool dedicated an entire month to promoting the chain’s new energy drink. Wendy’s had also expressed hesitation to partner with Barstool, but this summer the company sponsored “Barstool 5th Year,” a Snapchat channel specifically targeted at college students.

The question of whether Barstool should be held responsible for the worst behaviors of its fans reflects a fundamental question facing online media — the same one at the core of Facebook’s issues with fake news, Twitter’s with neo-Nazis and Reddit’s with various toxic communities. Unlike those companies, Barstool can’t hide behind the notion of being an open, neutral platform for the free speech of others. Its readers may come from all sorts of backgrounds, but the core Stoolies are an organic online community that grew under the caring, thoughtful hand of their very own El Presidente. Every new-media venture seeks out an “organic online community” like this — one that can, in Nardini’s words, “convert content into commerce.” That community could mean, say, subscribers of The Daily Skimm, an email for millennial women that recaps the news in a peppy, corporate voice. But it can also mean tribes of angry, disaffected young men who gather online to find shelter from the floodwaters of political correctness. This leaves companies like ESPN with a discomforting dilemma. Should they try to create their own communities — an almost impossible enterprise, especially with young audiences who have grown up on completely independent, unfiltered personalities on YouTube and social media? Or should they co-opt, sanitize and scale audiences like the Stoolies?

There are two distinct visions of how Barstool could work at the scale Nardini and Chernin envision. The first would involve running back into the understanding embrace of the Stoolies and building an uncouth, unapologetic brand aimed exclusively at boorish young men. Last August, Barstool purchased Old Row, a site that posts frat-boy fight videos and photos of college girls in bikinis and sells T-shirts celebrating the Trump presidency. This month, Barstool announced that it had bought Rough N Rowdy Brawl, an amateur boxing company from West Virginia that features untrained locals knocking one another out. In an “emergency press conference” announcing the acquisition, Portnoy thanked Ponder, saying the ESPN controversy had led to “the biggest couple weeks we’ve ever had.” “It does not matter if you like us, hate us, whatever,” he said. “We speak directly to our own consumers.”

The other road is to take the popular material that has been built since the Chernin acquisition and take another crack at entering media’s mainstream. I have friends and relatives — the majority of whom would be considered progressive, many of whom are not white — who read Barstool regularly, like its videos on Instagram and listen to “Pardon My Take.” Some are vaguely aware that Portnoy has said disturbing things about women, but they shrug it off in the same way they shrug off the cloud of bad news that continually engulfs the N.F.L. The vast majority of the Barstool content they consume ticks between standard-fare aggregation (funny videos, memes, weird stories from Florida) and genuinely enjoyable content aimed directly at men who, like me, grew up watching sports and went to colleges where we watched sports with our sports-watching friends.

During the N.H.L. finals in June, I went to the Barstool offices to watch a recording of “Pardon My Take.” Katz, who is not as fat as he claims to be on air, sat in a La-Z-Boy, idly watching hockey and scribbling notes. His co-host, who goes by the pseudonym PFT Commenter, tried out jokes about handshake lines and the superiority of the N.H.L. to the N.B.A. When the game ended, they settled on a list of segments and piled into a small recording studio, completely bare except for poorly stapled acoustic tiles and posters of Chris Berman and Lenny Dykstra.

They rattled through the show without second takes or pauses, the jokes and banter falling into a familiar, rapid rhythm. Katz is the straight man; he is mostly playing himself, an affable dude who loves his Chicago sports and could easily slide into the chair of any ESPN opinion show. PFT Commenter, who has shoulder-length hair and wears Hawaiian shirts, has created a type of character that has never really been seen in sports media — a gag version of a commenter on the well-trafficked N.F.L. blog Pro Football Talk, his tweets and columns filled with the spelling errors, prejudices and leaps of logic that plague all open forums about sports. In 2015, covering the early part of the presidential campaign, in character, for SB Nation, he would pound airplane bottles of Fireball whiskey and walk straight into scrums of reporters; outside a Republican debate in Cleveland, he held up a sign behind Chris Matthews that read, “Is Joe Flacco a ELITE Quaterback?”

Almost everything about “Pardon My Take” is a densely referential sports-fan in-joke. Even the title plays off two ESPN talk shows, “Pardon the Interruption” and “First Take.” If you’ve never watched Chris Berman run through a highlight reel or admired the sports-yelling talents of Stephen A. Smith, Katz and Commenter might as well be speaking a foreign language. But most sports fans have watched hundreds of hours of ESPN programming, absorbing all the tics, clichés and motifs that Katz and Commenter have quilted together into a pitch-perfect satirical pidgin. One of its catchiest elements derives from the N.F.L.-coach habit of explaining some bit of masculine bluster by saying “I’m a football guy” — in my time at Barstool, at least 70 percent of conversations seemed to include some deadpan variation on “I’m a huge [something] guy.” This entertaining mix has attracted an impressive list of high-profile athletes and media figures to the show. Before the Chernin deal, Portnoy had not seen the value in producing podcasts, which he admitted to me was a “big mistake”; now “Pardon My Take” is Barstool’s flagship product. Katz and Commenter were, until October, proof that Barstool could be scrubbed clean and scaled up.

During our conversations, Portnoy kept bringing up “Saturday Night Live,” mentioning it as a model for Barstool. What he meant was that he wanted to create a broad cast of characters, each capable of his or her own independent success. Barstool has hired the ESPN sideline reporter Julie Stewart-Binks; Michael Rapaport, the character actor who hosts a popular podcast; the former major-league pitcher Dallas Braden; Pat McAfee, an N.F.L. punter who retired midcareer to sign with Portnoy; and Adam Ferrone, a battle-rap champion who told me that he pestered Barstool for two years for a job. By choosing Barstool, each seems to be signing on with the gospel of Portnoy: Say what’s on your mind — and if anyone has a problem with it, fight back.

The morning after Skipper sent out the ESPN memo canceling “Van Talk,” I met Portnoy in his hoarder’s den of an office, where Tom Brady memorabilia and stacks of paper occupied every surface. He seemed unusually subdued. His nearly manic manner had dissipated into a fog of half-formed sound bites and what felt like sincere anxiety. He expressed regret over hurting Katz and Commenter’s television prospects, denounced ESPN’s cowardice and called out the hypocrisy of any female journalist at ESPN who had ever tweeted an edgy joke in the past. “I used to think of Barstool like a comedy club,” he said. “Just me talking to my guys. But things have definitely changed.” Then, after a pause, he seemed to have a change of heart: “ESPN thought they were going to get Barstool without Barstool. How does that even work?”

Over the days to come, Portnoy and a handful of bloggers — alongside hundreds of Stoolie volunteers — scrubbed through the social-media accounts of women at ESPN who had spoken out about them, resurfacing every comment that was even slightly off-color. (“I hate hypocrisy,” Portnoy told me — and that image, of ugly honesty triumphing over hypocrisy, probably explains Barstool’s appeal to young men better than any of its content.) A week later, Henry Lockwood, the producer of “Pardon My Take,” tweeted that Britt McHenry had “cankles,” leading to another spat. It was as if Barstool was doubling down on being more Barstool than ever, even though ESPN wasn’t the only partner that had been scared off: Portnoy told me another network had backed away from a deal, and that some advertisers had expressed concern.

We talked about something that happened a few hours before ESPN’s announcement, while Portnoy was recording one of his daily pizza reviews — a Barstool programming staple in which Portnoy tries to review every pizza joint in Manhattan. That day, his guest was Jake Paul, the 20-year-old YouTube heel who might be the only person on the internet better than Portnoy at turning hate and controversy into merchandising opportunities. “People know I’m a Jake Paul guy,” Portnoy said. “I respect people who take over the internet, and this guy has got maybe more haters than I do, which I also love.” He ventured that “if you put Team 10” — the name of Paul’s company — “with the Stoolies, I think we can bring down, like, the entire country.”

He was joking, but if companies like ESPN want to corral the millions of young people who have cut cable cords, turned off “SportsCenter” and flocked to unfiltered and anarchic internet personalities, they will have to reckon with Jake Pauls and Dave Portnoys. The truth about ESPN’s supposed bias will not really matter: A lot of people, like Ives the intern, believe that the Worldwide Leader in Sports no longer speaks to them. Their grievances, like those of the angry men who fume over the female cast of “Ghostbusters” or ethics in video-game journalism, will seem absurdly petty, whether they’re complaining about the rare yet somehow oppressive sight of a female sportscaster or the unbearable burden placed upon their consciences by a two-minute conversation about Colin Kaepernick. But they will voice these grievances online with enough volume and vitriol to worry even the most reasonable media executive. And if that executive doesn’t bend to their will, they will seek out someone, anyone, who feels more authentic to their experience, whatever that may mean. For huge media conglomerates, this dynamic might matter only in the margins; ESPN surely has more immediate business concerns. But gains in media right now occur only in the margins. The market inefficiencies will not be ignored.

In his office, I asked Portnoy why he thought ESPN had been interested in partnering with Barstool in the first place, given its past. A half-smile crept over his face. “You know, it’s like that Batman quote,” he said. “In a time of desperation, you turn to a man you don’t fully understand.”","Spurned by ESPN, Barstool Sports Is Staying on Offense",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/magazine/spurned-by-espn-barstool-sports-is-staying-on-offense.html

Physicians are at approximately twice the relative risk of suicide compared to people in other professions, Dr. McClafferty said.
And we don’t adequately teach the skills in medical training that doctors will need to deal with the realities of taking care of patients.
“The solution is not to weed out the ones who don’t care, but to support the large number of physicians who are deeply invested and have the capacity to provide excellent care, but lose that capacity over time,” Dr. Schonfeld said.","“It’s not that physicians are burned out and so don’t care, it’s that they care deeply,” said Dr. David Schonfeld, a developmental behavioral pediatrician at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. “You can’t experience compassion fatigue if you’ve not had compassion.”

Medical faculty members have been shown to have burnout rates ranging from 20 to 49 percent. And the hard-won reductions in resident work hours do not seem to have satisfactorily reduced burnout or depression among residents, perhaps because hospitalized patients are sicker on average than they used to be, perhaps because patient loads are higher (if you reduce work hours but don’t increase the number of doctors, well, you can do the math), or perhaps because of the increasing frustrations and time pressures connected to the electronic health record and documentation, which can take up more than half of some doctors’ time, often squeezed in at night or by coming in early.

Another statistic often cited in the physician wellness conversation is the suicide rate. Physicians are at approximately twice the relative risk of suicide compared to people in other professions, Dr. McClafferty said. “Women physicians especially are at a significantly higher risk of completed suicide than matched female controls in other professions,” she said. An estimated 300 to 400 physicians commit suicide every year.

If this were happening in any other high-profile industry, Dr. McClafferty said, “I can’t imagine people wouldn’t be rallying round, saying this is unacceptable, it has to stop.”

There is a clear link between physician depression and medical errors. In one study of pediatric residents at three high-powered training programs, those who were depressed made more than six times as many medication errors as those who were not. This study and others also found that residents experiencing burnout were more likely to perceive that they were making more errors, even if they were not.

We place physicians in situations where they are detecting problems, often connected to social conditions or poverty, Dr. Schonfeld said, but then don’t give them the support they need to address those problems. And we don’t adequately teach the skills in medical training that doctors will need to deal with the realities of taking care of patients. “There are more advanced skill sets, how to deal with conflict, how to deal with negotiation, how to deal with the distress of patients,” he said. “We just send trainees in, the training focuses on medications, pathophysiology, genetics, not the skills they need to be able to deal with those broader issues.”

So we might look to changes in the ways we train residents, not just limiting work hours but looking more closely at what the content of those work hours is like, and at the skills we teach, and at what we do and do not discuss.

“Because of organizational structures and competing responsibilities there’s less time, and physicians are really sad about this, and we need to struggle as a society to make it different,” Dr. Serwint said.

Studies are just beginning to be done of workplace interventions that address such issues as time pressure, workplace chaos, and a doctor’s sense of control, but the evidence supports the idea that it’s more effective to make changes at the level of the institution, rather than just telling the doctors to shape up in the wellness department.

“The solution is not to weed out the ones who don’t care, but to support the large number of physicians who are deeply invested and have the capacity to provide excellent care, but lose that capacity over time,” Dr. Schonfeld said. “Physicians enter medical school deeply committed to the field, they come with the desire to be empathic and compassionate, if we just create a system that nurtures what they come with then we will have less burnout and higher quality care.”

It should not be the doctor’s responsibility to feel that “if I’m just more mindful, if I just exercise more or do it better or more consistently, all will be well, and I shouldn’t be feeling burned out or exhausted,” Dr. McClafferty said.

The fact that nearly half of physicians and over 50 percent of trainees experience burnout at some point “shows that it is not predominantly an individual deficit, but an organizational and system problem,” Dr. Schonfeld said

That consensus does not extend to the American public.

Climate change divides Americans, but in an unlikely way: The more education that Democrats and Republicans have, the more their beliefs in climate change diverge.

Percent saying they worry about climate change “a great deal”

This chart , based on a Gallup survey from March 2015, demonstrates this relationship clearly. About one in four Republicans with only a high school education said they worried about climate change a great deal. But among college-educated Republicans, that figure decreases, sharply, to 8 percent.

This relationship persists even when pollsters pose different kinds of questions about climate change – when Republicans are asked if they believe global warming “will never happen,” if they think it poses “a serious threat to way of life in your lifetime” or if it is caused by “natural changes in the environment.”

This may seem counterintuitive, because better-educated Republicans are more likely to be aware of the scientific consensus that human activity is contributing to climate change. But in the realm of public opinion, climate change isn’t really a scientific issue. It’s a political one.

Even though better-educated Republicans may have more exposure to information about the science around climate change, they also have more exposure to partisan messages about it. And communications research says that matters more.

Few other national issues divide as sharply by education as climate change does. At the request of The New York Times, Andrew Dugan and Jonathan Rothwell of Gallup compiled estimates of Americans’ attitudes by party and education on a wide range of issues, including race, immigration, taxes and values. Climate change is near the top of that list.

Gap between college-educated Democrats and Republicans Dem. Rep. Difference

On many other issues – social issues in particular, including abortion, gay marriage and divorce – more education is associated with higher rates of acceptance, regardless of party. Gaps between Democrats and Republicans persisted, but the relationships moved more or less in tandem:

Issues where attitudes change in tandem with education

On most other issues, education had little effect. Americans’ views on terrorism, immigration, taxes on the wealthiest, and the state of health care in the United States did not change appreciably by education for Democrats and Republicans.

Only a handful of issues had a shape like the one for climate change, in which higher education corresponded with higher agreement among Democrats and lower agreement among Republicans.

Issues where education has a different relationship depending on your party

So what distinguishes these issues, climate change in particular?

First, climate change is a relatively new and technically complicated issue. On these kinds of matters, many Americans don’t necessarily have their own views, so they look to adopt those of political elites. And when it comes to climate change, conservative elites are deeply skeptical.

This can trigger what social scientists call a polarization effect, as described by John Zaller, a political scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, in his 1992 book about mass opinion. When political elites disagree, their views tend to be adopted first by higher-educated partisans on both sides, who become more divided as they acquire more information.

It may be easier to think about in terms of simple partisanship. Most Americans know what party they belong to, but they can’t be expected to know the details of every issue, so they tend to adopt the views of the leaders of the party they already identify with.

Climate change is not a social issue like gay marriage, divorce, racism or abortion – issues where Democrats’ and Republicans’ views move in tandem with education. On those kinds of issues, college-educated Americans of both parties tend to be more progressive.

But Americans do not treat climate change like a scientific issue either. In the past, consensus from the scientific community on factual issues effectively ended serious disagreement among elites, whether it was about things like whether blacks and whites have the same kind of blood or whether homosexuality was rooted in mental illness.","The More Education Republicans Have, the Less They Tend to Believe in Climate Change",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/14/upshot/climate-change-by-education.html

But Mr. Wang moved from leader to leader, shaping the outlook not only of Mr. Xi but also his two predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin. In doing so, he has played a key role in justifying one-party rule during China’s transformation into a geopolitical rival of the United States.

“People call him the brain behind three supreme leaders,” said Yun Sun, a China expert at the Washington-based Stimson Center.

As a young professor in Shanghai in the late 1980s, Mr. Wang won attention for advocating “neo-authoritarianism,” the idea that a nation as big and poor as China needed a firm hand to push through modernization before it could consider becoming a democracy.

As others argued that China could never modernize without becoming democratic — a view that later gave rise to the ill-fated student movement based in Tiananmen Square — Mr. Wang made the case in a 1988 article that an enlightened autocracy would be “highly effective in distributing social resources” in order to “promote rapid economic growth.”

“He believed in modernization and that China needed strong political leadership,” said Ren Xiao, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai and a former student of Mr. Wang. “That is still on his mind. It is his firm belief.”

Mr. Wang is believed to have helped craft Mr. Xi’s key slogans, including the one the party enshrined in its constitution last month, elevating Mr. Xi to the same status as Mao: “Xi Jinping Thought for the New Era of Socialism With Chinese Special Characteristics.”

Just as Mao made China independent and Deng Xiaoping made it prosperous, Mr. Xi has vowed to make China strong again. With Mr. Wang’s help, he has centralized power, tightened control of society and emphasized the need to keep a firm grip on the party itself using a sweeping anticorruption campaign.

To the outside world, their message is one of national pride: China has followed a different path to development from the United States, which it hopes to eclipse.

While many Chinese looked to the West for inspiration after the country opened up in the 1980s, Mr. Wang returned from two trips to the United States back then convinced that it was not a good model for China, according to his own writings and people who knew him.

“If pluralism means a multiparty system, Western-style elections — he doesn’t believe that kind of system is suitable for China,” Mr. Ren said.

Mr. Wang recorded the trips in a book called “America Against America.” In it, he offered a scathing description of the 1988 presidential contest between George H.W. Bush and Michael S. Dukakis. He also rejected the notion that America was a land of egalitarian opportunity where anyone could become president.

Born in the eastern province of Shandong, the birthplace of Confucius, Mr. Wang was a sickly teenager who, unlike many young people, was allowed to avoid heavy farm work during Mao’s destructive Cultural Revolution. He studied instead, learning French as his first foreign language.

Tutored by a prominent Marxist scholar, Chen Qiren, Mr. Wang gravitated toward the study of Western political thought. At 30, he became the youngest professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, and within just a few years had risen to head the law school.

“He taught Plato, Aristotle, the French Revolution, a little about the American Revolution, the Federalist Papers translated into Chinese,” Mr. Ren said.

As the coach of Fudan’s debate team, he would stand during practice with a plastic stick to make a show of driving his students to strive harder, though he never struck them, according to a collection of essays about the team’s trip to a 1988 competition in Singapore.

His team defeated National Taiwan University, 5-0, by out-debating it on the subject: Is human nature kind or evil? (Mr. Wang’s team argued for evil.)

Reflecting on the visit, Mr. Wang later wrote: “While Western modern civilization can bring material prosperity, it does not necessarily lead to improvement in character.”

As a member of delegations of young political scientists, he toured more than a dozen American campuses, including Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Iowa.

“He was a very charismatic figure: young, articulate and adept at theoretical arguments,” said Miles Kahler, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, who first encountered Mr. Wang in the early 1980s in Shanghai and later in California.

“He was definitely a skeptic of the wisdom of China moving toward a Western-style democracy,” Mr. Kahler added. “Wang Huning did not pretend to share such idolization of the United States.”

When the pro-democracy movement erupted on Tiananmen Square and spread to cities across the country in the spring of 1989, Mr. Wang kept his distance from the demonstrations in Shanghai.

In a letter written two months after the bloody crackdown that followed, he informed Mr. Kahler that one of his students had been “too active” in “recent affairs” to go to the United States but refrained from saying much more.

Soon afterward, Mr. Wang was recruited into politics by Jiang Zemin, the Shanghai party chief who became president of China after the crackdown. Mr. Jiang brought Mr. Wang to Beijing, where he stood out as a rare academic within a party leadership dominated by engineers and apparatchiks.

Mr. Wang’s first post was as head of the politics group inside the Central Policy Research Office, the party’s in-house think tank, which he was later promoted to lead.

When Mr. Jiang retired in 2002, Mr. Wang was promoted again, into the party’s influential Central Secretariat, the bureaucracy that serves the Politburo, even as he continued to run the research office.

After a decade serving Mr. Jiang’s successor, Mr. Wang transferred his allegiance to Mr. Xi, becoming a loyal adviser to the ambitious new president and a key member of his entourage on overseas trips.

He was there in 2013 when Mr. Xi visited Kazakhstan’s capital, Astana, to launch an effort to project Chinese power called the Belt and Road Initiative. Sitting in the audience, he approved photos of Mr. Xi for transmission by the state news agency, Xinhua.

Mr. Wang has returned several times to the United States with Mr. Xi and his predecessors. When he does, he has avoided his American peers, in keeping with the strict rules for senior party officials.

At a State Department lunch for Mr. Xi in 2015, Mr. Wang crossed paths with Kenneth G. Lieberthal, who had worked for President Bill Clinton on China issues at the National Security Council.

“When I asked whether I could see him during my next trip to Beijing, he indicated he now works ‘inside’ and thus would not be available,” Mr. Lieberthal said.","Behind the Scenes, Communist Strategist Presses China’s Rise",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-wang-huning.html

I own a house in Maplewood, N.J., and am wondering: Does it ever make sense to rent out your house rather than sell it? Are there any advantages to renting? Is there a rule of thumb to decide if it’s worth it financially?

A. Before you crunch numbers, decide if you want to be a landlord. Are you prepared to take a call at 3 a.m. when the heat fails during a blizzard in January? If the dishwasher won’t work properly, you will be expected to fix the problem immediately. If the rent is late (or does not arrive) you will have to chase the tenant for the money, and maybe even take the case to housing court.

“Being a landlord isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be,” said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers and Consultants in Manhattan.

Generally, renters do not maintain homes the way owners do. Consider the finicky dishwasher: If you own the house and the dishwasher is on its last legs, you might hold out until you can afford a new stainless steel model that matches the newer refrigerator. But a tenant will expect a functioning dishwasher pronto, and so, chances are, you will swap out the aging one with a cheap white model. Come time to sell the house, the overall condition of your kitchen has diminished.

“I’ve had people who’ve rented their homes and they come back and it’s never the house they left,” said Allison Maguire, a sales associate for Halstead in Montclair, N.J. “No one takes care of a rental as if it’s their true home.”

To make your decision, research the rental market, as its fluctuations are not necessarily tied to the sales market. With the help of a broker, estimate how much rent you could fetch: Would it be enough to cover the mortgage and taxes? Consider other expenses, too, like landscaping services, and insurance. Ask your accountant about tax implications. Factor in vacancies and repairs. You may need to hire a property manager if, for example, you move out of the area.

Tally your estimated profit for the number of years you anticipate renting out the house. Then compare that figure with the cash you would walk away with should you sell your house today. Is the potential payoff worth the headache of being a landlord? It might be. But being a landlord is a job, and you have to decide if it is one you want. With “a long-term hold, generally, you can come out ahead,” Mr. Miller said. “But people don’t factor in the hassle.”",Does It Make Sense to Rent Out a House Rather Than Sell It?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/11/realestate/does-it-make-sense-to-rent-out-a-house-rather-than-sell-it.html

“When I saw Ariel the first time, it was like a dare,” she added, referring to the “Tempest” score. “And this is a double-dog dare.”

In “The Exterminating Angel,” based on the 1962 Luis Buñuel film, Ms. Luna plays Leticia, an opera diva who is part of a blue-bloods dinner party, the guests of which find themselves mysteriously unable to leave at the end of the evening. The vocal demands are a workout for almost every performer onstage.

“The note,” Mr. Adès said, “the range, the tessitura, is a metaphor for the ability to transcend these psychological and invisible boundaries that have grown up around them.”

Adding to the excitement of the high A is its placement in the score. Unlike in other high-flying parts — the imperious Queen of the Night in “The Magic Flute,” the spunky Zerbinetta in “Ariadne auf Naxos,” the long-suffering title role in “Lucia di Lammermoor” — there’s little time for Ms. Luna to warm up: The A is her very first note, sung before she’s even visible onstage. (She sings it again a short time later, as the party guests, in a surreal portent, leave the stage and re-enter.)

“It’s a moment of arrival,” Mr. Adès said. “It had to be on this note.”

Growing up in Oregon, Ms. Luna sang the daunting Queen of the Night when she was still in high school “just because it was fun,” she said. “And I liked the sensation it made in my bones, in my head, in my sinuses. It just gave me a high. It still gives me a high.”

Her topmost register is unusually lucid and effortless. Even in those notes unattainable by most other sopranos, and even when those notes are held far longer than the pecks requested by most other composers, Ms. Luna’s tone is full. She manages to avoid shrillness in what she aptly calls the “Wagnerian coloratura spectacle” that is her final “Exterminating Angel” aria, a flood of sustained superhigh sound up to F.

Even if nothing in previous Met history has equaled her high A, other singers have come close, sometimes adding unwritten interpolations and transpositions to show off their personal stratospheres. A number of the highest notes in Met history have emerged from sopranos singing the title part in “Lucia di Lammermoor”; it’s no coincidence that this is the role Ms. Luna’s character performs just before the dinner party at the start of “The Exterminating Angel.”

Ellen Beach Yaw, born near Buffalo in 1869, sang a G above C as Lucia in her single Met performance in 1908. The review in The New York Times praised her “flutelike Santos-Dumont notes,” comparing her to a Brazilian aviation pioneer, and added, in a reference to a Wild West gunslinger: “She hit that high G as promised, but it is like Bat Masterson hitting a tomato can with a .44 at four paces.”

The celebrated French soprano Lily Pons sustained a high F in the final mad scene from “Lucia” — sung, at her Met debut in 1931, “in legitimate note, not bird whistles or falsetto,” according to The New York Post. At the turn of the 20th century, Sibyl Sanderson, as Massenet’s Manon, hit a G, known as her “Eiffel Tower note.” Mado Robin, a French coloratura, was recorded shrilling up to a B flat, but she never sang at the Met.

More recently, Natalie Dessay was known in New York for her crystal-clear G’s as the mechanical doll Olympia in Offenbach’s “Les Contes d’Hoffmann.” Just this fall, Erin Morley’s Olympia ornaments brought her up to A flat, a feat Rachele Gilmore achieved in the role at the Met in 2009.

The company admits it is possible that an even higher note could have slipped through the archival cracks. “There’s no record keeping of such things, especially of improvised stuff,” said Peter Clark, the Met’s archivist, who remembers hearing Pons’s F on a radio broadcast as a child. “So it’s not to say that in 1908, say, something higher didn’t happen. But I doubt that it wouldn’t be mentioned somewhere.”

“The Exterminating Angel” isn’t the first time Mr. Adès has pushed a singer to extremes, nor was “The Tempest.” In fact, one of his very first works, “Five Eliot Landscapes” for soprano and piano, from 1990, ends on a sustained G flat.

“It’s a certain amount of useful cruelty involved,” he said with a chuckle, before correcting himself. “Not cruelty, but the callowness of youth.”

Callow or not, he’s still at it. Mr. Adès said that in the score of “The Tempest,” which had its premiere in London in 2004, he had placed a high G in brackets, indicating a note that at the time he only dreamed of hearing.

When she sang the part at the Met, Ms. Luna could reach the G. Now, more than a decade later, the score of “The Exterminating Angel” has a high B in brackets — yet another seemingly impossible note, waiting patiently for a soprano who can crack yet another music-stave ceiling.","At the Met Opera, a Note So High, It’s Never Been Sung Before",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/arts/music/metropolitan-opera-high-note-exterminating-angel.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“In Lithuanian, we have a proverb: ‘A neighbor’s apples are always tastier,’” he said.

Mr. Kavaliauskas knows that firsthand. As a frequent flyer, he has experienced the boredom, discomfort and stress that often accompanies air travel, feelings he captured in his decade-long project on fellow travelers, which Lens featured last year. But he also knows the lure of freedom and excitement that flying presents to people on the ground, an understanding he gained while photographing people who spend hours relishing the view above.

“There are people who watch football,” he said. “There are others who go fishing. These people go out to watch airplanes.”

Over the last two years, Mr. Kavaliauskas has photographed people in more than a dozen cities around the world. He discovered there are hugely popular locations that attract hundreds of people. On St. Martin, scores of tourists on Maho Beach gawk at the famously low-flying planes making their descent into Princess Juliana International Airport. In Denmark, diners at The Airplane Grill come specifically to watch the landings and departures at Copenhagen Airport.

At those places, the atmosphere can be carnivalesque. But plane-spotting also draws people to desolate places in “the middle of nowhere,” Mr. Kavaliauskas said. There, the hobby can be a solitary and sober pursuit.

“One night, I saw three students who’d just graduated high school and were looking at airplanes, discussing what they want to do in life,” he said. “So sometimes this scenery is for entertainment. Other times it’s a place for serious contemplation.”

Thanks to various apps and websites providing real-time flight information or access to radio chatter from air traffic control, spotting planes is a fairly accessible pursuit for aviation geeks. But plane-spotter spotting, Mr. Kavaliauskas said, is trickier. Several times he trekked to a remote plane-spotting location he’d found online, only to discover a single spotter, or none. But those situations can still yield interesting photographs, Mr. Kavaliauskas said. So, too, can scenes where airplanes aren’t even present.

Some of Mr. Kavaliauskas’ subjects, in fact, aren’t clearly identifiable as plane spotters. Taken out of context, they could be enjoying a parade, or watching birds. In these images, Mr. Kavaliauskas’ focus is human relationships — the father and son peering through a telescope, or the new parents lifting their baby in the air for a photo.

“What I actually liked about this project was that there was often no immediate picture to take,” he said.

Not all plane watchers are necessarily aviation enthusiasts. Some do it to see their relatives taking off. Some just enjoy the scenery with a date or with their families. Others, he said, want to feel vicariously connected to the planes, passengers and the far-off places they’ll likely never visit.

“It’s a way to kind of consume the world,” he said.

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at the Leica store in New York. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

For all its depiction of a world spinning off its axis, “Albion” affords the pleasures of a vintage, soul-searching British novel.","This may sound like a joyless prospect. But it’s amazing how quickly the traffic of the stage passes when you’re in the hands of expert craftsmen.

Neither Mr. Graham’s “Labour of Love” (at the Noël Coward Theater in the West End) nor Mr. Bartlett’s “Albion” (at the Almeida in Islington) is likely to be the work for which either dramatist will be best remembered. But seen at a moment in which the center of a classically self-contained world no longer seems to be holding, these fraught works exude a paradoxical reassurance.

There is warming solace, after all, in people gathering to hear their collective identity crisis discussed in such well-spoken terms. (This is true even for uneasy Americans like me, whose own viciously conflicted nation has been keeping them awake at nights.)

Theatergoers here will recognize such plays as part of a long tradition of literary introspection. It is one that stretches back to at least the days of that other Queen Elizabeth, when Shakespeare’s characters tear out their hair over their imperiled country’s divisions, and has been sustained by 20th- and 21st-century writers including John Osborne, David Hare and Caryl Churchill.

What’s more, though their subjects may be absolutely of the moment, “Labour of Love,” an anxious comedy, and “Albion,” a state-of-the-nation drama, are both old-fashioned in form. This is not necessarily to be expected of either of their creators.

Mr. Bartlett is the author of the future Shakespearean history play “King Charles III”; Mr. Graham wrote the interactive “Privacy,” about reality-fracturing practices in the age of surveillance. Despite a few postmodern flourishes and some teasing structural game playing, their latest offerings are unlikely to disconcert habitual watchers of “Masterpiece” television.

Directed by Jeremy Herrin (“Wolf Hall,” “People, Places & Things”), “Labour of Love” is a detailed examination of the history of the British Labour Party. But wait. It is also a spirited battle-of-the-sexes comedy in the vein of “Much Ado About Nothing” and the films that pitted Katharine Hepburn against Spencer Tracy.

In this case, though, the salt-of-the-earth Tracy character is a woman, Jean Whittaker, a longtime stalwart of the local party in a working-class mining town. The patrician Hepburn type is a rising politician, with a public school accent and impeccably tailored suits.

That’s David Lyons (a top-form Martin Freeman, of “Sherlock” fame). He has been delivered, more or less by central party fiat, into a “safe seat” in the constituency where Jean (the wonderful Tamsin Greig) has worked as the office manager for the outgoing member of Parliament (who happens to be her husband). She has no intention of sticking around.

But of course she does, and leftist Old Labour (think Tony Benn) butts heads with centrist New Labour (think Tony Blair), amid plenty of sparks and quips over 27 years. I should note that the play begins on an election night in 2017, when it seems as if David is going to lose, and works backward to the day he arrived to first assume his Parliamentary position in 1994.

That’s the first act, anyway. The second act reverts to conventional chronology, beginning in 1994 and picking up where each scene in the previous act ended. The structure embodies the play’s central and cleverly executed motif of mirror images.

I’m making the plot sound more complicated than it feels. Interspersed with time-capsule video montages that show the changing faces of British government, the production moves with the barbed breeziness of an Alan Ayckbourn comedy.

Yes, Labour policies, strategies, economics and even iconography are discussed at length. But as he demonstrated in his gripping parliamentary procedural docudrama, “This House,” Mr. Graham has a gift for finding the human crackle in ostensibly dry political business.

It is a battle to which Mr. Freeman and Ms. Greig lend a deliciously combustible chemistry. And though the divided Britain of 2017 inspires lamentations about a party — and a nation — at war within itself, “Labour” dares to end on a note of guarded but cheering optimism.

The same can hardly be said of “Albion,” which is directed by Rupert Goold and stars a splendid Victoria Hamilton (of Netflix’s “The Crown”). The titular setting is the once magnificent garden of an English estate, long since fallen into disuse and decay.

Albion once belonged to the uncle of Audrey Walters (Ms. Hamilton), the self-made head of a home furnishings empire and a bereaved mother whose soldier son was killed in Iraq. She is determined to restore it to its former glory. She is also, of course, hoping to resurrect an England of long ago, of material solidity and a clear-cut social structure.

It isn’t a spoiler to say that this project is inevitably doomed. An end-of-days tone of Chekhovian melancholy pervades the show from its opening moments.

And Mr. Bartlett borrows unapologetically from both Chekhov’s “The Cherry Orchard” and “The Seagull” for his portrayal of the characters here. They include Audrey’s benignly parasitic husband (an excellent Nicholas Rowe); her best friend, a swaggering and emotionally destructive novelist (Helen Schlesinger); and Audrey’s dangerously impressionable daughter (Charlotte Hope), who has artistic leanings of her own.

The fact that there is no place in contemporary Britain for the Albion of yore is explored in clashes among classes and generations. These are enacted in dialogue that, by Mr. Bartlett’s standards, often feels surprisingly banal, as if recycled from a century’s worth of country house dramas.

But Mr. Goold’s production, featuring a deceptively simple design by Miriam Buether, has been most engagingly staged. (The ways in which the garden comes to life is a marvel.) And the acting, especially from Ms. Hamilton, is passionate and persuasive.

For all its depiction of a world spinning off its axis, “Albion” affords the pleasures of a vintage, soul-searching British novel. In asking the question of who will inherit what remains of the British Empire, it brings to mind one literary classic in particular. And when I turned on the television the next night, there on the screen was a new adaptation of that very work.

I mean E. M. Forster’s 1910 masterpiece, “Howards End.” Watching this latest incarnation of one of my favorite books, I found it exasperating, poignant and comforting that more than a hundred years ago, Forster was posing the same questions about his country’s identity and purpose that haunted the plays I had just seen.","On London Stages, Britain Considers Its Divided Soul",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/theater/labour-of-love-albion-london.html

“There is this combination of intimacy and formal, rigorous design,” said Alex Prud’homme, the couple’s grandnephew and a co-author of “France Is a Feast: The Photographic Journey of Paul and Julia Child.”

The Childs met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, leading them to various postings around Europe. But it was Paris, where they arrived in 1948, that captured their hearts.

“Apart from our official lives — cooking and government — the other things we do fall into fairly repetitive categories whose two main divisions are, being entertained and entertaining others,” Mr. Child wrote to his twin brother, Charlie. “Sometimes when we’re being entertained it isn’t people, but just Paris herself who acts as hostess.”

While Ms. Child took French cooking classes, and eventually began work on “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck, Mr. Child was engaged in diplomatic duties as a cultural attaché for the United States government. And he was rarely without a camera.

The photographs, taken between 1948 and 1954, focus on the beauty of postwar France. The perfectly-landscaped parks, the bustling waterfront in Marseille, the glow of Place de la Concorde at night, a cold fog settling over the Sacré-Coeur basilica. The shadow play on the grand entryways and the underpasses along the Seine.

But Mr. Child’s main subject was always his wife. Ms. Child in the kitchen; changing her clothes on the side of the road; legs propped up in a telephone booth; sunbathing in Cassis.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

The detail and expansive catalog of Mr. Child’s work raise the question: Did he have a sense that their lives would have a bigger impact than their immediate Parisian universe?

“He was an obsessive photographer and note taker, it’s almost like he knew back then that their lives were worth preserving for posterity,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “It’s like they were leaving breadcrumbs.”

Mr. Prud’homme helped Ms. Child write her memoir, “My Life in France” (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006), but he felt it wasn’t complete. That’s when Katie Pratt, a longtime family friend of the Childs and the book’s co-author, discovered a “Pandora’s box” of hundreds of black and white and color photographs, everything from surrealistic street documentary to formal portraits and landscapes.

Negatives were clearly labeled. Log books and letters provided a time frame, and were often accompanied by long letters detailing their routine: embassy comings and goings during the Cold War, their meals, the price of wine or the performance they saw the evening before. Everything was for the taking.

Mr. Child had a “distinct style,” Ms. Pratt said.

“His style as a visual artist, whether it was photography or other mediums, it was very important for him to have strong, well-organized, well-balanced compositions, often with perspective and depth,” she said. “There’s often a story going on.”

Mr. Child’s style was heavily influenced by artists living in France at the time. And as a cultural attaché, he quickly gravitated to the top artists of the day: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Edward Steichen were all friends of his. They even shared the same printer, using Pictorial Service owned by Pierre Gassmann in Paris.

“My interpretation was that Paul was a very independent-minded guy who really developed his own aesthetic, but he was swimming in the waters of these masters of 20th-century photography,” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off. But he always remained behind the camera.

“Paul and Julia, in their own ways, were really good teachers,” Ms. Pratt said. “They really cared about not only perfecting their craft and communicating it clearly with others. They put it to operational proof and shared it with others.”

“That’s something they learned while in the O.S.S.,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “Don’t trust common wisdom, find out for yourself whether something works or doesn’t. That’s something they both did in their art, and cooking.”

But conservatives said Mrs. Clinton should not be immune from scrutiny as a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, investigates Russia’s interference in last year’s election and any ties it may have to Mr. Trump’s campaign. They argued, for example, that Mrs. Clinton was the one doing Russia’s bidding in the form of a uranium deal approved when she was secretary of state.

Peter Schweizer, whose best-selling book, “Clinton Cash,” raised the uranium issue in 2015, said a special counsel would be the best way to address this matter because it would actually remove it from politics. “It offers greater independence from any political pressures and provides the necessary tools to hopefully get to the bottom of what happened and why it happened,” said Mr. Schweizer, whose nonprofit organization was co-founded by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist.

A letter by Stephen E. Boyd, an assistant attorney general, to Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, disclosed that career prosecutors were evaluating issues that the congressman raised in his own letters to the department in July and September.

Among the issues raised by Mr. Goodlatte was the uranium case. In 2010, Russia’s atomic energy agency acquired a controlling stake in Uranium One, a Canadian company that at the time controlled 20 percent of American uranium extraction capacity. The purchase was approved by a government committee that included representatives of nine agencies, including Mrs. Clinton’s State Department.

Donors related to Uranium One and another company it acquired contributed millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, and Bill Clinton received $500,000 from a Russian bank for a speech. But there is no evidence that Mrs. Clinton participated in the government approval of the deal, and her aides have noted that other agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, signed off on it as well. The company’s actual share of American uranium production has been 2 percent; the real benefit for Russia was securing far greater supplies of uranium from Kazakhstan.

Other issues raised by Mr. Goodlatte include Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server, which was investigated by the F.B.I. until the bureau’s then-director, James B. Comey, declared last year that no prosecutor would press charges based on the evidence. Mr. Goodlatte also asked the Justice Department to investigate Mr. Comey for leaking details of his conversations with Mr. Trump after the president fired him.

To the extent that there may be legitimate questions about Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Comey, however, the credibility of any investigation presumably would be called into question should one be authorized by Mr. Sessions or his deputy, Rod J. Rosenstein, because of the way it came about under pressure from Mr. Trump.

There are few if any recent precedents. President George W. Bush did not order an investigation reopened into the fund-raising practices of Al Gore, his vanquished rival, nor did Mr. Obama suggest the Justice Department look again at the Keating Five lobbying case that involved John McCain, whom he defeated. Mr. Obama rebuffed pressure from his liberal base to investigate Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for their actions authorizing the waterboarding of terrorism suspects despite anti-torture laws.

During the Obama administration, the Internal Revenue Service applied extra scrutiny to tax exemptions for conservative nonprofit groups and was accused of politicizing the agency much like President Richard M. Nixon did. But no evidence emerged tying that to Mr. Obama.

Mr. Trump promised during last year’s campaign that if he were elected, he would instruct his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs. Clinton. But he backed off that pledge shortly after the election, saying, “I don’t want to hurt the Clintons.”

By last summer, with Mr. Mueller’s investigation bearing down, he had changed his mind. To Mr. Trump, the investigation was a “witch hunt” based on a “hoax” perpetrated by Democrats. It was all the more galling to him, advisers said, because Mrs. Clinton had not been prosecuted, a frustration exacerbated by recent reports about how her campaign helped finance a dossier of salacious assertions about him.

While presidents typically are not supposed to intervene in investigations or prosecutions of specific individuals, Mr. Trump’s calls for an investigation of Mrs. Clinton over the last several months have been repeated, insistent and not even slightly subtle.

“So why aren’t the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?” he wrote on Twitter in July.

“There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out,” he wrote in October. “DO SOMETHING!”

“At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper,” Mr. Trump wrote again in November. He added: “Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn’t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems.”

Mr. Trump has expressed frustration that he does not control the F.B.I. or Justice Department. By his own account, he fired Mr. Comey while bristling at the Russia investigation that the F.B.I. director was at the time leading. He has also expressed deep anger at Mr. Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing that investigation, resulting in Mr. Mueller’s appointment. Mr. Trump said last summer that he would never have appointed Mr. Sessions had he known he would do that, and he has since refused to rule out firing the attorney general.

With his job potentially on the line, Mr. Sessions has been put in the difficult position of absorbing his president’s ire while safeguarding the department’s traditional independence. Some legal experts said Mr. Boyd’s letter actually may be a way of defusing the situation. By asking career prosecutors to evaluate the evidence, he has a ready-made reason not to appoint a special counsel if they do not recommend one.

“I have no idea what will happen but this letter is entirely consistent with the A.G. later saying, ‘we followed normal process to look in to it and found nothing,’” said Jack L. Goldsmith, a former top Justice Department official under Mr. Bush. “The letter does not tip off or hint one way or another what the A.G.’s decision will be.”

The school did not reply to questions about the case, including whether the administration was aware of the trooper’s conclusion. The academy recently entered into an agreement with the police to comply with state reporting requirements, and go beyond them.

Neither of the deans, Arthur J. Cosgrove and Melissa D. Mischke, responded to emails seeking comment.

Like St. Paul’s School in Concord, N.H.; St. George’s School in Middletown, R.I.; Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass.; Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, Conn., and many other prestigious prep schools, Phillips Exeter has been reeling from revelations of sexual misconduct, and questions about whether the school properly handled them.

In most cases, the accusations have involved teachers preying on students. This year, a former Phillips Exeter admissions officer pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a 14-year-old prospective student in the 1970s, and the academy said that an investigation had revealed credible allegations against three former teachers and a former school psychologist. Last year, the school fired a teacher for sexual misconduct with a student, and revealed that another teacher, after admitting to such misconduct, had been allowed to retire quietly and for years remained a presence on campus, with emeritus status.

While some accused of abuse have been prosecuted, it is rare for school administrators who failed to report misconduct to face any legal penalty.

In the case described in the state police report, Michael W. Jones, an alumnus who has been a leading critic of the academy’s handling of sexual abuse cases, said it was “outrageous” that the two deans still had their administrative positions, and that the school had not addressed the matter in more detail. “There should be transparency and consequences,” he said.

The 17-year-old girl’s lawyer, Carmen Durso, declined to comment.

When The Boston Globe reported last year on the girl’s groping allegation and the way it was handled by the school, the news prompted a strong backlash among alumni, many of whom said they would withhold donations to the academy. In a statement, the academy said that “without question, the situation could and should have been handled in a better way,” but it did not say explicitly what had been done wrong, or by whom. Until now, the police account of the deans’ response to the groping allegation, and the trooper’s desire to charge the deans, had not been publicly known.

The state police report shows that the two female students met in October 2015 with Mr. Cosgrove, dean of residential life; Ms. Mischke, dean of students; and a teacher who was the younger student’s faculty adviser and who had encouraged her to go to the deans. The police report includes the two accusers’ and the faculty adviser’s descriptions of the meeting; the two deans declined to be interviewed by investigators.

The younger accuser said that days before she went to the deans, a popular male senior texted her that it was his 18th birthday, and asked her to meet him in the church basement, a quiet place where students sometimes studied, and which he was assigned to monitor. There, she said, he touched her buttocks and breasts and kissed her, even as she repeatedly told him not to, until she left.

The other accuser recounted a similar incident in the same place with the same male student, who she said put his hands under her shirt and touched her breasts, prompting her to leave.

A state law mandates that anyone in a long list of positions, including school officials, “having reason to suspect” sexual abuse of a person under age 18, which it defines very broadly, must report it to the state Department of Health and Human Services.

The girl said that the month after their first meeting, she asked Mr. Cosgrove what punishment her classmate had received, and he declined to tell her. Several months later, the girl felt unsafe with the male student still on campus, and showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, her faculty adviser told investigators. In April 2016, they met again with the two deans.

In both the October and April meetings, the teacher said, when the girl described what had happened to her as an “assault,” Mr. Cosgrove corrected her, saying that it was just harassment.

After the second meeting, the girl went to the police, and prosecutors soon charged the male student, Chukwudi Ikpeazu, with misdemeanor sexual assault. But a year later, in July 2017, as his trial was about to begin, they set aside the charge, and if he meets certain conditions — which have not been made public — prosecutors will drop the case.

Shaun’s inability to read cues can alienate patients. When he’s cogitating on a diagnosis, he goes blank, like a computer app in spinning-wheel mode, and the show suspends the tension long enough that you, like his colleagues, wonder if something’s gone wrong.

The conceit of “The Good Doctor” is that the condition that limits Shaun’s human interactions is inseparable from his gift. I can’t speak to the accuracy of its representation of autism — I am neither a doctor, nor do I play one on TV — but Shaun’s emotional challenge is the show’s emotional engine.

Shaun may not understand human relations well enough to know that, say, he shouldn’t wake his apartment superintendent after midnight. But Mr. Highmore (“Bates Motel”) makes him appealing and eager, with an unintentionally comic candor. (His version of a reassuring diagnosis: “It’s definitely not flesh-eating bacteria!”) You root for him and for his advocate, Dr. Aaron Glassman (Richard Schiff).

“The Good Doctor” was adapted from a South Korean series by David Shore, the creator of “House,” which had a different sort of difficult protagonist. Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) was a crusty, arrogant physician in the sharp-elbowed spirit of the post-9/11 aughts, when figures from Jack Bauer of “24” to Simon Cowell of “American Idol” popularized the idea that nice guys don’t get the job done.

On “House,” the doctor’s misanthropy was as much a strength as a liability — his suspicion (“Everybody lies”) and lack of sentiment led him to ingenious diagnoses.

In the “Good Doctor” pilot, Shaun asks something of a dismissive superior that could have been aimed at his TV predecessor. “You’re very arrogant,” he says. “Do you think that helps you be a good surgeon? Does it hurt you as a person? Is it worth it?”

On the page, that sounds sanctimonious and angry, but Shaun asks it out of curiosity. That’s his way. He’s not cuddly or warm, but he’s guileless and well intentioned — the anti-antihero version of Gregory House. Not just Shaun but his fellow young doctors are learning the art of dealing with frightened patients, getting a feel for the proper dosage of tact, honesty, sympathy and willingness to bend rules.

While there may be different ways to be good and to express caring, “The Good Doctor” suggests, it is something worth aspiring to — an idea that may especially appeal to viewers who have experienced health care as scary, impersonal and alienating.

Elsewhere, “The Good Doctor” creates emotional investment the old-fashioned way: by stabbing a hypodermic needle of it straight into your heart.

The manipulative incidental music is abundant, as are the heart-wrenching scenarios. A bus carrying a wedding party crashes in one episode; in another, we meet a young boy with cancer who is so charming and wise that, if you have watched more than one medical drama in your life, you know he’s not long for this world.

We also get a series of bludgeoningly woeful flashbacks to Shaun’s childhood — his father beats him, his brother dies, his pet rabbit dies — which the show has thankfully dialed back on lately. Even Mr. Schiff, known for playing acerbic characters like Toby Ziegler on “The West Wing,” is cast here as an avuncular guardian teddy bear.

But Mr. Schiff is convincing in the role, and Mr. Highmore is striking in his. “The Good Doctor” has hardly reinvented the syrupy, tear-jerking medical drama. But it has found a new way to complicate that genre’s oldest idea: that human connection is the best medicine.","On ‘The Good Doctor,’ the Anti-Antihero Is In",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/arts/television/the-good-doctor-freddie-highmore-abc.html

Republican leaders, responding to political pressure to move quickly, defend the process, saying Congress has held dozens of hearings on tax reform in recent years.

Tax bills, by nature complex, are shaped by a galaxy of competing pressures. And withholding details until the final vote as a way of shielding the legislation from special interests is not a new strategy.

Yet several veterans of previous tax battles argue what is different this time is the mix of breakneck speed and enormous scope.

The Congressional Budget Office said on Monday that Congress’s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has not yet had enough time to analyze the full economic impact of the proposals.

One of the plans’ most radical changes is a shift from a worldwide system, where profits are taxed no matter where they are earned, to a territorial system, which exempts profits earned outside the United States. That would bring the American tax system in line with those in most other nations.

Because the switch could end up encouraging American companies to move even more profits offshore to avoid paying any domestic income tax, both the House and Senate versions of the bill impose rules to deter most multinationals with annual revenues of more than $100 million from exploiting such tactics.

But the effort to catch the giants under the new territorial system sets a financial bar that small and medium-size businesses can limbo under. Mr. Shay said accounting firms were likely to start marketing off-the-shelf tax shelters allowing companies to set up foreign offices in low-tax countries like Bermuda or Luxembourg to shrink their tax bills.

“They’re just opening us up to the next round of tax shelters on the international side,” he said. “And the I.R.S., underfunded as it is, isn’t going to be able to check anything.”

At the same time, he said, some safeguards aimed at multinationals could still be bypassed. To reduce their home tax bill, companies like Google and Pfizer, for instance, often relocate patents and copyrights in tax havens and then sell use of that intellectual property back to their American subsidiaries at eye-popping prices. These are the higher-than-normal profits — which Senate bill drafters have cunningly called “Gilti” (for global intangible low-tax income) — that Republican bills are trying to stop from leaking out of the tax system.

View all New York Times newsletters.

Multinationals, though, could avoid some of the Gilti tax by shifting more tangible property like production and research facilities abroad.

Other problems arise from the push to reduce the rate on pass-through businesses (sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations that currently pay taxes at the individual rate). Lawmakers have advertised the cut as relief for smaller businesses, but high-income investors in hedge and private-equity funds could use the provision to reduce the tax paid on rent and interest income by as much as a third.

Hedge-fund investors have an additional opportunity for a windfall with a simple reporting technique, said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and former legislation counsel with the Joint Committee on Taxation. The funds’ decision to mark their trading positions at their market price (instead of their initial purchase price) would enable any gains to qualify for pass-through treatment at the newly reduced rate of 25 percent instead of being treated as short-term capital gains, at a top rate that nears 40 percent.

The pass-through changes present other tax dodges. Benefits for pass-throughs that provide services — like doctors, lawyers and accountants — are supposed to be phased out for individuals with incomes above $75,000 and for married couples with income above $150,000. But a firm could skirt that limit by creating multiple partnerships with different functions, with one providing services, and the other handling, say, licensing or leasing, said Dan Shaviro, a professor of taxation at New York University Law School who helped write the 1986 tax overhaul.

“There is not a single advantage this has, except for students of people like me, who will get paid more to figure out how to game the system,” he said.

Individual proposals that might make sense on their own can also set off unintended consequences when paired together. Although the Senate’s plan to wait until 2019 to cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent has infuriated some shareholders, it saves money so that Congress can reach its budget goals. Some tax experts go further and argue that any cut should be phased in over a 10-year period to smooth out investment and reduce windfall gains.

Yet enacting a 20 percent corporate tax rate to take effect one year in advance while allowing investors to immediately deduct their expenses at 35 percent operates like a subsidy, and could encourage investing in money-losing projects simply for a tax gain.

“That could lead to silly stuff where you have a loss before the tax, but a gain after the tax,” Mr. Shaviro said.

(He offered an example for the mathematically inclined. Normally no one would invest $100 to earn only $90 back. But under the Senate plan, where some business expenses could be immediately deducted at a 35 percent rate, you would get $35 back in 2018. So your actual cost is $65. By the time your $90 earnings are paid in 2019, though, the tax rate would be 20 percent. That would cost you $18 in taxes, and leave $72 in your wallet. So even though your investment lost $10, you are still coming out ahead: with $72 on a net investment of $65.)

Other experts pointed to constantly shifting cost estimates of proposals that suddenly gained or lost tens of billions of dollars overnight.

At the end of 10 years, the very safeguards that are supposed to prevent international tax avoidance actually lose money, according to the Joint Committee’s revenue estimates of the House bill, said Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College. “This is a big giveaway in future years,” she said. “On net, the whole system is ineffective.”

The shortcomings are fixable to some degree, critics say, but the Republican strategy of pushing through a bill without Democratic votes before the end of the year — on tax rules that take effect a few weeks later — will not leave sufficient time.

To some supporters, though, that’s the price of success.

“Will they find things that need to be fixed afterward because the process was moving so fast? Yes,” said Rachelle Bernstein, vice president and tax counsel at the National Retail Federation, which represents big chains like Macy’s and Saks Fifth Avenue.

But there are always technical corrections to tax bills after they pass, Ms. Bernstein said, and retailers have been waiting so long for a corporate rate cut that they don’t mind if it finally happens with an imperfect bill.

“It’s part of how the sausage is made, but it’s better to make this sausage than cut it off,” Ms. Bernstein said.",Haste on Tax Measures May Leave a Trail of Loopholes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/business/economy/corporate-tax.html

In 2010, Russia’s atomic energy agency acquired a controlling stake in Uranium One, a Canadian company that at the time controlled 20 percent of American uranium extraction capacity. The purchase was approved by a government committee that included representatives of nine agencies, including Mrs. Clinton’s State Department.

Donors related to Uranium One and another company it acquired contributed millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, and Bill Clinton received $500,000 from a Russian bank for a speech. But there is no evidence that Mrs. Clinton participated in the government approval of the deal, and her aides have noted that other agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, signed off on it as well. The company’s actual share of American uranium production has been 2 percent; the real benefit for Russia was securing far greater supplies of uranium from Kazakhstan.

Other issues raised by Mr. Goodlatte include Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server, which was investigated by the F.B.I. until the bureau’s then-director, James B. Comey, declared last year that no prosecutor would press charges based on the evidence. Mr. Goodlatte also asked the Justice Department to investigate Mr. Comey for leaking details of his conversations with Mr. Trump after the president fired him.

To the extent that there may be legitimate questions about Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Comey, however, the credibility of any investigation presumably would be called into question should one be authorized by Mr. Sessions or his deputy, Rod J. Rosenstein, because of the way it came about under pressure from Mr. Trump.

There are few if any recent precedents. President George W. Bush did not order an investigation reopened into the fund-raising practices of Al Gore, his vanquished rival, nor did Mr. Obama suggest the Justice Department look again at the Keating Five lobbying case that involved John McCain, whom he defeated. Mr. Obama rebuffed pressure from his liberal base to investigate Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for their actions authorizing the waterboarding of terrorism suspects despite anti-torture laws.

During the Obama administration, the Internal Revenue Service applied extra scrutiny to tax exemptions for conservative nonprofit groups and was accused of politicizing the agency much like President Richard M. Nixon did. But no evidence emerged tying that to Mr. Obama.

Mr. Trump promised during last year’s campaign that if he were elected, he would instruct his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs. Clinton. But he backed off that pledge shortly after the election, saying, “I don’t want to hurt the Clintons.”

By last summer, with Mr. Mueller’s investigation bearing down, he had changed his mind. To Mr. Trump, the investigation was a “witch hunt” based on a “hoax” perpetrated by Democrats. It was all the more galling to him, advisers said, because Mrs. Clinton had not been prosecuted, a frustration exacerbated by recent reports about how her campaign helped finance a dossier of salacious assertions about him.

While presidents typically are not supposed to intervene in investigations or prosecutions of specific individuals, Mr. Trump’s calls for an investigation of Mrs. Clinton over the last several months have been repeated, insistent and not even slightly subtle.

“So why aren’t the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?” he wrote on Twitter in July.

“There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out,” he wrote in October. “DO SOMETHING!”

“At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper,” Mr. Trump wrote again in November. He added: “Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn’t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems.”

Mr. Trump has expressed frustration that he does not control the F.B.I. or Justice Department. By his own account, he fired Mr. Comey while bristling at the Russia investigation that the F.B.I. director was at the time leading. He has also expressed deep anger at Mr. Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing that investigation, resulting in Mr. Mueller’s appointment. Mr. Trump said last summer that he would never have appointed Mr. Sessions had he known he would do that, and he has since refused to rule out firing the attorney general.

With his job potentially on the line, Mr. Sessions has been put in the difficult position of absorbing his president’s ire while safeguarding the department’s traditional independence. Some legal experts said Mr. Boyd’s letter actually may be a way of defusing the situation. By asking career prosecutors to evaluate the evidence, he has a ready-made reason not to appoint a special counsel if they do not recommend one.

“I have no idea what will happen but this letter is entirely consistent with the A.G. later saying, ‘we followed normal process to look in to it and found nothing,’” said Jack L. Goldsmith, a former top Justice Department official under Mr. Bush. “The letter does not tip off or hint one way or another what the A.G.’s decision will be.”

LOS ANGELES — The show apparently goes on.

On Saturday night, as chauffeured S.U.V.’s carrying the likes of Jennifer Lawrence and Steven Spielberg inched through gridlock traffic en route to the Governors Awards, the first major stop on Hollywood’s long march to the Oscars, a question hung in the air: How would attendees handle self-celebration at a time when sexual harassment scandals are engulfing the entertainment industry?

On the presenter list were some of Hollywood’s most outspoken women, including Angelina Jolie, Ava DuVernay and Jessica Chastain. Would the tone be less gleeful than usual? Perhaps the Piper-Heidsieck Brut Champagne would flow a little less freely?

The outcome was perhaps summed up best by a moment during the cocktail hour, when a waiter arrived with a tray of hors d’oeuvres. “Deviled eggs for everyone!” he cheerfully pronounced.

Indeed, the topic of sexual harassment went unmentioned during the formal ceremony, which lasted more than three hours and covered honorary Oscars for the cinematographer Owen Roizman, the actor Donald Sutherland and three directors — Agnès Varda, Charles Burnett and Alejandro G. Iñárritu. The closest anyone came to the elephant in the room was Ms. Jolie, who introduced Ms. Varda, the filmmaker credited with inspiring the French new wave movement with her 1956 film, “La Pointe Courte.”

“We need to draw strength from artists like Agnès,” Ms. Jolie said from the stage. “Those women who went first, who took that first step, showed the way for all of us.”

They often must wait about three months before submitting an official complaint, yet must file one no later than 180 days after the episode. Once filed, victims must submit to up to 30 days of mandatory counseling and complete another 30 days of mediation.

If mediation fails, the person then must wait 30 more days before seeking an administrative hearing or filing a lawsuit in Federal District Court.

“The system is so stacked,” said Debra Katz, a Washington lawyer who often works on sexual harassment cases. “They don’t want people to come forward.”

With such rigid policies, even the most dogged complainants may find no avenue for resolution. In one case, a fellow at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, M. Reese Everson, brought a complaint against a House member to the Office of Compliance. But she said the office told her it could not handle her case because, as a fellow and not a full-time employee, she did not fall under its jurisdiction.

She ended up filing her complaints with the District of Columbia government, where they have languished for over two years.

Few deny the growing sense that Congress is, for many women, a hostile workplace. Last Thursday, the Senate approved a resolution that would create mandatory anti-harassment training for all Senate employees and interns, and would require training every two years. At least two other pieces of legislation that would make the changes even broader are in progress.

Kristin Nicholson, a former chief of staff to Representative Jim Langevin, Democrat of Rhode Island, said Congress had not gone far enough. “We think training needs to be in-person to be more effective,” said Ms. Nicholson, who now directs the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, “and we’re asking for reforms to the opaque process for reporting and resolving harassment claims.”

In interviews, a few who were harassed said they were never even informed of the Office of Compliance’s existence.

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

Rebecca Weir, a 39-year-old lawyer in Washington, had never heard of the office in 2001 when she said former Representative Gary Miller, Republican of California, asked her to twirl for him in his Diamond Bar, Calif., office.

”He said, ‘My God, you look amazing today. Just stunning.’ And he was kind of leering at me, and then he asked me to twirl,” Ms. Weir recalled. “I was stunned, but I was young and dumb and here’s a member of Congress that I’m working for asking me to twirl in his office. So I did.”

Ms. Weir said Mr. Miller’s chief of staff called from Washington soon after with some news.

“‘Well Rebecca, I don’t know what you did, but Gary just called me and said you can have a $1,250 bonus, effective immediately,’” Ms. Weir recalled.

On Monday, a woman who identified herself as Mr. Miller’s wife, Cathy Miller, denied the allegations. “I know my husband,” she said before adding that the claim was “yellow journalism.”

There also was no mandatory training in place on Katherine Cichy’s 27th birthday in 2013. Ms. Cichy, then an aide for now-retired Senator Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota, was walking through Union Station with colleagues when Ms. Cichy’s direct supervisor repeatedly called her “hot.”

Ms. Cichy reported the episode to her chief of staff at the time, who she said made light of it, saying, “It is what it is.”

Months later, Ms. Cichy took a job in another office. The man who harassed her stayed in Mr. Johnson’s office, as did his former chief of staff, Drey Samuelson, who said on Friday that he had warned the offending employee, “I would fire him, and it never happened again.” He said that he did not make light of the episode.

“Bottom line,” Ms. Cichy said, “my boss told me I was hot, and I had to sit in a room every day and work with him. And they didn’t do anything about it. Nothing.”

For female lobbyists, sexual suggestions appear to be part of the price of access.

In her 40 years on the Hill, Laura W. Murphy, the former head of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington legislative office, said she endured a number of sexually suggestive episodes as generations of lawmakers cycled in and out of Congress. In the 1980s, a House member, whose name she would not share, tried to kiss her in the produce aisle at a Capitol Hill grocery store. In the early 2000s, she said a lawmaker asked her for a working dinner, then propositioned her for sex.

“At first it was about work,” Ms. Murphy, 62, said. “But then it devolved into a very blatant overture to have sex.”

Like many women, Ms. Murphy did not report the episodes in part because she believed her career could be negatively affected and because she was not sure where she could turn.

All of the women now coming forward are putting pressure on the Office of Compliance, whose processes date back to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. Between 1997 and 2014, the United States Treasury paid $15.2 million in 235 awards and settlements for Capitol Hill workplace violations under the office’s byzantine procedures, according to a recent Washington Post analysis of the Office of Compliance.

Susan Tsui Grundmann, the office’s executive director, said that the office had received an increase in requests for harassment training in the past two weeks, and that the five-member board had repeatedly recommended since 2010 that Congress put in place regular mandatory harassment training.

Bradford Fitch, president and chief executive of the Congressional Management Foundation, a group that helps lawmakers and staff run their offices, said sexual harassment was vastly underreported in congressional offices.

This has been the case for decades: In 1989, Alice Cain was 22 and three months into a job as a chief of staff’s assistant for Paul Simon, who was then a Democratic senator from Illinois, when one of his top donors groped her and kissed her at a fund-raiser held at a Washington hotel.

Ms. Cain, who is now 50 and works for a nonprofit organization, said that several other women in her office had similar experiences with that donor, whom she declined to name out of respect for his family. But she said it was years before the women spoke to one another about the episodes.

“If I go into my boss’s office and say, ‘Oh, this guy did this to me’ — I don’t want to lose my job,” Ms. Cain said. “I think all of us made that calculation.”

She said she decided to share her story belatedly “for the 22-year-olds now.”

Others are reconsidering past experiences, episodes previously brushed off as playful or not a big deal, that register now as assault.

Hannah Hudson was in her early 20s and working for a Democratic congressman from Oklahoma in 2009 when she was joined on a work trip by staff members from a Republican senator’s office. At a work outing, she said, a senior aide for that senator tried to tug open her wrap dress, which she had pinned closed, asking, “Why are you holding out on us?”

Ms. Hudson, who is now 32 and works as a photographer, did not think to report the episode. She said she tried to brush it off because she felt that what had happened to her was not as bad as what had happened to others.

She does remember feeling grateful when a male colleague who silently witnessed the episode pulled her aside privately to ask if she was all right.

“How much of a patriarchal society do we live in that the person who came up to me in private and said, ‘Oh, are you O.K.?’ is the hero?” she asked.

She paused.

Mr. McConnell’s pronouncement made it clear that the accounts were as good as proven in his eyes and increased the prospect that Mr. Moore would face a significant challenge to joining the Senate even if he prevails in the election on Dec. 12. A parade of new calls from Republican senators for Mr. Moore to bow out followed.

Expelling Mr. Moore could present an advantage to Senate Republicans since it could create a vacancy and set off another special election in Alabama, giving the party a chance to find a new candidate. The uproar over his candidacy is also providing Mr. McConnell and his allies with evidence that the effort to oust establishment Senate Republicans being led by Stephen K. Bannon, the former adviser to President Trump, could be disastrous if Mr. Moore is an example of who they intend to support.

But the fight over Mr. Moore could also elicit a harsh backlash from conservative activists aligned with Mr. Bannon and deepen the party split that is already looming as an obstacle in the 2018 midterm elections.

Republicans are also weighing the potential of a write-in campaign behind an alternative candidate. It worked for Senator Lisa Murkowski in Alaska in 2010, but such successes are exceedingly rare. A write-in campaign by a Republican could split the party vote and bolster the chances of the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor. Mr. Jones could also win outright, a result that could solve many thorny problems for Mr. McConnell but would leave Republicans with one less seat and a narrow 51-49 majority when they are already struggling.

Mr. McConnell does not appreciate such complications. When Mr. Craig was arrested and pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in the airport sting, Mr. McConnell set out to prevent him from even returning to the Capitol to avoid a spectacle. The leadership stripped Mr. Craig of his committee leadership positions and made clear that if he decided to return, he would face additional ethics scrutiny.

Mr. Craig quickly announced he would resign his Senate seat. He then reneged and decided to serve out his term, but the ethics committee admonished him for his behavior and he was treated as an outcast by many of his colleagues.

In the Packwood case, Mr. McConnell delivered findings on the Senate floor, describing his colleague’s “physical coercion” of women and “a habitual pattern of aggressive, blatantly sexual advances, mostly directed at members of his own staff or others whose livelihoods were connected in some way to his power and authority as a senator.” Republicans ultimately lost that seat after Mr. Packwood’s resignation.

“I don’t think there has ever been a leader with a more aggressive no-tolerance policy toward sex abuse allegations,” said Josh Holmes, a former top aide to Mr. McConnell who remains a close adviser. “In his mind, there is no political calculation to make when this kind of thing arises. It’s far more important to protect the integrity of the Senate than the partisan makeup of its membership.”

Yet at this year’s races, on Sunday, the vision of unity carried new weight. The reason was a surprising one: a call for the return of Prime Minister Saad Hariri — Rafik’s son — from Saudi Arabia. He is no more a universally beloved figure than his father was.

But it was the eighth day since he unexpectedly declared his resignation from the Saudi capital, Riyadh. He remains stranded there, widely seen as a captive, literally or figuratively, of his Saudi patrons, a pawn in their efforts to isolate their regional rival, Iran, and its ally, Hezbollah. (He insisted he was “free” in a televised interview.)

When Lebanese politicians declared the marathon a rally for Mr. Hariri’s return, I expected mass rolling of eyes. An axiom of marathon day is that it is a time to set aside politics. But when young men handed out baseball caps reading, “We want our PM back,” many runners put them on.

Billboards showed Mr. Hariri running in last year’s race with the slogans, “We are all waiting for you” and “Running For You.” People snapped selfies with them. Other signs displayed an Arabic hashtag, #WeAreAllSaad.

It was not that people had forgotten that Mr. Hariri presides over a weak government and has failed to win concessions from Hezbollah through confrontation or compromise. Nor had they abandoned the widespread conviction that he and his rivals play on sectarian divisions to keep power and wealth concentrated in the hands of a tiny, largely hereditary political elite.

It was just that enough was enough. Generations of foreign meddling aside, the belief that another country had effectively kidnapped Lebanon’s prime minister was the last straw, and people wanted to see the move backfire. As one commenter put it on Twitter, Lebanon was tired of outside powers acting like it was “not a real place.”

Somehow, a humiliating moment for Lebanon became an occasion for national unity, even pride.

Lebanon’s most earnest slogans are often their own parodies. A perfect example is the hashtag #LiveLoveLebanon, invented by the Ministry of Tourism.

Lebanese social media users quickly embraced it to comment on the country’s beaches (and their scent of sewage), its ski slopes (and mountainside garbage dumps), its wine industry (and hash factories), its swanky (and overcharging) restaurants and its cedar forests (what’s left of them) dating to the Song of Solomon.

The hashtag is used in posts about the country’s resilience and diversity in the face of efforts to divide it from within and without, and also to tag anecdotes about petty corruption and glacial internet speeds.

#WeAreAllSaad is much the same. By definition, politically divided Lebanon is not all Saad.

Even to his mostly Sunni constituents, Mr. Hariri has never matched his father’s charisma or effectiveness. One telling image, a faded poster on a road in the Bekaa Valley, shows him dwarfed by a translucent likeness of his father, a more imposing figure with a much more regal mustache, looming behind him.

It reminds me of Patrick Swayze’s spirit in the movie “Ghost,” hovering vaporously behind Demi Moore at her potter’s wheel.

Yet the fact that Mr. Hariri’s current predicament is seen by many Lebanese as somehow pathetic has not stopped him from becoming a symbol of Lebanese sovereignty. Even the flood of new jokes at his expense do not contradict the point.

Anglophone Lebanese cannot stop playing on “Saad” and “sad.” Journalists have drawn half-joking parallels to the disappearance of Moussa Sadr, the Lebanese Shiite leader who disappeared in Libya, believed kidnapped, in 1976.

After our race, my daughter and I followed some friends, fellow runners, to a cafe at Zaitounay Bay, a seaside development where dozens of gleaming, rarely used yachts are anchored. It is just the kind of glitzy privatization of public space that gets both celebrated and lampooned with the #LiveLoveLebanon hashtag, and an emblem of angst over the elder Hariri’s redevelopment strategy.

Our friend Imad Shehadi, who grew up watching his father run an emergency room in wartime Beirut and is no fan of politicians, explained over breakfast why the marathon meant more this year.

“It’s a mark of defiance against the forces of evil, against the forces on every side that want to interfere with Lebanon,” he said.

“To me it’s more resilience,” his wife, Carla Huijer Shehadi, said. “The resilience of Lebanon and the Lebanese, who just want to live life, no matter what.”

We strolled home along the boardwalk, their boys and my daughter stopping to admire a lavish boat christened “Thanx Dad 4.” We passed the spot where Rafik Hariri’s motorcade was blown up. We followed the marathon route along the seaside corniche, past snack bars and fishermen and picnicking families, toward the place where the American Embassy stood before it was bombed in 1983.

The racecourse went past several civil war massacre sites and refugee camps and the vibrant neighborhoods that cluster at either end of a city no longer physically divided.

The revelations about Louis C.K.","A lot happens in the movie, which repeatedly circles back to the question of whether it’s possible to separate the artist from the art, a question that some are asking now of Louis C.K. For Glen, this takes on extra urgency when China begins an undefined relationship with Leslie, who showers her with attention, shopping with her and sweeping her off to Paris. The first time they talk at length, Leslie even defines radical feminism for China, a scene that mirrors another in which Glen delivers a more generalized feminist lesson. Men explaining equality to a young woman is one provocation; another is that Grace defends sexual relations between teenage girls and adult men.

The other sustained provocation is that “I Love You, Daddy” is partly about the Woody Allen Problem. The film’s black-and-white cinematography is an obvious reference to Mr. Allen’s oft-celebrated 1979 film “Manhattan,” in which he plays a comedy writer having an affair with a 17-year-old girl. The title “I Love You, Daddy” refers to China’s repeated declaration to Glen, but it also seems like a nod at Mr. Allen’s expansive influence on comedy. Louis C.K. himself has been compared to Mr. Allen and he appeared in Mr. Allen’s 2013 drama “Blue Jasmine.” “He’s a very big deal in my life,” Louis C.K. said of being cast in that movie. “Since I was a little kid, I loved Woody Allen.”

Has that love soured? Did it sour in 2014, when Mr. Allen was accused by his daughter, Dylan Farrow, of sexually molesting her? However starkly confessional “I Love You, Daddy” sometimes registers as, it can also be seen as an act of symbolic patricide, a way of addressing a tarnished idol. Shortly before it ends, China turns 18 and offers herself to Leslie, who for the first time seems uninterested in her. Perhaps that’s meant to suggest that he doesn’t actually seduce girls or that China, at 18, is now too old for him. Your interpretation may vary, though it’s worth noting that Leslie later enthuses about how wonderful it is to be “loved by a girl and then be rejected by the woman she becomes.”

The line reminds me of one that Mr. Allen’s character, Isaac, tells the now 18-year-old former girlfriend, Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), toward the end of “Manhattan”: “I just don’t want that thing I like about you to change.” It’s unclear what he means (her beauty, her youth), though earlier Isaac tells Tracy — after passionately kissing her while they’re out one night in a horse-drawn carriage — that she’s “God’s answer to Job” and “would have ended all argument between them.” God, Isaac says while pointing a finger at Tracy, would have said, “I do a lot of terrible things, but I can also make one of these.”

I was 18 when I saw “Manhattan” and I despised it because I knew that its reveries were built on a lie that few adults, including film critics, seemed willing to acknowledge. Perhaps that’s partly why I appreciated “I Love You, Daddy” the first time I saw it. Louis C.K. seemed to be pointing at Mr. Allen with a queasy homage that was getting at the truth of “Manhattan” even as “I Love You, Daddy” circled — and circled — its own creator’s complicity in female exploitation. The two ideas converge late in the film when Glen meets Leslie, who reveals that he hasn’t seen China in a long time. That’s when Leslie dreamily shares his philosophy about loving girls only to be rejected by the women they become.

It’s an unnerving scene, one that doubtless speaks to how some men view women, but it also speaks, I think, to how the movies see women. How they use and use up young women, at least until they turn 18 or 20 or so when some moviemaker or some suit deems her no longer desirable and turns her putative lack of desirability on her, as if she were responsible for this lack of interest in her. When I watched “I Love You, Daddy” a second time, the jokes no longer landed; its shocks felt uglier, cruder. But for once a filmmaker seemed to be admitting to the misogyny that we know is always there and has often been denied or simply waved off, at times in the name of art.

Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the U.S.D.A. who also spoke on behalf of Ms. Adcock, said she had not violated her ethics agreement by meeting with her former industry allies. He also denied that Ms. Adcock had discussed issues related to her previous lobbying at the meeting, or that she had suggested that her deregulation team would be swamped by lobbyists if names of its members were released.

“The career ethics officers at U.S.D.A. agree that this is not a violation of the ethics agreement that Rebeckah Adcock signed,” said Mr. Murtaugh, citing a 2009 memo by the Office of Government Ethics.

Others dispute that interpretation of the memo; the ethics office declined to say whether the memo applied to the meeting, citing its policy not to discuss individual cases.

Ms. Adcock is scheduled to appear Tuesday before subcommittees of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which is tracking Mr. Trump’s deregulation effort. In announcing the hearing, the committee, led by Republicans, applauded the deregulation teams for making an “unprecedented reduction in the federal regulatory footprint.”

Republican members of the committee declined to comment about Ms. Adcock’s activities. Representative Elijah E. Cummings, the top Democrat on the committee, said that if Ms. Adcock had violated her ethics agreement, it contributed “to a troubling pattern of President Trump’s failure to ‘drain the swamp.’”

In February, Mr. Trump ordered major federal agencies to set up the deregulation teams, to fulfill a campaign promise to cut red tape for businesses. Corporations and industry groups quickly hired lawyers, lobbyists and economists to help them influence the process with billions of dollars at stake. The regulations under review cover a range of subjects, including the cleanliness of drinking water and the safety of highways.

The Trump administration has declined to make public the names of many members of the teams. It has also generally not provided records related to the teams’ calendars and correspondence.

A joint investigation published in July by The Times and ProPublica found that the teams included former employees of industry-financed organizations that oppose environmental regulations; lawyers who have represented companies in cases against federal regulators; and staff members of so-called political dark-money groups. Some are reviewing rules that their previous employers sought to weaken or kill, and at least two may be positioned to profit personally if certain regulations are undone. In all, the two news organizations have identified 112 current and former team members, including 41 with potential conflicts.

At the meeting on Capitol Hill in September, Ms. Adcock lamented the scrutiny that her team was under, a House aide familiar with the exchange said. Ms. Adcock cited, in particular, public records requests for calendars and emails.

The Times and ProPublica asked for those records this year and have received only a few. Most other federal agencies have been similarly unresponsive. The visitor logs that have been obtained are often handwritten sign-in sheets. They appear to show only a fraction of meetings, and many are illegible. It is not known from the logs, for example, if Ms. Adcock or her team had met with environmental or science groups in addition to the industry representatives.

In response to questions from reporters about possible conflicts of interest, agency officials across the government have said the deregulation teams are abiding by strict ethical standards, including rules that bar them from working on issues directly affecting recent employers.

Records received through a Freedom of Information Act request show that Ms. Adcock entered such an agreement on April 26, pledging that she would “not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties in which I know CropLife America is a party or represents a party” for a year.

But in May, Kellie Bray, a lobbyist for CropLife, arrived for a meeting with Ms. Adcock, according to the visitor logs.

The two knew each other well. From 2010 to early this year, Ms. Adcock and Ms. Bray lobbied together for CropLife, which represents Syngenta and Monsanto, among other pesticide makers.

Disclosure records show that during those years the two advocated for the industry’s agenda at agencies, including the U.S.D.A. and the Environmental Protection Agency, and in Congress. They pushed CropLife’s interests on bills and regulations relating to the impact of pesticides on water and human health.

Ms. Adcock’s departure from CropLife left the trade association short a seasoned lobbyist, but gave it a valuable contact in the top ranks of the U.S.D.A.

Ms. Bray said in an interview that in May, Ms. Adcock had met with her and the Southern Crop Production Association, a CropLife affiliate. Ms. Bray said she had sat in on the meeting but hadn’t talked.

“I facilitated the introduction,” she said. “That is all.”

After the meeting, the Southern Crop Production Association, which represents pesticide manufacturers, formulators and distributors across the South, said on its website that “Rebeckah has an exceptional understanding regarding the many issues facing agriculture due, in large part, to her previous position with CLA,” using the acronym for CropLife America.

Among the topics discussed, according to the trade group’s website, were the tests that pesticides must undergo to prove they are safe and rules governing their use near water sources. The trade group did not respond to requests for comment. Ms. Bray confirmed that the group had discussed regulations about the use of pesticides near water.

Discussing policy related to the impact of pesticides on water is deemed off limits under Ms. Adcock’s ethics agreement. Mr. Murtaugh, the U.S.D.A. spokesman, said Ms. Adcock disputed that she had discussed any off-limits subject.

“If any participant declared concern regarding any issue precluded by Ms. Adcock’s agreement, she politely and firmly instructed them it was not a matter she could discuss or assist with,” he said.

He also said Ms. Adcock had instructed Ms. Bray not to participate in the meeting and did not recall her being in the room.

Mr. Murtaugh said a provision in the memorandum from the Office of Government Ethics allowed an appointee like Ms. Adcock to attend meetings with a former employer or client so long as five or more other stakeholders participated. In the May meeting, he said, four of the Southern Crop Production Association representatives were affiliated with individual companies: Syngenta, Albaugh, Triangle Chemical and Crop Production Services.

However, three of those companies are also members of the CropLife trade group, Ms. Adcock’s former employer. And they were attending in their capacity as the executive committee of the Southern Crop Production Association, according to the association’s website, not as individual company executives.

Walter M. Shaub Jr., who headed the Office of Government Ethics under President Barack Obama and during the early months of the Trump administration, said the provision cited by the U.S.D.A. did not apply to the ethics regulation in Ms. Adcock’s agreement. Even if it did apply, he said, the meeting lacked a necessary diversity because the participants were all affiliated with one trade group. He also said it was irrelevant that Ms. Bray hadn’t spoken.

“If she brought them there, signed into the sign-in log, attended the meeting that she may or may not have set up, it definitely counts as a meeting with her,” said Mr. Shaub, who has been critical of the Trump administration.

Before Ms. Adcock worked at CropLife, she served as a lobbyist for the farming industry at the American Farm Bureau Federation. Among its donors is Farm Credit, a lending institution. In July, Ms. Adcock met with a delegation from Farm Credit, according to a participant.

One of the executives who attended — Jeremy Brown, president of Broadview Agriculture, a Texas cotton producer — said in an interview that he knew Ms. Adcock from the Farm Bureau. For those who did not know her, Ms. Adcock explained her past lobbying on behalf of the farming industry, and she asked for recommendations on regulatory changes, he said.

“Any time you have people already familiar with the industry, it helps,” Mr. Brown said. “They can hopefully get their feet on the ground and get the work in.”

He said he had pushed Ms. Adcock to get cottonseed reclassified as an oil seed crop so cotton producers could be eligible again for certain government subsidies if revenue dropped. He also discussed what he termed overreach on clean-water rules.

“She was taking notes, being really receptive,” Mr. Brown said.

Another highlight, he said, was the access the group enjoyed. Never before had he attended a meeting in the private gathering room just outside the office of the secretary of agriculture.

If Trump falls, is it Trump the realist who falls or Trump the “Jacksonian” hawk?
Still, at some point a new synthesis needs a bold politician or politicians to actually champion it, the way Trump himself sort of did.
They’re closer to Trumpism or Bannonism or whatever on domestic policy, but not on foreign policy.","Douthat: I agree that he’s raised those questions, Dan, but he did that during the campaign, too. In some sense people assume that campaigns pose questions and that administrations supply answers. And at the very least, one answer this administration has supplied is that personnel is policy, and that if you don’t have people standing by and ready to implement an agenda, it doesn’t matter what you campaigned on — you’ll get bog-standard pre-Trump Republicanism, whatever rhetorical gloss you put on it.

Olsen: That’s certainly true for the economic policy agenda. No one tasked with administering policy in any of those areas is supportive of a new approach. So they’re giving the president either small-government conservative options (like Mick Mulvaney at the Office of Management and Budget), business-G.O.P. choices or a hybrid of the two (almost everyone else). Immigration policy is the one exception, but that’s also the area where Trump’s ideas already overlapped with a significant Republican faction’s approach. I often imagine that Trump has these instincts and no one around him with knowledge wants to go there, so he gets options that don’t come close to matching what he campaigned on.

McCarthy: We’ve seen other candidates, even a Democratic president, champion a different kind of foreign policy — more restrained or at least less fixated on “exporting democracy” — in recent years. Two Republicans named Paul (Ron and Rand) advanced ideas in that vein, and Barack Obama was elected as a foreign-policy reformist. But their softer, more cerebral approaches didn’t shake up the way Washington thinks about the world nearly as much as Donald Trump has done. The “shambolic” quality of Trump is precisely what is opening up these questions in a way that posing them intellectually never seemed to do.

Douthat: So where do you see this shake-up happening most, Dan? Is it happening in think tanks and other institutions? Among the people Trump has appointed (to the extent he has appointed them) to staff the State Department and Defense Departments? It seemed like Obama did create a faction within the Democratic foreign policy establishment, or at least within his White House, that was committed to an Obama-ism defined in part by its resistance to hawkishness and interventionism. Is such a faction coming into being on the right outside the realist and paleocon periodicals?

McCarthy: It’s happening at every level. It’s significant that National Review has hired more foreign-policy realists or noninterventionists recently, such as my old American Conservative colleague Michael Brendan Dougherty. Among congressmen and think-tank types that I talk to in D.C., I find much more questioning about the purposes and instruments of United States foreign policy than I did before. Not all of that is because of Trump, but he’s accelerated it. As yet, though, there’s no single institution that really embodies the new questions, let alone systematic answers. American Affairs has broached them, but I find the foreign-policy views there less penetrating than the rest of the journal.

Douthat: And Henry, from your more pessimistic perspective, are any Trumpist or populist ideas gaining traction within the G.O.P. but outside the White House? It seems to me that many of the ideas for a more middle-class agenda that you and I share already have a lot of support within the conservative commentariat. But that’s been true for a while now, really since the Tea Party wave ebbed. What’s been missing is a sense among Republican politicians that these proposals — even something with as much support as a larger child-tax credit — should be the center of their agenda rather than just window dressing for the usual upper-bracket or business tax cuts. On the evidence of the new tax legislation, that’s still true — but does it have to be?

Olsen: The G.O.P. remains intellectually wedded to dying dogma. The congressional party really wants to do nothing other than cut taxes for businesspeople and the top bracket based on what can only be called religious devotion to supply-side theory. I do not think they represent their voters, and Trump’s nomination is proof of that. I think it will take a big defeat, though, before mainstream Republican pols start to realize the old ways aren’t politically sustainable. Just the sort of defeat that an inept reaction to last week’s election thrashing would create — and, boy, it sure looks like the first reaction might be exactly that!

Douthat: And yet in Steve Bannon, you have someone with real prominence who keeps saying that the party needs to change in something like the direction that you advocate — who talks about building a “workers’ party,” ditching libertarianism and even doing outreach to minority voters with economic-nationalist themes. But then when it comes to the specifics of his strategy, Bannon always seems more inclined toward seeking out racialized cultural fights, or linking himself to substance-free resentment vehicles like Roy Moore, than toward pursuing the economic-policy shift he’s officially in favor of accomplishing. What do you think of the frequent liberal argument that this is a problem inherent to right-wing populism — that the lurches toward race-baiting are inescapable, that the effort to build a pan-ethnic conservative populism is foredoomed?

Olsen: We have to remember that Bannon is really a political newbie, and one who doesn’t like or really “get” the Republican Party to begin with. So he has been very ineffective inside or outside at promoting a positive agenda that can work within the existing G.O.P. His primary challenge strategy is basically one that creates an alliance with the Tea Party groups but ignores the real political differences populists ought to have with them. So he will be forced to either avoid those differences in the candidates he backs, which means they will campaign only on immigration and Muslim terrorism, or he’ll let them go whole Tea Party, or they’ll just attack Mitch McConnell and “the establishment” on a contentless, personal campaign. None of those approaches will build real support for a workers’ party. A serious attempt to do that requires a language of citizenship rather than resentment and a policy agenda beyond “let’s get the foreigners.” Unless and until he does that, Bannon will continue to be suspected of simply peddling racialized populism.

McCarthy: If I can add to Henry’s point, the line between right-wing media and politics has blurred to the point where we can’t tell if Bannon is a media figure aiming for ratings and clicks or a political figure aiming for policy and elections. Trump seemed like a media figure — and then he became president. I used to think Fox News and talk radio were Pied Pipers getting Republican voters to support Bush-type politicians who were actually a bad fit for those right-leaning voters. But now the right-wing populist media isn’t doing anyone’s bidding — and in fact, politicians may be helpless before it, for good or ill.

Douthat: But Bannon was, for a brief time, trying to actually be a political figure, trying to work inside the White House, inside the system, to advance Trumpism. And while he was there he didn’t do much to advance Henry’s economic-populist vision, or his own promise of a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill.

Olsen: Bannon’s economic populism really consists of two things: restrict trade and restrict immigration. That’s got loads of problems, not the last of which is that trade helps many workers, too. And it takes the business-conservative faction inside the G.O.P. head on without sufficient support from the broader Tea Party wing, at least on trade. So he was always going to have a terrible time on that unless Trump was willing to tell aides who don’t agree with him to just do something specific that Trump probably doesn’t know enough to describe. The G.O.P. will become a workers’ party only when enough people within it see both the justice and the necessity of it becoming so — and that is still a ways off.

Douthat: But Bannon did fight a bunch of battles on your territory, Dan — taking the less interventionist line on a range of issues, from Syria to Afghanistan to maybe North Korea. And he lost most of those battles, not to the ideological neoconservative types, but mostly just to Trump’s generals. So we’ve ended up with a foreign policy in which the generals are the custodians of the foreign policy status quo, right?

McCarthy: You’re right that Bannon is serious about policy, Ross, in his way. When it comes to blurring the line, I should emphasize I don’t mean that Bannonism is “fake politics.” It’s real, but it’s radically different from the politics we’re used to. It’s a new hybrid: a media-political entity. Democrats thought that Ronald Reagan was such a thing, but this time it’s come true. As for the generals, they’re not advancing a grand ideological program in foreign policy, although they may be loyal to the ghost of one simply by force of inertia. They’re keeping up a degree of surface continuity, but the foundations of our policy have been called into question. You’re right that that’s not enough, but it’s where deep change has to start.

Douthat: O.K. — but then who follows it through? Trump is president, we assume, for another three years, and then he (presumably) will run for re-election. As long as he’s bestriding the Republican world, it seems that no G.O.P. politician is going to emerge as a clear champion of the next Republicanism, whatever it might be. Or maybe that’s wrong. But it seems to me that he has only a few figures right now who are even would-be heirs — Tom Cotton certainly (whose foreign policy views I suspect you strongly dislike, Dan) and maybe even Ivanka Trump, depending on her ambitions, but beyond them nobody obvious at all.

Olsen: True, but it takes only one to start something. Fear, and a lack of policy-specific work in a host of specific areas, are the major things holding back the next iteration of conservatism, and fear is by far the largest. Once pols start taking the leap, however, and see they get cheers from voters, the numbers will start to swell. The fact is there are very few Republican voters who really care about the issues the party’s donors and the Wall Street Journal editorial board are pushing. Had any establishment Republican — say, Scott Walker or John Kasich — been willing to explore these themes, they would have pre-empted Trump and the rest of the field. There is a large market for a conservative-populist party, which is exactly what Reagan tried to create during his lifetime.

McCarthy: What Trump has done is to re-politicize basic questions of policy, including foreign policy, that for a long time had been the domain of a narrow range of expert opinion. When it comes to who follows through, I don’t think we should be looking for a single figure, we should be looking rather for a national discussion, a political discussion, throughout our institutions. There’s no blueprint, as some of my realist friends in the academy sometimes seem to believe, that can be smoothly applied to create a new foreign policy. There has to be political give and take — ”political” in the broad sense, in the media as well as in Congress, and among the public. Once Trump no longer personally bestrides the Republican scene, there will be a whole host of squirming and wriggling new mutations evolving their way out of the new environment — I just couldn’t guess what’ll they look like when they’ve all grown up.

Douthat: But do you worry at all, Dan (and this goes for you too, Henry), that if Trump is perceived as a crashing failure — or for that matter if he’s somehow ejected from office — that the ideas that you think he’s tacitly championed will be seen as inherently tainted and discredited as well, even or especially among the people who might otherwise be interested in taking them up, in having the kind of conversation you envision?

I share a lot of your views, I think, when it comes to the intellectual bankruptcy and persistent failure of the Western elite. But I also don’t underestimate that elite’s capacity to retain a hold on power when their critics are self-marginalizing or self-destructive. And among my many concerns about Trump from the first was that he would discredit even the good ideas that I do think he’s elevated, both by associating them with darker tendencies (realism with xenophobia, populism with racism) and by associating them with simple incompetence.

Olsen: Yes, there is that risk, but in one sense the fact that Trump has really abandoned populist domestic policy helps to insulate that against his implosion. Someone who tackles trade in the way it should be, encouraging fair trade and providing real adjustment support for workers subject to global pressures, isn’t really engaging Trump. Anyone who says, “Let’s cut payroll taxes, not corporate taxes” is plowing new ground. And so on. Immigration restriction would be a policy that is tainted by Trump failure, but the fact is pure Trumpism is D.O.A. on that score, too. Immigration restriction will become law only as part of a larger deal that is much more like what Tom Cotton proposes than what Ann Coulter promotes.

McCarthy: In part I’m not worried about what you describe, Ross, precisely because Trumpism is so inchoate. If Trump falls, is it Trump the realist who falls or Trump the “Jacksonian” hawk? But more important, politics should carry precisely these risks. It’s not that you want to be indifferent to your associations, but ultimately you can’t think you’ll curry favor with everyone and offend no one — that’s an anti-political ideal.

Douthat: Yes, and I do think the problems in the West run deep enough that Trumpism’s association with Trump, even if he’s seen as catastrophic, will not prevent these ideas from returning to the surface in some form.

McCarthy: We can also look at past examples: When Barry Goldwater was blown out in 1964, pundits were certain that conservatism (Goldwater-style) was permanently discredited. The joke was on them.

Olsen: Well, if you had asked that question about conservatism generally on Oct. 26, 1964, you would have had to say no. But then Reagan gave his “A Time for Choosing” speech on Oct. 27. American politics is very fluid and open, and it doesn’t take much or very long for someone to break through.

Douthat: Yes, I thought that if Trump had lost, there would have been room for someone smart to step up and play Reagan to his Goldwater — to give a big speech embracing some of his themes, promising to carry the cause forward, and so on, and claim the mantle away from the island-of-misfit-toys figures who attached themselves to Trump’s campaign. But Reagan, of course, was not an officeholder at the point when he gave his speech. So perhaps it would have needed to be someone out of politics, because Republican officeholders are so timorous.

But I am not at all convinced that having Trump be the president is helpful to the process of finding Trumpism’s Reagan (unless it turns out to the Rock), to that process, since it seems to me to be trapping the Republican politicians who should be arguing and experimenting on all these fronts. And I also feel that we’ve all been having these conversations, in our world of punditry, since the crackup of the Bush administration 10 years ago now, without having anyone except Trump really taking up the ideas that they imply.

McCarthy: The world of punditry has been having the conversation at some levels, and you’re plugged into them, Ross. But you never before had someone expressing the views that, say, Tucker Carlson now routinely does, in prime time on Fox. The conversation is becoming a public one in a way that it had not been before: It was very narrowly restricted to a few thinkers ahead of the curve.

Douthat: Fair enough! Still, at some point a new synthesis needs a bold politician or politicians to actually champion it, the way Trump himself sort of did. We journalists have described the world of conservatism, but the point is to change it. So at the risk of trying too hard to pin you guys down: Is there any right-of-center political figure, now on the American scene, who gives you hope for the G.O.P. after Trump? (I’ll offer my own non-answer after yours.)

McCarthy: There are plenty of Republicans who are smart and principled and in some respects forward-thinking, but who nonetheless seem to be pre-Trump figures — I have in mind Mike Lee and Rand Paul in particular. Whether they become more or less salient post-Trump is something I’m interested to see. My guess is that the really salient figures will be newer ones who aren’t yet on my radar.

Olsen: The conservative-populist alliance is increasingly becoming obviously the only way forward for non-Social Democrats who don’t want to become catchall centrists like Emmanuel Macron or Justin Trudeau. It is the $1,000 bill lying on the ground waiting for someone to pick it up. Eventually, someone will. I think Cotton is farthest along in pursuing it. Nikki Haley is more hawkish than Dan will like, but she would be very well positioned to take up that mantle if she were to leave the United Nations after 2018 and become more of an “all purpose” political figure. We also need more pundits to show some courage, too. Conservatism itself needs to be redefined, and you can’t create a revolution of the heart and the mind simply by adding a couple of tweaks here and there. That’s triangulation, and triangulation always disappoints.

McCarthy: I agree with Henry. Haley is not someone I’m fond of, and neither is Tom Cotton, but they’ve both acclimated themselves to the Trump era very effectively. I hope Republican realists can adapt as well. That will require them to be a bit more right-wing or populist in their mass appeal; for too long, they’ve been too wonkish and above-the-fray.

Douthat: My sense of things is that on the domestic front, you have a lot of different Republican figures who have sympathy for a genuinely populist agenda, ranging from Cotton to Marco Rubio to Mike Lee and others.

Olsen: Sympathy for some aspects, yes. But the populist mind-set starts, as it did with Reagan, with the average person as your touchstone. Rubio, like most Republicans, always talks about the striver, the person who wants to get ahead. His dad’s stint as a bartender, for example, seems to have value for him because it led to his being able to go to college, not because it was worthy in and of itself. That’s just not the way to think about economic populism, so it’s not too surprising to me that he remains distinctly orthodox in what he’s willing to do.

Douthat: Yes, I agree: Even now, figures like Cotton and Rubio are wary of going too far with it, of getting too far away from Reaganite orthodoxy. Neither of them are likely to (for instance) blow up the tax bill because it isn’t friendly enough to the middle class, the way Ted Cruz blew up various deals to build his brand. They’re not sure there’s enough support there for strong populism, as opposed to populist gestures.

Olsen: I regretfully agree that no one who seems sympathetic to populism is willing to blow up the tax bill, but they might not have to: They might be correctly figuring that Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, John McCain or Bob Corker will do it for them first.

Douthat: But then on foreign policy, the fact is that most of these proto-populists (with the exception of Lee) are also more hawkish, not less, than the Republican norm. They’re closer to Trumpism or Bannonism or whatever on domestic policy, but not on foreign policy. Which was what made Trump so distinctive: He combined ideas that go together in the minds of many voters, but not in the mind of Republican elites. I sometimes liked to say, before 2016, that the G.O.P. needed a synthesis of Rubio and Rand Paul, and that’s strangely part of what Trump’s campaign delivered. But I am much more skeptical than you, Dan, that this synthesis has gained ground since.

McCarthy: Ross, I don’t really agree that Rubio, for example, is close to Trump on domestic policy. And I think there are different senses of populist and distinctly different ideas of what a middle-class economic policy looks like. I’ve found it telling, actually, that the “other side” from me, who tend to be aligned with neoconservatives in foreign policy, talk a lot about tax-code tweaks and measures that might be intended to foster a “pro-family” welfare state, but they rarely if ever get into industrial policy. Whereas the populists I’m more sympathetic to in foreign policy, including Trump and Bannon and, in the classic case, Pat Buchanan, do seem interested in trade and industry. Even “libertarian populists” like Ron Paul, interestingly enough, tend to make hay about the iniquities of Nafta while not, of course, favoring tariffs.

Douthat: Those are both fair points. I agree that Trump went much further than Rubio or any broader “reform conservatism” in questioning the foundations of economic policy. And certainly immigration is a big dividing line, and a place where someone like Cotton has separated himself from those would-be reforming Republicans who still back the Bush-era elite-Republican consensus. But at the same time the Rubio-Ivanka partnership on family policy is basically the only place where Trump’s campaign promises have had even a modest effect on Republican negotiations on Capitol Hill.

Any last words?

Olsen: Conservative-populism will only come about when a group of Republicans decide they want it. Anyone who seriously looks at popular opinion should realize that the business-Jeb approach is D.O.A. within the party and won’t gain enough millennial or minority voters in any event. Cruz-Flake-Paul-style conservatism is deader than Jacob Marley. Someone reading this exchange will see the logic of a conservative-populist alliance, just as an on-the-decline actor was reading Human Events and National Review back in the 1950s but had enough common sense to see how it could be blended with something else to really take off. Our time will come, and much sooner than most pundits think.

McCarthy: Your point about Capitol Hill is well taken, Ross, but then, that’s why Bannon is unleashing primary attacks against Republican incumbents. We still have a Bush-Republican Congress, and the next phase of the Trump insurgency, or the populist insurgency, will be to storm the House and Senate. I’ve said in other venues that in some ways the “revolution” was premature, it happened right at the top, at the presidential level, before lower levels of politics had been changed or any outside institutional support structure was in place. But you have to take what you get, and not imagine the world will play to your plans.

LOS ANGELES — Score two for old-fashioned star power.

A pair of new wide-release movies, “Daddy’s Home 2” and “Murder on the Orient Express,” both of which rely on starry ensembles, arrived to stronger-than-expected ticket sales in North American theaters over the weekend. Although neither could topple “Thor: Ragnarok,” which remained No. 1 for a second week, the sturdy results for “Daddy’s Home 2” and “Murder on the Orient Express” gave Hollywood hope that its formulas may not be as broken as many had started to believe.

“Thor: Ragnarok” (Walt Disney Studios) collected an estimated $56.6 million, for a two-week domestic total of $211.6 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. Disney said the Marvel-branded superhero movie has now taken in $650.1 million worldwide.

Second place went to “Daddy’s Home 2,” which took in about $30 million, or roughly 20 percent more than analysts had expected before release. On the downside, the PG-13 comedy was expensive, costing about $70 million to produce. “Daddy’s Home 2,” starring Mark Wahlberg, Mel Gibson, Will Ferrell and John Lithgow, received poor reviews but clicked with audiences, who gave it an A-minus grade in CinemaScore exit polls. More than 50 percent of the audience was over age 35.

Even so, it will take much more than one box office win to stabilize Paramount, which has suffered a string of misfires, including “Suburbicon,” “Mother!,” “Monster Trucks” and “Baywatch.” Last week, the studio, which ranks last among Hollywood’s major studios in domestic market share, parted ways with its marketing and distribution chief.

In “The Exterminating Angel,” based on the 1962 Luis Buñuel film, Ms. Luna plays Leticia, an opera diva who is part of a blue-bloods dinner party, the guests of which find themselves mysteriously unable to leave at the end of the evening. The vocal demands are a workout for almost every performer onstage.

“The note,” Mr. Adès said, “the range, the tessitura, is a metaphor for the ability to transcend these psychological and invisible boundaries that have grown up around them.”

Adding to the excitement of the high A is its placement in the score. Unlike in other high-flying parts — the imperious Queen of the Night in “The Magic Flute,” the spunky Zerbinetta in “Ariadne auf Naxos,” the long-suffering title role in “Lucia di Lammermoor” — there’s little time for Ms. Luna to warm up: The A is her very first note, sung before she’s even visible onstage. (She sings it again a short time later, as the party guests, in a surreal portent, leave the stage and re-enter.)

“It’s a moment of arrival,” Mr. Adès said. “It had to be on this note.”

Growing up in Oregon, Ms. Luna sang the daunting Queen of the Night when she was still in high school “just because it was fun,” she said. “And I liked the sensation it made in my bones, in my head, in my sinuses. It just gave me a high. It still gives me a high.”

Her topmost register is unusually lucid and effortless. Even in those notes unattainable by most other sopranos, and even when those notes are held far longer than the pecks requested by most other composers, Ms. Luna’s tone is full. She manages to avoid shrillness in what she aptly calls the “Wagnerian coloratura spectacle” that is her final “Exterminating Angel” aria, a flood of sustained superhigh sound up to F.

Even if nothing in previous Met history has equaled her high A, other singers have come close, sometimes adding unwritten interpolations and transpositions to show off their personal stratospheres. A number of the highest notes in Met history have emerged from sopranos singing the title part in “Lucia di Lammermoor”; it’s no coincidence that this is the role Ms. Luna’s character performs just before the dinner party at the start of “The Exterminating Angel.”

Ellen Beach Yaw, born near Buffalo in 1869, sang a G above C as Lucia in her single Met performance in 1908. The review in The New York Times praised her “flutelike Santos-Dumont notes,” comparing her to a Brazilian aviation pioneer, and added, in a reference to a Wild West gunslinger: “She hit that high G as promised, but it is like Bat Masterson hitting a tomato can with a .44 at four paces.”

The celebrated French soprano Lily Pons sustained a high F in the final mad scene from “Lucia” — sung, at her Met debut in 1931, “in legitimate note, not bird whistles or falsetto,” according to The New York Post. At the turn of the 20th century, Sibyl Sanderson, as Massenet’s Manon, hit a G, known as her “Eiffel Tower note.” Mado Robin, a French coloratura, was recorded shrilling up to a B flat, but she never sang at the Met.

More recently, Natalie Dessay was known in New York for her crystal-clear G’s as the mechanical doll Olympia in Offenbach’s “Les Contes d’Hoffmann.” Just this fall, Erin Morley’s Olympia ornaments brought her up to A flat, a feat Rachele Gilmore achieved in the role at the Met in 2009.

The company admits it is possible that an even higher note could have slipped through the archival cracks. “There’s no record keeping of such things, especially of improvised stuff,” said Peter Clark, the Met’s archivist, who remembers hearing Pons’s F on a radio broadcast as a child. “So it’s not to say that in 1908, say, something higher didn’t happen. But I doubt that it wouldn’t be mentioned somewhere.”

“The Exterminating Angel” isn’t the first time Mr. Adès has pushed a singer to extremes, nor was “The Tempest.” In fact, one of his very first works, “Five Eliot Landscapes” for soprano and piano, from 1990, ends on a sustained G flat.

“It’s a certain amount of useful cruelty involved,” he said with a chuckle, before correcting himself. “Not cruelty, but the callowness of youth.”

Callow or not, he’s still at it. Mr. Adès said that in the score of “The Tempest,” which had its premiere in London in 2004, he had placed a high G in brackets, indicating a note that at the time he only dreamed of hearing.

When she sang the part at the Met, Ms. Luna could reach the G. Now, more than a decade later, the score of “The Exterminating Angel” has a high B in brackets — yet another seemingly impossible note, waiting patiently for a soprano who can crack yet another music-stave ceiling.","At the Met Opera, a Note So High, It’s Never Been Sung Before",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/arts/music/metropolitan-opera-high-note-exterminating-angel.html

This wish was at once selfless and self-protecting: Beau couldn’t bear the thought of his illness derailing his father’s political aspirations. Biden understood this. He went with it. The whole family did. Dreaming of 2016, he writes, sometimes became a kind of performance, a family diversion: “It was as if we were all keeping up an elaborate and needful charade.”

This charade also happened to suit Biden. Entertaining a presidential bid during those dark days gave him meaning, “a way to defy the fates.” And part of him obviously wanted to run.

Biden’s life was full of surreal juxtapositions during Beau’s illness. One minute, he was sitting at his son’s bedside in the hospital; the next, he was in a specially designated room nearby, talking to the prime minister of Iraq. The work focused him, allowing him to contain his feelings. But those feelings would heave to the surface in private. On March 29, 2015, as Air Force Two was taking off, he wrote in his diary that he felt buoyed and hopeful. A few hours later, he added three staccato sentences. Just landed. 6:07. I feel so goddam lonely.

These flashes of vulnerability are part of what makes “Promise Me, Dad” memorable; so, too, are the small, tender interactions between Biden and his dying son. “Guess who was at the office today?” Biden asked Beau one night. Elton John. “You remember when I used to drive you and Hunt to school? That song we would all sing together, the three of us, as loud as we could?” Beau couldn’t answer by then; he was no longer capable of speech. But he smiled. So Biden sang as much of “Crocodile Rock” as he could remember.

Soon after he was first elected to the Senate in 1972, Biden’s wife, Neilia, and 13-month-old daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car accident. He has a great, unwanted body of expertise in coping with loss. “Promise Me, Dad” shows that he’s willing to make use of it. Imparting what he knows about bereavement is part of his legacy now.

He gives his philosophy of the eulogy. He shares tricks he’s learned about how to bear up and survive the earliest days of mourning. When he speaks at funerals and memorials, he writes, he often gives his private phone number to the grieving. “When you’re down and you feel guilty for burdening your family and friends,” he tells them, “pick up the phone and call.” Some do.

It’s to Biden’s credit that you don’t really question these anecdotes. He may be a bit excitable, a bit of a windbag. But anyone who’s ever covered Congress (I did, for a while) can discern on the page what was discernible in real life: the bartender aspect of Biden’s character, the natural convener who reads customers well enough to put them at ease. He’s always understood that the political is personal.

Which leads to the inevitable question: Is “Promise Me, Dad” secretly a campaign book?

The way he repeatedly recounts his accomplishments and expertise certainly suggests he’s thinking about a 2020 run, as does the way he finds multiple excuses to invoke his middle-class bona fides. His advisers, he pointedly tells us, concluded in 2015 that his reputation as a “gaffe machine” was no longer a liability. “Authenticity matters,” one of them wrote.

The suggestion being that he’s Trump minus the Trump.

For Biden, the heart of 2015 contained a paradox. He faced tremendous pressure inside his own home to run for president, for Beau’s sake. But outside his home, the pressure for him to run didn’t reach its peak until after Beau died, the very moment he was least able to handle the strains of a national campaign. Yet that was when many of his former colleagues from the Senate urged him to jump in. That was when George Clooney got in touch and offered to raise money.

And then Hillary Clinton lost — in many of the states where Biden appeared to poll well.

It must have been a powerful formula for regret. Even if, as Barack Obama suspected, Clinton had the nomination sewn up. Obama had discouraged Biden from making the leap from the start.

So Biden ends his book outlining the agenda for the 2016 presidential campaign he never ran. It’s an unrealized story, vibrantly alive on the page but not in the world. Just like Beau. It’s all tied up with Beau.","In Joe Biden’s Memoir, Private Grief and Its Effect on a Public Life",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/books/review-joe-biden-promise-me-dad-memoir.html

The school did not reply to questions about the case, including whether the administration was aware of the trooper’s conclusion. The academy recently entered into an agreement with the police to comply with state reporting requirements, and go beyond them.

Like St. Paul’s School in Concord, N.H.; St. George’s School in Middletown, R.I.; Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass.; Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, Conn., and many other prestigious prep schools, Phillips Exeter has been reeling from revelations of sexual misconduct, and questions about whether the school properly handled them.

In most cases, the accusations have involved teachers preying on students. This year, a former Phillips Exeter admissions officer pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a 14-year-old prospective student in the 1970s, and the academy said that an investigation had revealed credible allegations against three former teachers and a former school psychologist. Last year, the school fired a teacher for sexual misconduct with a student, and revealed that another teacher, after admitting to such misconduct, had been allowed to retire quietly and for years remained a presence on campus, with emeritus status.

While some accused of abuse have been prosecuted, it is rare for school administrators who failed to report misconduct to face any legal penalty.

In the case described in the state police report, Michael W. Jones, an alumnus who has been a leading critic of the academy’s handling of sexual abuse cases, said it was “outrageous” that the two deans still had their administrative positions, and that the school had not addressed the matter in more detail. “There should be transparency and consequences,” he said.

The 17-year-old girl’s lawyer, Carmen Durso, declined to comment.

When The Boston Globe reported last year on the girl’s groping allegation and the way it was handled by the school, the news prompted a strong backlash among alumni, many of whom said they would withhold donations to the academy. In a statement, the academy said that “without question, the situation could and should have been handled in a better way,” but it did not say explicitly what had been done wrong, or by whom. Until now, the police account of the deans’ response to the groping allegation, and the trooper’s desire to charge the deans, had not been publicly known.

The state police report shows that the two female students met in October 2015 with Mr. Cosgrove, dean of residential life; Ms. Mischke, dean of students; and a teacher who was the younger student’s faculty adviser and who had encouraged her to go to the deans. The police report includes the two accusers’ and the faculty adviser’s descriptions of the meeting; the two deans declined to be interviewed by investigators.

The younger accuser said that days before she went to the deans, a popular male senior texted her that it was his 18th birthday, and asked her to meet him in the church basement, a quiet place where students sometimes studied, and which he was assigned to monitor. There, she said, he touched her buttocks and breasts and kissed her, even as she repeatedly told him not to, until she left.

The other accuser recounted a similar incident in the same place with the same male student, who she said put his hands under her shirt and touched her breasts, prompting her to leave.

A state law mandates that anyone in a long list of positions, including school officials, “having reason to suspect” sexual abuse of a person under age 18, which it defines very broadly, must report it to the state Department of Health and Human Services.

The girl said that the month after their first meeting, she asked Mr. Cosgrove what punishment her classmate had received, and he declined to tell her. Several months later, the girl felt unsafe with the male student still on campus, and showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, her faculty adviser told investigators. In April 2016, they met again with the two deans.

In both the October and April meetings, the teacher said, when the girl described what had happened to her as an “assault,” Mr. Cosgrove corrected her, saying that it was just harassment.

After the second meeting, the girl went to the police, and prosecutors soon charged the male student, Chukwudi Ikpeazu, with misdemeanor sexual assault. But a year later, in July 2017, as his trial was about to begin, they set aside the charge, and if he meets certain conditions — which have not been made public — prosecutors will drop the case.

From The Times’s Tiffany Hsu:

Broadcom “could also try to assuage Qualcomm’s fears of government pushback by initiating the regulatory approval process for a potential deal. The company garnered praise from President Trump this month when it said it would move its corporate address to Delaware from Singapore.”

Shares in Qualcomm ended the day up 3 percent, at $66.49. That’s still below Broadcom’s bid of $70 a share, suggesting that investors remain unsure of whether Broadcom’s takeover efforts will succeed.

Missouri’s attorney general subpoenas Google.

Attorney General Josh Hawley of Missouri said he wanted to know if Google had violated state law on matters ranging from how it obtains user data to the possibility that it has manipulated search results to harm competitors.

Here’s what Mr. Hawley had to say in his office’s announcement of an investigative subpoena examining Google’s business practices:

“There is strong reason to believe that Google has not been acting with the best interest of Missourians in mind. My office will not stand by and let private consumer information be jeopardized by industry giants, especially to pad their profits.”

A Google spokesman, Patrick Lenihan, gave this statement:

“We have not yet received the subpoena, however, we have strong privacy protections in place for our users and continue to operate in a highly competitive and dynamic environment.”

Brookfield offers $14.8 billion for the rest of GGP.

Get ready for a potential battle to control one of America’s biggest mall operators.

Brookfield Property Partners, a real estate investment firm, confirmed on Monday that it had offered to buy the 34 percent of GGP that it doesn’t already own. That would make Brookfield one of the biggest publicly traded real estate companies in the world, with nearly $100 billion worth of assets.

GGP, formerly known as General Growth Properties, operates primarily upscale malls like Tysons Galleria in Virginia and Woodbridge Center in New Jersey. Along with other mall operators, it has been grappling with the decline in brick-and-mortar shopping, and has been trying to find new ways to repurpose its real estate.

Brookfield’s C.E.O., Brian Kingston, said this in a statement:

“We are excited about the opportunity to leverage our expertise to grow, transform or reposition GGP’s shopping centers, creating long-term value in a way that would not otherwise be possible.”

Brookfield first gained a stake in GGP when it helped the mall operator emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

In its own statement, GGP said that it was considering Brookfield’s bid.

What happens when 3G can’t do more deals?

That’s the question confronting the acquisitive investment firm — long celebrated for its deal-making savvy, Unilever excepted — and its portfolio companies as they run out of transformational acquisition targets. In fact, it raises concern about what all companies whose growth has come in large part from buying others can do when they run out of companies to buy.

Anheuser-Busch InBev, Kraft Heinz and Restaurant Brands International are all becoming too big to buy huge competitors. And they have largely implemented 3G’s favorite tactics, like zero-based budgeting, to trim costs.

Now they, and their financial backer, must prove that they can grow their businesses organically. Hence, why Anheuser-Busch is replacing the head of its United States subsidiary.

From Jennifer Maloney of the WSJ:

The management changes mark a new phase for the company’s U.S. operations, said Carlos Brito, chief executive of the Belgium-based behemoth. The first phase, after InBev’s 2008 takeover of Anheuser-Busch, was aimed at cutting costs and paying off debt. The second focused on expanding the portfolio with craft beers and growing higher-end brands such as Stella Artois and Michelob Ultra, Mr. Brito said.

Putting G.E.’s self-help plan in context.

Here are some numbers to keep in mind about G.E.’s latest transformation. You can read the full plan here, and you can read the news release about the dividend here.

• 2009. That’s the last time G.E. cut its dividend.

• $4 billion. That’s how much money the move is expected to save each year.

• 3. That’s how many businesses G.E. now plans to focus on: aviation, power and health care.

• 35 percent. That’s how much G.E. shares have fallen so far this year.

Shares in the conglomerate closed down about 7.2 percent Monday, to $19.02.

At Breakingviews, Rob Cox found some promising, if belated, elements in the turnaround plan presented by John Flannery, G.E.’s new chief:

“Perhaps the most encouraging development to be found in Mr. Flannery’s 57-page slide show on Monday is a plan to put just 12 directors up for a vote next year, including three new ones. That means it is parting company with half the current lineup.”

Has the dysfunction at Uber finally ended?

After all, Uber, its investors and SoftBank’s Masa Son have struck enough compromises to move forward with a long-awaited deal that would allow early shareholders to cash out of the ride-hailing colossus. Those concessions included:

• Giving up special voting rights held by early shareholders like the investment firm Benchmark

• Benchmark suspending its lawsuit against Travis Kalanick

• Mr. Kalanick letting Uber’s other directors have a say over the board seats he controls if he ever needs to fill them again

From Greg Bensinger, WSJ:

“It’s a pretty great reset for the company,” said Bradley Tusk, a political strategist and investor in Uber. “Everyone staying in is focused on the possibilities of the future and everyone mired in the past and present can move on.”

What’s next: SoftBank and its partners can proceed with an offer to buy at least 14 percent of Uber’s shares — although they can walk away if they don’t hit that target. (We want to know whether SoftBank can raise its bid and extend the tender if, toward the end of the process, the Japanese conglomerate still looks like it will fall short of its goal.)

The cautious view: Not everyone is convinced that peace has descended upon Uber just yet. “Trust but verify,” an unidentified person told Kara Swisher of Recode.

The latest front in the tax battle: private equity.

The newest version of the House bill may have done little to meaningfully affect carried interest, but buyout firms are planning to fight back against limits on the deductibility of corporate debt payments. That would make the core business of private equity — buying and selling companies, in deals financed to some degree with borrowed money — much more difficult.

From Madison Marriage, Javier Espinoza and Sam Fleming in the FT:

“There is no particular logic to the reforms. This is really frightening,” said one London-based private equity manager with international holdings, including in the U.S.

Where we now stand: The House is set to vote on its tax plan by the end of the week. Lawmakers in the House and the Senate are scrambling to counter economic models showing that both proposals would ultimately add to the national debt, according to the NYT.

Don’t cut our taxes: More than 400 millionaires and billionaires, from George Soros to the founders of Ben & Jerry, are sending a letter to Congress this week opposing the Republican plans. “This makes no sense,” Bob Crandall, a former American Airlines C.E.O. and a signatory of the letter, told the WaPo.

Some Republican lawmakers have conceded that — contrary to statements by President Trump and party leaders — not all Americans will see their taxes lowered, and some will see their obligations rise, according to the WaPo.

Trump’s two messages to Asian partners.

On the one hand: Let’s band together to stop North Korea. On the other: Find your own way on trade. (But could his pronouncements be drowned out by his latest Twitter invectives against Kim Jong-un and critics of the Trump administration?)

A boon for Canadian lobster: While Mr. Trump takes a tough line on new trade pacts, foreign partners are wary of agreeing to those terms — leaving room for competitors like Canada to sign deals quickly.

Trump picks Eli Lilly president for H.H.S.

President Trump nominated Alex M. Azar II, the president of Eli Lilly’s United States division, to be the next secretary of the Health and Human Services Department.

Mr. Azar was a deputy in the department under President George W. Bush before spending the past decade in the pharmaceutical industry.

Some good news for bankers.

Item #1, from Ryan Tracy and Christina Rexrode, WSJ:

The Trump administration has a strong message for the country’s bankers: You’re not the villain anymore. President Trump’s newly minted financial regulatory team — growing in size with recent confirmations — is sounding a friendlier tone than its predecessor, which restricted the industry following the 2008 bank bailouts.

Item #2, from Telis Demos, WSJ:

For the first time in four years, year-end bonuses for bankers in 2017 are set to grow over the prior year, according to consulting firm Johnson Associates Inc. Over all, incentive pay is expected to rise by 5 percent to 10 percent, Johnson’s survey found.

What role is politics playing in the Time Warner deal?

Executives at the two companies privately worry that the Trump administration wants CNN to be sold to get the deal done. Justice Department officials dispute that, although they have asked for the sale of either Turner Broadcasting, which includes CNN, or DirecTV.

On Air Force One this past weekend, Mr. Trump denied intervening in the government’s decision-making process, saying, “I do feel you should have as many news outlets as you can — especially since so many are fake.”

But the WSJ has reported that when Jared Kushner met with a top executive at Time Warner this year, Mr. Kushner said that CNN should fire 20 percent of its staff because the cable channel was wrong in its analysis of the 2016 election.

A group of senators, led by Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, has asked the Justice Department whether the president had pressured its antitrust division.

Roy Moore presents a dilemma for the G.O.P.

Now that Alabama’s governor has ruled out delaying the Dec. 12 special election, Mr. Moore appears to be locked in as the Republican nominee for the Senate there. Should he lose — not a given — Republicans would have just a one-seat majority in the Senate, imperiling their ability to move legislation. Senate Republicans have largely abandoned Mr. Moore, although the White House hasn’t at this point.

At the same time, a stream of accusations has hit statehouses from California to Florida, according to the NYT.

A serious breach opens between N.F.L. owners.

As owners debate how to speed contract negotiations with Roger Goodell, while Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys threatens to sue if that happens, we have to ask: Can the league find unity again?

There are many issues to contend with, including player protests, declining TV ratings, and the debate about concussions. The fissure between Mr. Jones and the other owners could prevent the league from coming together on efforts to address all those. “This is not the way we do things in the N.F.L.,” Arthur Blank of the Falcons told Mr. Jones on a call last week, according to Sports Illustrated.

What N.F.L. owners will discuss today: Mr. Goodell’s most recent proposal, which includes annual compensation of $49.5 million, the lifetime use of a private jet and lifetime health insurance for his family, according to ESPN, citing an unidentified person.

But this counterintuitive behavior is what allows them to perform calculations at rate that would not be possible on a typical computer.

Today’s computers store information as “bits,” with each transistor holding either a 1 or a 0. But thanks to something called the superposition principle — behavior exhibited by subatomic particles like electrons and photons, the fundamental particles of light — a quantum bit, or “qubit,” can store a 1 and a 0 at the same time. This means two qubits can hold four values at once. As you expand the number of qubits, the machine becomes exponentially more powerful.

Todd Holmdahl, who oversees the quantum project at Microsoft, said he envisioned a quantum computer as something that could instantly find its way through a maze. “A typical computer will try one path and get blocked and then try another and another and another,” he said. “A quantum computer can try all paths at the same time.”

The trouble is that storing information in a quantum system for more than a short amount of time is very difficult, and this short “coherence time” leads to errors in calculations. But over the past two decades, Mr. Schoelkopf and other physicists have worked to solve this problem using what are called superconducting circuits. They have built qubits from materials that exhibit quantum properties when cooled to extremely low temperatures.

With this technique, they have shown that, every three years or so, they can improve coherence times by a factor of 10. This is known as Schoelkopf’s Law, a playful ode to Moore’s Law, the rule that says the number of transistors on computer chips will double every two years.

“Schoelkopf’s Law started as a joke, but now we use it in many of our research papers,” said Isaac Chuang, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “No one expected this would be possible, but the improvement has been exponential.”

These superconducting circuits have become the primary area of quantum computing research across the industry. One of Mr. Schoelkopf’s former students now leads the quantum computing program at IBM. The founder of Rigetti Computing studied with Michel Devoret, one of the other Yale professors behind Quantum Circuits.

In recent months, after grabbing a team of top researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara, Google indicated it is on the verge of using this method to build a machine that can achieve “quantum supremacy” — when a quantum machine performs a task that would be impossible on your laptop or any other machine that obeys the laws of classical physics.

There are other areas of research that show promise. Microsoft, for example, is betting on particles known as anyons. But superconducting circuits appear likely to be the first systems that will bear real fruit.

The belief is that quantum machines will eventually analyze the interactions between physical molecules with a precision that is not possible today, something that could radically accelerate the development of new medications. Google and others also believe that these systems can significantly accelerate machine learning, the field of teaching computers to learn tasks on their own by analyzing data or experiments with certain behavior.

A quantum computer could also be able to break the encryption algorithms that guard the world’s most sensitive corporate and government data. With so much at stake, it is no surprise that so many companies are betting on this technology, including start-ups like Quantum Circuits.

The deck is stacked against the smaller players, because the big-name companies have so much more money to throw at the problem. But start-ups have their own advantages, even in such a complex and expensive area of research.

“Small teams of exceptional people can do exceptional things,” said Bill Coughran, who helped oversee the creation of Google’s vast internet infrastructure and is now investing in Mr. Schoelkopf’s company as a partner at Sequoia. “I have yet to see large teams inside big companies doing anything tremendously innovative.”

Though Quantum Circuits is using the same quantum method as its bigger competitors, Mr. Schoelkopf argued that his company has an edge because it is tackling the problem differently. Rather than building one large quantum machine, it is constructing a series of tiny machines that can be networked together. He said this will make it easier to correct errors in quantum calculations — one of the main difficulties in building one of these complex machines.

But each of the big companies insist that they hold an advantage — and each is loudly trumpeting its progress, even if a working machine is still years away.

Mr. Coughran said that he and Sequoia envision Quantum Circuits evolving into a company that can deliver quantum computing to any business or researcher that needs it. Another investor, Canaan’s Brendan Dickinson, said that if a company like this develops a viable quantum machine, it will become a prime acquisition target.

“The promise of a large quantum computer is incredibly powerful,” Mr. Dickinson said. “It will solve problems we can’t even imagine right now.”",Yale Professors Race Google and IBM to the First Quantum Computer,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/technology/quantum-computing-research.html

Mr. Trump blames Mr. Sessions for the cloud of the Russia investigation that has hovered over his 10-month presidency, saying that if Mr. Sessions had never recused himself from the inquiry this year, the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, would never have been appointed.

On Tuesday, Mr. Sessions is scheduled to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, where he is expected to be questioned sharply by both Republicans and Democrats. The letter was a reply to formal requests from congressional Republicans for a Justice Department inquiry into various Clinton-related issues.

Although Mr. Sessions has recused himself from all matters related to the election, he and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, will oversee the prosecutors’ decision to appoint the special counsel, the letter said.

“These senior prosecutors will report directly to the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, as appropriate, and will make recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources, or whether any matters merit a special counsel,” Stephen E. Boyd, an assistant attorney general, said in the letter to the House Judiciary Committee.

Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, criticized the Justice Department’s letter.

Republicans have long tried to link Mrs. Clinton to the uranium deal, which was revealed in the run-up to her 2016 presidential campaign. The deal was approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States when she was secretary of state under President Barack Obama and had a voting seat on the panel.

Conservative news outlets have kept the story line alive and pushed the allegations as part of a continuing narrative that the Clintons are corrupt. They claim Mrs. Clinton was part of a quid pro quo in which the Clinton Foundation received large donations in exchange for support of the deal.

As the special counsel’s investigation into Mr. Trump and his associates has intensified in recent weeks, Mr. Trump has asked allies and advisers why Mr. Mueller is not investigating the Uranium One case, according to a person familiar with the president’s discussions on the matter.

The allies and advisers have told Mr. Trump that Mr. Mueller’s purview is only to look into Russian interference in the 2016 election, the person said. In response, Mr. Trump has protested that Uranium One also relates to Russia.

However, White House officials in recent days have played down questions about whether the president or his immediate advisers were seeking a new special counsel.

It was before leaving for a 12-day trip to Asia this month that Mr. Trump publicly vented about how the Justice Department had operated under Mr. Sessions.

“I’m really not involved with the Justice Department,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “I’d like to let it run itself.”

“But, honestly, they should be looking at the Democrats,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “And a lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me.”

Mr. Trump has been repeatedly criticized for trying to intervene in the Justice Department’s investigations since he took office.

In May, it was revealed that Mr. Trump had asked James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to end the investigation into Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser — a disclosure that led to the appointment of Mr. Mueller. Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized Mr. Mueller’s investigation — which has intensified in recent weeks as three Trump campaign members were charged — as a witch hunt.

During his Senate confirmation hearing this year, Mr. Sessions said he would not name a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs. Clinton even if ordered to do so by the president.

“This country does not punish its political enemies,” he told the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Mr. Trump, who closely monitors the conservative news media ecosystem for ideas on how to attack his opponents, has cited reports from those outlets to aides and friends as examples for why a special counsel should be appointed.

One commentator in particular, the Fox News host Jeanine Pirro — who is a friend of Mr. Trump’s and whose show he rarely misses — has aggressively denounced Mr. Sessions as weak for not investigating the uranium deal. In addition to making scathing critiques on her show, Ms. Pirro — who had interviewed to be the deputy attorney general, according to three transition officials — recently met with the president to excoriate the attorney general.

In an Oval Office meeting on Nov. 1, Ms. Pirro said that a special counsel needed to be appointed, according to two people briefed on the discussion. Through a Fox News spokeswoman, Ms. Pirro said, “Everything I said to President Trump is exactly what I’ve vocalized on my show, ‘Justice with Jeanine.’”

After his victory last November, Mr. Trump struck a far different tone on prosecuting Mrs. Clinton.

“Look, I want to move forward, I don’t want to move back,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times. “And I don’t want to hurt the Clintons. I really don’t.”

“She went through a lot. And suffered greatly in many different ways. And I am not looking to hurt them at all,” he said. “The campaign was vicious. They say it was the most vicious primary and the most vicious campaign. I guess, added together, it was definitely the most vicious; probably, I assume you sold a lot of newspapers.”",Justice Dept. to Weigh Inquiry Into Clinton Foundation,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/us/politics/justice-department-uranium-one-special-counsel.html

By late May 2015, the fuel was gone and the plant shut down.

Soon after the coalition imposed a naval blockade, ostensibly to prevent weapons from reaching Houthi rebels, reducing the supply of food, medicine and fuel to a trickle. Yemen imports more than 85 percent of its food and medicine, most of it by sea.

Coalition forces turned away or stopped ships heading for Yemeni ports for weeks. Fighting around ports such as Hodeida, the country’s largest cargo port, worsened shortages.

With the treatment plant out of power, wastewater flowed down canals and into the valleys around Sana. Dirty water spread over miles of farmland. Flies hovered above the raw sewage. Cucumbers, tomatoes and leafy greens grown in the contaminated water made their way to markets around Sana. Many cases of acute diarrhea were reported.

Infusions of fuel from the United Nations Children’s Fund helped the sewage plant return to operation, but not full time. Every week bought more people displaced by war into Sana. The treatment plant was built to serve 500,000 people but began handling the waste of nearly 1.5 million. An increasing number of patients sick with acute diarrhea arrived at the Kuwait Hospital in Sana.

In October 2016, tests confirmed cholera in Sana and cases began to be reported around the country. International organizations helped set up and run cholera testing and treatment centers across the city.

War brought even more displaced people to Sana and its population increased to about three million. With no fuel, the plant closed once again in January, for 40 days. It restarted after a small power station in Sana supplied it with six hours of electricity a day. It wasn’t enough. The quantity of untreated wastewater was increasing every day.

In April, cholera was spreading with unprecedented speed across 18 out of 23 governorates of Yemen. In two weeks, more than 20,000 people had been infected and 242 killed by this bout of the disease. Unicef stepped in again to help with the sewage plant’s operation. Since May, the plant has been in service.

Cholera in Yemen is a man-made disaster, and its spread and casualties are tied to the politics of the war. Aerial bombing by the Saudi-led coalition in Houthi-held areas have damaged hospitals, public water systems and sewage plants.

More than half of health care facilities have fully or partly closed. Doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers have gone without salaries for months. Sanitation has worsened. People live amid sewage. Acute watery diarrhea has been more fatal in areas controlled by the rebels than in areas controlled by the government.

According to The Lancet, 78 percent of cholera cases and 81 percent of deaths from cholera have occurred in Houthi-controlled governorates. Governorates controlled by Mr. Hadi’s government have reported 67,346 cases of cholera; the Houthi-rebel-controlled governorates have reported 339,061 cases.

The Saudi-led coalition has delayed or turned away numerous ships carrying fuel and supplies to ports controlled by the rebels. Between May and September alone, according to Human Rights Watch, seven fuel tankers were delayed or diverted.

It has eased the blockade intermittently, allowed varying amounts of fuel, food supplies and medicine. Saudi Arabia and the United States, its leading supporter in the war, have offered $236 million and $427 million for the United Nations humanitarian aid effort in Yemen in 2017. In the summer, Saudi Arabia pledged $33.7 million specifically to help fight cholera.

But severe shortages of food and medicine remain. The United Nations estimates that about seven million people are on the brink of famine in Yemen and nearly 900,000 are infected with cholera.

Later that year he made a bigger impression directing the Broadway production of “A Hatful of Rain,” a drama about addiction starring Ben Gazzara and Shelley Winters.
But his directing took him all over the world, to the Houston Grand Opera, the Washington Opera Society, the San Francisco Opera and many others.
In 1971 Mr. Corsaro married Mary Cross Lueders (known as Bonnie), a mezzo-soprano with City Opera.
Mr. Corsaro also wrote several librettos and is remembered by many as a teacher, whether in his capacity as director or in other settings.","“On the whole the production has been gimmicked too much,” Harold C. Schonberg of The New York Times wrote in his review of Mr. Corsaro’s production of “The Makropoulos Affair” at City Opera in 1970, which included sexually explicit film footage. The opera, he wrote, would have been better served “with more attention to the composer’s ideas and less to the director’s.”

Mr. Corsaro, though, was happy to raise eyebrows.

“It’s all an effort to break up the prevailing timid approach to opera production,” he said in an interview about that production. “You know, where they think it’s daring to use a few slides.”

Francesco Corsaro was born on Dec. 22, 1924. As he later told it, his birth took place aboard a ship as his parents, who had emigrated from Italy, were coming into New York Harbor from Argentina, where they had lived briefly. His father, Giuseppe, was a tailor, and his mother, the former Antonietta Guarino, was a homemaker.

His first exposure to opera was listening to radio broadcasts with his father, a fan. But at a young age he discovered that free standing-room tickets were available at some opera houses to “claquers,” who would applaud on cue when their designated star appeared.

Mr. Corsaro attended the Yale School of Drama and directed a production of Sartre’s “No Exit” at the Cherry Lane Theater in 1947 while still a student there. In 1950 he joined the Actors Studio, the famed incubator of method actors, and for a time he pursued acting himself.

“I was sort of an early ham, looking to find a proper refrigerator,” he said.

He had small roles in several Broadway productions in the early 1950s as well as a few television appearances, but that vocation soon fell by the wayside (though he did appear in the 1968 movie “Rachel, Rachel,” directed by his fellow Actors Studio member Paul Newman). He directed “The Scarecrow” Off Broadway in 1953 with a cast that included James Dean, Patricia Neal and Eli Wallach, and in 1955 he notched his first Broadway directing credit for “The Honeys,” a Roald Dahl comedy starring Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy.

Later that year he made a bigger impression directing the Broadway production of “A Hatful of Rain,” a drama about addiction starring Ben Gazzara and Shelley Winters. It ran for 398 performances.

He also received the director’s credit on “The Night of the Iguana,” the Tennessee Williams play that premiered on Broadway in 1961, though Bette Davis, one of the show’s stars, had him barred from rehearsals during the pre-Broadway run in Chicago. (“We differed on interpretation,” he told The Times in 1979.)

After that difficult experience, his attention increasingly turned to opera, and his production of “La Traviata” for City Opera in 1966, with Patricia Brooks and Plácido Domingo, was something of a breakthrough.

“The new ‘Traviata’ staged last night at the New York State Theater is, consistently, the most intelligent and best-acted presentation I have ever seen,” Mr. Schonberg wrote in The Times.

“It is a ‘Traviata’ full of original touches, and tradition has gone out the window,” he continued. “But everything has been done with such professionalism, together with an avoidance of campy effects, that the overall line is never broken, even though it may be slightly wrenched.”

Quite a few traditions went out the window, in Mr. Schonberg’s phrase, in Corsaro productions for City Opera — sometimes too many. His 1972 “Don Giovanni” became somewhat infamous. When Mr. Corsaro and the conductor, Bruno Maderna, came forth after the final curtain on opening night, “both got as lusty a collection of boos as has enlivened the New York State Theater since it was opened,” Mr. Schonberg wrote.

“They deserved every bit of it,” he added, finding the interpretation sexed up, frenetic and overstuffed with unfamiliar ideas. “Mr. Corsaro’s treatment of ‘Don Giovanni’ approached vandalism.”

If Mr. Corsaro’s productions sometimes inflamed, he was always eager to explore and to push opera out of its stand-and-deliver comfort zone — emphasizing sex and sensuality and story lines, changing settings, and above all pushing singers to dig deep to find their characters, as an actor would.

“We have been brainwashed into believing that the ‘true’ singer is the one with the azure-clad voice — one odd or coarse sound constituting a fall from grace,” he wrote in an article for The Times that was excerpted from his 1978 memoir, “Maverick: A Director’s Personal Experience in Opera & Theater.” “It’s part of the Norman Rockwell syndrome, where art and artists, like all winter days, are valentines.”

If that cost some purity on the musical side, he didn’t care.

“Inconsistent vocal production is minor sacrifice to pay in the shaping of great art,” he wrote.

Other noteworthy productions among his dozens of City Opera credits included “Madama Butterfly” (1967), “Faust” (1968), “Pelléas and Mélisande” (1970) and “La Fanciulla del West” (1977). But his directing took him all over the world, to the Houston Grand Opera, the Washington Opera Society, the San Francisco Opera and many others.

He enjoyed a fruitful partnership with Maurice Sendak, the author and illustrator known for children’s books like “Where the Wild Things Are.” Mr. Sendak designed the sets for Mr. Corsaro’s productions of “The Magic Flute” in Houston in 1980, “The Cunning Little Vixen” for City Opera in 1981 and several others.

In 1971 Mr. Corsaro married Mary Cross Lueders (known as Bonnie), a mezzo-soprano with City Opera. She died in 2016. In addition to his son, he is survived by a brother, Anthony, and two grandsons.

Mr. Corsaro also wrote several librettos and is remembered by many as a teacher, whether in his capacity as director or in other settings. He taught at and directed the American Opera Center at Juilliard. In 1988 he became artistic director of his old stomping ground, the Actors Studio.

Mr. Domingo, still in his 20s when he worked with Mr. Corsaro, said in a telephone interview that the director’s ideas were at first startling, but grew on him, and left him with an appreciation for stage-director approach to opera, and for bending boundaries.

“If it makes sense,” Mr. Domingo said, “then you can have wonderful things.”

In a video made for the Opera Honors award, the director Stephen Wadsworth summed up Mr. Corsaro’s influence, singling out the three-year span that brought his City Opera productions of “La Traviata,” “Madama Butterfly” and “Faust.”

“The wonderful thing about Frank’s work,” he said, “is that Frank is an American, and so the great glory of the American acting tradition, which is working from the inside out, was all over these shows, and all over the performances. And that was an absolute revelation, and a real revolution for opera.”","Frank Corsaro, Director Who Shook Up Opera World, Dies at 92",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/obituaries/frank-corsaro-director-who-shook-up-opera-world-dies-at-92.html

In January 2015, IRAP filed an I-730 form, a refugee family reunification petition, on Hazim’s behalf to be reunited with Entidhar.

In separate conversations in early October Entidhar and Hazim shared how they have dealt with their separation over the last three years.
My children really love America and they always describe what life is like there, how everybody respects them.","In 2001, Hazim, 65, a former English teacher, left his native Iraq for Jordan. His wife, Entidhar, 61, followed about three years later.

Entidhar, as a former school principal in Iraq, was a government employee, which required her to be a member of the Baath Party. Baathists ruled Iraq until the United States-led invasion in 2003. With the invasion came a de-Baathification policy that stripped many Baathist public sector employees from their positions.

Entidhar lost her job and was directly and indirectly threatened by insurgents for her Sunni religion and affiliation with the Baath Party, said Amira Mikhail, an Equal Justice Works Fellow at the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), an organization that has been aiding Hazim and Entidhar with their resettlement cases.

While Entidhar was still in Iraq, before she had joined her husband in Jordan, a drive-by shooter opened machine-gun fire on Entidhar’s house, she said, and on her son, who was standing outside. Threatening messages were painted on the exterior of her home, and pieces of paper bearing messages like “Leave or we’ll kill you” were thrown at her window.

Their daughter Zeina, 36, moved to Lebanon, and then she and her husband resettled in the United States, in Mishawaka, Ind., in 2012. Hazim followed them to Indiana in the summer of 2014. Their other daughter, Liqaa, 37, now lives in neighboring South Bend, Ind. Their son Mazen, 35, immigrated to Australia.

Each member has since built a new life far away from Iraq and from Jordan — except for Entidhar, who was forced to remain behind.

The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (U.S.C.I.S.) initially denied Entidhar’s refugee application on the basis that she did not provide enough details, said Stephen Poellot, the legal director at IRAP.

In January 2015, IRAP filed an I-730 form, a refugee family reunification petition, on Hazim’s behalf to be reunited with Entidhar. Yet because U.S.C.I.S. voiced concerns about certain details of the petition and requested more information, which often takes considerable time to process, it wasn’t approved until earlier this year.

“The issue with the whole process, honestly, is that there has been so many ups and downs that the approval of the I-730 at that point was such a huge win,” said Ms. Mikhail.

Entidhar lives alone in the northern Jordanian district of Sweilih, and suffers from diabetes, hypertension and ischemic heart disease.

With young children of their own to tend to and citizenship requirements to meet, Entidhar’s children haven’t been able to visit her. She hasn’t seen Zeina, who now has five children and is pregnant, in 14 years.

In separate conversations in early October Entidhar and Hazim shared how they have dealt with their separation over the last three years.

In Their Own Words

Hazim

Life here is very pleasant and peaceful. People here are orderly, kind and progressive. I’m happy but there’s a void in that happiness.

My wife and I didn’t have a typical traditional marriage that is common in the Middle East. Our marriage is based on true love — even more than true love. It’s based on passion, which differs from love because you can love many, but passion is what binds you to that one special person.

So my happiness is incomplete. And every day feels like a year.

Knowing that Entidhar is in Jordan, which is also a foreign country to us, doesn’t help. I can’t be comforted by the thought that she is in her homeland surrounded by her family. It’s a huge burden knowing that she’s stuck between four walls over there and I’m stuck between four walls over here.

Last month, I returned from a five-month trip in Amman. It was my first visit since I left. I had been aching to go for some time, but traveling is very expensive.

One day a friend of mine, a professor at Holy Cross College, asked me why I was depressed. I told him that I wanted to see my wife because she was having some medical problems, and explained my situation. He bought the plane ticket for me — that’s how kind he is. He paid for everything.

One day while we were at home, I was in the living room and Entidhar was in the kitchen. Suddenly I heard something fall on the ground. I went to check on her and found that she had collapsed, so I immediately called her American friend Chris, who told us to reach out if we ever needed anything. Chris arrived to help and the next day we booked an appointment for an open-heart surgery.

Once Entidhar recovered, we were happy like you wouldn’t believe. If I weren’t there when she fell, that would have ended her life. And it would have been the end of me.

Although we were able to spend time together, my trip presented a new problem. For a while, it was getting a little easier to bear with the distance. But once we created those new memories, it hurt twice as much to leave.

I actually left without saying goodbye. It was too hard. She was holding me and crying, like something out of a movie.

I’ve now traveled to America alone twice, and being on my own took all the excitement out of the journey. When birds migrate from one place to another, you rarely see them flying on their own. They usually fly in a group or as a family. If you’re with a partner, it doesn’t matter how far you’re traveling, because you’d be together. But when you’re alone, it’s really tough.

Whenever we chat over Skype, I don’t fully express myself because it’d be hard on her. She’s all by herself and if I told her how I really felt, it would bring her down. So I just tell her to stay strong, everything is fine here and all of our friends are waiting to meet her.

I wish that Entidhar could resettle here because, firstly, most of my family is here. And secondly, life in Amman is unlike life here. I feel like a citizen in this country. I have my dignity. I feel human, with rights and responsibilities.

My doctor told me that all this stress has been giving me high blood pressure and has taken a toll on my body. For instance, I started having migraines and stomach ulcers, and was told they were both due to stress.

But I’m still grateful. I have a feeling that my wife’s situation will be resolved soon.

Entidhar

I was a school principal in Iraq. Everyone liked me and respected me; all was well. But then the war began. Everything changed so quickly and our world was turned upside down.

What I saw was very harrowing. These strange faces started showing up, and you couldn’t tell who was who and what was what. All the people changed, their behavior changed.

Abu Mazen [Hazim] was already in Jordan. I was living with my son and we would hear gunshots constantly. We went through hell and received very, very disgusting threats. The harassment I experienced still haunts me today.

Luckily, we both made it out of Iraq under such grueling circumstances and fled to Jordan in 2004.

I came here because it was safe. But all of a sudden my personal life completely deteriorated because I live through my children, my grandchildren and my husband. What’s the point of life without them? Is there any meaning to life when you wake up in the morning and realize you’re the only one in your home? It’s a dreadful silence.

I thought the longest we wouldn’t see each other would be three months. We have a divine attachment, a spiritual attachment, a physical attachment. So I never thought that it would take this long.

My life has been reduced to inhaling and exhaling. I’m just stuck between four walls, and I’m struggling with some health problems, which is difficult.

And life in Jordan has been bearing down on people. You sense that everyone is dealing with their own situation and it’s very hard for others to care for you and check in on you. Everyone is just consumed with his or her own life.

But I’m really thankful for my two American friends. They feel like family to me now. No one else around here cares for me so I feel a little better when someone asks about me.

Of course, the internet brings Hazim and I closer. But you don’t understand what it means to love someone from deep down, a profound love. When I talk to him, I can’t touch him or smell his natural smell. Even when I see him over video chat, deep down we’re both crying.

I don’t believe that the internet can bring us closer and our problems would suddenly go away.

The moment I see him, I close my eyes and imagine I’m sleeping on his lap, or he’s sleeping on my lap. Our relationship is one of 38 years — three generations, going into the fourth — and we’re still separated. We don’t know what to do.

I feel like Abu Mazen is depressed because of this situation, because he had to leave me, and that deep inside, he feels this heavy burden of guilt.

My children really love America and they always describe what life is like there, how everybody respects them. They’re very happy so I hope that I can join them.

My patience is based on a glimpse of hope that one day the truth will prevail. And justice will prevail. And humanity will prevail. And that everything will fall into place and I’ll see my children. It’s a dream, and I pray to God it will come true.

An ‘Emotional Roller Coaster’

Talking about the promises and disappointments of the complicated resettlement process, Hazim likened the experience to an unpredictable, dramatic ride. “I have a lot of faith in God, and I’m patient,” he said, referring to a petition approval that was granted in January that did result in immediate action. “But to hear good news that lifts your spirits and then to be told otherwise is an emotional roller coaster.”

Soon after these interviews, however, IRAP said that it had been informed by U.S.C.I.S. Amman that Entidhar’s case had been processed and that her travel to the United States would be arranged by the International Organization for Migration.

Neither organization could provide a timeline for when this would happen, and only days later, IRAP cautioned that new restrictions on certain refugee groups could delay Entidhar’s case. Specifically, IRAP wrote in an email, “the ‘follow-to-join’ program, which allows close family members to be reunited, has been paused indefinitely,” according to a memo from the State Department.

The United States allowed 84,995 refugees to resettle in the 12 months before the end of September 2016, a number that asylee advocates believe will be drastically reduced if new travel restrictions are signed into law.

Before, and if, that happens, though, Entidhar boarded a plane from Amman, Jordan, to Washington, D.C., on Nov. 9. From there she would make her way to Indiana, to be reunited with her husband.

Earl Lucas, 47, is the chief exterior designer at the Lincoln Motor Company, in Dearborn, Mich.

Q. What is your day-to-day like?

It’s different every day. I interface with multiple disciplines, whether it be packaging, engineering, marketing or public relations. Some days I am at my computer designing digitally. Then I might be in our studio seeing that image converted to a clay model, and later as a fiberglass version of it. Another day I go to our wind tunnel, where we test aerodynamics to make sure we have the right drag count to get the best fuel economy for our product.

A. Did you always want to be an automobile designer?

I always knew I wanted to do something with design. I studied industrial design focusing on jewelry — rings, pendants and earrings — for two years at the College of Creative Studies in Detroit. The college also happened to have an outstanding automobile design curriculum. After taking one class in that program, I was hooked. It turns out the principles of designing a ring are the same as designing a car.

What or who were your early design influences?

I would have to start with my mother, Vessie Lucas, who is an interior decorator. She taught me to think abstractly — of what could be — at an early age. I read a lot of comics, like “The Mighty Thor” and “Spiderman.” I also watched cartoons such as “Speed Racer,” “Battle of the Planets” and “Star Blazers.” In terms of cars, I loved my grandfather’s 1984 Continental Mark VII, with two tones of blue paint and an impeccable white interior. After he died, I got to drive it on Sundays to church.

What considerations influence your design concepts?

I try to reflect the personality of the brand. In the case of Lincoln, our cars embody effortless luxury. We think of our car as a friend. We convey that through form, shape, color and texture. The most influential design element may be the front grille. It has to stand out but be in proportion with everything else. The centerpiece is our logo — called the Lincoln Star — which was developed in the 1950s. I have managed to tweak it a little.

What do you envision for auto design in the future?

Autonomous cars — driverless automobiles — are the future and we are already developing technologies to accommodate for this shift, which we predict could be in effect by 2030. As highways and streets will be modified, cars will also have different shapes and silhouettes; they may look more like living rooms.

“I thought if you’re writing hateful comment towards Hillary or Trump that are really, really angry and horrible, I thought that person is going to be horrible in person as well,” Mr. Lien said.
Many of them are trolls, but many of them are just really strongly opinionated people,” Mr. Lien said.
“Just to see their homes, their decorations around them, their computers — all of those things give quite a lot of personality to the photo,” Mr. Lien said.
Mr. Lien spent weeks researching and studying commenters.","Nick Haynes didn’t seem so bad.

Sure, online he had promised civil war if Hillary Clinton were elected, but Mr. Haynes was first and foremost a family man. He’d given up his days of motorcycles and drinking to live a sober life in a sleepy Pennsylvania town with his four children, where he had a full-time job as a truck driver.

But his family life contrasted sharply with his other full-time job, that of a prolific online commenter. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he tweeted an average of 57 times a day about a corrupt system, biased media and “Killary.” He compared voting for Mrs. Clinton to killing your own children.

It was this disconnect between “normal life” and intense online debate that drove Kyrre Lien, a photographer based in Oslo, to look into the lives of the online commenting community. For a project called “The Internet Warriors,” Mr. Lien combed through tens of thousands of online comments to put together a group of 27 internet debaters from around the world, representing all sides of the political spectrum.

“They had steady jobs, they had family, they had friends and lived quite a normal life, but at the same time, you saw they had these hateful comments,” he said. “That was part of what drove me to dig into this.”

In the case of Mr. Haynes, Mr. Lien assumed that he would personify his comments.

“I thought if you’re writing hateful comment towards Hillary or Trump that are really, really angry and horrible, I thought that person is going to be horrible in person as well,” Mr. Lien said. “But many of the people were actually quite nice, made me coffee and tea and, until politics came up, it was like flipping the switch on a different personality.”

Still, Mr. Lien is hesitant to categorize them as internet trolls.

“Labeling them all as internet trolls would be too harsh. Many of them are trolls, but many of them are just really strongly opinionated people,” Mr. Lien said. “All of the people I met are really dedicated in the cause they’re fighting.”

They have full-time jobs and families, they are men and women of all ages, who feel marginalized in some way or another. Take, for example, Ashleigh Jones, 22, a psychology student in Cardiff, Wales. She’s amassed more than 180,000 tweets on various subjects including entertainment, L.G.B.T. issues and “hot guys.”

Photo

“Some people have also called me a troll, like when I said that ISIS should kill David Cameron,” Ms. Jones told Mr. Lien, referring to the former British prime minister. “I don’t think I’m a troll. I might have strong opinions, but they are just that — opinions. For me, a troll is someone who is ruining the discussion, and that’s not me.”

The photographs feature portraits of the commenters, many of them in their natural commenting habitat inside their homes. Video interviews accompany the subjects online, as well as a book.

“Just to see their homes, their decorations around them, their computers — all of those things give quite a lot of personality to the photo,” Mr. Lien said.

Mr. Lien spent weeks researching and studying commenters. One thread took him down a dark path on Kim Kardashian’s Facebook account. He spent three or four days going through all the comments on her account looking for frequent commenters with a consistent message. But in the end, that was one type of opinion he wasn’t able to capture on camera — misogynists.

Mr. Lien found that the motivation behind commenters depends on their political affiliation. On the right, it’s “because they feel threatened and society is letting them down, they’re being left by themselves,” Mr. Lien said, whereas people on the left “feel that we need to stand up for what we believe in.”

Sofia Srour, 23 and Muslim, defends her religion daily.

“There is so much ignorance and hate directed towards my religion in the comment section that I quickly become irritated. Anger drives me,” she told Mr. Lien. “I have spent more than three hours every day sharing my views on Islam. It’s a bit scary to engage in these discussions, but I feel that it’s important to balance out all the negativity that is posted.”

Mr. Lien may have spent four years trailing the lives of what he calls internet warriors, but the photographer is far from calling himself a troll.

“I’d like to be more of an internet peacekeeping force than an internet warrior,” he said.

Authoritarian leaders exercise a strange and powerful attraction for President Trump. As his trip to Asia reminds us, a man who loves to bully people turns to mush — fawning smiles, effusive rhetoric — in the company of strongmen like Xi Jinping of China, Vladimir Putin of Russia and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines.

Perhaps he sees in them a reflection of the person he would like to be. Whatever the reason, there’s been nothing quite like Mr. Trump’s love affair with one-man rule since Spiro Agnew returned from a world tour in 1971 singing the praises of thuggish dictators like Lee Kuan Yew, Haile Selassie, Jomo Kenyatta, Mobutu Sese Seko and Gen. Francisco Franco.

Mr. Trump’s obsessive investment in personal relations may work for a real estate dealmaker. But the degree to which he has chosen to curry favor with some of the world’s most unsavory leaders, while lavishing far less attention on America’s democratic allies, hurts America’s credibility and, in the long run, may have dangerous repercussions.

In China, he congratulated Mr. Xi for securing a second term as ruler of an authoritarian regime that Mr. Trump had spent the 2016 campaign criticizing. He again absolved Mr. Putin of interfering in the United States election, despite the finding of American intelligence agencies that Moscow did extensive meddling. As for Mr. Duterte, Mr. Trump effused about their “great” relationship while saying nothing about the thousands of Filipinos who died in a campaign of extrajudicial killings as part of the Philippine president’s antidrug war. En route, he gave a verbal thumbs-up to the Saudi crown prince for arresting hundreds of senior officials and cementing control of the kingdom.

It’s not uncommon for American presidents to foster relations with strongmen. Serving the national interest often means working with leaders who are undemocratic, corrupt, adversarial or all three, and for decades there was no alternative to dealing with whoever had the top job in the Kremlin. People still talk about how naïve President George W. Bush was when he looked into Mr. Putin’s eyes in 2001 and declared the Russian president “trustworthy.” President Barack Obama stuck with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the democratically elected president of Turkey, long after Mr. Erdogan evolved into a dictator. The Chinese and Saudi leaders were favorites of President George H. W. Bush. President Richard Nixon assiduously cultivated China’s Mao Zedong, the shah of Iran and the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.

Still, whatever their strengths and weaknesses, these past presidents worked within a structure of longstanding alliances and, in varying degrees, espoused support for democratic values, including the rule of law and human rights, all the while trying to nudge the autocrats along a similar path. President George H. W. Bush and others encouraged democracy in Russia; President Bill Clinton did likewise in China and Peru; President George W.

And in collaboration with the designer Jan Versweyveld, his longtime partner in aesthetic demolition, he has found vivid, viscera-tugging stage equivalents for the anger and displacement that infused a wild-eyed movie now regarded by many as prophecy.

That’s the cinematic satire that took home a clutch of Oscars in 1977 for telling Americans that their souls were being cannibalized by big television and the bigger corporations behind it. Directed with high bombast by Sidney Lumet, with a fulminating script by Paddy Chayefsky, “Network” tapped into the populist rage of a post-Nixon society, suspicious of all authority and stressed to the end of its tether.

It seems safe to say that such emotions are very much with us again, if they ever really went away. And when it’s in sensory attack mode (as opposed to podium lecture mode), this revamped “Network,” piously adapted from Chayefsky’s screenplay by Lee Hall, feels as pertinent to our time as it did to its own.

True, the monster television that Chayefsky condemned, in which minds were numbed and massaged through a central household set, looks kind of puny these days. Most homes are now filled with multiple screens, which record and transmit as well as receive images, turning daily existence into one big reality show.

But without resorting to obvious technological anachronisms, Mr. van Hove and Mr. Versweyveld have created a world of invasive lenses that scramble the lines between public and private, between thought and deed. It’s not just what happens on sound stages that’s magnified into splintered simulcast images. (Tal Yarden is the feverishly imaginative video designer.)

What happens behind the scenes is also captured, flattened and projected. That includes activities in broadcast control rooms, offices, bedrooms, boardrooms and even a restaurant where a pair of adulterous lovers conduct a cool quickie in full view of their fellow diners.

Those voyeurs at the next table, by the way, could well be you, as this production offers ticket buyers the option of dining onstage during the performance. Such inclusiveness is just another way of reminding us that we’re all complicit in this landscape of nonstop surveillance. (The same notion is underscored, more predictably, when a TV warm-up man tries to work the audience into a rabid froth.)

As Beale, the aging anchorman whose onscreen nervous breakdown turns him into a ratings sensation (played on screen by Peter Finch), Mr. Cranston (“Breaking Bad” on television, “All the Way” on Broadway) is the perfect stark raving center for this meticulously calibrated mayhem.

From the first words Beale utters, he projects a lifetime of assumed gravitas now shading into burnout. When he’s reborn as an evangelist of the airwaves — urging his public to open their windows and scream they’re not going to take it anymore — he’s the avenging phoenix that would inevitably rise from such ashes.

Watching him romancing the cameras, and seeing him transformed into an army of simulcast selves, is one of this production’s great, disorienting pleasures. If only he didn’t have to sermonize so much.

I know, I know. Beale’s jeremiads are what make him a star. But like the movie, this “Network” often eclipses character with its bloviating didacticism. And whenever there’s a big speech to be made — by Beale, or his honorable best friend, Max Schumacher (Douglas Henshall), or the show’s various embodiments of institutional evil — the production slows down and e-nun-ci-ates with organ music (really) as underscoring.

There is a large supporting cast, but as individuals they don’t register very convincingly. Mr. Henshall is just fine as a weary producer of fraying integrity who falls for a beautiful young co-worker, Diana Christensen, who is (poor thing) television incarnate.

She is played by Michelle Dockery, a fine actress of stage (“Pygmalion”) and television (“Downton Abbey”). But her generically eager performance here pales next to memories of Faye Dunaway’s audaciously stylized onscreen interpretation.

Caroline Faber has the thankless role (and excruciating dialogue) of Schumacher’s betrayed wife. Tunji Kasim and Richard Cordery are serviceable as the hot and cold incarnations of bureaucratic monstrosity.

In an introduction to the script, Mr. Hall writes that there’s scarcely a word in it that isn’t Chayefsky’s. I do wish he’d been less reverent, since many of those words now sound tin-eared and melodramatic. (I found myself thinking that the show might have been better if it had been performed in Dutch by Mr. van Hove’s Toneelgroep Amsterdam troupe.)

It’s when all the technological bells and whistles are operating that this “Network” thrills, even as it agonizes. Mr. Cordery’s big boss figure may insist that it’s the message, not the medium, that ultimately prevails. But in this case, stagecraft nearly always trumps script in translating a fabled movie from the past into a palpable, searing present.","Review: ‘Network’ With Bryan Cranston Is Convulsive, Immersive and Still Mad as Hell",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/theater/network-review-bryan-cranston-national-theater.html

MANILA — President Trump confirmed on Tuesday that he had appealed to President Xi Jinping of China on behalf of three basketball players from the University of California, Los Angeles, who were arrested last week in Hangzhou, China, on suspicion of shoplifting.

“I had a great conversation with President Xi,” Mr. Trump told reporters as he was leaving the Philippines after a 12-day trip to Asia. “What they did was unfortunate. You know, you’re talking about very long prison sentences. They do not play games.”

In China, where the justice system has a very high conviction rate, theft can bring punishment ranging from a few days to years in prison.

Mr. Trump said he hoped the Chinese president would help the players: LiAngelo Ball, a freshman guard; and Cody Riley and Jalen Hill, both freshman forwards. He emphasized that it was a “very, very rough situation, with what happened to them.”

The three men were arrested this past Tuesday, accused of stealing designer sunglasses from a Louis Vuitton store next to their hotel in Hangzhou, in eastern China, where they were planning to play in a tournament. They were released on bail last Wednesday but were reportedly confined to the hotel. (Playing without the three freshmen, U.C.L.A. defeated Georgia Tech, 63-60, in Shanghai on Friday.)

On Friday evening the MSNBC host Chris Hayes sent out a tweet that electrified online conservatives: “As gross and cynical and hypocritical as the right’s ‘what about Bill Clinton’ stuff is, it’s also true that Democrats and the center left are overdue for a real reckoning with the allegations against him.” Hayes’s tweet inspired stories on Glenn Beck’s The Blaze, Breitbart and The Daily Caller, all apparently eager to use the Clinton scandals to derail discussions about Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for the United States Senate in Alabama who is accused of sexually assaulting minors.

Yet despite the right’s evident bad faith, I agree with Hayes. In this #MeToo moment, when we’re reassessing decades of male misbehavior and turning open secrets into exposes, we should look clearly at the credible evidence that Juanita Broaddrick told the truth when she accused Clinton of raping her. But revisiting the Clinton scandals in light of today’s politics is complicated as well as painful. Democrats are guilty of apologizing for Clinton when they shouldn’t have. At the same time, looking back at the smear campaign against the Clintons shows we can’t treat the feminist injunction to “believe women” as absolute.

Writing at Crooked.com, Brian Beutler warns that in future elections, right-wing propaganda will exploit the progressive commitment to always taking sexual abuse charges seriously. It’s easy to imagine an outlet like Breitbart leveraging the “believe women” rallying cry to force mainstream media coverage of dubious accusations.

The Clinton years, in which epistemological warfare emerged as a key part of the Republican political arsenal, show us why we should be wary of allegations that bubble up from the right-wing press. At the time, the reactionary billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife was bankrolling the Arkansas Project, which David Brock, the former right-wing journalist who played a major role in it, described as a “multimillion-dollar dirty tricks operation against the Clintons.” Various figures in conservative media accused Bill Clinton of murder, drug-running and using state troopers as pimps. Brock alleges that right-wing figures funneled money to some of Clinton’s accusers.

In this environment, it would have been absurd to take accusations of assault and harassment made against Clinton at face value. On Monday, Caitlin Flanagan, perhaps taking up Hayes’s challenge, urged liberals to remember some of what Clinton is said to have done. “Kathleen Willey said that she met him in the Oval Office for personal and professional advice and that he groped her, rubbed his erect penis on her, and pushed her hand to his crotch,” Flanagan wrote, recalling the charges Willey first made in 1998. It sounds both familiar and plausible. But Willey also accused the Clintons of having her husband and then her cat killed. Must we believe that, too?

Similarly, there are reasons to be at least unsure about Paula Jones’s claim that Clinton exposed himself to her and demanded oral sex. Jones was championed by people engaged in what Ann Coulter once proudly called “a small, intricately knit right-wing conspiracy” to bring down the president. She described “distinguishing characteristics” of Clinton’s penis that turned out to be inaccurate. Her sister insisted to Sidney Blumenthal, then a New Yorker writer, that she was lying.

Whatever new elements arrive in 2017, the foreboding is the same as always.

Nonetheless, the projected disasters almost never occur. Everybody has a great time. Remembering this will not help to achieve preliminary serenity, but understanding the process can make the angst easier to endure.

In order to help, the Thanksgiving wine panel annually tries to eliminate wine selections from your areas of concern. Each year, we share a Thanksgiving feast in advance. We each bring two bottles of wine to the meal, each costing no more than $25, with the aim of adding to our understanding of which types of wines work best.

As with many families, we welcomed a new member this year. Our colleague Tejal Rao — sitting in for Julia Moskin, who was away on assignment — joined me, Florence Fabricant, Pete Wells and our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch.

Over the years, we have learned and affirmed that wine is the least consequential issue anybody will face at Thanksgiving. Why is that?

Rule No. 3: If the food is good and the company convivial, you cannot go wrong with the wine. If the food is bad and the company annoying, wine can only help.

What’s the worst that can happen with wine? Only one potential disaster looms: running out.

The single most important guideline for selecting wine for Thanksgiving is simply to have enough on hand. We generally recommend one bottle per wine-drinking adult. This may seem like a lot, but it is simply a hedge against an insufficient supply. You do not have to finish it all. If you like, you can even give away unopened bottles with the leftovers.

Beyond quantity, you need to provide both reds and whites. You can add rosé or a sparkling wine, but both red and white are essential. You will have guests who contend that red wine gives them headaches or white wine gives them heartburn. This is not the time to debate these issues. Let guests drink what they want unfettered.

In our calculus, we imagine Thanksgiving as a large, freewheeling buffet meal, with lots of different dishes and a sprawling patchwork of flavors. It’s not the time to fret about pairing particular dishes with certain bottles. The trick is to provide versatile, nimble wines that pair well with many foods and will not be as fatiguing as everything else.

That generally means bottles not especially high in alcohol, generally below 14 percent. They should not be tannic or oaky, but they must be energetic with lively acidity, which helps to refresh and cleanse the palate.

Over the course of many years we have identified wines that almost always work well: Beaujolais and bone-dry sauvignon blancs are crowd-pleasers. Basic Italian reds made of barbera or sangiovese are fine, as are Italian whites made of fiano or carricante. Loire reds, pinot noirs, chardonnays, chenin blancs, mencías from Spain, rieslings — all are fine choices.

These wines, I should say, fit our particular vision of the feast. If you are having a small dinner party for six with multiple courses and you would like to serve precious bottles poured into exquisite glasses, by all means do.

For our party, we assume a crowd who might be drinking from tumblers or even paper cups. These are fine for big parties. But I do recommend steering clear of plastic goblets, which have a nasty habit of separating bowl from stem at the worst possible moments for your clothing, carpeting and anxiety threshold.

Almost all the wines the panel sampled were excellent, and the few that fell short were nonetheless fine. Tejal brought the two most fascinating wines, both white, sort of.

The first, the 2016 Caprice du Chameau from La Vrille et Le Papillon, a brother-and-sister team who make natural wines in the Ardèche region of southeastern France, was unfiltered, giving the wine a hazy appearance. Yet it was sublimely light and spicy, vibrant and thoroughly delicious. Surprisingly, it was made of viognier, which I usually associate with heavier, fruitier wines. Though visually unusual, the wine was ideal, with what Pete called “a feeling of over the river and through the woods.”

Tejal’s second bottle was more challenging, a 2015 from RuBor Viticultores, made of chasselas, a Swiss white grape unaccountably planted 70 years ago in Cebreros in the Sierra de Gredos, a range of hills that cuts through central Spain. Though made from white grapes, the wine had been made as if it were a red. Instead of immediately separating the juice of the grapes from the skins, the producers macerated them together, extracting tannins and pigment.

The gritty, amber-colored result was savory, intense and unusual, and perhaps better for a crowd of questing wine fanatics than a general-interest holiday group. I would happily serve it with cheese, though not for the long haul of a feast.

Pete brought a rosé sparkling wine, a light, lacy cava from Dibon in the Penedès region of Spain. This fruity cava, unusually made entirely of the garnacha grape, would make a delightful aperitif, though we all would prefer not to drink sparkling wine throughout the feast.

His other wine was an inspired selection, a 2013 Tinto, or red, from the intriguing Barraida region of Portugal from Sidónio de Sousa, made from the baga grape. It was spicy, herbal and lightly fruity, and had just the sort of light-bodied charm that could carry through the entire meal.

Bernie took an unusual tack in selecting his white. He chose a Quincy, a Loire sauvignon blanc, because, he said, he remembered a meal many years ago when a Quincy was universally reviled.

This suggestion of overt hostility to the group could not be rewarded. We disappointed him by thoroughly enjoying the wine, a clean, citrusy 2013 from Domaine Trotereau. We compounded the issue by liking his red even more, a 2013 pinot noir from Red Tail Ridge in the Finger Lakes. Its pale brick color seemed more typical of an older wine, but it was bright, juicy and fresh.

Florence’s white, a 2016 sauvignon blanc from Matanzas Creek in Sonoma County, was an archetypal Thanksgiving white: neutral rather than flamboyant, a subtle character actor that would enhance rather than dominate. It had the sort of texture that continually invited another sip.

Her red was also from Sonoma, a 2012 Buena Vista merlot. It had the opposite character of the Matanzas Creek, with fruit flavors that were too intense. Tejal called the effect “sinister,” but even so, it was easily tolerable.

My own wines included a savory white Bordeaux, a 2015 Lune d’Argent from Clos des Lunes, made by the excellent Domaine de Chevalier. Though primarily sémillon with a quarter sauvignon blanc, it had a lot in common with the Matanzas Creek in that it was more interesting texturally than aromatically.

My red was a 2015 Cahors from Château Combel-la-Serre, an easygoing wine that combined plummy fruit and chalky mineral flavors. It was made of malbec, but was more restrained than many of the fruity malbecs from Argentina.

Collectively, most of these wines added good options to the tried-and-true selections. Tejal, however, second-guessed her choice of the Spanish chasselas. “I realized that maybe something I personally liked is not for everybody,” she said.

She’s correct only to the extent of the distance that a wine lies from the mainstream. Otherwise, I live by the last rule.

Recipe Pairing: Cornbread Madeleines With Jalapeño

A recent dinner at Gloria, an intimate new seafood restaurant in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, started on a fine note. Warm rounds of individual jalapeño-studded cornbread were served while we sipped cocktails. Always on the prowl for something new for the Thanksgiving menu, I thought of the cornbread as we sampled these Thanksgiving wine selections. Phil Johnson, an owner of Gloria, provided the recipe. But for Thanksgiving, instead of the four-inch cornbread disks served at the restaurant, I baked the batter in madeleine pans. I then froze the little cakes, so I would have them for the holiday. (I will reheat them covered in foil on a baking sheet at 275 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes.) The madeleines would welcome any quaff, cider or beer, not just wine. And the batter can also be baked in cast-iron corn stick molds, though the yield would be fewer, about 15. FLORENCE FABRICANT

Although Mr. Sessions has recused himself from all matters related to the election, he and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, will oversee the prosecutors’ decision to appoint the special counsel, the letter said.

“These senior prosecutors will report directly to the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, as appropriate, and will make recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources, or whether any matters merit a special counsel,” Stephen E. Boyd, an assistant attorney general, said in the letter to the House Judiciary Committee.

Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, criticized the Justice Department’s letter.

Republicans have long tried to link Mrs. Clinton to the uranium deal, which was revealed in the run-up to her 2016 presidential campaign. The deal was approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States when she was secretary of state under President Barack Obama and had a voting seat on the panel.

Conservative news outlets have kept the story line alive and pushed the allegations as part of a continuing narrative that the Clintons are corrupt. They claim Mrs. Clinton was part of a quid pro quo in which the Clinton Foundation received large donations in exchange for support of the deal.

As the special counsel’s investigation into Mr. Trump and his associates has intensified in recent weeks, Mr. Trump has asked allies and advisers why Mr. Mueller is not investigating the Uranium One case, according to a person familiar with the president’s discussions on the matter.

The allies and advisers have told Mr. Trump that Mr. Mueller’s purview is only to look into Russian interference in the 2016 election, the person said. In response, Mr. Trump has protested that Uranium One also relates to Russia.

However, White House officials in recent days have played down questions about whether the president or his immediate advisers were seeking a new special counsel.

It was before leaving for a 12-day trip to Asia this month that Mr. Trump publicly vented about how the Justice Department had operated under Mr. Sessions.

“I’m really not involved with the Justice Department,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “I’d like to let it run itself.”

“But, honestly, they should be looking at the Democrats,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “And a lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me.”

Mr. Trump has been repeatedly criticized for trying to intervene in the Justice Department’s investigations since he took office.

In May, it was revealed that Mr. Trump had asked James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to end the investigation into Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser — a disclosure that led to the appointment of Mr. Mueller. Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized Mr. Mueller’s investigation — which has intensified in recent weeks as three Trump campaign members were charged — as a witch hunt.

During his Senate confirmation hearing this year, Mr. Sessions said he would not name a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs. Clinton even if ordered to do so by the president.

“This country does not punish its political enemies,” he told the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Mr. Trump, who closely monitors the conservative news media ecosystem for ideas on how to attack his opponents, has cited reports from those outlets to aides and friends as examples for why a special counsel should be appointed.

One commentator in particular, the Fox News host Jeanine Pirro — who is a friend of Mr. Trump’s and whose show he rarely misses — has aggressively denounced Mr. Sessions as weak for not investigating the uranium deal. In addition to making scathing critiques on her show, Ms. Pirro — who had interviewed to be the deputy attorney general, according to three transition officials — recently met with the president to excoriate the attorney general.

In an Oval Office meeting on Nov. 1, Ms. Pirro said that a special counsel needed to be appointed, according to two people briefed on the discussion. Through a Fox News spokeswoman, Ms. Pirro said, “Everything I said to President Trump is exactly what I’ve vocalized on my show, ‘Justice with Jeanine.’”

After his victory last November, Mr. Trump struck a far different tone on prosecuting Mrs. Clinton.

“Look, I want to move forward, I don’t want to move back,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times. “And I don’t want to hurt the Clintons. I really don’t.”

“She went through a lot. And suffered greatly in many different ways. And I am not looking to hurt them at all,” he said. “The campaign was vicious. They say it was the most vicious primary and the most vicious campaign. I guess, added together, it was definitely the most vicious; probably, I assume you sold a lot of newspapers.”",Justice Dept. to Weigh Inquiry Into Clinton Foundation,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/us/politics/justice-department-uranium-one-special-counsel.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

No matter where you lived in New York, sooner or later all roads led to 116th Street and Lexington Avenue, the commercial and cultural heart of East Harlem.

Joseph Rodriguez was no exception: Though born and raised in Brooklyn — with detours at Rikers and a life-changing encounter with photography — he, as a teenager, liked to hang out at his uncle’s candy store and numbers spot where the streets were abuzz with music and life. Those early encounters led to a May 1990 National Geographic cover story and the most important project of his life after he spent the latter half of the 1980’s photographing El Barrio’s streets and residents in their homes and on the block.

Now, a revised version of that body of work will be on display at the Bronx Documentary Center, as well as in the new book, “Spanish Harlem: El Barrio in the ’80s.”

While it is “easy to make gritty pictures of poverty,” Mr. Rodriguez was looking to go deeper and connect with people whose struggles he knew intimately as the son of a single mother.

“I carried this story for a long time before I could go out and make the work,” he said. “That was an important path for me to understand patience and waiting, connecting and trust.”

His images reflect an intimacy — and long-term commitment — that marks his later work in East Los Angeles, Romania and Puerto Rico. For him, this project was deeply personal, and still is.

“We’re not garbage people, we have a presence,” he said. “One thing that was extremely important was to show our children with some dignity. You see their strength. We’ve gone through hell and back, just like now in Puerto Rico. But we get up, and we fight back.”

For her, this is a dream job. She recalled the first time she went behind the scenes at the museum, as a student, before she actually worked there.

Dr. McAlister’s fascination began in childhood. “I used to catch the fleas off the cats,” she said, inspecting them with a microscope her parents had given her. But she soon gravitated toward more gruesome insects.

Decomposing carcasses of small creatures, also courtesy of the cats, were treasure troves of maggots, which she still delights in. “I quite like the darker side of nature,” she said, just before discussing the lives of spider-killing flies.

The larvae “hurl themselves at spiders” in order to land on them and burrow into the abdomen. They then eat the spider from the inside out. But if the spiders are immature, the larvae may go to sleep for a few years until the spider grows into a bigger meal.

Photo

One of her few disappointments: “I’ve yet to get my own botfly.” She means that despite spending time in the tropics, no adult botfly has laid an egg on her arm or leg so that the larva could burrow under her skin and develop into the notoriously painful, itchy worm before it emerges.

Many flies do an enormous service for us and the planet by cleaning up all sorts of the biological world’s detritus, from dead wood to the slime in drainpipes. Drain flies, or sewer gnats, are actually cleaning up human mess. Occasionally, however, they may have a population boom that sends the adults into the air, which is annoying; if the bodies disintegrate into tiny particles in the air, they are potentially harmful to human health.

And, of course, there are the flies that feed on dead bodies — the 1,100 different species of blow flies, favorites of forensic detective shows. The maggots of these flies, like the very attractive bluebottle larva, devour corpses of mice and men and everything else.

Knowledge of which species lay eggs at which stages of decomposition can help determine how long ago a person turned into a body. (If it’s Tuesday, it must be a bluebottle.)

Within science, flies are one of the great subjects of laboratory study. Or rather, the fly: Drosophila melanogaster, commonly known as the fruit fly, although Dr. McAlister points out it actually belongs to a group called the vinegar flies.

They are easy to work with and share the same basic DNA as all life. Historically, they have provided much of the foundation for modern genetics. And now they may provide deep insights into neuroscience and other fields.

On Thursday, scientists at the Salk Institute reported that their studies of how the fly brain works can improve internet search engines. At the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Janelia Research Institute in Virginia, the search is on to develop a wiring diagram of the fly brain, and then figure out in the greatest detail how they think.

Inviting Flies Into the Newsroom The Times’s James Gorman recently took reader questions on Facebook Live with Erica McAlister, a curator of flies at the National History Museum, London.

And they do think, according to Vivek Jayaraman, who runs a lab there, in the sense that flies don’t just react instinctively. Their brains make decisions based on several different inputs — smell, memory, hunger and fear, for instance. And that whole process is what he hopes to decipher, neuron by neuron. “You can go end to end, potentially, in the fly,” he said.

Dr. McAlister admits the importance of Drosophila, although a bit reluctantly. She is really interested in the countless other fly species, from the Antarctic to the Arctic, from predators that kill dragonflies on the wing to the tiny fungus gnats. There are 160,000 known species of fly, and entomologists can only guess at the number we don’t know — it’s somewhere between hundreds of thousands and millions.

Marlene Zuk, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Minnesota, as well as a decidedly pro-insect scientific popularizer, couldn’t agree more. Dr. Zuk, whose chosen study subject is a cricket, also studies a parasitic fly that lays its larvae in them.

I called her to talk flies. “Wow,” she said, “you never get asked what your favorite fly is.”

Dr. Zuk quickly came up with an unfavorite. “Flies are always cursed by Drosophila,” she said. “But flies are unbelievably diverse.” She mentioned the value to research of the blowfly and referred to a classic paper, and later a book, on hunger in the blowfly, by Vincent G. Dethier.

The paper showed the physiological process that signaled to a blowfly larva that it had eaten enough, for the moment, of whatever dead thing it was dining on. Dr. Dethier also wrote what might be described as a cult favorite, “To Know a Fly.” Assuming entomologists and their hangers-on can be considered a cult.

Flies are actually prolific muses, in addition to their other qualities. Consider “A Fly for the Prosecution,” “The Life of the Fly,” and “Lords of the Fly” for the Drosophila crowd, among many others.

Dr. McAlister said that her work and her book have bemused and pleased her relatives, including an aunt who is quite delighted to have an author in the family. “My parents were a bit confused to start,” she said. “But I was a middle child and they let me do my own thing.” Eventually, she said, they realized, “Oh, she’s done all right.”

Changing tax rules over time.","Even if it passes, the final bill will be different. The Senate will offer its own legislation, and then the haggling will begin in earnest. The debate over deducting state and local taxes for individual taxpayers is almost certainly not over, as lawmakers from high-tax states will put up more of a fight. As of now, those deductions would disappear, though you would still get to deduct up to $10,000 in property taxes.

And any changes that affect the bill’s overall math will require countervailing alterations elsewhere.

Sacred cows are hard to slay.

A hearty congratulations to the Save Our Savings coalition, a financial services industry lobbying group that worked to keep the tax benefits for retirement savings (and the ever-increasing balances in members’ accounts) as they are. Despite all the chatter about reducing the amount you could put in 401(k) accounts and other workplace savings plans before paying income taxes, no lowered cap emerged after all.

That’s not surprising when you consider recent history. When President Barack Obama tried to place some limits on 529 college savings accounts, the blowback was so severe that he backed down within days. It turns out that Americans don’t like to be punished for doing the right thing, financially, for themselves and their families.

Hence the lowered cap on the mortgage interest deduction that also emerged Thursday, which should still encourage some people to buy real estate and use mortgage payments as a forced savings vehicle. The deduction would remain intact for current homeowners.

For people buying in the future (which the bill defines as Nov. 2, 2017, or later), mortgage interest deductions would be allowed only on loans up to $500,000, down from the current cap of $1 million. Moreover, only debt from primary residences would count toward that limit, and you could not include any interest from home equity loans or lines of credit that you took out on that new home.

But how hard will the real estate sales and home builder lobbies push back, and will they succeed?

Our own behavior.

While we cannot be sure exactly how much more or less money we might all have without redoing our taxes once a bill, if any, becomes law, it would be a mistake to try to predict how we’ll all react once we do know.

In the wake of the last big tax reform effort in 1986, the rules changed on the deductibility of credit-card interest. That didn’t keep card companies from devising all sorts of clever ways to induce people to spend and borrow much, much more.

Photo

Outside actors may have an impact on us, too. If state and local taxes become more expensive because of federal changes in their deductibility, state legislatures might then come under pressure to lower taxes.

Our own changing lives.

The biggest question mark for any of us comes from the unknowable future.

Will we change jobs? Earn more? Have kids? Help our adult children? Retire early because of our own choice, or choices made by employers who no longer want us around? These things matter so much more than any tax rules. Depending on how our lives change, any tax changes may help or hurt.

Changing tax rates over time.

When all of Washington is occupied with today’s proposed tax changes, it’s easy to forget that we’ve been here before and will be here again. Nearly every recent president has taken his shot at revising the system. And while the proposals here are potentially farther reaching, future politicians will make changes, too.

“In the back of my mind, I don’t anticipate taxes staying low for a long period of time,” said Julie Welch, an accountant and financial planner in Leawood, Kan.

After all, we’re adding to the national debt here in the hopes of stoking growth. If that doesn’t work, it won’t change the fact that Medicare and Medicaid will cost ever more money as the population ages. Something will have to give, and because Medicare is one of the most sacred cows of all, we’re more likely to raise taxes again than to make older people pay more for their health care.

Changing tax rules over time.

Our retirement accounts seem safe for now, though it wouldn’t be surprising to see the tax rules for 401(k)’s and similar workplace savings accounts back on the table next week or next year.

In the meantime, consider the possibilities. If more people keep saving in Roth retirement accounts of various sorts, where you don’t get a tax break when you put aside the money but it comes out free of income taxes after decades of appreciation, the balances will one day dwarf what sits in them today. And as they grow, legislators will be tempted to cap their size or to tax withdrawals.

This possibility has to be on the mind of any prudent financial planner working with younger clients who have the most time to save, given how often wholesale changes to Roth accounts have already come under consideration.

“It’s disconcerting to me that planning based on the promise of certain rules and taxation levels is actually being second-guessed after clients had put money into that vehicle,” said Katie Brewer, a financial planner in Garland, Tex., whose clients tend to be in their late 30s.

But that is just how things are going to go with this and so many other tax rules, whether 529 accounts or mortgage interest. So what is there to do in the absence of any certainty?

Avoid rash or unnecessary decisions, and remember that maximizing flexibility is always the best strategy. Be wary of home purchases that depend on tax laws’ staying the same. Invest in enrichment for your kids for the pure fun and joy of learning, but also so they might someday earn scholarships in case your savings plan doesn’t work out perfectly.

And when it comes to retirement, this is an excellent moment to be reacquainting ourselves with what the accountants and financial planners refer to as tax diversification.

In the same way that it’s smart to have a mix of investments that might perform differently at different times, it’s best to divide money among various tax-favored accounts. If you have money in a 401(k) or I.R.A., a Roth account and a normal taxable brokerage account (where you’d tally up your long-term capital gains when you withdraw money, under an entirely different set of tax rules), you should have at least some choices come retirement time.

At that point, you can make the withdrawal from the account that serves your tax goals at that moment.

There is one thing we do know for sure in all of this tax talk: Reformers come, and reformers go. We, however, must persist for six or seven decades of adult living and financial planning, and the only way to do that while staying sane is to give ourselves as much room to maneuver as possible.",Why It’s Too Soon to Predict What the Tax Changes Will Mean for You,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/your-money/tax-plan-changes-predict.html

There’s no magic formula for getting into a selective college, but over a decade covering admissions for The Chronicle of Higher Education, I’ve picked up a thing or two. These takeaways, based on hundreds of interviews with admissions deans over the years, may help you navigate the process.

Admissions decisions aren’t all about you.

When colleges choose applicants, they’re juggling competing goals, like increasing diversity and bringing in more revenue. Admissions officers aren’t looking for students who fit just one description — say, those who’ve earned all A’s or won the most awards. So don’t take rejection personally.

Grades and test scores still carry the most weight.

Colleges often say they want to get to know the real you, but that’s probably true only if your academic accomplishments (and the rigor of courses you’ve taken) pass muster.

You’re more than a number.

After colleges identify a big batch of students with outstanding credentials, differences among them become more important, admissions deans say. Among some of the attributes they tell me they would like to see evidence of (in essays, extracurricular activities, recommendations) are: leadership, risk taking, emotional intelligence, fire for learning, critical thinking, curiosity, empathy, optimism, grit, perseverance and the ability to overcome obstacles.

Express your authentic self.

Overwhelmed by slick, boastful essays, colleges are eager for what they call “authentic” glimpses of applicants — their experiences, passions and goals. Some deans believe they’ll get deeper insight through alternative formats like videos, pictures, audio files or documents (an Advanced Placement English paper, maybe). A handful of prestigious schools, including Yale, the University of Chicago, Pomona College, Reed College and the University of Rochester, recently introduced this option. As with essays, too much polish is no good, deans say, so you might think twice about hiring a professional videographer. At Yale, about 400 applicants (out of nearly 33,000) for this year’s freshman class sent in something in an alternative format. In at least one case, the submission — a video showing leadership and impact on others — was, the dean told me, a “difference maker.”",10 Things to Know About Getting Into Your Dream College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/education/edlife/admissions-tips-on-getting-into-dream-college.html

“You terrorist,” one man is heard saying in a video they uploaded to Facebook. “You little monkey.” Then, following Mr. Dastyari around the pub, they continue to throw insults his way. “Why don’t you go back to Iran, you terrorist?”

The lawmaker initially tried to brush the insults aside but then called them out.

“Honestly, I think you guys are a bunch of racists. I don’t have time for you,” said Mr. Dastyari, who is of Iranian heritage and a nonpracticing Muslim.

But I was not alone in wondering.

Paul Cooper, the grandson of Besse Cooper, who wore the oldest-living-person-on-Earth mantle in 2012, summed up for me the zeitgeist’s love-hate relationship with extreme longevity: “People would say ‘That’s amazing,”’ he said of the reactions to his grandmother, who died at 116. “Then in the next breath, they would say, ‘I don’t want to live that long.”’

As I probed the happiness quotient of supercentenarians, I also tried, in interviews with the story’s subjects but also with my own friends and family, to unpack the reasons for our apprehension.

Maybe it was that we associate old age with illness?

But supercentenarians, as the 110-and-older crowd are known, are remarkably healthy on average until shortly before death. The idea, as longevity researchers will assure you, is to lengthen not life span but “health span.”

Were we worried about loneliness?

But with a magic supercentenarian-inspired drug, we would all live to somewhere near the limits of the human life span (which appears to be around 120).

Or going broke?

But one line of economic thought holds that, rather than plunging us into poverty, societal wealth would boom as a result of plummeting health care costs and increased productivity.

It was an email from my father, who is 74 and recently retired, that rang the most true to me on this front. During the time I was working on this story — which I started in 2014 and proceeded to report in fits and starts — he took to sending me old photographs of myself and family members, often with subject lines like “gather ye rosebuds while ye may.”

While these may be a form of meta-commentary on the bittersweet passage of time, sometimes they seem more like an admonition: Stop rewriting those nut grafs and get out of the house; life (as he also has often told me) “is not a dress rehearsal.”

The most visceral fear, when I explored this with others, too, seemed to be that having extra time later could make us squander the time we have now. And yet, from all I could glean about supercentenarians from their family members, media reports, and James Clement, the collector of their DNA, they were nearly all inveterate gatherers of rosebuds.

To my indelicate question, Mr. Matthews answered that yes, he did indeed still enjoy life, and never had stopped. In this he was joined by fellow supercentenarians James McCoubrey, who frequented senior online chat rooms, pretending he was merely in his 70s, Will Miles Clark, who had just driven himself from Tucson, Az., to a family birthday party in Denver, Colo when he donated his DNA, and Goldie Michelson, an avid reader of library books.

Time was of the essence in this situation, in part because whales that come near land are at risk of suffocation and organ failure.

“If you’re 60,000 pounds and your body is meant to float around then gravity can take its toll,” said Regina Asmutis-Silvia, the director of the North American office of Whale and Dolphins Conservation, a nonprofit that has assisted with whale strandings in the United States.

In addition, the shock of being stranded evokes a stress response.

“Elevated levels of adrenaline also take toll on the organs,” Ms. Asmutis-Silvia said. It’s similar to that of a human that has been in a car accident, she added.

It’s unclear why the pod of whales swam so close to shore. Sperm whales, which are listed as an endangered species, are the largest of the toothed whales. They are not usually found in waters less than 984 feet deep, and prefer areas two times deeper than that, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries.

In February, more than 650 pilot whales became stranded at the northern tip of South Island in New Zealand for reasons that were also unknown, and about 400 of them died. Pathologists hoped to find answers by studying some of the dead animals.

And in April, officials said they were investigating an “alarming” number of humpback whale strandings along the Atlantic coast.

There are multiple reasons these events can happen, Ms. Asmutis-Silvia said, including navigational error, changes in the environment, a wayward hunt for food or tidal changes.

Sperm whales tend to travel as a group and are unlikely to abandon their podmates.

Still, he is taking no chances — his bulging war chest makes him a particularly imposing front-runner.

He will add to it this week as he heads to California, with stops in San Francisco and Beverly Hills, and an itinerary typical of his big-money fund-raising calendar. Donors will be asked for as much as $50,000 to rub shoulders with the governor at the home of Jeff Shell, the chairman of Universal Filmed Entertainment Group. Other boldfaced names on the invitation include the CBS chief executive, Leslie Moonves; the Disney chief, Bob Iger, and Jeffrey Katzenberg, co-founder of DreamWorks Animation.

Even if Mr. Cuomo ends his 2018 re-election with a sizable surplus, he cannot use his state account to fund a potential presidential campaign because those funds are not transferable. But Mr. Cuomo’s vast network of large donors would be the envy of most politicians, and his patrons could always spend millions on an independent super PAC.

Nonetheless, the overwhelming reliance on big checks makes Mr. Cuomo an outlier even among the best fund-raisers in the country.

Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, famous for his connections to wealthy donors as a top fund-raiser for the Clintons, raised over $1 million from contributions of $100 or less in his 2013 campaign. Mr. Cuomo has raised around $164,000 in such contributions in his 2010, 2014 and 2018 campaigns — combined.

Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas — a Republican who has the most campaign money in the country, $41 million — has raised over $2.8 million from nearly 75,000 contributions of $200 or less since his 2014 re-election, according to his campaign officials.

Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor of California and a leading Democratic candidate for governor in 2018, has one of the largest campaign treasuries in the nation, with $16 million. In the first six months of 2017, he had 34,096 donors who gave $200 or less, his campaign said.

Mr. Newsom’s median donation during that period was $10; Mr. Cuomo’s was $2,500. Mr. Newsom raised over $668,000 from such donors, compared to roughly $5,000 for Mr. Cuomo.

“The governor has received contributions of all sizes from thousands of supporters, and these varying donations help bolster his strong progressive agenda to improve the lives of all New Yorkers.” said William J. Mulrow, Mr. Cuomo’s campaign chairman. “We look forward to building on that record in the third term.”

Mr. Cuomo’s campaign account has grown by over $23.6 million since the start of 2015 but only roughly $30,000 came from individual donors who gave less than $200, the federal threshold for disclosure.

“Small-dollar fund-raising and online fund-raising has been a nonnegotiable for both Obama campaigns, for Bernie and Hillary,” said Betsy Hoover, the director of digital organizing for President Obama’s 2012 campaign. “It’s hard to imagine what a serious presidential looks like that doesn’t get that kind of buy-in and participation from a broader swath of donors.”

In the first six months of this year, Mr. Cuomo raised over $5 million, but reported fewer than 100 total small donors who collectively gave less than $5,000. Over that same period, Mr. Cuomo earned far more in interest and dividends on his deposited donations; over $100,000 was paid on June 30.

“It shows who he does appeal to — which is powerful, vested, moneyed interests,” said Stephanie Miner, a Democrat and the mayor of Syracuse who is contemplating challenging Mr. Cuomo in a primary.

If she were to run, Ms. Miner said her campaign would follow “the Bernie Sanders, Howard Dean, Daily Kos model” of seeking small contributions online.

Mr. Cuomo has long resisted investing capital to create a formidable digital footprint for his campaigns, according to past advisers.

“Governor Cuomo set out a transformational plan to restore New York to greatness and has spent three and half years making that plan a reality,” his home page says.

Mr. Cuomo has been governor for nearly seven years.

“Politics changed in the last few years and Andrew Cuomo hasn’t shown that he’s noticed,” said Zephyr Teachout, the then-little-known professor who challenged Mr. Cuomo for the Democratic nomination in 2014. “The deep, legitimate anger at big corporate monopolies is not something Andrew Cuomo understands. In fact, that’s his donor base.”

Past and present advisers to Mr. Cuomo say the governor has long been in his element wooing the wealthy for large checks. In September, he hosted a fund-raiser at Madison Square Garden during a Paul McCartney concert.

In December, Mr. Cuomo is throwing a birthday fund-raiser that will feature former President Bill Clinton and a performance by Jon Bon Jovi. Top-tier access to the event, which includes a private reception with the governor, will cost $50,000.

Mr. Cuomo did hold a relatively rare “grass-roots” event last Thursday at Hudson Terrace in Manhattan with $100 tickets and a “limited number” of $50 spots available.

One reason small donations are so critical for federal races is the far more restrictive giving limits. Presidential candidates can only raise money in $2,700 increments for the primary; in New York, Mr. Cuomo can raise up to $65,100 for his re-election.

Joe Trippi, who served as campaign manager for Mr. Dean’s 2004 presidential campaign, which pioneered raising smaller contributions online, said Mr. Cuomo still has the time and resources to cultivate a small-donor network.

“The requirement to do that is a message that energizes people and they’re excited about,” he said. “We haven’t seen that from him yet.”

Mr. Cuomo has a long way to go to catch up to past presidential contenders’ small donor programs.

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Hillary Clinton’s campaign raised 18 percent of its funds from donations less than $200; Mr. Obama raised 32 percent of his funds from such donors in 2012. Mr. Sanders raised 87 percent, according to his campaign.

Mr. Cuomo? Just above 0.1 percent.

A pitched battle certainly now seems to be underway — in hospitals and on the streets, in local assemblies and courts throughout the country.

Early this year, a major public hospital in Rome listed two job openings for gynecologists, specifying that it was seeking candidates who were not conscientious objectors. The Italian Bishops’ Conference denounced the ad as discriminatory, but a local court said it was legal. In August, an administrative court in Rome ruled that medical personnel could not invoke conscientious objection to refuse prescribing birth-control pills or withhold certificates of pregnancy, which women seeking an abortion need. Local media called the decision a “revolution.”

Almost as soon as Law 194 was passed in 1978, the Church and its political proxy then, the Christian Democratic Party, tried to have it repealed. A referendum was held in 1981, but voters rejected the idea — roundly, by a margin of 2 to 1. Having failed to change the law, the Church then set out to exploit its internal contradictions — which it had helped create.

Even as Law 194 guarantees the right to an abortion, it “recognizes the social value of motherhood.” According to Angela Balzano, a researcher in philosophy and bioethics at the University of Bologna, that built-in tension, along with “the loophole provided by the clause on conscientious objection,” was an attempt to mediate between “two irreconcilable positions” in the late 1970s: the abortion-rights agenda of the Radical Party, a leading left-wing party, and the anti-abortion Catholics. She called this “a clear case of judicial antinomy.”

Four decades later, it’s apparent who has benefited from that weakness, and this result is no accident. Pope Francis himself, speaking at a gathering of Italian Catholic physicians in 2014, encouraged doctors to make “brave choices that go against the current,” referring pointedly to conscientious objection and abortion.

Although the Christian Democrats are no longer, Catholicism remains a major political force. The religious movement Comunione e Liberazione (Communion and Liberation), whose stated mission is to promote the “education to the Christian faith” and comes under the pope’s direct authority, has thousands of supporters — some say many thousands — including in hospitals, universities and women’s clinics, and among politicians in center-right parties, like those who opposed Mr. Borraccino’s law in Apulia.

In addition to legalizing abortion, Law 194 called for establishing specialized women’s clinics. But after years of cuts to the state health care system, many clinics today are Catholic, and those refuse to provide even information or basic services to women seeking an abortion. What’s more, they are partly funded with taxpayer money: 0.8 percent of personal taxes are directly allocated to the Church, unless taxpayers specifically ask to opt out. So much for the separation of Church and state.

The law granting women access to abortion has been gutted, Assunta Sarlo, a journalist and activist with the feminist group Usciamo dal Silenzio (Let’s End the Silence), told me, partly “because the religious forces have been able to count on political allies in what remains a strongly Catholic country.” But it’s also, she said, “because the reputation of abortion is such that choosing to be a gynecologist who carries out this type of procedure is akin to career suicide.”

Opinion polls suggest that the vast majority of Italians still support access to abortion. But some three-quarters of the population also call themselves Catholic, and so even for some Italians who support women’s right to terminate a pregnancy, abortion still carries a stigma. And that’s just the kind of tension that the Church has been expert at exploiting — at a great cost to women, as well as the rule of law, in Italy.","Abortion in Italy, a Right Wronged",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/opinion/abortion-italy-conscientious-objectors.html

Yet at this year’s races, on Sunday, the vision of unity carried new weight. The reason was a surprising one: a call for the return of Prime Minister Saad Hariri — Rafik’s son — from Saudi Arabia. He is no more a universally beloved figure than his father was.

But it was the eighth day since he unexpectedly declared his resignation from the Saudi capital, Riyadh. He remains stranded there, widely seen as a captive, literally or figuratively, of his Saudi patrons, a pawn in their efforts to isolate their regional rival, Iran, and its ally, Hezbollah. (He insisted he was “free” in a televised interview.)

When Lebanese politicians declared the marathon a rally for Mr. Hariri’s return, I expected mass rolling of eyes. An axiom of marathon day is that it is a time to set aside politics. But when young men handed out baseball caps reading, “We want our PM back,” many runners put them on.

Billboards showed Mr. Hariri running in last year’s race with the slogans, “We are all waiting for you” and “Running For You.” People snapped selfies with them. Other signs displayed an Arabic hashtag, #WeAreAllSaad.

It was not that people had forgotten that Mr. Hariri presides over a weak government and has failed to win concessions from Hezbollah through confrontation or compromise. Nor had they abandoned the widespread conviction that he and his rivals play on sectarian divisions to keep power and wealth concentrated in the hands of a tiny, largely hereditary political elite.

It was just that enough was enough. Generations of foreign meddling aside, the belief that another country had effectively kidnapped Lebanon’s prime minister was the last straw, and people wanted to see the move backfire. As one commenter put it on Twitter, Lebanon was tired of outside powers acting like it was “not a real place.”

Somehow, a humiliating moment for Lebanon became an occasion for national unity, even pride.

Lebanon’s most earnest slogans are often their own parodies. A perfect example is the hashtag #LiveLoveLebanon, invented by the Ministry of Tourism.

Lebanese social media users quickly embraced it to comment on the country’s beaches (and their scent of sewage), its ski slopes (and mountainside garbage dumps), its wine industry (and hash factories), its swanky (and overcharging) restaurants and its cedar forests (what’s left of them) dating to the Song of Solomon.

The hashtag is used in posts about the country’s resilience and diversity in the face of efforts to divide it from within and without, and also to tag anecdotes about petty corruption and glacial internet speeds.

#WeAreAllSaad is much the same. By definition, politically divided Lebanon is not all Saad.

Even to his mostly Sunni constituents, Mr. Hariri has never matched his father’s charisma or effectiveness. One telling image, a faded poster on a road in the Bekaa Valley, shows him dwarfed by a translucent likeness of his father, a more imposing figure with a much more regal mustache, looming behind him.

It reminds me of Patrick Swayze’s spirit in the movie “Ghost,” hovering vaporously behind Demi Moore at her potter’s wheel.

Yet the fact that Mr. Hariri’s current predicament is seen by many Lebanese as somehow pathetic has not stopped him from becoming a symbol of Lebanese sovereignty. Even the flood of new jokes at his expense do not contradict the point.

Anglophone Lebanese cannot stop playing on “Saad” and “sad.” Journalists have drawn half-joking parallels to the disappearance of Moussa Sadr, the Lebanese Shiite leader who disappeared in Libya, believed kidnapped, in 1976.

After our race, my daughter and I followed some friends, fellow runners, to a cafe at Zaitounay Bay, a seaside development where dozens of gleaming, rarely used yachts are anchored. It is just the kind of glitzy privatization of public space that gets both celebrated and lampooned with the #LiveLoveLebanon hashtag, and an emblem of angst over the elder Hariri’s redevelopment strategy.

Our friend Imad Shehadi, who grew up watching his father run an emergency room in wartime Beirut and is no fan of politicians, explained over breakfast why the marathon meant more this year.

“It’s a mark of defiance against the forces of evil, against the forces on every side that want to interfere with Lebanon,” he said.

“To me it’s more resilience,” his wife, Carla Huijer Shehadi, said. “The resilience of Lebanon and the Lebanese, who just want to live life, no matter what.”

We strolled home along the boardwalk, their boys and my daughter stopping to admire a lavish boat christened “Thanx Dad 4.” We passed the spot where Rafik Hariri’s motorcade was blown up. We followed the marathon route along the seaside corniche, past snack bars and fishermen and picnicking families, toward the place where the American Embassy stood before it was bombed in 1983.

The racecourse went past several civil war massacre sites and refugee camps and the vibrant neighborhoods that cluster at either end of a city no longer physically divided. Waiters at our favorite cafe, exiles from today’s war in Syria, high-fived passing runners. Near the finish line, a booth offered manicures to a subset of joggers in sequined velour.

And it is out of our collective and respective cowardice — our refusal to risk, to love and to combat our mutual cynicism — that this letter of love arises.
Many will also criticize us, saying that love is too simplistic, that the problem between North Korea and the United States is too ideologically and geopolitically complicated.
Among the very real and central challenges of radical love is to adhere to the moral mandate to love our neighbors and enemies as we would love ourselves.
This is the tradition of radical love most powerfully and persuasively articulated and represented by Martin Luther King Jr.","We know that love is dangerous, because it requires facing one’s own brokenness and vulnerability. Yet both of our nations are morally broken, imperfect. So we speak with the impassioned words of Mahatma Gandhi: “I offer you peace. I offer you love. I offer you friendship. I see your beauty. I hear your need. I feel your feelings.”

This letter fervently asks more from you and from the United States. The writer James Baldwin, one of our most prophetic voices, wrote: “One can give nothing whatever without giving oneself — that is to say, risking oneself. If one cannot risk oneself, then one is simply incapable of giving.” Neither of our nations has much to give the other because each has failed to risk itself. And it is out of our collective and respective cowardice — our refusal to risk, to love and to combat our mutual cynicism — that this letter of love arises. It serves as an intervention as we face the potential horrors of unspeakable mass death. We stand with our brother Martin Luther King Jr., who refused “to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway into the hell of nuclear annihilation.”

There are many here in the United States who will say that this letter is absurd, useless, even treasonous. Well, if love is treasonous, then we take joy in it. We revel in speaking out against hatred; inhumanity; divisiveness; discourse mired in immature name-calling; ugly, disparaging remarks; talk of destruction and obliteration; and the potential of miscalculation and nuclear conflagration. We prefer to stand on the “treasonous” side of Jesus, who dared to love.

We are traitors to those who reject mutual respect and who believe that there is no place for love as a binding force greater than mutual bullying and provocation. We are traitors to our country’s divisive rhetoric, filled with militarism, hatred, blood lust and warmongering, just as we stand opposed to yours, which threatens not only us, but also your neighbors — that is, your own brothers and sisters, and even your own people. As men of color, we know the semblance of that threat from within our own country.

To hate requires so little; to love requires doing what may feel impossible, because it means to lay down the sword and stretch out your hands, your arms, your hearts, to each other. Many will also criticize us, saying that love is too simplistic, that the problem between North Korea and the United States is too ideologically and geopolitically complicated. Those people fail to imagine with their hearts. Dr. King said: “We are inevitably our brother’s keeper because we are our brother’s brother. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.” And Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, another prophetic American voice of love, asked us, “How many disasters do we have to go through in order to realize that all of humanity has a stake in the liberty of one person; whenever one person is offended, we are all hurt.”

That kind of love refuses to hate, it refuses to believe that we are “enemies” by birth. We are brothers and sisters born of a common humanity. We believe in a love that remembers the humanity that binds us together, that opens us to hear the other’s voice, the other’s mourning. Then again, perhaps Baldwin was correct, “There are too many things we do not wish to know about ourselves.” Yet we believe that reciprocal love can take us to that place together and heal our wounds.

David Kyuman Kim: These feel like especially loveless times. We write from the conviction that the values of a love-driven politics can transform how we engage each other not only as nations but also as human beings. Which is to say, a love-driven politics insists that we seek compassion, generosity, kindness, forgiveness and mercy for each other as much as we do for ourselves.

Our president was elected to represent our people, but he has not represented the best of us. He has instead chosen to display only our basest traits. While he is not the first president to speak and act with hubris and arrogance, he has chosen belligerence over diplomacy, bullying over accord, insult over care. He represents a strand and strain of the American experiment that stubbornly holds on to the misguided notion that we are a nation of destiny and superiority, strengthened on legacies of white supremacy and rapacious capitalism. He has exacted those misguided ideals by treating you with disrespect and disregard, all the while belittling you as a leader of your own people, and you, in turn have done the same.

As a Korean-American, I have to acknowledge you both as one of my people and very much not of my people. My mother’s family is from North Korea, and so in some very real ways, you and I are of common stock. But a land does not make for family. If anything, you and your father have shown how land and nation can destroy families and traumatize them for generations. You are the leader of a nation whose people have suffered at the service of a political vision. At what cost has your loyalty to power come to your people, let alone to your humanity?

My mother’s family fled North Korea because of the forces of war that are all too similar to the enmities that are threatening us today. And it was the consequences of the Korean War and the havoc it wreaked on my people in South Korea that eventually drove my family to the United States. And through this migration and growing up in white-supremacist America, I was transformed from our common stock to a Korean-American dedicated to the ways of love.

Indeed, as a Korean brother I have been forged by my inheritance from Christianity and Confucianism. This means that my witness to you is born of traditions of love and ethical responsibility. Among the very real and central challenges of radical love is to adhere to the moral mandate to love our neighbors and enemies as we would love ourselves. This is especially challenging at a moment in which love has been hard to find and discern. For those of us who lament the ascendancy of our current president, we have had to learn how to love ourselves once again.

We write you today not only because of what you are hearing from us — the United States — but, more important, because of all the crucial things you are not hearing. As defenders of civil rights against racism, we come from a tradition not well represented or well understood, yet one that has transformed the course of our nation’s history and the lives and legacies of peoples across the globe.

This is the tradition of radical love most powerfully and persuasively articulated and represented by Martin Luther King Jr. This is a tradition that insists that love has the power to bind us together in a common purpose, that love gives us the confidence and courage to stand up to injustice and suffering. It is a tradition that holds us accountable not simply to ourselves but to a vision of human existence that insists that we can be with one another, hold one another up, and fortify one another’s humanity in what Dr. King called “the beloved community.”

We reach out to you from this tradition that holds the value of speaking truth to power with love. This is a calling. It is our vocation. We have no choice but to strive to live up to the examples of Dr. King and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, of activists like Fannie Lou Hamer and Grace Lee Boggs. These heroic figures have been exceptions to the insidious rule of an American legacy of white supremacy and imperialism that has left the least among us in utter despair. This tradition of radical love is an American tradition, even though it has drawn deeply and powerfully from people like Gandhi and Thich Nhat Hanh.

We come to you as citizens of an America not yet fully realized, one that insists that the ways of love can be the ways of democracy, that the challenge of loving one’s neighbors and enemies is fundamentally a call for freedom and justice and hope. We write to you with love and an appeal for forgiveness and mercy because history and our lot demand this of us. And our hope is that it will demand the same of our fellow citizens.

Wishing you peace and love,

“It’s drip by drip, cut by cut,” said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Alabama’s senior lawmaker. “It doesn’t look good.”

Mr. Moore responded with fury, not only refusing to quit the race but stating that the person who needed to step aside was Mr. McConnell.

“He has failed conservatives and must be replaced,” said Mr. Moore in a statement, appending President Trump’s trademark: “#draintheswamp.”



Publicly, Mr. McConnell, appearing at a news conference in Louisville, said he was “looking at” drafting a write-in candidate for the Dec. 12 special election. Privately, Mr. McConnell was doing more than merely looking. One idea being discussed, first brought up by two different White House officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, would be for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to run as either a write-in candidate or to be appointed to what was his seat should Mr. Moore win and be immediately removed from office.

Mr. McConnell is supportive of the idea and discussed it on Monday in a telephone call with Vice President Mike Pence that was chiefly about the Republican tax overhaul proposal, according to party officials briefed on the call. Mr. Sessions remains popular among Alabama Republicans, but his relationship with Mr. Trump has frayed since he recused himself from the investigation of the role that Russia played in last year’s presidential campaign.

The swap would be something of a win-win for Mr. McConnell and Mr. Trump — the senator is eager to rid himself of Mr. Moore and the president has been open about his disappointment with Mr. Sessions.

That they even discussed such a radical maneuver spoke to the desperate straits that Republicans find themselves in. If Doug Jones, the Democratic nominee, wins, it would narrow the Republican advantage in the Senate to a single seat.

But Republicans increasingly believe that enduring such a narrow majority may be a price they are willing to pay if it means keeping Mr. Moore from their ranks.

Should Mr. Moore prevail, Republicans believe the debate over whether he should be allowed to take and keep his seat could drag on for months. The Republicans’ legislative agenda, including on taxes, already faces uncertain prospects and could be swallowed in a maelstrom of controversy around Mr. Moore and his fitness to serve.

The implications for the 2018 elections could be even graver, Republicans fear, with several party strategists predicting that Democrats would brand them as the party of child sex abuse.

For their part, Alabama Republicans are warning of the perils of barring Mr. Moore from the Senate. A write-in campaign, they suggested, would prove fruitless and perhaps help the Democrats, while a move to block or expel Mr. Moore would further poison the relationship between the Republican Party’s leaders and its populist wing.

“If the people of this state go forward and select their U.S. senator as Roy Moore, it will be because there is a deep suspicion of what has been coined as the establishment in D.C.,” said State Senator Phil Williams, whose district includes Mr. Moore’s home county. “And if the establishment then chooses and tries to unseat, or in some way disavow, that candidate, it will create a backlash the likes of which the party has never seen before.”

Democrats, who have been restrained about their prospects in such a conservative state, tried to avoid inserting themselves into the Republican crossfire. But, they said, as more information comes out, Mr. Moore’s case that he is being smeared in a single newspaper article will crumble. By Monday night, an article in The New Yorker asserted that Mr. Moore had been barred from the mall in his hometown, Gadsden, for bothering young women, a memory that many in the town said they shared, though no one has found direct evidence.

“The more people that come out of the woodwork, the more women with similar stories, the more credible it becomes,” said Zac McCrary, a Democratic pollster based in Alabama. “It’s going to become easier to see through Roy Moore’s nondenial denials.”

Mr. Jones is also quietly benefiting from the support of national liberals. He is to be in Washington on Tuesday for a $500 per person cocktail reception partly sponsored by a raft of well-known Democrats, including Senator Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, according to an invitation circulating among Democratic lobbyists.

Mr. Jones has been raising substantial money out-of-state — Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut helped him bring in $125,000 with a single email and handful of Twitter messages — and has had Alabama’s airwaves nearly to himself in recent weeks: He has aired nearly $2 million worth of commercials since Mr. Moore won the nomination in September while Mr. Moore has spent only about $300,000 on ads, according to strategists tracking the race.

Mr. Moore, because of his statewide fame, has never had to raise much money. But now that he is fighting for his political life, he urgently needs to recast the race to focus on some of Mr. Jones’s liberal views on guns and abortion.

But he may not have the money to mount any such assault and, with his party leaders shunning him, it is not clear who will fill the gap. Mr. Moore tried one approach Monday afternoon: trying to tap into the grass-roots loathing on the right toward Mr. McConnell.

In the terror-struck and vertiginous days after Donald Trump’s election a year ago, as I tried to make sense of America’s new reality, I called people who lived, or had lived, under authoritarianism to ask what to expect. I wasn’t looking for concrete predictions — one of the disorienting things about that moment was that no one, no matter how learned, had any idea what was happening — but for insights into how the texture of life changes when an autocratic demagogue is in charge.

A secular Turkish journalist told me, her voice sad and weary, that while people might at first pour into the streets to oppose Trump, eventually the protests would probably die out as a sense of stunned emergency gave way to the slog of sustained opposition. The Russian dissident writer Masha Gessen warned that there’s no way, with a leader who lays siege to the fabric of reality, to fully hold on to a sense of what’s normal. “You drift, and you get warped,” she told me.

They were both right. The country has changed in the past year, and many of us have grown numb after unrelenting shocks. What now passes for ordinary would have once been inconceivable. The government is under the control of an erratic racist who engages in nuclear brinkmanship on Twitter. He is dismantling the State Department, defending the hollowing out of the diplomatic corps by saying, on Fox News, “I’m the only one that matters.”

He publicly pressures the Justice Department to investigate his political opponents. He’s called for reporters to be jailed, and his administration demanded that a sportscaster who criticized him be fired. Official government statements promote his hotels. You can’t protest it all; you’d never do anything else. After the election, many liberals pledged not to “normalize” Trump. But one lesson of this year is that we don’t get to decide what normal looks like.

Last month Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, took an unannounced trip to Saudi Arabia, where he met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who later had a number of his rivals, including a Trump critic, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, put under arrest. In The Washington Post, David Ignatius described Kushner’s talks with Prince Mohammed this way: “The two princes are said to have stayed up until nearly 4 a.m. several nights, swapping stories and planning strategy.” A year ago, that sentence would have been unintelligible as a description of American diplomacy, even as a wry joke.

“For Trump supporters reflexively jumping to Moore’s defense, please stop making stupid arguments. You are hurting the president.”

Mr. Jennings, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, has a novel idea for how President Trump should respond to allegations against Roy S. Moore. The president should encourage the Alabama Republican party to withdraw Mr. Moore’s name from the slot, and urge voters to write in Attorney General Jeff Sessions for the position he left behind. It’ll be “zigging when everyone thinks he’s going to zag,” Mr. Jennings argues. Read more »

David Harsanyi in The Federalist:

“ ‘Due process’ shouldn’t be code for ‘Let’s dismiss anything inconvenient to our political fortunes.’ This isn’t a criminal proceeding.”

Mr. Harsanyi has a healthy dose of skepticism about the mainstream media, writing that “the establishment media gave former presidents and senators who were likely sexual predators virtual free passes for decades.” But that doesn’t dissuade him from considering The Washington Post’s article chronicling Mr. Moore’s alleged relationships with teenagers to be a “credible” and “solid piece of journalism.” It is fair, argues Mr. Harsanyi, to support Mr. Moore based on policy — like his views on abortion — despite these accusations. “But don’t tell me you’re sure Roy Moore is innocent.” Read more »

David French in National Review:



“Roy Moore will not lose his life, liberty, or property if voters reject his bid for high office.”

Mr. French reminds his readers that “Constitutional protections for due process apply when the state is attempting to deprive a person of ‘life, liberty, or property.’ ” It does not apply when you are at risk of being deprived of a seat in government. Just as it is “entirely fair for voters to analyze the available facts about Hillary Clinton’s email scandal [...] without waiting for the outcome of a civil or criminal proceeding,” so is it entirely fair to voters to assess Mr. Moore’s character based on reports in The Washington Post. People who know better, he writes, are disingenuously calling for due process, knowing full well that “it’s a good way to coax good people into ignoring problematic claims while soothing their guilty conscience.” Read more »

The “Salvator Mundi” is being sold by the family trust of the Russian billionaire collector Dmitry E. Rybolovlev, who bought it in 2013 for $127.5 million and had never exhibited the work in public before now. The sense that this is rare opportunity to view a Leonardo was elevated in New York, where no museum collection contains a painting by the artist.

The National Gallery of Art in Washington possesses the only example in North America. The museum paid over $5 million in a private transaction in 1967 (roughly $36.4 million in today’s dollars) to secure “Ginevra de’ Benci,” a portrait from the 1470s. No other painting by the artist has appeared on the open market in the last 100 years.

“It’s the 16th Leonardo painting,” said Dianne Dwyer Modestini, based in New York, who restored the “Salvator Mundi.” The painting, showing Christ with his right hand raised in blessing and his left holding a crystal orb, was bought by an unrecognized dealer in 2005, in an overpainted and damaged condition.

While Christie’s claims “an unusually uniform scholarly consensus” that the painting is by Leonardo, some respected experts on Renaissance art who have seen the work have failed to succumb to Stendhal syndrome.

“Even making allowances for its extremely poor state of preservation, it is a curiously unimpressive composition and it is hard to believe that Leonardo himself was responsible for anything so dull,” wrote Charles Hope, an emeritus professor at the Warburg Institute at the University of London, in his 2012 review of a National Gallery exhibition that included the “Salvator Mundi.”

Ms. Modestini, the restorer, said in an interview that she hopes the work will ultimately be on public view in a museum. “It’s easy to be negative about a damaged picture, and you can argue that a section of drapery might have been painted by a studio assistant, but this should be allowed to live as a Leonardo rather than be someone’s trophy,” she said.

Now, Mr. Sessions must contend with comments he made last month, in another hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. “I did not, and I’m not aware of anyone else that did,” Mr. Sessions told senators when asked whether he believed members of the campaign had communicated with Russians.

Democrats on the committee put Mr. Sessions on alert in a letter last week, saying that they would want clarification on “inconsistencies” between those statements and those of the two campaign advisers, George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, who have acknowledged having contact with Russians.

The White House will have its eye on his performance.

The White House will be carefully watching Mr. Sessions’s performance. The attorney general has been in hot water with the president since he decided in March to recuse himself from all matters related to Russia, leaving him without control over the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russian efforts to meddle in the election.

Any hiccups in Mr. Sessions’s testimony would most likely only make his problems at the White House worse.

Mr. Sessions will have to mind the partisan divide.

The House Judiciary Committee has a reputation as one of the most politically divided in Congress — and those differences are likely to be on plain display on Tuesday as both Republicans and Democrats wrestle with the sharp changes in policy at the Justice Department instituted under Mr. Sessions.

Republicans mostly approve of those changes, but Democrats will probably grill Mr. Sessions on the effects of curtailing the Obama-era enforcement of antidiscrimination laws, especially protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and the Trump administration’s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

Republicans, on the other hand, are almost certain to press Mr. Sessions on the progress of investigations into potential leaks of classified information, which have tripled under his watch, and into the handling of the Hillary Clinton email case by the Obama Justice Department.

But they will be pleased that Mr. Sessions is coming with good news. On Monday, the Justice Department notified the committee that senior prosecutors were looking into whether a special counsel should be appointed to investigate the Obama administration’s decision to allow a Russian nuclear agency to buy Uranium One, a company that owned access to uranium in the United States. The department will also examine whether any donations to the Clinton Foundation were tied to the approval. Republicans are investigating the matter themselves but have been clamoring for the department to get involved.

Then again, Mr. Sessions’s days at the department could be numbered.

The race to fill Mr. Sessions’s former Senate seat in Alabama has fallen into turmoil in recent days after five women accused the Republican nominee of misconduct when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Despite mounting accusations and calls by fellow Republicans, including the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, to step aside, the candidate, Roy S. Moore, has remained defiant.

That’s where Mr. Sessions comes in.

Two White House officials floated on Monday a scenario under consideration that would have Mr. Sessions either run for his old seat as a write-in candidate to challenge Mr. Moore or be appointed to it should Mr. Moore win and be immediately removed from office. Mr. McConnell is said to be supportive of the idea.

Though a long shot, the move could provide Republicans with a convenient — if awkward — solution to two issues: the prospect of Mr. Moore in the Senate and Mr. Trump’s frustration with Mr. Sessions. While Mr. Sessions remains extremely popular in the state, his relationship with Mr. Trump never really recovered after the attorney general’s recusal.",What to Watch For as Jeff Sessions Testifies About Russia Contacts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/us/politics/jeff-sessions-congress-russia.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“I believe the women, yes.”

With that statement, about accounts of lecherous behavior and child molestation by the Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said words that thousands of victims of sexual harassment and assault have waited in vain to hear.

Perhaps nobody should hold her breath expecting this will bring real, lasting change. Mr. Moore is too much of an extremist, making him already unpopular for even Republican leaders. But the flood of accusations against famous men in entertainment, the news media and politics has raised hope that women can come forward without fear to seek justice.

Mr. McConnell and a growing list of other Republicans have been pressing Mr. Moore to quit the race after four women — Leigh Corfman, Wendy Miller, Gloria Thacker Deason and Debbie Wesson Gibson — told The Washington Post that Mr. Moore had pursued them as teenagers when he was a prosecutor in his 30s. Ms. Corfman said that when she was 14, in his home, Mr. Moore undressed her to her underwear and placed her hand on his crotch. The molestation troubled her for years, she said. On Monday, a fifth woman, Beverly Young Nelson, said that when she was 16, Mr. Moore molested her in his car. The Post corroborated points of the first four women’s stories with friends and relatives, providing the kind of bulletproofing that women need when they accuse powerful men.

Mr. Moore’s accusers kept silent for years for fear of what’s happening now: their past relationships, family, friends, finances, political affiliations and every vowel and consonant of their stories being mined in a partisan effort to discredit them. The authors of the warped Pizzagate conspiracy fiction have revealed personal details about Ms. Corfman online. Breitbart, house organ of Steve Bannon’s solipsistic revolution, fruitlessly dispatched two “reporters” to Alabama to sift through the women’s lives for nuggets to shame them.

From 2010 to early this year, Ms. Adcock and Ms. Bray lobbied together for CropLife, which represents Syngenta and Monsanto, among other pesticide makers.
Ms. Bray confirmed that the group had discussed regulations about the use of pesticides near water.
Discussing policy related to the impact of pesticides on water is deemed off limits under Ms. Adcock’s ethics agreement.
In July, Ms. Adcock met with a delegation from Farm Credit, according to a participant.","In one meeting, Ms. Adcock discussed issues banned by the ethics agreement with an executive who had been her lobbying partner weeks earlier at CropLife, according to the accounts of participants and the visitor logs, obtained through a public records request by The New York Times and ProPublica.

Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the U.S.D.A. who also spoke on behalf of Ms. Adcock, said she had not violated her ethics agreement by meeting with her former industry allies. He also denied that Ms. Adcock had discussed issues related to her previous lobbying at the meeting, or that she had suggested that her deregulation team would be swamped by lobbyists if names of its members were released.

“The career ethics officers at U.S.D.A. agree that this is not a violation of the ethics agreement that Rebeckah Adcock signed,” said Mr. Murtaugh, citing a 2009 memo by the Office of Government Ethics.

Others dispute that interpretation of the memo; the ethics office declined to say whether the memo applied to the meeting, citing its policy not to discuss individual cases.

Ms. Adcock is scheduled to appear Tuesday before subcommittees of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which is tracking Mr. Trump’s deregulation effort. In announcing the hearing, the committee, led by Republicans, applauded the deregulation teams for making an “unprecedented reduction in the federal regulatory footprint.”

Republican members of the committee declined to comment about Ms. Adcock’s activities. Representative Elijah E. Cummings, the top Democrat on the committee, said that if Ms. Adcock had violated her ethics agreement, it contributed “to a troubling pattern of President Trump’s failure to ‘drain the swamp.’”

In February, Mr. Trump ordered major federal agencies to set up the deregulation teams, to fulfill a campaign promise to cut red tape for businesses. Corporations and industry groups quickly hired lawyers, lobbyists and economists to help them influence the process with billions of dollars at stake. The regulations under review cover a range of subjects, including the cleanliness of drinking water and the safety of highways.

The Trump administration has declined to make public the names of many members of the teams. It has also generally not provided records related to the teams’ calendars and correspondence.

A joint investigation published in July by The Times and ProPublica found that the teams included former employees of industry-financed organizations that oppose environmental regulations; lawyers who have represented companies in cases against federal regulators; and staff members of so-called political dark-money groups. Some are reviewing rules that their previous employers sought to weaken or kill, and at least two may be positioned to profit personally if certain regulations are undone. In all, the two news organizations have identified 112 current and former team members, including 41 with potential conflicts.

Several federal agencies have not yet released the names of people serving on deregulation task forces. We need your help finding them and figuring out what they’re doing. Got a tip? Email taskforce@nytimes.com or contact Danielle Ivory on the encrypted messaging app Signal at 917-280-2607.

At the meeting on Capitol Hill in September, Ms. Adcock lamented the scrutiny that her team was under, a House aide familiar with the exchange said. Ms. Adcock cited, in particular, public records requests for calendars and emails.

The Times and ProPublica asked for those records this year and have received only a few. Most other federal agencies have been similarly unresponsive. The visitor logs that have been obtained are often handwritten sign-in sheets. They appear to show only a fraction of meetings, and many are illegible. It is not known from the logs, for example, if Ms. Adcock or her team had met with environmental or science groups in addition to the industry representatives.

In response to questions from reporters about possible conflicts of interest, agency officials across the government have said the deregulation teams are abiding by strict ethical standards, including rules that bar them from working on issues directly affecting recent employers.

Records received through a Freedom of Information Act request show that Ms. Adcock entered such an agreement on April 26, pledging that she would “not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties in which I know CropLife America is a party or represents a party” for a year.

But in May, Kellie Bray, a lobbyist for CropLife, arrived for a meeting with Ms. Adcock, according to the visitor logs.

The two knew each other well. From 2010 to early this year, Ms. Adcock and Ms. Bray lobbied together for CropLife, which represents Syngenta and Monsanto, among other pesticide makers.

Disclosure records show that during those years the two advocated for the industry’s agenda at agencies, including the U.S.D.A. and the Environmental Protection Agency, and in Congress. They pushed CropLife’s interests on bills and regulations relating to the impact of pesticides on water and human health.

Ms. Adcock’s departure from CropLife left the trade association short a seasoned lobbyist, but gave it a valuable contact in the top ranks of the U.S.D.A.

Ms. Bray said in an interview that in May, Ms. Adcock had met with her and the Southern Crop Production Association, a CropLife affiliate. Ms. Bray said she had sat in on the meeting but hadn’t talked.

“I facilitated the introduction,” she said. “That is all.”

After the meeting, the Southern Crop Production Association, which represents pesticide manufacturers, formulators and distributors across the South, said on its website that “Rebeckah has an exceptional understanding regarding the many issues facing agriculture due, in large part, to her previous position with CLA,” using the acronym for CropLife America.

Among the topics discussed, according to the trade group’s website, were the tests that pesticides must undergo to prove they are safe and rules governing their use near water sources. The trade group did not respond to requests for comment. Ms. Bray confirmed that the group had discussed regulations about the use of pesticides near water.

Discussing policy related to the impact of pesticides on water is deemed off limits under Ms. Adcock’s ethics agreement. Mr. Murtaugh, the U.S.D.A. spokesman, said Ms. Adcock disputed that she had discussed any off-limits subject.

“If any participant declared concern regarding any issue precluded by Ms. Adcock’s agreement, she politely and firmly instructed them it was not a matter she could discuss or assist with,” he said.

He also said Ms. Adcock had instructed Ms. Bray not to participate in the meeting and did not recall her being in the room.

Mr. Murtaugh said a provision in the memorandum from the Office of Government Ethics allowed an appointee like Ms. Adcock to attend meetings with a former employer or client so long as five or more other stakeholders participated. In the May meeting, he said, four of the Southern Crop Production Association representatives were affiliated with individual companies: Syngenta, Albaugh, Triangle Chemical and Crop Production Services.

However, three of those companies are also members of the CropLife trade group, Ms. Adcock’s former employer. And they were attending in their capacity as the executive committee of the Southern Crop Production Association, according to the association’s website, not as individual company executives.

Walter M. Shaub Jr., who headed the Office of Government Ethics under President Barack Obama and during the early months of the Trump administration, said the provision cited by the U.S.D.A. did not apply to the ethics regulation in Ms. Adcock’s agreement. Even if it did apply, he said, the meeting lacked a necessary diversity because the participants were all affiliated with one trade group. He also said it was irrelevant that Ms. Bray hadn’t spoken.

“If she brought them there, signed into the sign-in log, attended the meeting that she may or may not have set up, it definitely counts as a meeting with her,” said Mr. Shaub, who has been critical of the Trump administration.

Before Ms. Adcock worked at CropLife, she served as a lobbyist for the farming industry at the American Farm Bureau Federation. Among its donors is Farm Credit, a lending institution. In July, Ms. Adcock met with a delegation from Farm Credit, according to a participant.

One of the executives who attended — Jeremy Brown, president of Broadview Agriculture, a Texas cotton producer — said in an interview that he knew Ms. Adcock from the Farm Bureau. For those who did not know her, Ms. Adcock explained her past lobbying on behalf of the farming industry, and she asked for recommendations on regulatory changes, he said.

“Any time you have people already familiar with the industry, it helps,” Mr. Brown said. “They can hopefully get their feet on the ground and get the work in.”

He said he had pushed Ms. Adcock to get cottonseed reclassified as an oil seed crop so cotton producers could be eligible again for certain government subsidies if revenue dropped. He also discussed what he termed overreach on clean-water rules.

“She was taking notes, being really receptive,” Mr. Brown said.

Another highlight, he said, was the access the group enjoyed. Never before had he attended a meeting in the private gathering room just outside the office of the secretary of agriculture.

Dr. Kathryn Backholer, an expert on the issue at Deakin University in Australia, said taxes on soda were “low-hanging fruit” in the fight against obesity, diabetes and other weight-related diseases because such drinks are easily categorized to tax and sensible to target because they “have little or no nutritional value.”

Dr. Backholer and other experts said the turning point for soda tax proponents came in 2014, when Mexico — Coca-Cola’s biggest consumer market by per capita consumption — approved a 10 percent tax.

Mexico also showcased how dirty the fight could get.

Last year, numerous advocates of a proposal to double Mexico’s tax to 20 percent received strings of upsetting and fraudulent texts from unknown numbers. One man got a message saying his daughter had been seriously injured; another found a text saying his wife was having an affair; a third received a link to a funeral home. Spyware was found on the phones. The proposal failed.

Elsewhere in the world, soda companies have assiduously worked their government connections and economic clout. In internal company emails leaked to an American watchdog group last year, Coke executives described strategies for winning over government ministers and other officials in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, Portugal, and regions of Spain.

The Australian Beverages Council wrote in its 2016 annual report that fighting a soft drinks tax “has been consuming vast amounts of resources,” and that “our learnings from other markets through our international network tells us that these types of threats must be constantly challenged before they get before a parliament for debate.”

In Colombia, where soda is often cheaper than bottled water, the soda-tax fight took place in a key market for beverage makers. Sales volume of carbonated drinks here has climbed more than 25 percent over the past 15 years; during that same time in the United States, it fell 12 percent, according to Euromonitor, a market research firm.

Coke and Pepsi were far less visible in the Colombia battle, leaving the big national beverage company, Postobón, in the spotlight. Postobón, a drinks maker and distributor for Pepsi, is part of a huge conglomerate that includes sugar cane growers, sugar mills and the country’s biggest media company, RCN Televisión, which helped disseminate the anti-tax message. Postobón and RCN declined interview requests.

The stage was set for a clash between a powerful industry and a stubborn public advocate.

Showdown Over an Ad

In early 2016, Colombia, a nation of 49 million, was facing the unfamiliar prospect of stability and peace. After decades of civil war and narco-terrorism, Colombians were enjoying the fruits of an aggressive United States-backed military campaign that had largely decimated the country’s drug cartels. Unemployment was near historic lows, the poverty rate was dropping and millions were hopeful about the possibility of lasting peace with the country’s main rebel group, the FARC.

In March 2016, the country’s health minister, Alejandro Gaviria Uribe, proposed a 20 percent tax on soda and sugar-sweetened beverages — the equivalent of about 10 cents on a liter bottle — that became part of a larger tax overhaul backed by Colombia’s president and the Ministry of Finance.

“For the first time in our lives, we thought we might become a normal country and be able to deal with issues other than violence,” said Diana Guarnizo, a lawyer with Dejusticia, a rights group that helped promote the soda tax. “Here we were, an organization that had dealt with peace, violence, land reform and gross injustice, and suddenly we had the luxury to talk about what mothers are putting in their children’s lunchboxes.”

The measure was designed to inject $340 million a year into Colombia’s chronically underfunded national health care system, but Mr. Gaviria had a larger goal: to dampen soda consumption in a country with an obesity rate that had tripled since 1980 to 19 percent of adults. The fastest growth had occurred among Colombian youth from ages 5 to 17. Each year, 4,000 people age 30 to 70 die from obesity-related illnesses like heart disease and diabetes, the Health Ministry said.",She Took On Colombia’s Soda Industry.

Time was of the essence in this situation, in part because whales that come near land are at risk of suffocation and organ failure.

In addition, the shock of being stranded evokes a stress response.

It’s unclear why the pod of whales swam so close to shore. Sperm whales, which are listed as an endangered species, are the largest of the toothed whales. They are not usually found in waters less than 984 feet deep, and prefer areas two times deeper than that, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries.

In February, more than 650 pilot whales became stranded at the northern tip of South Island in New Zealand for reasons that were also unknown, and about 400 of them died. Pathologists hoped to find answers by studying some of the dead animals.

And in April, officials said they were investigating an “alarming” number of humpback whale strandings along the Atlantic coast.

There are multiple reasons these events can happen, Ms. Asmutis-Silvia said, including navigational error, changes in the environment, a wayward hunt for food or tidal changes.

The administration crafted the latest policy after judges ruled that the previous two versions were unconstitutional attempts to bar Muslims from the country and violated the Constitution.

Both judges deemed the ban to be discriminatory against Muslims and similar to the previous ones.

“To extent that the government might have provided additional evidence to establish that national security is now the primary purpose for the travel ban, it has not done so,” he wrote.

In Hawaii, Judge Watson wrote that the latest ban “suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor.”

The Trump administration appealed both decisions, citing national security concerns. It said that it is not trying to bar Muslims from entering the United States, but rather to exercise control over who enters from some of the world’s most menacing countries.

The Ninth Circuit’s decision on Monday limits the scope of the Hawaii injunction and brings it in line with the one issued in Maryland.

“This is certainly good for the administration,” conceded Betsy Fisher, policy director for the International Refugee Assistance Project, the lead plaintiff in the Maryland case. Ms. Fisher added that for travelers from the six countries, however, “everyone can expect longer processing times to allow for proving bona fide relationships.”

PhotoOne passage, possibly hinting at the Shadow Brokers’ identity, underscored the close relationship of Russian intelligence to criminal hackers.
Has Russian intelligence simply outplayed the United States, penetrating the most closely guarded corners of its government?
And American officials believe Russian intelligence was piggybacking on Kaspersky’s efforts to find and retrieve the N.S.A.’s secrets wherever they could be found.
Mr. Williams said it may be years before the “full fallout” of the Shadow Brokers breach is understood.","With a leak of intelligence methods like the N.S.A. tools, Mr. Panetta said, “Every time it happens, you essentially have to start over.”

Fifteen months into a wide-ranging investigation by the agency’s counterintelligence arm, known as Q Group, and the F.B.I., officials still do not know whether the N.S.A. is the victim of a brilliantly executed hack, with Russia as the most likely perpetrator, an insider’s leak, or both. Three employees have been arrested since 2015 for taking classified files, but there is fear that one or more leakers may still be in place. And there is broad agreement that the damage from the Shadow Brokers already far exceeds the harm to American intelligence done by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who fled with four laptops of classified material in 2013.

Mr. Snowden’s cascade of disclosures to journalists and his defiant public stance drew far more media coverage than this new breach. But Mr. Snowden released code words, while the Shadow Brokers have released the actual code; if he shared what might be described as battle plans, they have loosed the weapons themselves. Created at huge expense to American taxpayers, those cyberweapons have now been picked up by hackers from North Korea to Russia and shot back at the United States and its allies.

Millions of people saw their computers shut down by ransomware, with demands for payments in digital currency to have their access restored. Tens of thousands of employees at Mondelez International, the maker of Oreo cookies, had their data completely wiped. FedEx reported that an attack on a European subsidiary had halted deliveries and cost $300 million. Hospitals in Pennsylvania, Britain and Indonesia had to turn away patients. The attacks disrupted production at a car plant in France, an oil company in Brazil and a chocolate factory in Tasmania, among thousands of enterprises affected worldwide.

American officials had to explain to close allies — and to business leaders in the United States — how cyberweapons developed at Fort Meade in Maryland came to be used against them. Experts believe more attacks using the stolen N.S.A. tools are all but certain.

Inside the agency’s Maryland headquarters and its campuses around the country, N.S.A. employees have been subjected to polygraphs and suspended from their jobs in a hunt for turncoats allied with the Shadow Brokers. Much of the agency’s arsenal is still being replaced, curtailing operations. Morale has plunged, and experienced specialists are leaving the agency for better-paying jobs — including with firms defending computer networks from intrusions that use the N.S.A.’s leaked tools.

“It’s a disaster on multiple levels,” Mr. Williams said. “It’s embarrassing that the people responsible for this have not been brought to justice.”

In response to detailed questions, an N.S.A. spokesman, Michael T. Halbig, said the agency “cannot comment on Shadow Brokers.” He denied that the episode had hurt morale. “N.S.A. continues to be viewed as a great place to work; we receive more than 140,000 applications each year for our hiring program,” he said.

Compounding the pain for the N.S.A. is the attackers’ regular online public taunts, written in ersatz broken English. Their posts are a peculiar mash-up of immaturity and sophistication, laced with profane jokes but also savvy cultural and political references. They suggest that their author — if not an American — knows the United States well.

“Is NSA chasing shadowses?” the Shadow Brokers asked in a post on Oct. 16, mocking the agency’s inability to understand the leaks and announcing a price cut for subscriptions to its “monthly dump service” of stolen N.S.A. tools. It was a typically wide-ranging screed, touching on George Orwell’s “1984”; the end of the federal government’s fiscal year on Sept. 30; Russia’s creation of bogus accounts on Facebook and Twitter; and the phenomenon of American intelligence officers going to work for contractors who pay higher salaries.

One passage, possibly hinting at the Shadow Brokers’ identity, underscored the close relationship of Russian intelligence to criminal hackers. “Russian security peoples,” it said, “is becoming Russian hackeres at nights, but only full moons.”

Russia is the prime suspect in a parallel hemorrhage of hacking tools and secret documents from the C.I.A.’s Center for Cyber Intelligence, posted week after week since March to the WikiLeaks website under the names Vault7 and Vault8. That breach, too, is unsolved. Together, the flood of digital secrets from agencies that invest huge resources in preventing such breaches is raising profound questions.

Have hackers and leakers made secrecy obsolete? Has Russian intelligence simply outplayed the United States, penetrating the most closely guarded corners of its government? Can a work force of thousands of young, tech-savvy spies ever be immune to leaks?

Some veteran intelligence officials believe a lopsided focus on offensive weapons and hacking tools has, for years, left American cyberdefense dangerously porous.

“We have had a train wreck coming,” said Mike McConnell, the former N.S.A. director and national intelligence director. “We should have ratcheted up the defense parts significantly.”

America’s Cyber Special Forces

At the heart of the N.S.A. crisis is Tailored Access Operations, the group where Mr. Williams worked, which was absorbed last year into the agency’s new Directorate of Operations.

T.A.O. — the outdated name is still used informally — began years ago as a side project at the agency’s research and engineering building at Fort Meade. It was a cyber Skunk Works, akin to the special units that once built stealth aircraft and drones. As Washington’s need for hacking capabilities grew, T.A.O. expanded into a separate office park in Laurel, Md., with additional teams at facilities in Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii and Texas.

The hacking unit attracts many of the agency’s young stars, who like the thrill of internet break-ins in the name of national security, according to a dozen former government officials who agreed to describe its work on the condition of anonymity. T.A.O. analysts start with a shopping list of desired information and likely sources — say, a Chinese official’s home computer or a Russian oil company’s network. Much of T.A.O.’s work is labeled E.C.I., for “exceptionally controlled information,” material so sensitive it was initially stored only in safes. When the cumulative weight of the safes threatened the integrity of N.S.A.’s engineering building a few years ago, one agency veteran said, the rules were changed to allow locked file cabinets.

The more experienced T.A.O. operators devise ways to break into foreign networks; junior operators take over to extract information. Mr. Williams, 40, a former paramedic who served in military intelligence in the Army before joining the N.S.A., worked in T.A.O. from 2008 to 2013, which he described as an especially long tenure. He called the work “challenging and sometimes exciting.”

T.A.O. operators must constantly renew their arsenal to stay abreast of changing software and hardware, examining every Windows update and new iPhone for vulnerabilities. “The nature of the business is to move with the technology,” a former T.A.O. hacker said.

Long known mainly as an eavesdropping agency, the N.S.A. has embraced hacking as an especially productive way to spy on foreign targets. The intelligence collection is often automated, with malware implants — computer code designed to find material of interest — left sitting on the targeted system for months or even years, sending files back to the N.S.A.

The same implant can be used for many purposes: to steal documents, tap into email, subtly change data or become the launching pad for an attack. T.A.O.’s most public success was an operation against Iran called Olympic Games, in which implants in the network of the Natanz nuclear plant caused centrifuges enriching uranium to self-destruct. The T.A.O. was also critical to attacks on the Islamic State and North Korea.

It was this arsenal that the Shadow Brokers got hold of, and then began to release.

Like cops studying a burglar’s operating style and stash of stolen goods, N.S.A. analysts have tried to figure out what the Shadow Brokers took. None of the leaked files date from later than 2013 — a relief to agency officials assessing the damage. But they include a large share of T.A.O.’s collection, including three so-called ops disks — T.A.O.’s term for tool kits — containing the software to bypass computer firewalls, penetrate Windows and break into the Linux systems most commonly used on Android phones.

Evidence shows that the Shadow Brokers obtained the entire tool kits intact, suggesting that an insider might have simply pocketed a thumb drive and walked out.

But other files obtained by the Shadow Brokers bore no relation to the ops disks and seem to have been grabbed at different times. Some were designed for a compromise by the N.S.A. of Swift, a global financial messaging system, allowing the agency to track bank transfers. There was a manual for an old system code-named UNITEDRAKE, used to attack Windows. There were PowerPoint presentations and other files not used in hacking, making it unlikely that the Shadow Brokers had simply grabbed tools left on the internet by sloppy N.S.A. hackers.

Some officials doubt that the Shadow Brokers got it all by hacking the most secure of American government agencies — hence the search for insiders. But some T.A.O. hackers think that skilled, persistent attackers might have been able to get through the N.S.A.’s defenses — because, as one put it, “I know we’ve done it to other countries.”

The Shadow Brokers have verbally attacked certain experts, including Mr. Williams. When he concluded from their Twitter hints that they knew about some of his hacks while at the N.S.A., he canceled a business trip to Singapore. The United States had named and criminally charged hackers from the intelligence agencies of China, Iran and Russia. He feared he could be similarly charged by a country he had targeted and arrested on an international warrant.

He has since resumed traveling abroad. But he says no one from the N.S.A. has contacted him about being singled out publicly by the Shadow Brokers.

“That feels like a betrayal,” he said. “I was targeted by the Shadow Brokers because of that work. I do not feel the government has my back.”

The Hunt for an Insider

For decades after its creation in 1952, the N.S.A. — No Such Agency, in the old joke — was seen as all but leakproof. But since Mr. Snowden flew away with hundreds of thousands of documents in 2013, that notion has been shattered.

The Snowden trauma led to the investment of millions of dollars in new technology and tougher rules to counter what the government calls the insider threat. But N.S.A. employees say that with thousands of employees pouring in and out of the gates, and the ability to store a library’s worth of data in a device that can fit on a key ring, it is impossible to prevent people from walking out with secrets.

The agency has active investigations into at least three former N.S.A. employees or contractors. Two had worked for T.A.O.: a still publicly unidentified software developer secretly arrested after taking hacking tools home in 2015, only to have Russian hackers lift them from his home computer; and Harold T. Martin III, a contractor arrested last year when F.B.I. agents found his home, garden shed and car stuffed with sensitive agency documents and storage devices he had taken over many years when a work-at-home habit got out of control, his lawyers say. The third is Reality Winner, a young N.S.A. linguist arrested in June, who is charged with leaking to the news site The Intercept a single classified report on a Russian breach of an American election systems vendor.

Mr. Martin’s gargantuan collection of stolen files included much of what the Shadow Brokers have, and he has been scrutinized by investigators as a possible source for them. Officials say they do not believe he deliberately supplied the material, though they have examined whether he might have been targeted by thieves or hackers.

But according to former N.S.A. employees who are still in touch with active workers, investigators of the Shadow Brokers thefts are clearly worried that one or more leakers may still be inside the agency. Some T.A.O. employees have been asked to turn over their passports, take time off their jobs and submit to questioning. The small number of specialists who have worked both at T.A.O. and at the C.I.A. have come in for particular attention, out of concern that a single leaker might be responsible for both the Shadow Brokers and the C.I.A.’s Vault7 breaches.

Then there are the Shadow Brokers’ writings, which betray a seeming immersion in American culture. Last April, about the time Mr. Williams was discovering their inside knowledge of T.A.O. operations, the Shadow Brokers posted an appeal to President Trump: “Don’t Forget Your Base.” With the ease of a seasoned pundit, they tossed around details about Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s now departed adviser; the Freedom Caucus in Congress; the “deep state”; the Alien and Sedition Acts; and white privilege.

“TheShadowBrokers is wanting to see you succeed,” the post said, addressing Mr. Trump. “TheShadowBrokers is wanting America to be great again.”

The mole hunt is inevitably creating an atmosphere of suspicion and anxiety, former employees say. While the attraction of the N.S.A. for skilled operators is unique — nowhere else can they hack without getting into legal trouble — the boom in cybersecurity hiring by private companies gives T.A.O. veterans lucrative exit options.

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

Young T.A.O. hackers are lucky to make $80,000 a year, while those who leave routinely find jobs paying well over $100,000, security specialists say. For many workers, the appeal of the N.S.A’s mission has been more than enough to make up the difference. But over the past year, former T.A.O. employees say an increasing number of former colleagues have called them looking for private-sector work, including “graybeards” they thought would be N.S.A. lifers.

“Snowden killed morale,” another T.A.O. analyst said. “But at least we knew who he was. Now you have a situation where the agency is questioning people who have been 100 percent mission-oriented, telling them they’re liars.”

Because the N.S.A. hacking unit has grown so rapidly over the past decade, the pool of potential leakers has expanded into the hundreds. Trust has eroded as anyone who had access to the leaked code is regarded as the potential culprit.

Some agency veterans have seen projects they worked on for a decade shut down because implants they relied on were dumped online by the Shadow Brokers. The number of new operations has declined because the malware tools must be rebuilt. And no end is in sight.

“How much longer are the releases going to come?” a former T.A.O. employee asked. “The agency doesn’t know how to stop it — or even what ‘it’ is.”

One N.S.A. official who almost saw his career ended by the Shadow Brokers is at the very top of the organization: Adm. Michael S. Rogers, director of the N.S.A. and commander of its sister military organization, United States Cyber Command. President Barack Obama’s director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., and defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, recommended removing Admiral Rogers from his post to create accountability for the breaches.

But Mr. Obama did not act on the advice, in part because Admiral Rogers’s agency was at the center of the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Trump, who again on Saturday disputed his intelligence agencies’ findings on Russia and the election, extended the admiral’s time in office. Some former intelligence officials say they are flabbergasted that he has been able to hold on to his job.

A Shadow War With Russia?

Lurking in the background of the Shadow Brokers investigation is American officials’ strong belief that it is a Russian operation. The pattern of dribbling out stolen documents over many months, they say, echoes the slow release of Democratic emails purloined by Russian hackers last year.

But there is a more specific back story to the United States-Russia rivalry.

Starting in 2014, American security researchers who had been tracking Russia’s state-sponsored hacking groups for years began to expose them in a series of research reports. American firms, including Symantec, CrowdStrike and FireEye, reported that Moscow was behind certain attacks and identified government-sponsored Russian hacking groups.

In the meantime, Russia’s most prominent cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky Lab, had started work on a report that would turn the tables on the United States. Kaspersky hunted for the spying malware planted by N.S.A. hackers, guided in part by the keywords and code names in the files taken by Mr. Snowden and published by journalists, officials said.

Kaspersky was, in a sense, simply doing to the N.S.A. what the American companies had just done to Russian intelligence: expose their operations. And American officials believe Russian intelligence was piggybacking on Kaspersky’s efforts to find and retrieve the N.S.A.’s secrets wherever they could be found. The T.A.O. hackers knew that when Kaspersky updated its popular antivirus software to find and block the N.S.A. malware, it could thwart spying operations around the world.

So T.A.O. personnel rushed to replace implants in many countries with new malware they did not believe the Russian company could detect.

In February 2015, Kaspersky published its report on the Equation Group — the company’s name for T.A.O. hackers — and updated its antivirus software to uproot the N.S.A. malware wherever it had not been replaced. The agency temporarily lost access to a considerable flow of intelligence. By some accounts, however, N.S.A. officials were relieved that the Kaspersky report did not include certain tools they feared the Russian company had found.

As it would turn out, any celebration was premature.

On Aug. 13 last year, a new Twitter account using the Shadow Brokers’ name announced with fanfare an online auction of stolen N.S.A. hacking tools.

“We hack Equation Group,” the Shadow Brokers wrote. “We find many many Equation Group cyber weapons.”

Inside the N.S.A., the declaration was like a bomb exploding. A zip file posted online contained the first free sample of the agency’s hacking tools. It was immediately evident that the Shadow Brokers were not hoaxsters, and that the agency was in trouble.

The leaks have renewed a debate over whether the N.S.A. should be permitted to stockpile vulnerabilities it discovers in commercial software to use for spying — rather than immediately alert software makers so the holes can be plugged. The agency claims it has shared with the industry more than 90 percent of flaws it has found, reserving only the most valuable for its own hackers. But if it can’t keep those from leaking, as the last year has demonstrated, the resulting damage to businesses and ordinary computer users around the world can be colossal. The Trump administration says it will soon announce revisions to the system, making it more transparent.

Mr. Williams said it may be years before the “full fallout” of the Shadow Brokers breach is understood. Even the arrest of whoever is responsible for the leaks may not end them, he said — because the sophisticated perpetrators may have built a “dead man’s switch” to release all remaining files automatically upon their arrest.

But the Avalere analysis is the first to apply a consistent methodology across all of the states that have declined to expand. Some of the numbers are big. Florida would get an estimated $26 billion over the next decade, according to Avalere; North Carolina $13 billion.

The Medicaid expansion has been the subject of substantial scholarly attention. Strong evidence suggests states’ expansion has helped improve the financial health of their low-income residents, as well as the financial performance of local hospitals. Studies also show that Medicaid coverage has helped low-income Americans get access to health care, though there is not yet strong evidence about whether it has improved their physical health.

Research has found that the Medicaid expansion does not appear to discourage low-income people from working. More speculative articles have suggested that the influx of federal dollars may help strengthen state economies, though there is little hard evidence of such effects.

Governors in expansion states have argued that the money has been particularly helpful in helping residents battle addictions to opioids.

A recent study found that, in the early years of the expansion, there were no hidden costs to state budgets — and that states spent no more on their programs than states that declined to expand. In some states, it appears that expansion has improved state finances, by reducing the need for programs that pay doctors and hospitals directly for uncompensated care, among other ancillary effects. There is evidence that Medicaid expansion has lowered insurance premiums for middle-class residents who buy their own insurance.

Some states are likelier to come out ahead than others. Benjamin Sommers, an associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who studies Medicaid, said Wisconsin, for example, might actually save money over all if it accepted federal expansion dollars.

But legislators and governors in the holdout states have consistently opposed the expansion, citing a range of political, ideological and fiscal concerns. One big issue, experts say, is the expansion’s link to Obamacare, a law that Republicans have vowed to repeal from the beginning. “It’s made it very hard for them to turn around and embrace one of the only optional parts of it,” said Matt Salo, the executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, who has closely watched the debate. “There is ample evidence from the states that have done it that there is substantial benefit.”

Some state officials also object to a program that provides benefits to poor residents who don’t work. Studies have shown that the large majority of expansion beneficiaries are working, in school or caring for a sick family member. But the Trump administration has signaled that it will allow states to condition coverage on “community engagement activities,” a policy change that could interest some reluctant politicians.

For some states, finding 10 percent of the dollars may be a challenge. David Dzielak, the Medicaid director in Mississippi, a state that has not expanded, said raising even a small fraction of the funding would be hard, especially after recent corporate tax cuts. The Avalere numbers suggest that the 6 percent of Medicaid expansion costs that Mississippi would need to pay if it expanded next year would represent less than 1 percent of its 2016 general fund spending.

“It’s all about the money, really, and our state is so poor that we can’t even afford the 10 percent for the expansion,” he said. “That’s really the bottom line.”

But not every state that has expanded its program has been wealthy, and some of those have been red states. Louisiana, for example, expanded Medicaid last year, providing health coverage to around 430,000 people, despite limited fiscal capacity and state budget challenges. Some of the largest coverage gains have come in poorer states, including West Virginia, Arkansas and Kentucky.

Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health policy at George Washington University, said states generally fight to maximize federal funding for their programs. She described Medicaid expansion as a striking counterexample, where political preferences have sometimes outweighed the desire for resources. “It’s so much revenue,” she said. “That’s when you know we’re not dealing with dollars and cents.”

Medicaid expansion states could keep growing. Voters in Maine last week approved a ballot measure to expand Medicaid. And recent legislative gains by Democrats in Virginia could change the politics of the issue there. Activists in other states, including Kansas, Utah and Idaho, are mobilizing for a renewed expansion push in the coming year.

***

The Avalere estimates are rough, but they show what would happen if each state’s expansion resulted in a decrease in the uninsured rate among low-income residents that is similar to the average decrease in states that have already expanded their programs. The model then made adjustments for the size of the poor, uninsured population, and the different costs of providing Medicaid care in different states.

In the states that have expanded already, there has been a wide range of effects. The uninsured rate among the eligible population declined by only half a percentage point in Massachusetts, which already had very broad insurance coverage. But it declined by more than six percentage points in Louisiana, where there were many more poor residents who lacked coverage. The average reduction was 2.5 percentage points.



Most of the states that haven’t expanded are likely to reap more federal dollars than these estimates if they expand, said Mr. Sloan, but analysts felt the average number was a useful, conservative estimate. (That means that our figures may also understate the amount of money that states would need to spend, too.)

Our budget numbers are for the fiscal year 2016, and come from a recent survey from the National Association of State Budget Officers. In evaluating the budget impact of the federal share of Medicaid expansion, we compared estimated federal spending with total state budgets, including current federal dollars. In evaluating the state share of the expansion funding, we compared the numbers to state general funds, to give a sense of how the program would compare with functions that the state raises its own funds to cover. State budgets typically grow by around 3 or 4 percent a year, said John Hicks, the association’s executive director, so our percentages may slightly overstate Medicaid expansion funding as a share of state budgets.",What Red States Are Passing Up as Blue States Get Billions,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/upshot/what-red-states-are-passing-up-as-blue-states-get-billions.html

This relationship held even when he excluded the United States, indicating that it could not be explained by some other factor particular to his home country. And it held when he controlled for homicide rates, suggesting that mass shootings were better explained by a society’s access to guns than by its baseline level of violence.

Factors That Don’t Correlate

If mental health made the difference, then data would show that Americans have more mental health problems than do people in other countries with fewer mass shootings. But the mental health care spending rate in the United States, the number of mental health professionals per capita and the rate of severe mental disorders are all in line with those of other wealthy countries.

A 2015 study estimated that only 4 percent of American gun deaths could be attributed to mental health issues. And Mr. Lankford, in an email, said countries with high suicide rates tended to have low rates of mass shootings — the opposite of what you would expect if mental health problems correlated with mass shootings.

Whether a population plays more or fewer video games also appears to have no impact. Americans are no more likely to play video games than people in any other developed country.

Racial diversity or other factors associated with social cohesion also show little correlation with gun deaths. Among European countries, there is little association between immigration or other diversity metrics and the rates of gun murders or mass shootings.

A Violent Country

America’s gun homicide rate was 33 per million people in 2009, far exceeding the average among developed countries. In Canada and Britain, it was 5 per million and 0.7 per million, respectively, which also corresponds with differences in gun ownership.

Americans sometimes see this as an expression of deeper problems with crime, a notion ingrained, in part, by a series of films portraying urban gang violence in the early 1990s. But the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries, according to a landmark 1999 study by Franklin E. Zimring and Gordon Hawkins of the University of California, Berkeley.

Rather, they found, in data that has since been repeatedly confirmed, that American crime is simply more lethal. A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner, for instance, but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process.

They concluded that the discrepancy, like so many other anomalies of American violence, came down to guns.

More gun ownership corresponds with more gun murders across virtually every axis: among developed countries, among American states, among American towns and cities and when controlling for crime rates. And gun control legislation tends to reduce gun murders, according to a recent analysis of 130 studies from 10 countries.

This suggests that the guns themselves cause the violence.

Comparisons in Other Societies

Skeptics of gun control sometimes point to a 2016 study. From 2000 and 2014, it found, the United States death rate by mass shooting was 1.5 per one million people. The rate was 1.7 in Switzerland and 3.4 in Finland, suggesting American mass shootings were not actually so common.

But the same study found that the United States had 133 mass shootings. Finland had only two, which killed 18 people, and Switzerland had one, which killed 14. In short, isolated incidents. So while mass shootings can happen anywhere, they are only a matter of routine in the United States.

As with any crime, the underlying risk is impossible to fully erase. Any individual can snap or become entranced by a violent ideology. What is different is the likelihood that this will lead to mass murder.

In China, about a dozen seemingly random attacks on schoolchildren killed 25 people between 2010 and 2012. Most used knives; none used a gun.

By contrast, in this same window, the United States experienced five of its deadliest mass shootings, which killed 78 people. Scaled by population, the American attacks were 12 times as deadly.

Beyond the Statistics

In 2013, American gun-related deaths included 21,175 suicides, 11,208 homicides and 505 deaths caused by an accidental discharge. That same year in Japan, a country with one-third America’s population, guns were involved in only 13 deaths.

This means an American is about 300 times more likely to die by gun homicide or accident than a Japanese person. America’s gun ownership rate is 150 times as high as Japan’s. That gap between 150 and 300 shows that gun ownership statistics alone do not explain what makes America different.

The United States also has some of the weakest controls over who may buy a gun and what sorts of guns may be owned.

Switzerland has the second-highest gun ownership rate of any developed country, about half that of the United States. Its gun homicide rate in 2004 was 7.7 per million people — unusually high, in keeping with the relationship between gun ownership and murders, but still a fraction of the rate in the United States.

Swiss gun laws are more stringent, setting a higher bar for securing and keeping a license, for selling guns and for the types of guns that can be owned. Such laws reflect more than just tighter restrictions. They imply a different way of thinking about guns, as something that citizens must affirmatively earn the right to own.

The Difference Is Culture

The United States is one of only three countries, along with Mexico and Guatemala, that begin with the opposite assumption: that people have an inherent right to own guns.

The main reason American regulation of gun ownership is so weak may be the fact that the trade-offs are simply given a different weight in the United States than they are anywhere else.

After Britain had a mass shooting in 1987, the country instituted strict gun control laws. So did Australia after a 1996 shooting. But the United States has repeatedly faced the same calculus and determined that relatively unregulated gun ownership is worth the cost to society.

That choice, more than any statistic or regulation, is what most sets the United States apart.

“In retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate,” Dan Hodges, a British journalist, wrote in a post on Twitter two years ago, referring to the 2012 attack that killed 20 young students at an elementary school in Connecticut. “Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.”",What Explains U.S. Mass Shootings?

The single most important guideline for selecting wine for Thanksgiving is simply to have enough on hand.

Always on the prowl for something new for the Thanksgiving menu, I thought of the cornbread as we sampled these Thanksgiving wine selections.","For most families, Thanksgiving this year will not be unlike Thanksgiving any other year. Whatever new elements arrive in 2017, the foreboding is the same as always.

Nonetheless, the projected disasters almost never occur. Everybody has a great time. Remembering this will not help to achieve preliminary serenity, but understanding the process can make the angst easier to endure.

In order to help, the Thanksgiving wine panel annually tries to eliminate wine selections from your areas of concern. Each year, we share a Thanksgiving feast in advance. We each bring two bottles of wine to the meal, each costing no more than $25, with the aim of adding to our understanding of which types of wines work best.

As with many families, we welcomed a new member this year. Our colleague Tejal Rao — sitting in for Julia Moskin, who was away on assignment — joined me, Florence Fabricant, Pete Wells and our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch.

Over the years, we have learned and affirmed that wine is the least consequential issue anybody will face at Thanksgiving. Why is that?

Rule No. 3: If the food is good and the company convivial, you cannot go wrong with the wine. If the food is bad and the company annoying, wine can only help.

What’s the worst that can happen with wine? Only one potential disaster looms: running out.

The single most important guideline for selecting wine for Thanksgiving is simply to have enough on hand. We generally recommend one bottle per wine-drinking adult. This may seem like a lot, but it is simply a hedge against an insufficient supply. You do not have to finish it all. If you like, you can even give away unopened bottles with the leftovers.

Beyond quantity, you need to provide both reds and whites. You can add rosé or a sparkling wine, but both red and white are essential. You will have guests who contend that red wine gives them headaches or white wine gives them heartburn. This is not the time to debate these issues. Let guests drink what they want unfettered.

In our calculus, we imagine Thanksgiving as a large, freewheeling buffet meal, with lots of different dishes and a sprawling patchwork of flavors. It’s not the time to fret about pairing particular dishes with certain bottles. The trick is to provide versatile, nimble wines that pair well with many foods and will not be as fatiguing as everything else.

That generally means bottles not especially high in alcohol, generally below 14 percent. They should not be tannic or oaky, but they must be energetic with lively acidity, which helps to refresh and cleanse the palate.

Over the course of many years we have identified wines that almost always work well: Beaujolais and bone-dry sauvignon blancs are crowd-pleasers. Basic Italian reds made of barbera or sangiovese are fine, as are Italian whites made of fiano or carricante. Loire reds, pinot noirs, chardonnays, chenin blancs, mencías from Spain, rieslings — all are fine choices.

These wines, I should say, fit our particular vision of the feast. If you are having a small dinner party for six with multiple courses and you would like to serve precious bottles poured into exquisite glasses, by all means do.

For our party, we assume a crowd who might be drinking from tumblers or even paper cups. These are fine for big parties. But I do recommend steering clear of plastic goblets, which have a nasty habit of separating bowl from stem at the worst possible moments for your clothing, carpeting and anxiety threshold.

Almost all the wines the panel sampled were excellent, and the few that fell short were nonetheless fine. Tejal brought the two most fascinating wines, both white, sort of.

The first, the 2016 Caprice du Chameau from La Vrille et Le Papillon, a brother-and-sister team who make natural wines in the Ardèche region of southeastern France, was unfiltered, giving the wine a hazy appearance. Yet it was sublimely light and spicy, vibrant and thoroughly delicious. Surprisingly, it was made of viognier, which I usually associate with heavier, fruitier wines. Though visually unusual, the wine was ideal, with what Pete called “a feeling of over the river and through the woods.”

Tejal’s second bottle was more challenging, a 2015 from RuBor Viticultores, made of chasselas, a Swiss white grape unaccountably planted 70 years ago in Cebreros in the Sierra de Gredos, a range of hills that cuts through central Spain. Though made from white grapes, the wine had been made as if it were a red. Instead of immediately separating the juice of the grapes from the skins, the producers macerated them together, extracting tannins and pigment.

The gritty, amber-colored result was savory, intense and unusual, and perhaps better for a crowd of questing wine fanatics than a general-interest holiday group. I would happily serve it with cheese, though not for the long haul of a feast.

Pete brought a rosé sparkling wine, a light, lacy cava from Dibon in the Penedès region of Spain. This fruity cava, unusually made entirely of the garnacha grape, would make a delightful aperitif, though we all would prefer not to drink sparkling wine throughout the feast.

His other wine was an inspired selection, a 2013 Tinto, or red, from the intriguing Barraida region of Portugal from Sidónio de Sousa, made from the baga grape. It was spicy, herbal and lightly fruity, and had just the sort of light-bodied charm that could carry through the entire meal.

Bernie took an unusual tack in selecting his white. He chose a Quincy, a Loire sauvignon blanc, because, he said, he remembered a meal many years ago when a Quincy was universally reviled.

This suggestion of overt hostility to the group could not be rewarded. We disappointed him by thoroughly enjoying the wine, a clean, citrusy 2013 from Domaine Trotereau. We compounded the issue by liking his red even more, a 2013 pinot noir from Red Tail Ridge in the Finger Lakes. Its pale brick color seemed more typical of an older wine, but it was bright, juicy and fresh.

Florence’s white, a 2016 sauvignon blanc from Matanzas Creek in Sonoma County, was an archetypal Thanksgiving white: neutral rather than flamboyant, a subtle character actor that would enhance rather than dominate. It had the sort of texture that continually invited another sip.

Her red was also from Sonoma, a 2012 Buena Vista merlot. It had the opposite character of the Matanzas Creek, with fruit flavors that were too intense. Tejal called the effect “sinister,” but even so, it was easily tolerable.

My own wines included a savory white Bordeaux, a 2015 Lune d’Argent from Clos des Lunes, made by the excellent Domaine de Chevalier. Though primarily sémillon with a quarter sauvignon blanc, it had a lot in common with the Matanzas Creek in that it was more interesting texturally than aromatically.

My red was a 2015 Cahors from Château Combel-la-Serre, an easygoing wine that combined plummy fruit and chalky mineral flavors. It was made of malbec, but was more restrained than many of the fruity malbecs from Argentina.

Collectively, most of these wines added good options to the tried-and-true selections. Tejal, however, second-guessed her choice of the Spanish chasselas. “I realized that maybe something I personally liked is not for everybody,” she said.

She’s correct only to the extent of the distance that a wine lies from the mainstream. Otherwise, I live by the last rule.

Rule No. 4: Choose wines that you like; everybody else will like them, too.

Recipe Pairing: Cornbread Madeleines With Jalapeño

A recent dinner at Gloria, an intimate new seafood restaurant in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, started on a fine note. Warm rounds of individual jalapeño-studded cornbread were served while we sipped cocktails. Always on the prowl for something new for the Thanksgiving menu, I thought of the cornbread as we sampled these Thanksgiving wine selections. Phil Johnson, an owner of Gloria, provided the recipe. But for Thanksgiving, instead of the four-inch cornbread disks served at the restaurant, I baked the batter in madeleine pans. I then froze the little cakes, so I would have them for the holiday. (I will reheat them covered in foil on a baking sheet at 275 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes.) The madeleines would welcome any quaff, cider or beer, not just wine. And the batter can also be baked in cast-iron corn stick molds, though the yield would be fewer, about 15. FLORENCE FABRICANT

It gives its proponents a straightforward way to interpret the world — the noble us versus the powerful them. It gives them a clear sense of group membership and a clear social identity. It offers a ready explanation for the bad things that happen in life.

Most of all, it gives people a narrative to express their own superiority: We may be losing, but at least we are the holy remnant. We have the innocence of victimhood. We are martyrs in a spiteful world.

Leaders, even sports coaches, try to whip up the siege mentality, because it makes their job easier. After all, this mentality encourages people to conform and follow orders. Resentment can be a great motivator. It’s us against the world!

The siege mentality also excuses the leader’s bad behavior. When our very existence is on the line we can’t be worrying about things like humility, sexual morality, honesty and basic decency. In times of war all is permissible. Even molesting teenagers can be overlooked because our group’s survival is at stake.

In the end, though, the siege mentality ends up being self-destructive. Groups smitten with the siege mentality filter out discordant facts and become more extreme versions of themselves, leading to further marginalization. They take mainstream loathing as a badge of honor and wind up taking pleasure in their most unattractive instincts.

The siege mentality ends up displacing whatever creed the group started with. Evangelical Christians, for example, had a humane model for leadership — servant leadership — but, feeling besieged, they swapped it for Donald Trump, for gladiator pagan leadership.

Why is this mind-set so prevalent now? Well, it’s partially because the country is divided and many groups feel under assault. According to a Pew Research Center poll, 64 percent of Americans believe that their group has been losing most of the time.

But that’s not the main reason the siege mentality is so prevalent. It’s because we’re in a historic transitional moment and the very foundations of society are now open to question.

In the 1960s the civil rights leaders suffered injustice and oppression. But they had a basic faith in the foundations of society. They wanted a place at the table.

Today people are more likely to think the table itself stinks, or there is no common table. Today Christians are more likely to argue that the liberal order itself is intolerant toward faith. Social justice warriors are prone to argue that America is racist and oppressive in its very bones. The evil is inherent in the basic structure.

How should one respond to the siege mentality, to the Alabamians now rallying around Roy Moore? Well, it’s right to be disgusted, and it feels good to be contemptuous. But contempt only breeds contempt. Contempt for the conservatives in Alabama will just justify their siege mentality and make the social disorder that flows from it worse.

The fact is, the siege mentality arises from overgeneralization: They are all out to get us. It shouldn’t be met with a counter-overgeneralization: Those people are all sick.

It should be met with confident pluralism. We have a shared moral culture, and some things are beyond the boundaries, like tolerating sexual harassment. But within the boundaries of our liberal polity, we’re going to give one another the benefit of the doubt.

Suppose America’s leaders had gone to conservative evangelicals a decade ago and said: Look, we understand that changing attitudes about gay marriage put you in a tough position. We’re not going to stop doing what we think is right, but we’re going to try to work out some accommodation with you on religious liberty so you can feel at home here and practice your faith.

That might have felt more like a conversation than a siege. That might have spared us the populist revolts that brought us Roy Moore, and Donald Trump, and the repugnant habits of mind that now excuse them.",The Siege Mentality Problem,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/opinion/roy-moore-conservative-evangelicals.html

I know what you’re thinking — psychological warfare, the endless grim clashing of economic forces — but I am being literal. When we ponder America’s defining war, the Revolution, we think of Bunker Hill, or Saratoga, or Lexington and Concord, yet its largest battle, a vast and ferociously fought chess match in August and September of 1776, right after the formal declaration of the colonies’ independence, ranged over what are now the five boroughs. As to why the place was so hotly contested, you already know the answer. Then, as now, as ever, New York City was the center of it all. Both sides believed that if the British took control of New York and the Hudson River, the American resistance would likely collapse.

The battle isn’t as well known today as other encounters during the Revolution, in part because the city has done an excellent job of removing most traces of it. Where Boston sets aside hallowed historic precincts and wends a handsome brick Freedom Trail through its Revolutionary sites, New York City buries its past under mountains of concrete and steel. Hills have been flattened, islands swallowed up by landfill, shorelines redrawn.

But I was determined to find Revolutionary New York, and I did eventually, after a fashion. It helped that I had an organizing principle. I was researching a book, and, since my book isn’t about military strategy I wasn’t trying to cover all of the complex maneuverings of troops. I write narrative history, which to me means focusing on people’s lives. Getting to know the places in which those lives unfolded helps me in my efforts to get into the individuals’ heads and hearts.

On July 9, 1776, as British soldiers were gathering on Staten Island and preparing to attack Manhattan, Washington arrayed his troops here and had the newly minted Declaration of Independence read aloud to them. The men were so roused up they charged southward and pulled down the statue of King George at what is now Bowling Green.

With help from Tom Crandall, a friend in the store’s repair shop, Mr. Schein won the auction in 2005.
Mr. Schein has been unable to look for other photos taken by Johnnie Mae Crowder.","The deal was done at a crossroads.

There, according to legend, the bluesman Robert Johnson sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for otherworldly musical prowess — guitar playing, singing and songwriting that would make him an idol, still studied and revered almost 80 years after his death.

Zeke Schein came to a crossroads, too, when he bought an old photo (Slide 1) that he believes is only the third known image of Johnson. Johnson’s family, a prominent forensic expert and musicians who’ve been transformed by the bluesman’s recordings agreed with Mr. Schein. But skeptics questioned the likeness, the date — even Mr. Schein’s motives.

Intent on defending himself and the image, Mr. Schein began a journey to learn more about the sharp-dressed men in the sepia print. He chronicles his search in “Portrait of a Phantom: The Story of Robert Johnson’s Lost Photograph,” a book he co-wrote with Poppy Z. Brite, recently published by Pelican.

He talked about the book at another crossroads, Matt Umanov Guitars, a Greenwich Village landmark where he has worked since 1989. He wrote that the store is such a magnet that “if you sit at the front counter of Matt Umanov Guitars, the world comes to you.” Since we began this conversation Matt decided to close the store after 53 years. Zeke put on his walking shoes, and moved on to Rudy’s, his next crossroads.

Mr. Schein discovered the photo while searching for old guitars on eBay. The 3-inch-by-4-inch print from sheet film wasn’t in great shape – “The photo looked haunted, like it had been to hell and back,” he wrote. But when Mr. Schein saw it, he immediately believed that the man holding the guitar was Johnson.

With help from Tom Crandall, a friend in the store’s repair shop, Mr. Schein won the auction in 2005. Mr. Schein was familiar with vintage and vernacular photography. He makes photographs as well as plays music, with a deep appreciation of the tools of each form, since before selling guitars, he’d sold cameras and worked in a lab. He immediately thought the image was a contact print from sheet film, likely done with a Speed Graphic, because of the sharpness.

“Looking at the paper,” Mr. Schein said, “I could tell it was that cheaper, crumbly paper that you would see in old photo albums, photos of maybe my grandparents and even early photos of my father would be on that type of paper.” He dated it to the 1930s. Johnson died in 1938.

Photo

“And then if you look at the print, if you see it online, you’ll see that the edges are black,” Mr. Schein said. “It’s not masked. So you’re not seeing white edging on there — you’re seeing what looks like a negative which was laid down flat.” (A negative’s clear edge comes out black on a contact-sheet print.)

Mr. Schein also guessed that the man in the lighter suit in the photo was Johnny Shines, another blues legend who died in 1992. Mr. Schein later learned of a documentary about Johnson, “Can’t You Hear the Wind Howl?” in which Shines said that there was a photo of him and Johnson taken in 1937 by a photographer named Johnnie Mae Crowder in Hughes, Ark., and that it ran in a local newspaper. If the two were posing for a newspaper photographer, she might very well have used a Speed Graphic, which was standard equipment then.

After showing the photo to friends and musicians who, like Mr. Schein, knew intimately the details of the two authenticated photos of Johnson, many agreed that he’d discovered a third image. Trouble was, when he showed the photo to two old Delta bluesmen, David “Honeyboy” Edwards and Robert Lockwood Jr., who’d both known Johnson, neither of them recognized the man holding the guitar.

Skeptics questioned whether the photo was from the 1930s, since it looked as if the man on the right wore a zoot suit, a 1940s fashion fad featuring wide lapels and shoulders and high-waisted baggy pants. But the style was based on the “drape suit” worn by African-Americans a decade earlier; in the 1933 film “International House,” Cab Calloway’s band wore similar suits.

Some also have suggested that the photo was reversed, since the man in the light suit wore his watch on his right wrist and the man in the dark suit has a pocket square on the right side of his jacket, rather than the left. If the photo is flipped, this meant Johnson is holding the guitar as a left-handed player, not a righty. But since the guitar is stringless, it could have been a studio prop, so it wouldn’t matter how Johnson held it.

More people joined the search. Frank DiGiacomo, who wrote about Mr. Schein’s photo for Vanity Fair in 2008, showed a copy to Claud Johnson, Robert’s son, who agreed that it was his father.

A lawyer for the Johnson estate sent a copy of the photo to Lois Gibson, a forensic specialist who had identified the sailor in Alfred Eisenstaedt’s famous image of a sailor kissing a nurse in Times Square at the end of World War II. She said that the man holding the guitar in Mr. Schein’s photo appeared to be Johnson.

The Vanity Fair piece seemed only to spur attacks on the photo and criticism of Mr. Schein, with some accusing him of pushing it for financial gain, even though he’d assigned the copyright to the Johnson estate.

“We do all share a love of that music and we all play it, including writers and historians who decided to attack what I was doing and also question the integrity — my integrity — in what I was doing and that of the Johnson family,” Mr. Schein said. “They were accusing us of only being in it for money, which was never the goal for either of us. I needed to at least explain my position, why I cared so much about trying to put out a musician’s image who affected me.”

Despite years of investigations, more needs to be done. Mr. Schein has been unable to look for other photos taken by Johnnie Mae Crowder. “I stumbled on this one,“ he said. “I don’t have the skill set to go further than I did.”

But maybe you do.

“In a wild-hopes situation — wildest hopes — I hope someone reads my story and has the knowledge and experience to take my research and what I’ve been able to do a step further.”

Though technically junior to Lieutenant Hudner, Ensign Brown had logged more air time, and was therefore section leader; Lieutenant Hudner was his “tail end Charlie,” flying at his rear that day, Dec. 4.
Lieutenant Hudner removed the woolen watch cap he had carried in his flight suit, placed it over Ensign Brown’s head and wrapped Ensign Brown’s hands in an extra scarf.
With only one hand available — he needed the other to hold on to the plane — Lieutenant Hudner could not extricate him.
“If anything happens, tell Daisy I love her,” Ensign Brown told Lieutenant Hudner, referring to his wife.","“I was not going to leave him down there for the Chinese,” he later said.

For what followed — he crash-landed his own plane, then tried unsuccessfully to pry his dying squadron mate out from under his battered fuselage in subzero temperatures while Chinese troops hovered — Lieutenant Hudner collected the first Medal of Honor awarded during the Korean War.

But his feat was not purely a military one. It doubled as a civil-rights milestone: Ensign Brown was the Navy’s first black aviator, and in going to rescue him, Lieutenant Hudner, who died on Monday at 93, defied the expectations of some and defeated a different sort of foe.

When President Harry S. Truman integrated the armed forces two and a half years earlier, some expressed doubts that white and black soldiers would stand by one another in the heat of battle. But Ensign Brown’s race was immaterial to Lieutenant Hudner, and that was precisely the point.

“A lesson in the brotherhood of man,” a leading black weekly, The Norfolk Journal and Guide, wrote. One letter among many by black admirers said of Lieutenant Hudner — who had had no black classmates at the Naval Academy — “I never thought a white man would help out a black man like that.”

Only later, after he had returned home, did Lieutenant Hudner learn that what he did that day in Korea could have gotten him court-martialed.

“The fact that it happened was not met with great joy by a lot of people,” he recalled in a 2013 interview with the filmmaker Charles Stuart. “Apparently our squadron captain, commander, said, ‘Now if anybody goes down, I don’t want to have any heroes here trying to crash-land this airplane.’ The very thing that I did later on, I didn’t know that was a direct violation of orders.”

Mr. Hudner’s death, at his home in Concord, Mass., was announced by the Massachusetts Department of Veterans Services.

Thomas Jerome Hudner Jr. was born on Aug. 31, 1924, in Fall River, Mass. His family owned a chain of meat and grocery stores. After graduating from Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., he was appointed to the Naval Academy in 1943 by Representative Joseph W. Martin Jr., then the House minority leader. He graduated in 1946 and earned his wings in 1949.

Ensign Brown, of Hattiesburg, Miss., came up through the naval aviation cadet program, overcoming racial bias along the way, and had earned his wings the year before.

Assigned to the same 15-man squadron, the two first met in the fall of 1949 while changing into their flight gear in a locker room at the naval air station at Quonset Point, R.I. As Mr. Hudner recalled it, Ensign Brown did not extend his hand for fear of embarrassing him if he did not want to shake it. So Lieutenant Hudner walked across the room and extended his.

War broke out in Korea in June 1950, and that August the aircraft carrier on which their squadron, VF-32, was based, the U.S.S. Leyte, was deployed there. On Sept. 15, United Nations forces landed at Inchon, and when tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers crossed into Korea in October, the squadron’s mission suddenly changed from offense to defense — to slowing the Chinese advance and protecting the outnumbered United Nations forces on the ground.

Though technically junior to Lieutenant Hudner, Ensign Brown had logged more air time, and was therefore section leader; Lieutenant Hudner was his “tail end Charlie,” flying at his rear that day, Dec. 4.

On seeing that Ensign Brown was alive after his crash landing, Lieutenant Hudner tightened his harness, jettisoned all excess weight, and landed, wheels up, within 100 yards of the wreck in two feet of snow. He found Ensign Brown conscious and calm, bareheaded, his fingers frozen, unable to reach his fallen gloves and helmet.

“We’ve got to figure out how to get out of here,” Ensign Brown told him.

Lieutenant Hudner removed the woolen watch cap he had carried in his flight suit, placed it over Ensign Brown’s head and wrapped Ensign Brown’s hands in an extra scarf. Then he looked into the cockpit. The ensign’s right knee was crushed and jammed between the fuselage and the control panel.

With only one hand available — he needed the other to hold on to the plane — Lieutenant Hudner could not extricate him. He radioed the incoming helicopter to bring an ax and a fire extinguisher. The trapped man, he later recalled, “was very stoic.”

“He was motionless and slowly dying,” he said.

Lieutenant Hudner packed snow around the smoking canopy to keep any flames away. But the hatchet the helicopter pilot brought just bounced off the unyielding metal, and amputation was not an option: The rescuers could not get deep enough inside the cockpit.

“If anything happens, tell Daisy I love her,” Ensign Brown told Lieutenant Hudner, referring to his wife. With nightfall rapidly approaching, the helicopter had to leave. Lieutenant Hudner promised Ensign Brown that he would return soon with better equipment.

“It was a baldfaced lie,” he said later; he knew he could never get back in time. By the time Lieutenant Hudner had left him, in fact, Ensign Brown might have already died.

Ensign Brown’s squadron mates later returned to the site, drenched the body with napalm and set it ablaze to prevent it from being desecrated.

Ensign Brown posthumously received a Distinguished Flying Cross.

About four months later, with Ensign Brown’s widow sobbing behind him, Lieutenant Hudner was in the Rose Garden at the White House receiving the Medal of Honor from President Truman. Two days earlier, Truman had relieved Gen. Douglas MacArthur of his command in Korea. Away from the microphones, Truman told the young lieutenant, “At this moment, I’d much rather have received this medal than be elected the president.”

Lieutenant Hudner later recounted that his in-laws, whose name was also Brown, had arrived in Washington for the ceremony seeking accommodations, only to be told by a hotel that no rooms were available. When the hotel learned that these Browns were white, they were given rooms.

After his return home, Lieutenant Hudner met with the track star Jesse Owens, who had overturned the white-supremacist expectations of his Nazi hosts at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin by winning four gold medals.

Mr. Hudner retired from the Navy as a captain in 1973. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts later named him state commissioner of veterans affairs.

For the rest of his life, Mr. Hudner told one interviewer, the medal left him “highly spoiled” and tiresomely honored, enduring endless rounds of recognition. He put up with it, he said, to honor Americans in the armed forces.

In 2013, he returned to North Korea in an unsuccessful attempt to locate Ensign Brown’s remains.

He is survived by his wife, the former Georgea Farmer; a son, Thomas III; a stepson, Stan Smith; two stepdaughters, Kelly Fernandez and Shannon Gustafson; a sister, Mary Hammer; a brother, Philip; 12 grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.

In 1973, Mr. Hudner was present in Boston Navy Yard when the destroyer escort Jesse L. Brown was commissioned. In 2013, Ensign Brown’s daughter and granddaughter were on hand at the Maine Maritime Museum in Bath for a ceremony commemorating the beginning of construction of the guided-missile destroyer Thomas J. Hudner. The ship is scheduled to be commissioned in 2018.","Thomas Hudner, War Hero in a Civil Rights Milestone, Dies at 93",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/obituaries/thomas-j-hudner-dead-korean-war-medal-of-honor-winner.html

Nevertheless, given the scarcity of actual elections this year, they flocked in disproportionate numbers to Virginia — and in particular to its 32nd district.
Each of the groups wanted Sorenson to make some kind of pitch for why they should direct their resources her way.
Some had clear purity tests — “Will you take the no-PAC-money-ever pledge?” “Were you endorsed by Senator Sanders?” — and Sorenson’s campaign didn’t always check all the boxes.
At first Sorenson didn’t seem to know what I was talking about.","Sorenson, whose one-woman campaign — the candidate had a demanding day job — was limited by a cumbersome and unsightly cervical collar, had few illusions that all these new volunteer hearts had been set aflame by the local business owner and retired Navy Reserve commander David Reid, even if everybody who met him agreed right away that he seemed like a profoundly decent guy with the right priorities. She knew that their primary motivation was their hatred for the president, and that their secondary motivation was their hatred of their local Republican congresswoman, but she was optimistic that they might be taught to direct some of their umbrage toward Reid’s incumbent Republican opponent, Tag — “Sorry,” she’d say, with mock solemnity, “Delegate Greason.”

What Sorenson needed from these inchoate volunteer armies, however, was not a collective expression of outrage; it was reliable support for campaign practicalities like door-knocking and phone-banking, tasks that lacked the glamour and solidarity of marches and protests. Even those who could readily speak about state and local issues — how the Republicans in the House of Delegates had refused the Medicaid expansion and passed a sheaf of anti-abortion bills; how Loudoun County was the only district in Northern Virginia without full-day kindergarten; how somebody needed to put a stoplight at Waxpool and Demott, where Sorenson was almost killed — were rarely acquainted with the proper channels for action. They would talk about calling their representative, and Sorenson would say, “That’s not a congressional thing, that’s a state thing!” or “That’s not a state thing, that’s a supervisor thing! Call your supervisor!” Sorenson showed them how to find out who their supervisors were. They wanted to write letters to Terry McAuliffe, the governor, about bathroom discrimination. She said: “Don’t write letters to Terry! The bathroom bill is dead, don’t worry. It died in subcommittee, and even if it hadn’t, Terry had already promised to veto it, so pick a better battle!”

If a more grizzled campaign manager might have thought only to harness this energy, Sorenson saw an opportunity to help organize it. When the volunteers made proposals that seemed impractical or irrelevant, she did not issue judgment. “I didn’t want to rain on their ideas,” she said. Instead, she gently tried to usher them in productive directions. She told them about what a great guy David Reid was, how he’d come from poverty and sent his two girls to local public schools and today stood for full-day kindergarten and gun control and Medicaid expansion and distance-based tolls on the Dulles Greenway. She also told them about Reid’s Republican opponent, Tag — “Sorry, Delegate Greason” — and all the party-line votes he’d made down in Richmond. “He votes 99 percent of the time with the Republican leadership. From assault rifles to bazookas to ninja stars, he’s for it.”

To get Reid on the ballot, Sorenson explained, the campaign needed to collect 125 signatures by March. The pop-up groups were happy to help, especially because Sorenson had a pleasant, easygoing appeal, not to mention a broken neck. Within a few weeks, she was given almost 600 names. She couldn’t quite account for how it was done; these groups didn’t have leadership, exactly, or if they did, they had large “steering committees” — and they could be touchy if you used the wrong word or gave one individual too much credit — but they used Facebook and they contacted friends of friends and somehow they got the signatures they needed. And not only that. Representatives from some groups got the required signatures, and then representatives from some other groups materialized to vet those signatures and remove inadvertent out-of-district signatories, and then still other representatives from different or maybe the same groups suggested they might help Sorenson by formatting all of that petition data so they could merge the relevant information with their master voter file. As long as Sorenson was explicit about what she needed, it all seemed to just ... happen.

In the months after Trump’s inauguration, there was no shortage of expressive opportunities for the left — protests, actions — but few electoral conduits for its new resolve. Virginia provided one of them. In what Sorenson unsentimentally called “16,” Hillary Clinton carried the state by more than five points, but the previous year’s election had preserved for the Republicans a considerable edge in the House of Delegates: 66 to 34. Not a single incumbent lost. Now, in advance of 2017, Democrats couldn’t help thinking it auspicious that exactly 17 of those Republican delegates came from Clinton districts. If the party could flip only those seats this year, it would come away with a 51-49 majority. This seemed like a totally fanciful possibility to Sorenson herself, but she wasn’t blind to its inspirational potency: Flip the Hillary districts, flip the house.

A majority of the pop-up groups were experiments in decentralized organizing, so individual chapters were free to expend their energy where and how they pleased. Nevertheless, given the scarcity of actual elections this year, they flocked in disproportionate numbers to Virginia — and in particular to its 32nd district. Reid’s district had no primary, for one thing, and seemed acutely winnable. It also had Sorenson. She was not only competent; she was, at least outwardly, calm. She also reached out to each group on its own terms, even if that effort alone absorbed three or four hours of each day. And she didn’t want to seem exploitative, so she refused on principle to blast the groups’ lists with what she called “hair-on-fire send-$5-now-or-the-world-will-end emails.”

Though in theory these groups had diverse goals, the impression they made on Sorenson was one of a great, reverberant longing. “There’s just this huge energy,” Sorenson told me, “with people saying, ‘We want to do something right now, we want to effect change in this election.’ ” They were hard to keep track of: who was with which group, what each one cared about, which groups were subgroups or affinity groups of other groups, which had national umbrella organizations and which didn’t, which terms of art groups preferred to describe their particular variety of leaderlessness. There were chapters and huddles and pods, and they used Google Forms or Google Docs or Eventbrites or Meetups. She found herself scrolling through endless Facebook commentaries in search of group moderators or other sources of provisional authority.

She began to build her own Google Doc as a central storehouse for all the fugitive information. This color-coded document included but was not limited to, in no particular order, the following groups: 31st Street Swing Left; Code Blue; Indivisible Del Ray; Indivisible VA Assembly 42; Network NoVA; NOVANation Coalition; Sister District DC; Sister District Maryland; Swing Left; Together We Will NoVA; Vienna Neighbors United; VOTE MOB VA; WofA (We of Action); ACT Empowered; We ARE the People Who Stand Up; Loudoun 4 Women’s March on Washington; Hunter Mill Huddle; Arlington Huddle Action Network; Neighbors for a Blue Virginia; Ward 3 Democrats; the Resurgent Left; Turn It Blue DC (formerly Swing Left NE DC); Dining for Democracy; #Citizen. Sorenson got a kick out of the names the groups had given themselves. She loved one called the Huddlery.

Sorenson’s list included the names of the principals, to which she often felt obligated to append the qualification “(co-leader?)” or “(steering committee member?).” She documented their purpose, insofar as she could divine it; her perception of their viability (“all talk no plans”); and their willingness to help the Reid campaign to, as her own hashtag put it, #flip32blue. Each of the groups wanted Sorenson to make some kind of pitch for why they should direct their resources her way. Some, like Flippable, had former campaign people on staff; they just needed to hear the numbers and they’d mail a check. Others, like the West L.A. Democratic Club, asked her questions for an hour before saying no. Some had clear purity tests — “Will you take the no-PAC-money-ever pledge?” “Were you endorsed by Senator Sanders?” — and Sorenson’s campaign didn’t always check all the boxes. Others were concerned that she didn’t need the help badly enough.

Sorenson did her best to put her candidate and their campaign up for adoption in a way that made their specific requirements clear. It was going to be expensive, for one thing. They had to raise at least $400,000, or $500,000 if she wanted her “Cadillac plan.” The map of Loudoun County is a Mandelbrot set of nested subdivisions, and three of her precincts — the Villas, Lansdowne Woods and the Ashby Ponds retirement community — are gated and thus “unknockable,” which meant the campaign would have to double down on phone banking. This would require a lot of coordination. Running against a seven-year incumbent, Reid also faced a huge deficit in name recognition, which meant that early preparatory canvassing was just as important as a late turnout effort.

Money and time would always be the hardest asks, but while Sorenson was still neck-braced and understaffed, there were plenty of basic start-up tasks to complete. One outfit offered to make the campaign an easily updatable website. Another sent a member to take photographs, which saved the campaign $700. Sorenson offhandedly mentioned that it would be nice to have a spreadsheet itemizing all of Tag Greason’s votes in his seven years in the House of Delegates — bill number, how he voted, why it matters. She had it within hours. Yet another organization delivered print-at-home postcards that recalled classic Americana, marked with parks and schools and polling places; she wanted people to keep in mind that the 32nd district was an actual place. She loved the postcards, even if she had to send repeated reminders about which disclosures were necessary to make them compliant with campaign-finance law.

It wasn’t lost on her that some of the work being done was redundant, and that some of her interactions required more effort than they ultimately returned, but Sorenson understood that the new spirits were fragile. She tried to remind herself that each group brought its own perspective or talent, even as her attempt to outline their special characteristics revealed a litany of special needs. One group was part of a Jewish organization and thus couldn’t canvass on Saturdays. Another one wanted to know how to get over to Loudoun without paying tolls, and many of its members were older and needed printed directions or car pools. But Sorenson’s willingness to keep track of and accommodate all these preferences gave her word-of-mouth fame. No research trial — volunteer-coordination software, fund-raising by text message — was too small or bug-ridden for her to disdain, and she joked that she was first in every line to serve as a guinea pig.

In June, Shaun Daniels, then an executive director of an influential PAC called Win Virginia, told me, “No one anywhere is working with more outside groups than Kathryn.” Democratic politics had entered a new era of experimentation, he said, and “this here is ground zero.”

By the middle of June, Sorenson had hired a field director and a field organizer, both from the Clinton campaign. They chose the weekend of June 24 for their earnest summer opener — a “Weekend of Action” — in part because it coincided with a Network NoVA event called the Women’s Summit. This daylong happening brought together participants from across the pop-up group universe to hear speeches from 35 of the House of Delegate candidates left standing after the Democratic primaries the week before. These primaries had delivered a remarkable slate — most of them first-time candidates, a majority of them women, including many from the working class and many of color. Sorenson did not feel competitive, and had great warmth for her colleagues in other races, but she knew that some of the pop-up groups would be tempted to exchange Reid for a candidate of greater charisma or a more diverse background, like the sheep farmer in a nearby district. She didn’t want her outside collaborators to forget that they joined up with her (and Reid’s) effort early and for good reasons.

The other salient election was the recent runoff between Jon Ossoff and Karen Handel in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District. Sorenson herself was not disposed to draw any big lessons from Ossoff’s defeat, which she was by nature unable to regard as a leading indicator on the president, or the Democratic Party, or the role of outside patrons. It seemed to her that the campaign was waged about as well as it could have been in a district that was close to impossible for a Democrat to win. For many of her volunteers, however, the loss felt like a dispiriting prelude to what was supposed to be a stirring campaign kickoff.

Early in the morning, a crowd of campaign staff members, longstanding volunteers and outside irregulars milled around Reid’s home in anticipation of their canvassing shifts. The family’s two shiba inus were underfoot, the coffee table was decorated with back issues of astronomy and archaeology magazines and the whole place smelled faintly but persistently of maple syrup. There were cars from Massachusetts and Missouri, and Reid joked more than once about how he kept meaning to give out an award for the person who traveled the farthest to be there. The volunteers were mostly women, and mostly middle-aged, and had come outfitted for day hikes of moderate exertion. Whenever one of them was asked which group, if any, she had come with, there was a perceptible pause as she thought about the profusion of mailers in her inbox and posts in her Facebook feed.

Those there for the first time were nervous about how they would be greeted. A woman from Vienna, Va., named Francesca, in capri-length cargo pants, sturdy boots and a beaded necklace, raised her hand. She had come on behalf of half a dozen groups. “Am I going to look like a carpetbagger, or should I say that I care so much that I came here from elsewhere?”

Reid looked to Sorenson before responding. “Nobody will ask you because you look like the district — it’s pretty diverse here. We joke that we give an award for the person who came the furthest. All of this, here, it’s really starting to make a difference.” The volunteers were shuffled through a brief orientation, which was longer on Reid’s biography — a foster child who was the first in his family to go to college; a local businessman who sent his daughters to the public schools; a retired Navy Reserve intelligence officer who gave 23 years of service to his country — than it was on his positions. But the point of the summer canvass was deliberately introductory.

Francesca, the woman from Vienna, cleared a space for me in her cluttered minivan. She’d worked on clean-energy policy, she told me en route, but her entire department was recently eliminated. We passed a new data center across from a data center under construction. She delivered an impassioned monologue as she tried to pay attention to the GPS; she had an air of spiky distraction, as if stopping to scowl at news alerts while watching a TV show. “Now the Klan is out in Charlottesville when they take down the Confederate monuments. Just the other day I went to the website of the Southern Poverty Law Center for the first time in my life. It’s intersectionality. If affluent people like me aren’t caring about Black Lives Matter, well — it kind of opened my eyes. We can’t ever not be engaged again. It’s like the Founding Fathers’ idea of the yeoman government. My progressive friends, they’re on Facebook but they’re not out canvassing and phone-banking. There’s nothing else going on in ’17, and there’s all this pent-up energy.”

Francesca said she had gone to the Women’s Summit the previous morning and left exhilarated, but what she took away from the conference wasn’t wholly clear. Each delegate emphasized the importance of gerrymandering, and health care, and school funding, and rural broadband, and the state of the roads. If the national Democratic Party really was in crisis, torn between cultural politics and pocketbook issues, it certainly wasn’t visible at the summit. The biggest applause line of the day came from Danica Roem, a transgendered former journalist and “freshman member of the Democratic Party” who won a surprise victory in a four-way primary in District 13, to the south. “My opponent,” she said with national-stage charisma, “cares more about where I go to the bathroom than how you get to work!” Francesca, however, seemed to have little interest in low-stakes issues like the office vacancies on Manassas Drive. “We’re literally fighting for our democracy,” she said. “It’s ‘Handmaid’s Tale.’ ”

We got out to canvass in a subdivision of modest flagpoled homes on branching cul-de-sacs. Francesca traipsed over people’s lawns and rapped hard on doors. The hit rate with canvassing is always low, and over two hours on a hot and cloudless Sunday, we encountered only half a dozen families at home.

In the few conversations Francesca did have, she was invariably friendly and polite, but her pitch about Reid was mostly that he was a great guy; every once in a while she remembered to say that he was in favor of full-day kindergarten districtwide or distance-based tolls on the Dulles Greenway. In her one extended interaction, a young mother began by saying that her family cared above all about full-day kindergarten. She had only ever voted in presidential elections, she admitted, but then managed, over the course of five minutes, to convince herself that she was wrong to do so.

“I don’t vote in the local but I guess I really need to now,” she said.

“Well, I was never out canvassing before, either!” Francesca said.

Some volunteers I accompanied were more careful to stay off lawns, or more fluent in the local issues, or had greater experience with the mechanics of political campaigns; some remembered that a “1” on the voter-information sheet meant most likely to vote for David Reid, while others were sure that great enthusiasm was recorded with a “5.” On the record, they were always positive about their huddles and steering committees, even if off the record they wondered whether the welter of organizations meant duplicative or otherwise-inefficient resource allocation. No one, however, seemed frustrated by the fact that they reached only a handful of voters, or discouraged from making a return trip.

By the end of the weekend, more than 40 volunteers had knocked on more than 2,500 doors. Sorenson rarely allowed herself to be thrilled by anything, but she conceded some satisfaction that these were patently terrific results. This wasn’t to say that everything had gone smoothly. When canvassing was over, Sorenson checked the campaign’s email account to find a restrained but irate message from a community member, upset that his home’s “no soliciting” sign was ignored. The volunteer stood and argued about the First Amendment. The voter leaned Republican, he continued, but had always voted on both sides of the aisle, and from what he knew about David Reid, he was interested. This encounter, however, had cost them his vote.

This didn’t sound to Sorenson like one of her own people. She looked up the planned itineraries of one of the outside groups — an organization dedicated to voter-suppression issues — and found that it must have been someone from its camp. Sorenson wasn’t sure there was much she could do. “They have a different list, and a different script, and different priorities. We tell our people in training not to get into constitutional battles, but each group does its own thing.”

The interaction was, Sorenson thought, a bummer, but she couldn’t afford to dedicate any more time to it just then. She had email to answer, and as she took out her phone, I looked down at mine. There was a news alert that the Supreme Court had upheld part of Trump’s travel ban, and I read it aloud. At first Sorenson didn’t seem to know what I was talking about. Then she said: “Oh, him. I can’t even worry about him. I can’t even think about him.” She was late for another call, this one with the group that had the wrong compliance box on their folksy print-at-home postcards. It lasted an hour.

It is never easy to assess a campaign’s progress, particularly one that is likely to be won or lost by a few hundred votes, but over the summer the Reid campaign appeared to have cultivated a meaningfully committed base, among local voters and elsewhere. A San Francisco group called the Sister District Project, which pairs volunteers in deeply blue or red districts with campaigns in purple ones and had quickly become one of Sorenson’s most useful and beloved allies, had helped them set up an Amazon Wish List. Now far-flung supporters could buy them toner or printer paper. They handily outraised Delegate Greason for the month of June — $53,000 to his $39,000 — with five and a half times as many total contributions and 12 times as many grass-roots donors. Greason was still up $36,000 in cash on hand, but there was almost certainly enough time to close that gap, especially since the Reid campaign had raised enough money to hire a finance director, a young woman who had worked on the Ohio senatorial campaign; she would save Sorenson countless trips to the Post Office and the bank. On the third weekend in July, Sorenson was working from home when she checked the campaign’s Facebook page and saw a photo of some 30-odd canvassers, 20 of them from the group that had done the campaign’s website. “I was like, Holy cow, you usually see those numbers later in the year.” By the end of August they’d visited 32,556 doors. The House Democratic Caucus looked at their stats and decided to award them two additional paid positions.

The major development was an unexpected shift in the dynamics at the top of the ticket. The governor and the state’s two senators were Democrats; the pipe dream for November 2017 was to bring the State Legislature into line. In August, however, the Republican gubernatorial candidate — a former lobbyist, R.N.C. chairman and all-around establishment figure named Ed Gillespie — hired an erstwhile Trump campaign operative and reinvented himself in the president’s image. He began to speak out against the removal of Confederate monuments and in favor of the travel ban. He spoke about the danger of “sanctuary cities,” even though Virginia has none, and ran campaign ads about Latino gang violence that prompted a rare public rebuke from Obama.

It was hard to tell how this affected Sorenson’s race, though the summer poll wasn’t good; Reid was down by seven. But the race, Sorenson knew, was always going to come down to turnout. The weekend after Labor Day would hopefully set the tone for the fall, when, with any luck, the name recognition they’d worked to foster might begin to translate into voter commitments. When returning summer volunteers arrived, they found a more mature operation: there was a sign-in table in the entryway, three times the turnout and a campaign staff large enough for one person to do check in, one person to divide the turf and a third to guide the orientations.

Reid as a candidate seemed looser and more confident. He’d received recent endorsements from the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, and was willing to talk about more difficult subjects. “There’s some hesitation among people of color to put up yard signs” for a Democrat, he told a group of volunteers, “after what we’ve seen, down in Charlottesville and elsewhere, with the emboldening of white supremacists.” He did not seem like the sort of person who’d ever had reason to refer to white supremacy. He was, however, still making the same joke about giving an award to whoever had traveled the farthest to volunteer.

For canvassers, the script was slightly different in this phase of the campaign. They were now instructed to ask directly if the campaign could count on the respondent’s vote. The field organizer explained that if volunteers found themselves in a position to discuss Delegate Greason’s record in Richmond, they should mention that he missed more than 700 votes — 713, to be precise. A volunteer raised his hand to ask how many pieces of legislation actually came before the delegates; he thought it would be more impressive to express Greason’s absences as a percentage. Sorenson, at her computer, rolled her eyes. Once he left, she looked up. “I know exactly how many pieces of legislation came before the chamber, and I picked that number for a reason! We do not want to express it as a percentage.”

For every volunteer who saw fit to challenge the campaign’s authority or its expertise, however, there were half a dozen there for a political education. If everybody hated the tolls, more than one canvasser asked, why were they so high? Well, the campaign answered, the Australian firm that owned the Dulles Greenway had donated $8,000 to Delegate Greason. There was something about the modesty of that figure that got even distant volunteers incensed on behalf of the local community. The conflicts surrounding Trump’s D.C. hotel and the emoluments clause were exasperating but remote in their immensity, whereas a $6 toll for a $2.29 bottle of milk was an affront you could grasp.

With 11 days to go before the election, their ground strategy shifted from the voter-commitment stage to the final get-out-the-vote effort; on the campaign’s final Saturday, they enlisted 205 volunteers to go door to door helping voters articulate an explicit plan for when and how they’d go to the polls on Tuesday. The race, as Sorenson predicted, was going to come down to turnout on the margins: their tracking poll had them in a dead heat. Sorenson’s estimate was that Reid needed 13,150 votes to win, and it was easy for her to imagine that the final tallies would be within the 1 percent margin that would trigger an automatic recount. With the race tightening, Greason sent mailers that described Reid as a radical leftist who had taken “tens of thousands of dollars from New York, Washington and California.” Sorenson showed it to me and shrugged. “Well, that last part’s true.”

Sorenson was grateful for all the money and help from her outside volunteers, but what most moved her was when she felt someone had made the organizational leap from political fury to political identification. When one of her Sister District captains in Maryland asked for a yard sign, Sorenson furrowed her brow and asked her why she wanted one on the other side of the river. The volunteer simply said, “We need to expand what we think of as our own backyard.” Sorenson didn’t have a lot of time for mawkishness, but that idea, she said, “is just beautiful to me.” And she could appreciate whatever it was that got people newly involved in politics and kept them there. If Indivisible wanted to call Virginia “the first statewide referendum on Trump,” that was fine with her, as long as they didn’t set expectations so high that their support couldn’t survive a disappointment.

Election Day was a dark deluge of hard, driving rain. Sorenson put on high green galoshes and met Reid at his polling place at 7 a.m., then sent him on a tour of polling locations to shake hands and take selfies. She went back to their staging location in the rec room of some dedicated supporters. Everybody seemed to have a different idle conviction about which kind of voter was most susceptible to the weather, but Sorenson screened out the chatter, sitting on a high stool in front of her laptop, an overheated phone in her hand. She left only to vote herself, and to check up on an alarming but ultimately false story she heard about an older supporter who’d had her ballot disqualified for no reason.

The foot traffic — not just the usual folks from D.C. or Maryland, but people who came from California, Florida and Iowa — was so steady that the campaign began to run out of clipboards. Volunteers would arrive, muddy and soaked, peel off their clear ponchos and hand over their unreadably macerated voter rolls. By midafternoon, they were almost finished with the fifth complete pass they’d done, over their 11-day “mobilization window,” of all 10,000 doors in their universe. Most returnees declared that everyone on their lists had either voted already or was just waiting for a spouse to come watch the kids; some of them stopped Sorenson to tell her stories about how they took a moment at the end of their shifts to circle back around and check on these promissory replies, and more often than not they encountered “I voted” stickers. Then they’d be handed a new packet and sent back out into the rain. Someone in need of reprieve asked Sorenson when she planned to wrap things up for the day. “When do you stop? If your nearest polling place closes at 7:00 and is two minutes away, you stop at 6:58.”

Sorenson didn’t feel she could really trust the numbers that were coming in — turnout, she thought, couldn’t realistically be as high as it seemed to be — but by 4 o’clock she could no longer ignore the fact that most polling places had already far exceeded the totals they usually showed in off years. She dealt with her mounting anxiety by making new spreadsheets to compare precinct-level historical data and devoted her last hour of her campaign’s last day to one final round of phone-banking to voters in what she worried was her one underperforming precinct.

The campaign party was at a favorite strip-mall wine bar. Sorenson went home to change, thinking she might have a moment to herself before the results came in, but by the time she and the rest of her team arrived, 90 percent of Loudoun’s precincts were reporting. Reid’s race was one of the first calls. He won with more than 17,000 votes, by at least 17 points. Shoals of well-wishers formed around Sorenson, touching her arms and shoulders and yelling through their tears. “You are so [expletive] awesome,“ one said. “You brought happiness back into our lives,” said another.

Sorenson made her way through the crowd slowly and with only a small, hesitant, curious smile. Every few minutes the growing crowd reacted to new results. Wins at the top of the ticket brought sighs of relief, but the shouted announcement of each successive delegate victory triggered gasps and whoops of astonishment: the first Asian-American woman, the first two Latina women, the first out lesbian, the first trans woman, an African-American woman, even a woman in a Trump district; altogether at least 11 new Democratic women, seven from Northern Virginia alone, in a swell that seemed likely to result in 16 flipped districts for a tied House. Eventually Sorenson sat down with her finance and field directors — the three young women, Reid later proclaimed, who organized a legion of volunteers and brought them to victory — to eat some cheese; she particularly liked the kind of Brie they had there, which is why they chose the venue for the party. She stopped to read a congratulatory text from “Joe Biden’s guy.”

Her finance director looked over at her and asked, through a flood of tears: “How are you so calm? I feel like we’ve all been in our little bubble, but look” — she gestured toward the television overhead — “we’re on MSNBC! How are you not crying?”

Sorenson just smiled her smile of mellow detachment, and finally spoke. “I just kind of want to throw my phone into the ocean.”",How the ‘Resistance’ Helped Democrats Dominate Virginia,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/magazine/how-the-resistance-helped-democrats-dominate-virginia.html

Mr. McConnell’s pronouncement made it clear that the accounts were as good as proven in his eyes and increased the prospect that Mr. Moore would face a significant challenge to joining the Senate even if he prevails in the election on Dec. 12. A parade of new calls from Republican senators for Mr. Moore to bow out followed.

Expelling Mr. Moore could present an advantage to Senate Republicans since it could create a vacancy and set off another special election in Alabama, giving the party a chance to find a new candidate. The uproar over his candidacy is also providing Mr. McConnell and his allies with evidence that the effort to oust establishment Senate Republicans being led by Stephen K. Bannon, the former adviser to President Trump, could be disastrous if Mr. Moore is an example of who they intend to support.

But the fight over Mr. Moore could also elicit a harsh backlash from conservative activists aligned with Mr. Bannon and deepen the party split that is already looming as an obstacle in the 2018 midterm elections.

Republicans are also weighing the potential of a write-in campaign behind an alternative candidate. It worked for Senator Lisa Murkowski in Alaska in 2010, but such successes are exceedingly rare. A write-in campaign by a Republican could split the party vote and bolster the chances of the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor. Mr. Jones could also win outright, a result that could solve many thorny problems for Mr. McConnell but would leave Republicans with one less seat and a narrow 51-49 majority when they are already struggling.

Mr. McConnell does not appreciate such complications. When Mr. Craig was arrested and pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in the airport sting, Mr. McConnell set out to prevent him from even returning to the Capitol to avoid a spectacle. The leadership stripped Mr. Craig of his committee leadership positions and made clear that if he decided to return, he would face additional ethics scrutiny.

Mr. Craig quickly announced he would resign his Senate seat. He then reneged and decided to serve out his term, but the ethics committee admonished him for his behavior and he was treated as an outcast by many of his colleagues.

In the Packwood case, Mr. McConnell delivered findings on the Senate floor, describing his colleague’s “physical coercion” of women and “a habitual pattern of aggressive, blatantly sexual advances, mostly directed at members of his own staff or others whose livelihoods were connected in some way to his power and authority as a senator.” Republicans ultimately lost that seat after Mr. Packwood’s resignation.

“I don’t think there has ever been a leader with a more aggressive no-tolerance policy toward sex abuse allegations,” said Josh Holmes, a former top aide to Mr. McConnell who remains a close adviser. “In his mind, there is no political calculation to make when this kind of thing arises. It’s far more important to protect the integrity of the Senate than the partisan makeup of its membership.”

Though he wanted Mr. Packwood gone, Mr. McConnell wanted it done his way. When Democrats pushed for public hearings that could embarrass Republicans, Mr. McConnell blocked the effort by threatening retaliatory hearings on various Democrats like Edward M. Kennedy.

A Supreme Court justice, Sonia Sotomayor, even saw a game there in August.

Judge’s season included a prolonged slump; he hit .179 from July 14 through the end of August, after batting .329 before the All-Star break. He was unflappable throughout, with a calm, humble demeanor and the assurance that he would recover. On his conference call with reporters Monday, Judge recalled a lesson from Carlos Beltran at spring training in 2016.

“I asked him, ‘How’s it been for you, going through the ups and downs each year, through injuries and stuff like that?’” Judge said of Beltran, who retired Monday after 20 seasons. “And he said: ‘Hey, you’ve got to realize that you could be hot in the first couple of months, or you could start off bad in the first couple of months, but you know what? It’s baseball, it’s all going to even out. So if you just stay as even-keel as possible, don’t try to ride the ups and downs, just stay positive with everything, your numbers, your results, and where your team wants to be will be there at the end of the year.’

“Hearing that from a veteran presence like that, who never pressed in any situation, was pretty cool to hear.”

Since the end of the season, Judge’s profile has continued to rise. Last week, Sony revealed him as the new cover star of its popular video game MLB The Show. On Monday, Pepsi announced an endorsement deal with him. Typically, Judge deflected attention from himself.

“There’s a lot of young faces who could be the face of M.L.B.,” he said. “If you look around, from a lot of the rookies we had this year, a lot of the younger guys in their early to mid-20s, and how they’ve impacted the game — we’ve got a special group here in Major League Baseball. How the playoffs went this year, the excitement around this game right now, it’s a special time to be in the big leagues.”

Bellinger, 22, joined the Dodgers in late April and helped the team to 104 victories, the most for the franchise since its move from Brooklyn in 1958. He drove in 97 runs and hit .267 with a .933 O.P.S., while splitting time between first base and the outfield.

Bellinger, the son of the former Yankees utility man Clay Bellinger, joined a long list of Dodgers to win the award. The Dodgers have now claimed 18 rookies of the year, including Robinson — the first — and shortstop Corey Seager, a unanimous winner in 2016. The Yankees, with nine, have the second-most rookies of the year.

For all their success, though, Judge and Bellinger were humbled at times in the postseason. In the Yankees’ division series victory over Cleveland, Judge went 1 for 20 and set a postseason series record for strikeouts, with 16. The record lasted less than a month, because Bellinger broke it in the World Series. He was 4 for 28 in the seven-game loss to Houston, with 17 strikeouts.

Some of Mr. Kavaliauskas’ subjects, in fact, aren’t clearly identifiable as plane spotters.","There’s a funny paradox about flying, said the Lithuanian photographer Mindaugas Kavaliauskas: Those in the air often wish they were on the ground, and those on the ground often dream of being in the air.

“In Lithuanian, we have a proverb: ‘A neighbor’s apples are always tastier,’” he said.

Mr. Kavaliauskas knows that firsthand. As a frequent flyer, he has experienced the boredom, discomfort and stress that often accompanies air travel, feelings he captured in his decade-long project on fellow travelers, which Lens featured last year. But he also knows the lure of freedom and excitement that flying presents to people on the ground, an understanding he gained while photographing people who spend hours relishing the view above.

“There are people who watch football,” he said. “There are others who go fishing. These people go out to watch airplanes.”

Over the last two years, Mr. Kavaliauskas has photographed people in more than a dozen cities around the world. He discovered there are hugely popular locations that attract hundreds of people. On St. Martin, scores of tourists on Maho Beach gawk at the famously low-flying planes making their descent into Princess Juliana International Airport. In Denmark, diners at The Airplane Grill come specifically to watch the landings and departures at Copenhagen Airport.

At those places, the atmosphere can be carnivalesque. But plane-spotting also draws people to desolate places in “the middle of nowhere,” Mr. Kavaliauskas said. There, the hobby can be a solitary and sober pursuit.

“One night, I saw three students who’d just graduated high school and were looking at airplanes, discussing what they want to do in life,” he said. “So sometimes this scenery is for entertainment. Other times it’s a place for serious contemplation.”

Photo

Thanks to various apps and websites providing real-time flight information or access to radio chatter from air traffic control, spotting planes is a fairly accessible pursuit for aviation geeks. But plane-spotter spotting, Mr. Kavaliauskas said, is trickier. Several times he trekked to a remote plane-spotting location he’d found online, only to discover a single spotter, or none. But those situations can still yield interesting photographs, Mr. Kavaliauskas said. So, too, can scenes where airplanes aren’t even present.

Some of Mr. Kavaliauskas’ subjects, in fact, aren’t clearly identifiable as plane spotters. Taken out of context, they could be enjoying a parade, or watching birds. In these images, Mr. Kavaliauskas’ focus is human relationships — the father and son peering through a telescope, or the new parents lifting their baby in the air for a photo.

“What I actually liked about this project was that there was often no immediate picture to take,” he said.

Not all plane watchers are necessarily aviation enthusiasts. Some do it to see their relatives taking off. Some just enjoy the scenery with a date or with their families. Others, he said, want to feel vicariously connected to the planes, passengers and the far-off places they’ll likely never visit.

“It’s a way to kind of consume the world,” he said.

Climate progress has historically been driven from the bottom-up, not the top down from Washington. Though Congress failed to pass a cap-and-trade bill to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in 2009 during the Obama administration, the United States has still reduced emissions faster and farther than any other large nation.

In fact, we are already almost halfway to reaching our Paris commitment, thanks largely to consumer preferences and market forces. Half the country’s coal plants have closed or are being phased out while air quality improves and electricity bills fall for American consumers.

In the current political climate, however, there is a risk that nonfederal actions will go unrecognized by the global community. To ensure the world sees the continued commitment of the United States to tackling climate change, and the extent to which local governments and businesses are driving progress, we have introduced an initiative called America’s Pledge, which will document the progress we are making — and the bolder actions we must still take — to meet our Paris commitments.

This week in Bonn, we released a report detailing existing nonfederal climate initiatives and policies across America. The report also identifies major new opportunities for cities, states and businesses to take climate action without the federal government.

For instance, more states can opt in to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a carbon pricing program involving nine Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states to drive down power plants emissions, or California’s independently managed vehicle emissions programs, including its Zero Emission Vehicle Mandate, which nine states have adopted. More cities can adopt greener building codes, policies and programs to reduce electricity waste.

And more businesses can follow the lead of the 43 American supermarket chains that have committed to reducing their emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, a potent greenhouse gas used in refrigeration.

Together, these actions will strengthen the economy and improve public health, while also helping the United States move faster toward its Paris commitment. Over the next year, we will aggregate and quantify these actions and continue pushing for new efforts to speed up decarbonization.

If you miss NASA’s space shuttles, you might like the Dream Chaser.

The compact space plane carries no crew, but will transport cargo to the International Space Station in the years ahead and conduct other missions in orbit around the Earth. On Saturday, the vehicle completed an important milestone in its development.

A helicopter lifted Dream Chaser more than 2.3 miles off the ground, then dropped it. Over the course of one minute, the craft accelerated to 330 miles per hour, made a couple of turns and glided 10 miles to a runway at Edwards Air Force Base in California. It touched down at a speed of 191 miles per hour, rolling 4,200 feet before coming to a stop.

“The vehicle is in perfect shape, no issues,” Mark N. Sirangelo, the head of Sierra Nevada Space Systems, the maker of the Dream Chaser, said in an interview.

Mr. Sirangelo said he thought no more glide tests would be needed. If NASA agrees, the very next flight of the Dream Chaser might be a return from orbit two or three years from now at the end of a mission taking cargo to and from the space station. It is to land on the same runway at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida that the space shuttles once used.

Last year, NASA awarded Sierra Nevada a contract for at least six cargo flights.

The Dream Chaser is an autonomous, self-flying spacecraft, and this iteration will not carry any people. Saturday’s test demonstrated that the software that guides the vehicle worked as designed.

By now, some of my colleagues are veteran chroniclers of such shootings, grimly bumping into one another with gallows humor over the past few years in Las Vegas; Colorado Springs; San Bernardino, Calif.; Roseburg, Ore.; and Orlando, Fla.

Perhaps because of the small size of Sutherland Springs, the ungainliness of the media’s rush to cover the latest shooting touched a nerve here. As satellite trucks staked out coveted parking spots and broadcasters from around the world described the town’s horrors in German or Russian or Portuguese, tempers flared.

Some residents in the town simply slammed doors in journalists’ faces, a reaction any of us might have had under such circumstances. Others in the town put a price on their cooperation. Reporters from a wide array of organizations scrambled to interview anyone else they could find.

“Eventually the media pressure began to weigh even on me,” Lauren McGaughy, a reporter for the Dallas Morning News, wrote in an eloquent apology to the people of Sutherland Springs. “I did a few on-the-ground interviews before rejecting the rest. It was too stressful. I expressed my growing disgust with a few other journalists, and many agreed with me.”

Journalists were not the only ones who descended on the town. Sidewalk preachers from San Antonio convened at the Valero gas station opposite the church, bellowing their prayers, if not in front of townspeople then for reporters’ iPhone cameras. Chaplains from the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team meandered through the town.

Brad Kessler, an aspirant for mayor of San Antonio, dropped in to shake hands around the yellow crime-scene tape that cordoned off the killing field. The Homicide Survivors Support Group of Corpus Christi set up a table with stuffed animals, where reporters quickly conducted interviews with the volunteers.

I grew up in a rural outpost in northern New Mexico about the size of Sutherland Springs. I know how suspicious, and sometimes awed, residents of small towns can be of privileged, big-city visitors. Still, I have a hard time imagining what it’s like for the people here to have so many cameras pointed at them and so many tape recorders thrust their way.

As some of the network television trucks began to pull out of town, I wondered how big a role I myself had played in amplifying the suffering of Sutherland Springs. After all, I, too, had approached residents who wanted nothing to do with reporters. I’d asked Ms. Solis, the factory worker, to talk to me when she could have been tending the shoulder where a bullet had sundered her flesh.

When the country endures one mass shooting after another, why they happen certainly ought to be the main focus of the national conversation. But maybe it’s time we also discuss how they’re covered on the ground.

On Friday evening the MSNBC host Chris Hayes sent out a tweet that electrified online conservatives: “As gross and cynical and hypocritical as the right’s ‘what about Bill Clinton’ stuff is, it’s also true that Democrats and the center left are overdue for a real reckoning with the allegations against him.” Hayes’s tweet inspired stories on Glenn Beck’s The Blaze, Breitbart and The Daily Caller, all apparently eager to use the Clinton scandals to derail discussions about Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for the United States Senate in Alabama who is accused of sexually assaulting minors.

Yet despite the right’s evident bad faith, I agree with Hayes. In this #MeToo moment, when we’re reassessing decades of male misbehavior and turning open secrets into exposes, we should look clearly at the credible evidence that Juanita Broaddrick told the truth when she accused Clinton of raping her. But revisiting the Clinton scandals in light of today’s politics is complicated as well as painful. Democrats are guilty of apologizing for Clinton when they shouldn’t have. At the same time, looking back at the smear campaign against the Clintons shows we can’t treat the feminist injunction to “believe women” as absolute.

Writing at Crooked.com, Brian Beutler warns that in future elections, right-wing propaganda will exploit the progressive commitment to always taking sexual abuse charges seriously. It’s easy to imagine an outlet like Breitbart leveraging the “believe women” rallying cry to force mainstream media coverage of dubious accusations.

The Clinton years, in which epistemological warfare emerged as a key part of the Republican political arsenal, show us why we should be wary of allegations that bubble up from the right-wing press. At the time, the reactionary billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife was bankrolling the Arkansas Project, which David Brock, the former right-wing journalist who played a major role in it, described as a “multimillion-dollar dirty tricks operation against the Clintons.” Various figures in conservative media accused Bill Clinton of murder, drug-running and using state troopers as pimps. Brock alleges that right-wing figures funneled money to some of Clinton’s accusers.

In this environment, it would have been absurd to take accusations of assault and harassment made against Clinton at face value. On Monday, Caitlin Flanagan, perhaps taking up Hayes’s challenge, urged liberals to remember some of what Clinton is said to have done. “Kathleen Willey said that she met him in the Oval Office for personal and professional advice and that he groped her, rubbed his erect penis on her, and pushed her hand to his crotch,” Flanagan wrote, recalling the charges Willey first made in 1998. It sounds both familiar and plausible. But Willey also accused the Clintons of having her husband and then her cat killed. Must we believe that, too?

Similarly, there are reasons to be at least unsure about Paula Jones’s claim that Clinton exposed himself to her and demanded oral sex. Jones was championed by people engaged in what Ann Coulter once proudly called “a small, intricately knit right-wing conspiracy” to bring down the president. She described “distinguishing characteristics” of Clinton’s penis that turned out to be inaccurate. Her sister insisted to Sidney Blumenthal, then a New Yorker writer, that she was lying.

Does this concept sound overstuffed? Initially, at least from inside Disney Hall, it threatened to feel disjointed. There, Ms. Gosfield’s thrilling chamber orchestra writing was, by necessity, often cut off by the need to reintroduce Ms. Weaver’s narrator and her latest bit of news about the alien-induced pandemonium.

Yet the hard-charging first movement, “Mercury,” was more than capable of standing on its own as a sizzling orchestral piece. Its references to vintage big-band jazz were refracted through some piercing harmonies. And the writing for brass instruments often merged seamlessly with buzzing, noisy motifs from the composer’s “sampling keyboard,” a vivid instrument of her own design, similarly prominent in some of her earlier work.

By the narrator’s interruptions during the following movement — a witty modernization of a crooner-and-orchestra number — the transitions came across as forced and a touch repetitive. But this early clunkiness abated as soon as Ms. Gosfield’s music was allowed to merge with the dramatic passages for Ms. Weaver’s narrator and the various “outdoor” characters.

One ideal blend came during the opera’s most memorable aria, sung by the character Mrs. Martinez — a witness to the panic outside the hall. The mezzo-soprano Suzanna Guzmán performed the song at one of the raid siren locations, accompanied by pizzicato bass and a lyrically swooning violin stationed nearby. The music was relayed to the crowd in Disney Hall as Mr. Sharon’s staging there brought a visualization of the alien (dubbed La Sirena in the libretto, and sung by Hila Plitmann) being described by Mrs. Martinez. The collapse of physical distance was simple in design, perhaps, but stunning in execution.

These dizzying shifts in narrative space helped the opera seem like more than just a collection of clever gestures. Mr. Sharon wrote in a program note that “there is no privileged perspective” from which to view the production. But at critical moments, it’s obviously hard for audience members not to wonder about which position confers the best possible view. Those unavoidable considerations, in turn, pull the opera away from the comparatively well-trod “fake news” conceit, and toward a poetic way of exploring how different communities might absorb the same developing news story from different vantages and through different media.",Review: A ‘Fake News’ Opera on the Streets of Los Angeles,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/arts/music/review-war-worlds-los-angeles-philharmonic.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

I was a typical beginner, even if I didn’t live in your typical neighborhood: This was the South Bronx during the era when arson and abandonment fueled by government dysfunction turned it into a globally-infamous and desolate urban landscape.

My spirit sometimes felt as broken as the sidewalks and buildings of my neighborhood on Fox Street, since I had grown disillusioned with art school and was floundering with my identity. I was a Puerto Rican and a New Yorker, but it was hard to reconcile those two identities. I struggled in New York because I wasn’t recognized as American. And when I moved to the island for a while, I wasn’t recognized as Puerto Rican, either.

Even in art school I sometimes wasn’t recognized as the one thing I had set out to be – a photographer. Luckily, one of my teachers who was familiar with my work suggested I meet a friend of hers, Mel Rosenthal, who taught photography at Empire State College.

Mel instantly liked what I was shooting, and it was fitting that we met at that time. While I was photographing the Longwood section of South Bronx, Mel was out making pictures on the streets of his youth a few miles north in the Bathgate neighborhood for images that would later be published as “In the South Bronx of America.”

Mel let me into his life, and I was alongside him when he took many of the pictures in his book. We made the connections between his youth as a Jewish man who returned to where he had grown up on the streets of the South Bronx and seeing how its current residents – my family and friends – had been disenfranchised. Mel introduced me to politics and taught me who the players were and how they were being exposed. There was the catalyst that got me thinking how I could use photography to change and document that.

Mel’s approach to documentary photography was shaped by his own strong belief in social justice, which led him back to his old neighborhood to document how its beleaguered residents confronted its decline, the impact of city policies of official neglect, or the guerilla ingenuity of Puerto Rico’s Villa Sin Miedo, a land rescue effort to provide affordable housing.

What was central in his work – and what he taught us – was that when people let you into their lives, your photographs can amplify their voices on the issues that mattered to them, despite the silence and indifference of the rest of the city and its power brokers. Under his guidance, I started making those connections between my neighborhood’s decline and the larger forces buffeting it, from political neglect and corruption to the greed of landlords who cut services and then abandoned their properties or hired people to torch them for insurance.

My work from that era was influenced by Mel’s lessons and his own example as a compassionate photographer on a mission. Sure, I took pictures of the fires, the abandoned buildings or skeletal cars dumped on the streets. But I also caught early B-Boys dancing at the Hunts Point Palace, kids playing on the streets and the other rhythms of life. And, sadly, I also have portraits of friends who would not survive much past their teenage years, their lives cut short by drugs, AIDS or guns.

I am but one of many young, socially aware photographers fortunate to have attended Mel’s seminal workshops where he introduced us to the world of documentary photography and photojournalism. The summer workshops were a six-week intensive course where some of the best photojournalists in the world shared their images of the issues of the time, from covering the wars in Central America to poverty in the middle America and around the world.

The students who attended those workshops fanned out throughout New York City covering the rise of AIDS and the birth of political activism in the gay and lesbian community, as well as protests against racism and police brutality that turned the streets of black and Latino communities into raging battlegrounds. There wasn’t a single week where there wasn’t a demonstration taking place and that was the real classroom where Mel’s students learned their craft.

Mel came into his own as a photographer during the social unrest of the 1960s. Maybe it’s not a coincidence that his former students are now photojournalists documenting very similar deep divisions that are consuming our country.

Mel died last week from the effects of Alzheimer’s, a disease that slowly and painfully took him from us. The best memorial we can give him is to continue the practice as he taught it.

After telling senators at his confirmation hearing in January that he had not had any contacts with Russians, it was revealed that Mr. Sessions held multiple meetings with a Russian ambassador during the campaign.

Now, Mr. Sessions must contend with comments he made last month, in another hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. “I did not, and I’m not aware of anyone else that did,” Mr. Sessions told senators when asked whether he believed members of the campaign had communicated with Russians.

Democrats on the committee put Mr. Sessions on alert in a letter last week, saying that they would want clarification on “inconsistencies” between those statements and those of the two campaign advisers, George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, who have acknowledged having contact with Russians.

The White House will have its eye on his performance.

The White House will be carefully watching Mr. Sessions’s performance. The attorney general has been in hot water with the president since he decided in March to recuse himself from all matters related to Russia, leaving him without control over the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russian efforts to meddle in the election.

Any hiccups in Mr. Sessions’s testimony would most likely only make his problems at the White House worse.

Mr. Sessions will have to mind the partisan divide.

The House Judiciary Committee has a reputation as one of the most politically divided in Congress — and those differences are likely to be on plain display on Tuesday as both Republicans and Democrats wrestle with the sharp changes in policy at the Justice Department instituted under Mr. Sessions.

Republicans mostly approve of those changes, but Democrats will probably grill Mr. Sessions on the effects of curtailing the Obama-era enforcement of antidiscrimination laws, especially protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and the Trump administration’s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

Republicans, on the other hand, are almost certain to press Mr. Sessions on the progress of investigations into potential leaks of classified information, which have tripled under his watch, and into the handling of the Hillary Clinton email case by the Obama Justice Department.

But they will be pleased that Mr. Sessions is coming with good news. On Monday, the Justice Department notified the committee that senior prosecutors were looking into whether a special counsel should be appointed to investigate the Obama administration’s decision to allow a Russian nuclear agency to buy Uranium One, a company that owned access to uranium in the United States. The department will also examine whether any donations to the Clinton Foundation were tied to the approval. Republicans are investigating the matter themselves but have been clamoring for the department to get involved.

Then again, Mr. Sessions’s days at the department could be numbered.

The race to fill Mr. Sessions’s former Senate seat in Alabama has fallen into turmoil in recent days after five women accused the Republican nominee of misconduct when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Despite mounting accusations and calls by fellow Republicans, including the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, to step aside, the candidate, Roy S. Moore, has remained defiant.

That’s where Mr. Sessions comes in.

Two White House officials floated on Monday a scenario under consideration that would have Mr. Sessions either run for his old seat as a write-in candidate to challenge Mr. Moore or be appointed to it should Mr. Moore win and be immediately removed from office. Mr. McConnell is said to be supportive of the idea.

Though a long shot, the move could provide Republicans with a convenient — if awkward — solution to two issues: the prospect of Mr. Moore in the Senate and Mr. Trump’s frustration with Mr. Sessions.

Though Mr. Maduro is widely unpopular, he has used the judiciary and other divisions of government to tighten his hold on power, jail prominent critics and demoralize the opposition, which has suffered deep schisms following a dismal showing in regional elections last month in which the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela was able to buttress its dominance.

The European Union’s foreign ministers cited those elections, which were scarred by allegations of fraud and electoral trickery, as an impetus for its decision on Monday, and they called on the Maduro administration to allow “a comprehensive and independent audit” of the results.

“These developments have accentuated the political polarization in the country,” the group said.

In a statement, the Maduro administration called the new European restrictions “illegal, absurd and ineffective.”

Also on Monday, the government, seeking to ease Venezuela’s economic crisis and avoid a default, began talks in Caracas on renegotiating a crushing foreign debt that has drained its treasury of money to import food and medicine.

Though many major investors around the world balked at an invitation to the meeting, citing safety concerns amid the capital’s violence and the possibility they could run afoul of American sanctions, scores of bondholders or their representatives attended the hourlong gathering. It was held at a regal government building here known as the White Palace.

But government officials at the meeting presented no firm proposals to attendees, Reuters reported, and no future gatherings were scheduled. That left bondholders and analysts struggling to figure out whether the Maduro administration had any sort of strategy to resolve its debt problem.

“I don’t think they have a fully constructed plan,” said Diego Ferro, an executive at Greylock Capital, an investment house that holds Venezuelan bonds though its representatives did not attend the meeting. “To organize this meeting in Caracas at this moment seemed to be more of a political statement on their part than to have a really constructive dialogue. Nothing should really surprise.”

Mr. Maduro has said he hopes to restructure Venezuela’s $63 billion in bonds, most of them issued by the government and the state-run oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, known as Pdvsa. He has made payments on the country’s foreign debt a cornerstone of his economic policy, even at the expense of food, medicine and other critical imports for the country.

Over the weekend, Mr. Maduro reiterated that commitment, according to news services, declaring that Venezuela would “never” declare default.

But many analysts both in Venezuela and abroad have questioned the sincerity of Mr. Maduro’s attempt to refinance the debt, saying that were he indeed serious, he would not have named Tareck El Aissami, his vice president, as head of the effort. The Trump administration imposed sanctions on Mr. El Aissami this year, barring American financial institutions from doing business with him.

All told, Venezuela owes more than $120 billion, including the bond debts, oil payments to Russia and China and outstanding claims by oil service companies.

Further complicating the economic picture for Venezuela, its crude production has dropped below two million barrels per day, to its lowest point in 28 years. Oil is the government’s main source of revenue.

The economic and political pressures on Venezuela were also underscored on Monday at the United Nations, where the Security Council held an informal meeting to discuss the deteriorating situation in Venezuela and its threat to regional stability.

Notably absent was Venezuela’s ambassador, Rafael Ramírez, who held a news conference in which he denounced the meeting as “a hostile act” by the United States and a violation of Venezuela’s sovereignty.

“We will resolve our issues on our own and in peace,” he declared in a Twitter post.

China and Russia, both Security Council members, refused to attend, suggesting that any push by the United States and others for Council action on Venezuela would probably meet strong resistance.

Separately in New York, a derivatives industry trade organization met to discuss Venezuela’s debt situation and whether late bond payments earlier this month from Petróleos de Venezuela constituted a so-called credit event. Such a determination by the group, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, might allow debt holders to collect on a kind of insurance against default known as credit default swaps.

This, in turn, increases their incentive and capacity to favor red over blue states.
In their zeal to extract revenues from blue states, Republicans are threatening our nation’s ability to excel in a global knowledge economy.","Because the Republicans’ most prized constituencies, corporations and the rich, are actually more prevalent in blue states, the overall geographic distribution of the beneficiaries of the current Republican tax bills is mixed. But the growing signs that policies are being written to impose costs on states behind enemy lines are worrisome. A new spoils system based on state partisanship wouldn’t just poison our politics. It could also cripple our economic future.

How do the tax bills favor red over blue states? Most notably, they curtail or eliminate the deductibility of state and local taxes. This is the largest single pay-for in the plans — roughly $1.3 trillion over 10 years in the Senate legislation, which kills the deduction. And a majority of those bearing the cost are tax filers in blue states. Indeed, all of the states that have above-average use of the state and local taxes deduction voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.

The other major tax break in the cross hairs of House Republicans is the home mortgage interest deduction. As with local taxes, all the states that have an above-average number of homes that would be affected by the deduction cap in the House bill voted for Mrs. Clinton. (The Senate version doesn’t include this provision.)

Some of the pay-fors aimed at blue states look even more gratuitous. The House bill would phase out certain deductions for personal casualty losses — but “grandfathers” victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, though not the horrific California fires.

In sum, Republicans have put the majority of their tax cuts on the nation’s credit card, but they’ve handed most of the rest of the bill to blue states.

To see just how unusual that approach is, think back to 2009, when President Barack Obama briefly had a filibuster-proof Democratic majority in the Senate. Did he use it to shift spending away from red states? Hardly. His signature accomplishment, the Affordable Care Act, was most generous to poorer states, where more people lacked insurance — that is, red states.

This effect was of course blunted by the Supreme Court’s ruling that states could refuse the law’s Medicaid expansion and blunted further by the unwillingness of many red states to accept the expansion’s extremely generous terms. Even so, struggling parts of red America have come to depend heavily on Medicaid and other safety-net programs expanded by Democrats in 2009 and 2010.

Nor is the A.C.A.’s favoring of red states an exception. Compared with blue-state residents, people in red states get back much more in federal spending relative to the federal taxes they pay, mainly because red states are poorer on average. In other words, the Republican elimination of the state and local tax deduction is not fixing an “unfair” situation. It makes the existing blue state disadvantage even larger.

The A.C.A.’s universalistic approach has been the norm for a simple reason: National parties represent coalitions of local representatives that cut across state lines. Despite distinctive regional bases, the two major parties have generally featured a significant degree of geographic diversity, so partisan majorities had no political reason to systematically extract resources from some regions to the benefit of others.

As with other lines of division in American politics, however, the geographic lines have been hardening. Today, blue-state Republicans and red-state Democrats are much less common. As the political scientist David Hopkins has pointed out, the 15 coastal and Northeastern states that now form the Democrats’ geographic stronghold send only two Republicans to the Senate. The trends in the House are similar, with the Republican majority containing fewer and fewer seats in solidly blue states.

But Democrats haven’t sought big transfers toward “their” states. Why are Republicans distinctive? Because of a second crucial feature of our federal system: Parties get rewarded not just for winning over specific people but also for winning in specific places. Because Republicans are stronger in the most sparsely populated areas, they possess a growing structural advantage. This, in turn, increases their incentive and capacity to favor red over blue states.

The Republicans’ advantage stems from two main sources. First, the overrepresentation of less-populous states in the Senate has become more consequential as the population gap between crowded and rural states grows and as rural states become more solidly Republican. Second, the increasing concentration of Democratic voters in urban areas — and Republican gerrymandering to exploit this — means more and more Democratic votes are “wasted” on easy wins. As a consequence, Republicans in both the House and the Senate can lose the national popular vote and still control a majority of seats. Democrats, by contrast, still need to win some red regions of the country.

Of course, the remaining Republican legislators in blue states face cross-pressures. But many come from deep-red areas and feel more vulnerable to primary challenges than to a general election opponent. They also fear the wrath of Republicans’ increasingly assertive big-money donors, who often reside outside a politician’s district. As Chris Collins, another New York Republican who is conflicted about the tax bills, admitted, “My donors are basically saying, ‘Get it done or don’t ever call me again.’ ”

Republican leaders are betting that enough blue-state Republicans will put loyalty to party ahead of the prosperity of their state — or at least recognize that the first part of the Republican two-step (big tax cuts for rich people in blue as well as red states) may redound to their benefit even if the second (pay-fors aimed at blue states) doesn’t.

But if their bet pays off, it isn’t just blue states that will suffer. Red America may hold the key to Republicans’ control of government, but blue America holds many of the keys to our nation’s economic future. Indeed, among the blue-state pay-fors, the most troubling may be those that will bleed institutions of higher education, particularly in the House bill. In their zeal to extract revenues from blue states, Republicans are threatening our nation’s ability to excel in a global knowledge economy.

The moral of Civil War pensions is cautionary. Pensions for Union veterans devolved into a spectacularly corrupt system that undermined political support for much-needed universal social policies. High tariffs outlived their utility and helped incite a global trade war in the 1930s. It took the Great Depression to unleash new social programs and major federal investment in the South.

Mr. Trump made trade a major part of his message in Asia, and his tone grew more bluntly nationalistic as the trip wore on.
Mr. Trump’s mixed messages applied to China, too.
Just before leaving Manila on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters he had repaired what he claimed had been a “horrible” relationship between Mr. Duterte and the United States.
“I would actually say, probably better than ever before.”After 12 hectic days in Asia, even Mr. Trump’s critics acknowledge he projected an air of engagement.","“It was red carpet like nobody, I think, has probably ever received,” the president added.

By some measures, he was right. Mr. Trump made no major gaffes. The closest he came was calling the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un “short and fat” in a tweet. He also faced criticism for failing to challenge the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, who is accused of ordering thousands of extrajudicial killings, on human rights.

But Mr. Trump’s energy did not flag and he was accorded a lavish reception at every stop, especially Beijing, where President Xi Jinping threw open the doors of the Forbidden City.

“Like any Trump endeavor, there were the inevitable distractions with tweets about the physical appearance of leaders and clear signals that he prefers the company of tyrants like Putin and Duterte,” said Kurt M. Campbell, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs.

Still, Mr. Campbell said, “If this trip were a high-wire act, President Trump managed to get to the other side.”

And yet there were subtler signs of tension, which spoke to the conflicting messages Mr. Trump brought to Asia and suggested a level of disarray in the White House’s policy toward the region.

Before his meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia, for example, Mr. Trump had a brief contretemps with Mr. Turnbull over trade imbalances after he asserted that the United States ran deficits with “almost everybody.”

“Except us,” Mr. Turnbull interjected.

Mr. Trump made trade a major part of his message in Asia, and his tone grew more bluntly nationalistic as the trip wore on. After declaring in Beijing that he did not blame the Chinese for chronic imbalances with the United States, he delivered a withering denunciation in Vietnam of regional trade pacts, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, from which Mr. Trump has withdrawn the United States.

The president delivered that message in a speech that was supposed to explain his concept of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” region. The idea, which Trump officials borrowed from the Japanese, is that the region’s four major maritime democracies — the United States, Japan, Australia and India — will constitute a bulwark against a rising China.

But this theme was largely lost in the jeremiad on trade. Critics said it testified to the stubborn divide within the administration between mainstream foreign policy figures like Matthew Pottinger, the senior director for Asia at the National Security Council, and economic nationalists like the policy adviser Stephen Miller, who took a strong hand in writing the speech.

“The Indo-Pacific framing is clearly the handiwork of his more experienced and internationally-minded senior national security team, while the ‘America First’ theme of demanding zero-sum concessions from all our trading partners is not,” said Michael J. Green, senior vice president for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Mr. Trump’s invitation for one-on-one trade negotiations with the United States, Mr. Green said, was likely to fall on deaf ears in Asian countries, many of which went though fierce debates before signing on to the Pacific trade deal and now want to reap its benefits.

“That’s like a sheriff squaring up for a showdown with the town outlaw by announcing to the posse that he wants a gunfight with each of them at the same time,” said Mr. Green, who served as President George W. Bush’s senior adviser on Asia policy.

Indeed, while Mr. Trump was preaching his go-it-alone economic message, the 11 countries still in the Trans-Pacific Partnership made significant progress toward finalizing the agreement without the United States. They have given it an even wordier new name, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.

“I think this will be a strong message for not only Asia, but also other regions in the world,” Japan’s economy minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, told reporters.

Mr. Trump’s mixed messages applied to China, too. In Beijing, he embraced the Chinese leader unlike any American president going back to Richard M. Nixon. He said nothing publicly about China’s human rights record. And he cast Mr. Xi as a popular leader who could solve the nuclear crisis with North Korea.

“He’s a strong person,” Mr. Trump said to reporters. “He’s a very smart person. I like him a lot; he likes me. But, you know, we represent two very different countries. But we get along very well. And that’s a good thing that we get along; that’s not a bad thing.”

White House officials said Mr. Trump’s charm offensive had paid off in extracting new commitments from China to shut down North Korean bank accounts. But officials acknowledged that China had not budged on their No. 1 request on North Korea: to cut off all shipments of oil to the North.

Nor did it announce major moves to open its markets during Mr. Trump’s visit, in part because the president did not ask for any.

Moreover, Mr. Trump soft-pedaled his call for China not to colonize the South China Sea. While he emphasized the need for free navigation and open shipping lanes during his visits to Vietnam and the Philippines, he did not single out China, which has clashed with those neighbors as it has built military installations in the disputed waterway.

One of Mr. Trump’s aides marveled at the sheer size of China’s claims in the South China Sea, noting that Air Force One flew for three hours over these contested waters on its way from Hanoi to Manila.

During his meeting with Vietnam’s president, Tran Dai Quang, Mr. Trump offered his deal-making skills to mediate disputes in the South China Sea. But some Asian countries are no longer as ready to pick fights with China. Mr. Duterte stopped construction last week on a sandbar in disputed waters, as part of a broader effort to draw closer to Beijing.

Just before leaving Manila on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters he had repaired what he claimed had been a “horrible” relationship between Mr. Duterte and the United States. “We have a very good relationship,” he said. “I would actually say, probably better than ever before.”

After 12 hectic days in Asia, even Mr. Trump’s critics acknowledge he projected an air of engagement. The question, they said, is whether his mixed messages will open the door further for China’s incursions in the region.

“Despite all the craziness of Trump, the U.S. remains in the game in Asia,” said Evan S. Medeiros, a former adviser to President Barack Obama on China. “But the U.S. is no longer driving the agenda.”",Trump’s Mixed Messages Fail to Reassure Asian Allies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/world/asia/trump-asia-trade-north-korea.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Authoritarian leaders exercise a strange and powerful attraction for President Trump. As his trip to Asia reminds us, a man who loves to bully people turns to mush — fawning smiles, effusive rhetoric — in the company of strongmen like Xi Jinping of China, Vladimir Putin of Russia and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines.

Perhaps he sees in them a reflection of the person he would like to be. Whatever the reason, there’s been nothing quite like Mr. Trump’s love affair with one-man rule since Spiro Agnew returned from a world tour in 1971 singing the praises of thuggish dictators like Lee Kuan Yew, Haile Selassie, Jomo Kenyatta, Mobutu Sese Seko and Gen. Francisco Franco.

Mr. Trump’s obsessive investment in personal relations may work for a real estate dealmaker. But the degree to which he has chosen to curry favor with some of the world’s most unsavory leaders, while lavishing far less attention on America’s democratic allies, hurts America’s credibility and, in the long run, may have dangerous repercussions.

In China, he congratulated Mr. Xi for securing a second term as ruler of an authoritarian regime that Mr. Trump had spent the 2016 campaign criticizing. He again absolved Mr. Putin of interfering in the United States election, despite the finding of American intelligence agencies that Moscow did extensive meddling. As for Mr. Duterte, Mr. Trump effused about their “great” relationship while saying nothing about the thousands of Filipinos who died in a campaign of extrajudicial killings as part of the Philippine president’s antidrug war. En route, he gave a verbal thumbs-up to the Saudi crown prince for arresting hundreds of senior officials and cementing control of the kingdom.

It’s not uncommon for American presidents to foster relations with strongmen. Serving the national interest often means working with leaders who are undemocratic, corrupt, adversarial or all three, and for decades there was no alternative to dealing with whoever had the top job in the Kremlin. People still talk about how naïve President George W. Bush was when he looked into Mr. Putin’s eyes in 2001 and declared the Russian president “trustworthy.” President Barack Obama stuck with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the democratically elected president of Turkey, long after Mr. Erdogan evolved into a dictator. The Chinese and Saudi leaders were favorites of President George H. W. Bush. President Richard Nixon assiduously cultivated China’s Mao Zedong, the shah of Iran and the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.

Still, whatever their strengths and weaknesses, these past presidents worked within a structure of longstanding alliances and, in varying degrees, espoused support for democratic values, including the rule of law and human rights, all the while trying to nudge the autocrats along a similar path.

These facts were not known to me when I corralled my sons, climbed to the upper floor of a bus and crossed the river, trekking to the London neighborhood of Southwark. M. Manze is the oldest of the remaining eel houses, with roots going back to Mr. Poole’s grandfather, an Italian named Michele Manze, who immigrated to Britain as a child in 1878 and opened his first shop in 1902. By 1930, the family had 14 eel shops. Today, eel houses have dwindled and are more of a curiosity, good for a photo op for prominent British pols or a cameo in an Elton John video.

Unassuming from the outside, the eel shop we visited sits across the street from a betting parlor and a humble tandoori joint. But it seemed like we were onto something. There was a long queue out its door to get a spot at one of its 11 tables. A round blue sign out front proclaimed M. Manze’s “The Oldest Surviving Eel & Pie Shop in London.”

When we walked inside, the centuries rolled backward. Behind a high counter, food rose up from the kitchen by dumbwaiter: long trays of beef pies and metal pails piled high with mashed potatoes.

“It’s like a Victorian fast food place,” my older son Casey said.

A guy sporting a Tottenham Hotspur jersey was at one table, a British mother in a Lakers cap at another. A large ruddy-faced man in a three-piece suit accented with a yellow hankie was at a third. After briskly consuming a last bite of beef, he got up and began to walk out, nodding to the women behind the counter as he ambled past.

“Awwright ladies,” he said and took his leave.

I approached the counter tentatively.

“Could I get some eel pies?”

“No,” a woman answered somewhat gruffly, and left it at that.

I retreated and looked up. It was then I realized they served “eel & pie,” not eel pie. I was left to choose between jellied or stewed eels, with each plate about $5.50.

My younger son, Eli, did not hesitate. “Beef,” he said, fixating on a beef pie.

Perhaps he’d noticed that all of the locals were eating beef pies, and that perhaps the eel was more a novelty for the bold, the curious, or American ex-pats such as ourselves. I failed to pick up on this until much later, even though the woman behind the counter was providing a stream of unsubtle signals.

“Better have a taste,” she warned us, depositing samples in small bowls. One consisted of large chunks of eel flesh, another had them encased in a clear gelatin. I nibbled the jellied sample. There was certainly no mistaking that it was nautical. I turned toward my sons with resolve. The bus ride to get here had been about 40 minutes: There was no turning back now.

The woman behind the counter sensed what was coming.

“Oh gawd, you’re not going to make them try it, aww you?” she said.

That seemed like an odd thing to say at an eel house. But I handed Casey a bowl. He took a bite of each, recoiled slightly, but held his ground.

“Stewed,” he said.

A heaping plate of clear jelly soon glistened before me, wobbling over eel chunks. Casey’s was just a mound of eels. I’m not sure who had the greater challenge. We picked at our meals delicately, probing like surgeons.

“All of these bones,” Casey said, casting a feral glance toward his brother.

Eli had been enjoying his beef pie and then drew it closer to his chest. Like most younger brothers, he was forever guarding what was his. He tightened his grip on his plate.

Photo

Candidly, the beef pie had also attracted my attention.

“Oh no you don’t,” Eli insisted to both of us. “Finish your food.”

Mr. Poole later explained that only about a tenth of his customers actually eat eels, and was unsurprised when I told him that my younger son had refused to try.

“I wouldn’t have thought so,” he said. “You’ve got to be pretty open-minded to try eel for the first time.”

I can’t honestly say that Casey and I cleaned our plates, but we ate more eel than we likely will in the rest of our lifetimes. There was a sense of accomplishment. When that passed, we ordered a beef pie for ourselves and rapidly reduced it to crumbs. It became clear why everyone else was ordering the beef pies.

Slightly overwhelmed with what had just taken place, we set aside our plates and took a breath.

“That was …” Casey said, “peculiar.”

We bought some trophy T-shirts, because we deserved to commemorate this in cotton across our chests. We had learned an important eel-house pro tip. Taste the eel. Stick with the beef.","Tasting Victorian London, One Eel at a Time",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/travel/eating-eels-london.html

Patients who agree to take the digital medication, a version of the antipsychotic Abilify, can sign consent forms allowing their doctors and up to four other people, including family members, to receive electronic data showing the date and time pills are ingested.

A smartphone app will let them block recipients anytime they change their mind. Although voluntary, the technology is still likely to prompt questions about privacy and whether patients might feel pressure to take medication in a form their doctors can monitor.

Dr. Peter Kramer, a psychiatrist and the author of “Listening to Prozac,” raised concerns about “packaging a medication with a tattletale.”

While ethical for “a fully competent patient who wants to lash him or herself to the mast,” he said, “‘digital drug’ sounds like a potentially coercive tool.”

Other companies are developing digital medication technologies, including another ingestible sensor and visual recognition technology capable of confirming whether a patient has placed a pill on the tongue and has swallowed it.

Not all will need regulatory clearance, and some are already being used or tested in patients with heart problems, stroke, H.I.V., diabetes and other conditions.

Because digital tools require effort, like using an app or wearing a patch, some experts said they might be most welcomed by older people who want help remembering to take pills and by people taking finite courses of medication, especially for illnesses like tuberculosis, in which nurses often observe patients taking medicine.

The technology could potentially be used to monitor whether post-surgical patients took too much opioid medication or clinical trial participants correctly took drugs being tested.

Insurers might eventually give patients incentives to use them, like discounts on copayments, said Dr. Eric Topol, director of Scripps Translational Science Institute, adding that ethical issues could arise if the technology was “so much incentivized that it’s almost is like coercion.”

Another controversial use might be requiring digital medicine as a condition for parole or releasing patients committed to psychiatric facilities.

Abilify is an arguably unusual choice for the first sensor-embedded medicine. It is prescribed to people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and, in conjunction with an antidepressant, major depressive disorder.

Many patients with these conditions do not take medication regularly, often with severe consequences. But symptoms of schizophrenia and related disorders can include paranoia and delusions, so some doctors and patients wonder how widely digital Abilify will be accepted.

“Many of those patients don’t take meds because they don’t like side effects, or don’t think they have an illness, or because they become paranoid about the doctor or the doctor’s intentions,” said Dr. Paul Appelbaum, director of law, ethics and psychiatry at Columbia University’s psychiatry department.

“A system that will monitor their behavior and send signals out of their body and notify their doctor?” he added. “You would think that, whether in psychiatry or general medicine, drugs for almost any other condition would be a better place to start than a drug for schizophrenia.”

The newly approved pill, called Abilify MyCite, is a collaboration between Abilify’s manufacturer, Otsuka, and Proteus Digital Health, a California company that created the sensor.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The sensor, containing copper, magnesium and silicon (safe ingredients found in foods), generates an electrical signal when splashed by stomach fluid, like a potato battery, said Andrew Thompson, Proteus’s president and chief executive.

After several minutes, the signal is detected by a Band-Aid-like patch that must be worn on the left rib cage and replaced after seven days, said Andrew Wright, Otsuka America’s vice president for digital medicine.

The patch sends the date and time of pill ingestion and the patient’s activity level via Bluetooth to a cellphone app. The app allows patients to add their mood and the hours they have rested, then transmits the information to a database that physicians and others who have patients’ permission can access.

Otsuka has not determined a price for Abilify MyCite, which will be rolled out next year, first to a limited number of health plans, Mr. Wright said. The price, and whether digital pills improve adherence, will greatly affect how widely they are used.

Questions about the technology’s ability to increase compliance remain.

Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, chairman of psychiatry at Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, said many psychiatrists would likely want to try digital Abilify, especially for patients who just experienced their first psychotic episode and are at risk of stopping medication after feeling better.

But he noted it has only been approved to track doses, and has not yet been shown to improve adherence.

“Is it going to lead to people having fewer relapses, not having unnecessary hospital readmissions, being able to improve their vocational and social life?” he asked.

He added, “There’s an irony in it being given to people with mental disorders than can include delusions. It’s like a biomedical Big Brother.”

Abilify, a widely used drug, went off patent recently, and while other companies can sell the generic form, aripiprazole, Otsuka, has exclusive rights to embed it with Proteus’s sensor, said Robert McQuade, Otsuka’s executive vice president and chief strategic officer.

“It’s not intended for all patients with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar,” he added. “The physician has to be confident the patient can actually manage the system.”

Dr. McQuade said, “We don’t have any data currently to say it will improve adherence,” but will likely study that after sales begin.

Proteus has spent years bringing its sensor to commercial use, raising about $400 million from investors, including Novartis and Medtronic, Mr. Thompson said.

Until now, the sensor could not be embedded in pills, but pharmacies could be commissioned to place it in a capsule along with another medication.

In 2016, the encapsulated sensor started being used outside of clinical trials, but commercial use is still limited, Mr. Thompson said.

Nine health systems in six states have begun prescribing it with medications for conditions including hypertension and hepatitis C, the company said, adding that it has been found to improve adherence in patients with uncontrolled hypertension and others.

AiCure, a smartphone-based visual recognition system in which patients document taking medicine, has had success with tuberculosis patients treated by the Los Angeles County Health Department and is working with similar patients in Illinois, said Adam Hanina, AiCure’s chief executive.

He said AiCure has shown promising results with other conditions, including in schizophrenia patients whose pill-taking would otherwise require direct observation.

A Florida company, etectRx, makes another ingestible sensor, the ID-Cap, which has been or is being tested with opioids, H.I.V. medication and other drugs.

Made of magnesium and silver chloride, it is encapsulated with pills and avoids using a patch because it generates “a low-power radio signal that can be picked up by a little antenna that’s somewhere near you,” said Harry Travis, etectRx’s president, who said the company plans to seek F.D.A. clearance next year.

The signal is detected by a reader worn around the neck, but etectRx aims to fit readers into watchbands or cellphone cases.

“I get questions all the time, ‘Hey is the government going to use this, and can you track me?’” said Eric Buffkin, an etectRx senior vice president. “Frankly, there is a creepiness factor of this whole idea of medicine tracking.

“The thing I tell them first and foremost is there’s nothing to reach out of this technology to pry your mouth open and make you take a pill. If you are fundamentally opposed to this idea of sharing the information, then say, ‘No thank you.’”

Seeking to address concerns about privacy and coercion, Otsuka officials contracted with several bioethicists. Among them, I. Glenn Cohen, a Harvard law professor, said safeguards adopted include allowing patients to instantly stop physicians and others from seeing some or all of their data.

Asked whether it might be used in circumstances like probation or involuntary hospitalization, Otsuka officials said that was not their intention or expectation, partly because Abilify MyCite only works if patients want to use the patch and app.

How patients will view Abilify MyCite is unclear. Tommy, 50, of Queens, N.Y., who takes Abilify for schizoaffective disorder, participated in a clinical trial for digital Abilify.

Tommy, who withheld his last name to protect his privacy, encountered minor issues, saying the patch was “a little bit uncomfortable” and once gave him a rash.

A compliant patient, Tommy said he does not need monitoring. “I haven’t had paranoid thoughts for a long time — it’s not like I believe they’re beaming space aliens,” he said. If offered digital Abilify, he said, “I wouldn’t do it again.”

But the method might appeal to patients who want to prove their compliance, build trust with their psychiatrist, or who feel “paranoid about getting accused of not taking their medicine.”

Steve Colori, 31, of Danvers, Mass., who wrote a memoir about his illness, “Experiencing and Overcoming Schizoaffective Disorder,” said he took Abilify years ago for symptoms including believing,“I was a messiah.”

Although he sometimes stopped taking medication, he would consider digital pills “overbearing and I think it stymies someone and halts progress in therapy.”

William Jiang, 44, a writer in Manhattan with schizophrenia, took Abilify for 16 years. He said he steadfastly takes medication to prevent recurrence of episodes of paranoia when “I was convinced everybody was trying to murder me.”

He said some noncompliant patients might take digital Abilify, especially to avoid Abilify injections recommended to patients who skip pills.

“I would not want an electrical signal coming out of my body strong enough so my doctor can read it,” Mr. Jiang said.

Your Money Why It’s Too Soon to Predict What the Tax Changes Will Mean for You Image Credit Robert Neubecker

The news on Thursday that Congress does not (for now at least) plan to fundamentally alter our workplace savings plans was a pleasant surprise on its own. Current homeowners won’t see their mortgage interest deductions disappear, either.

But the fact that these particular trial balloons popped loudly is also a good reminder not to make too much just yet of any of the changes that are under discussion, or the precise figures behind them.

The tax bill unveiled by the House of Representatives was a mix of widely predicted measures, like disallowing the deduction of state and local income taxes for individuals, with a few surprises thrown in, like the end of the dependent care accounts that many families get through employers and use to pay for child care. In the coming days, politicians and pundits will speak with great authority about what will happen now and what it means for you. That’s their job.

My job, however, is to remind you that we should express great skepticism toward anyone who claims to know how this tax bill will evolve, and how any bill would actually change our behavior and our financial lives.

I count at least six major areas of uncertainty.

Nothing may come of any of this.

After what happened with the health care bill this year, there is no reason to have great confidence in the current crop of lawmakers in Washington. Tax reform is arguably harder than health insurance, given how many more constituents this bill may affect.

Even if it passes, the final bill will be different. The Senate will offer its own legislation, and then the haggling will begin in earnest. The debate over deducting state and local taxes for individual taxpayers is almost certainly not over, as lawmakers from high-tax states will put up more of a fight. As of now, those deductions would disappear, though you would still get to deduct up to $10,000 in property taxes.

And any changes that affect the bill’s overall math will require countervailing alterations elsewhere.

Sacred cows are hard to slay.

A hearty congratulations to the Save Our Savings coalition, a financial services industry lobbying group that worked to keep the tax benefits for retirement savings (and the ever-increasing balances in members’ accounts) as they are. Despite all the chatter about reducing the amount you could put in 401(k) accounts and other workplace savings plans before paying income taxes, no lowered cap emerged after all.

That’s not surprising when you consider recent history. When President Barack Obama tried to place some limits on 529 college savings accounts, the blowback was so severe that he backed down within days. It turns out that Americans don’t like to be punished for doing the right thing, financially, for themselves and their families.

Hence the lowered cap on the mortgage interest deduction that also emerged Thursday, which should still encourage some people to buy real estate and use mortgage payments as a forced savings vehicle. The deduction would remain intact for current homeowners.

For people buying in the future (which the bill defines as Nov. 2, 2017, or later), mortgage interest deductions would be allowed only on loans up to $500,000, down from the current cap of $1 million. Moreover, only debt from primary residences would count toward that limit, and you could not include any interest from home equity loans or lines of credit that you took out on that new home.

But how hard will the real estate sales and home builder lobbies push back, and will they succeed?

Our own behavior.

While we cannot be sure exactly how much more or less money we might all have without redoing our taxes once a bill, if any, becomes law, it would be a mistake to try to predict how we’ll all react once we do know.

In the wake of the last big tax reform effort in 1986, the rules changed on the deductibility of credit-card interest. That didn’t keep card companies from devising all sorts of clever ways to induce people to spend and borrow much, much more.

Image The debate over deductions for property taxes and mortgage interest is almost certainly not over. Credit Andrew Burton for The New York Times

Outside actors may have an impact on us, too. If state and local taxes become more expensive because of federal changes in their deductibility, state legislatures might then come under pressure to lower taxes.

Our own changing lives.

The biggest question mark for any of us comes from the unknowable future.

Will we change jobs? Earn more? Have kids? Help our adult children? Retire early because of our own choice, or choices made by employers who no longer want us around? These things matter so much more than any tax rules. Depending on how our lives change, any tax changes may help or hurt.

Changing tax rates over time.

When all of Washington is occupied with today’s proposed tax changes, it’s easy to forget that we’ve been here before and will be here again. Nearly every recent president has taken his shot at revising the system. And while the proposals here are potentially farther reaching, future politicians will make changes, too.

“In the back of my mind, I don’t anticipate taxes staying low for a long period of time,” said Julie Welch , an accountant and financial planner in Leawood, Kan.

After all, we’re adding to the national debt here in the hopes of stoking growth. If that doesn’t work, it won’t change the fact that Medicare and Medicaid will cost ever more money as the population ages. Something will have to give, and because Medicare is one of the most sacred cows of all, we’re more likely to raise taxes again than to make older people pay more for their health care.

Changing tax rules over time.

Our retirement accounts seem safe for now, though it wouldn’t be surprising to see the tax rules for 401(k)’s and similar workplace savings accounts back on the table next week or next year.

In the meantime, consider the possibilities. If more people keep saving in Roth retirement accounts of various sorts, where you don’t get a tax break when you put aside the money but it comes out free of income taxes after decades of appreciation, the balances will one day dwarf what sits in them today. And as they grow, legislators will be tempted to cap their size or to tax withdrawals.

This possibility has to be on the mind of any prudent financial planner working with younger clients who have the most time to save, given how often wholesale changes to Roth accounts have already come under consideration.

“It’s disconcerting to me that planning based on the promise of certain rules and taxation levels is actually being second-guessed after clients had put money into that vehicle,” said Katie Brewer , a financial planner in Garland, Tex., whose clients tend to be in their late 30s.

But that is just how things are going to go with this and so many other tax rules, whether 529 accounts or mortgage interest. So what is there to do in the absence of any certainty?

Avoid rash or unnecessary decisions, and remember that maximizing flexibility is always the best strategy. Be wary of home purchases that depend on tax laws’ staying the same. Invest in enrichment for your kids for the pure fun and joy of learning, but also so they might someday earn scholarships in case your savings plan doesn’t work out perfectly.

And when it comes to retirement, this is an excellent moment to be reacquainting ourselves with what the accountants and financial planners refer to as tax diversification.

In the same way that it’s smart to have a mix of investments that might perform differently at different times, it’s best to divide money among various tax-favored accounts. If you have money in a 401(k) or I.R.A., a Roth account and a normal taxable brokerage account (where you’d tally up your long-term capital gains when you withdraw money, under an entirely different set of tax rules), you should have at least some choices come retirement time.

At that point, you can make the withdrawal from the account that serves your tax goals at that moment.

There is one thing we do know for sure in all of this tax talk: Reformers come, and reformers go. We, however, must persist for six or seven decades of adult living and financial planning, and the only way to do that while staying sane is to give ourselves as much room to maneuver as possible.

While veterans groups largely praised the move, critics said it would do little to help veterans already in the appeals system. That is true for Mr. Bey, who was recently told it would be at least another 14 months before he heard anything about his case.

“I hate to use a hackneyed expression, but they are rearranging the deck chairs and the ship is still sinking,” said John Wells, a retired Navy commander and lawyer who runs Military-Veterans Advocacy, a nonprofit.

The main cause of delays, according to the department, was a design flaw that fed appeals with simple errors into a legal system that was meant to rule on complex cases. That led to thousands of cases with issues as small as a typo clogging up the flow of cases to be processed.

“We tried to do everything in one stream and it couldn’t work efficiently,” said David McLenachen, who leads the department’s benefits appeals office.

The new law triages appeals into three streams: A fast stream — like the express lane at a supermarket — to correct simple errors; a medium stream, in which a more experienced department specialist reviews more complex issues at a local level; and a final stream where veterans can take cases to an independent board of appeals. The agency plans to hire hundreds of additional claims processors with the goal of clearing each case within four months.

But lawyers who represent veterans say the changes do not address the core problem: The department’s vast number of errors, which have generated hundreds of thousands of appeals. A 2017 report by the Government Accountability Office found nearly half of cases were plagued by mistakes and reached the Board of Veterans Appeals — the final authority for veterans benefits cases — only to be sent back for fixes.

Cases that have been sent back can sit for years before they are addressed, then sit again as they wait for the board to read the revisions.

Making a fair ruling on injuries of war is far from easy, and veterans advocates say some cases will inevitably take time to sort out. But as Mr. Bey’s case shows, even simple issues can languish, and recent changes by Congress have so far offered veterans like him no relief.

Mr. Bey was working with a crew scraping barnacles off buoys in Chesapeake Bay in 1977 when his ship suddenly listed to port, causing a shelf holding heavy equipment to tip. Mr. Bey braced himself against the equipment to protect crew members working below, and held it until others could help him. The next morning he turned to grab his duffel bag and collapsed in agony. “It was like a dentist’s drill, but in my back,” he recalled.

He spent four days in an Air Force hospital, military records show. They also reflect that during the five remaining years of his service, he was struck periodically by debilitating spasms.

But in 1983, when Mr. Bey submitted a claim to get free medical care and a small pension for his back from the Department of Veterans Affairs, the department sent back a letter saying it could find no evidence in his exit physical exam that showed the injury.

He appealed, asking that the department review his entire medical record. He was denied. He dug through the National Archives outside Washington, found records of his hospitalization, and submitted them. He was denied again. He got a civilian doctor to perform X-rays and write a letter documenting damage to his spine. He was denied again. He appealed to the Board of Veterans Appeals. His claim was denied.

Each denial was punctuated by months or years of delay as paperwork sat waiting. In the meantime, Mr. Bey worked as a researcher for an intellectual property law firm, got married and raised his children.

Because his claim had been denied, he was unable get medical care from a veterans hospital, and, he said, his back pain grew worse to the point that he was unable to work a full-time job.

“We see hundreds of cases like this,” said Bart Stichman, a lawyer and the joint executive director of National Veterans Legal Services Program, a nonprofit advocacy group. “One veteran with diabetes spent years trying to prove her case. She lost a foot. The V.A. finally granted the benefit, but by that time she’d lost her other foot.”

The veterans department said it was working to improve response time and reduce errors.

“The problem isn’t the process,” Mr. Bey said as he sifted through stacks of files showing agency errors in his case. “It’s that the quality of work is so bad. If people had done their job right, this would have been over in the Reagan administration.”

By 2016, Mr. Bey had exhausted all but his last appeal. He submitted the same evidence that had always led to a denial in the past, but, hoping to bolster his chances, sent it through the office of his senator, Bill Nelson of Florida.

A few months later, his benefit was granted — sort of. A department error in the date of the original claim erased decades of back pay. Mr. Bey is appealing.

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

Photo

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

It was not clear whether that was a good thing or a bad one.

One afternoon in Florida, a 59-year-old career truck driver named Jeff Runions sat alertly in the cab of an 18-wheeler watching the road while his 11-ton cargo of stone tile made its way up the Ronald Reagan Turnpike. He was watching his steering wheel, too, but his hands were at his side: A computer was in control.

Mr. Runions works for Starsky Robotics, a San Francisco start-up that for the past two years has been testing its self-driving technology by running freight up and down Florida. The runs help collect data and hone the technology, in hopes of convincing regulators and the company itself that self-driving trucks are ready for business.

There are still plenty of kinks. Sitting next to Mr. Runions was an Irish engineer named Rebecca Feeney Barry. As the vehicle spent hours driving past swamps and billboards for accident lawyers, Ms. Feeney Barry balanced a laptop on her knees and watched how the truck’s sensors interpreted the road and nearby cars.

At one point the computer’s “vision” briefly lost sight of the freeway because an overpass shaded the road. Later, the truck didn’t take a turn hard enough, prompting Mr. Runions to grab the wheel. Ms. Feeney Barry logged all of it. Later, after some computer code had been altered to tell the truck to tug the wheel a bit harder, it made a similar turn more smoothly.

“Sometimes it kind of messes me up when I go back to driving because now I’m used to the truck driving,” Mr. Runions said.

Starsky’s ultimate plan, of course, is to eliminate Mr. Runions’s job. But they do not want him to be out of one. Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, Starsky’s 27-year-old chief executive, foresees using self-driving technology to replace long-haul drivers on freeways, but having people like Mr. Runions navigate at either end of the trip with remote control consoles that look like an arcade racing game.

Drivers would go off to work in offices and might spend their day driving trucks through the last few miles of several different routes in several different cities before heading home for dinner.

“One driver can drive 10 to 30 trucks per day,” Mr. Seltz-Axmacher said.

The March of Automation

Starsky’s vision of a remote operation is unique. But the basic idea — having trucks drive themselves on highways and letting human drivers take over in complicated city environments — is something of an industry consensus.

“One of the big misconceptions about self-driving technology is that it is going to emerge and be able to drive all the time in all circumstances,” said Alden Woodrow, the product manager for Uber’s self-driving truck unit.

As part of their partnership, Embark, Ryder and Electrolux are conducting what amounts to elaborate dry runs to imagine what self-driving-truck routes will look like. The runs start with human drivers leaving an Electrolux warehouse in El Paso and driving to the edge of the city, where they hitch the trailer to one of Embark’s autonomous trucks.

From there the truck drives itself for 650 highway miles (with a safety driver in tow) to Ontario, Calif., where the Embark drivers transfer their trailer to another Ryder driver, who drives the final few miles to one of Electrolux’s California warehouses.

“It’s a mirror of what we would do if there weren’t a driver inside,” said Mr. Rodrigues, the Embark chief.

A few miles from Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., a company called Peloton Technology is betting that there is a business to be built in a less radical version of automation. Peloton is on the cusp of rolling out a system that will make it easier and safer for trucks to travel one after the other on the highway, in a formation called platooning, helping them save gas by reducing wind drag.

Trucks with drivers already do this. But Peloton’s technology aims to make platooning safer with a mix of cameras, sensors and networking equipment, allowing the trucks to talk to each other and helping to prevent the second driver from ramming into the first truck after a sudden stop.

Josh Switkes, the company’s chief executive, said that because Peloton’s technology helps drivers get better at doing something they are familiar with, he thinks it can be quickly commercialized.

“Our basic approach is let’s bring real value to the fleet and society now,” Mr. Switkes said.",Self-Driving Trucks May Be Closer Than They Appear,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/business/self-driving-trucks.html

“One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.","A serpentine river gently cuts through a mountain plateau. Shepherds tend their flock while young men hunt wild game, fish along ancient tributaries or kayak over rapids. This pleated landscape of rolling hills and jagged mountains is most verdant in spring, when the junipers are full, the grass a vibrant emerald.

These quiet moments and images are not often associated with Iraq. But the Kurdish region, in the country’s northern reaches, is home to such reprieves. Beyond the oil fields of Taqtaq and Kirkuk, far east of Mosul and many miles north of Baghdad, the semiautonomous region often feels timeless and progressive, restive and at peace.

What the Vietnamese photographer Lam Duc-Hien first imagined of Iraq before traveling there on assignment were the usual media tropes from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq — tanks and violence, surges and refugees. Mr. Lam, who was working for nongovernment organizations and a French newspaper, said he had never heard of the Kurdish people, who by then were fleeing Saddam’s oppressive and violent Baath Party. But after he settled down in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a region he documented for more than two decades, he found the country to be vastly different than what he had expected.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.

Photo

Over the years he has lived and worked there, he often traveled with the peshmerga, the Kurdish military, while on duty and off. “When I spend time with them, we always go to the mountains,” he said. “For me, it is like coming back to the 19th-century, because we are fishing with Kalashnikovs. For me, it’s incredible.”

Often referred to as a people without a country, the Kurds have for many years sought refuge in the mountains that abut Turkey and Iran. “I focused specifically on different ethnic groups and different religions in Kurdistan,” he said. “It’s small place, but it is very diverse.”

The robust culture of daily Kurdish life is captured in Mr. Lam’s photographs, a collection that stretches from the 1990s through to the war against the Islamic State. The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said. “I spend more time with them than taking pictures of them.”

A child leans in for a kiss from his little companion beneath a tree in the village of Badawan; a group of women in traditional Kurdish dresses dance atop a mountain plateau; families gather on the first day of Eid al-Adha to break the Ramadan feast at the grave of a loved one. “Each time I get back here,” Mr. Lam said, “I feel like I have a link with the people.”

Photo

Though Mr. Lam’s images sometimes show refugees and internally-displaced persons living in camps within the Kurdish region, he often shied away from the violence that has wracked the region and nearly divided the country, choosing instead to focus on the vitality of the people, not their blemishes.

Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq. He has heard whispers of secession since 1991. “One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.

But that dream has become a nightmare for many following an independence referendum in September. Disputed areas controlled by Kurdish forces were reclaimed by the Iraqi army. Flights were suspended to and from the region. A number of Kurds have since been killed or maimed in clashes with federal forces.

Photo

The recent infighting reminded Mr. Lam of a time when, during travels in the areas outside the Kurdish region, he lost that sense of fellowship — and safety — he had felt among the Kurdish people. After two bombs exploded in Baghdad’s Sadr City in 2013, with corpses littering the streets as he worked, Mr. Lam reluctantly fled the country.

“When you get involved with the Kurdish soul or friendship,” Mr. Lam said, “it’s very difficult to get out.”

He returned to Erbil soon after.

Passion. It’s not about talent. It’s about education, hard work and passion. In German the word for passion is “leidenschaft” and it sort of means suffering, or to enjoy suffering, or be willing to suffer for it. That’s what passion is. It’s not like a hobby. The German word says it much better: Be willing to suffer or enjoy suffering for it.

What is your best advice to newcomers?

Be patient. At first, cooking is about repetition. We do things over and over and over again, and it takes a person who enjoys that.

Be focused. New York is an amazing place, but it’s also incredibly distracting. There are so many cuisines alone. You could say, hey, I want to learn how to make pizza, or Japanese food is really cool. Or I want to learn how to make French food, or how to bake, or how to make pasta. All these things can be super distracting, and my advice is, just focus on what you want to be the best at.

Don’t jump around. Think about what you want and then pick the restaurant that fits that, and stay there for two, three or four years. When I look at chefs who stayed somewhere for a long time, I see them much more evolved.

How do you become a top chef?

Cooking is a craft. To learn a craft, it’s not about creating at first. There is a right way to do a consommé, a stock, searing meat, or making an omelet. Every great chef starts by being a great craftsman — making that perfect omelet or making that perfect roast chicken. And then at some point creativity becomes a part of it. You start from a place of rules, and then you start breaking them.

Yesterday we told you about the M.T.A.’s new subway announcements: The phrase “ladies and gentlemen” is out, and conductors will give more detailed descriptions of delays, as well as extra information like tourist sites and reminders for special events.

We asked readers what other changes they would like to hear regarding M.T.A. announcements, and more than 100 responded. Here’s what your neighbors said:

“Please upgrade the subway sound systems so that we could actually hear these improved announcements.”

— Robert Cowen, 77, Fresh Meadows, Queens

“I would like to hear absolutely nothing at all: Silence is golden.”

— Howard Steiner, 55, Upper East Side

And as for the replacement of “ladies and gentlemen” to be more inclusive, a few offered their thoughts:

“To me, ‘ladies and gentlemen,’ though not particularly offensive, seems silly. How about ‘short-haired people and long-haired people and bald people,’ or ‘introverts and extroverts,’ or whatever? It just seems completely irrelevant to divide the listening public into any categories at all. This is why I don’t call my elementary students ‘boys and girls.’ What possible reason is there to call attention to gender differences when telling people what station is next on the subway, or that it’s time to clean up at school?”

— Miriam Sicherman, 45, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn

“Hey, I don’t care if they use the word ‘chumps’ to describe us, just make the announcements understandable and correct.”

— Paul Beissel, 69, Greenpoint, Brooklyn

Dr. Kathryn Backholer, an expert on the issue at Deakin University in Australia, said taxes on soda were “low-hanging fruit” in the fight against obesity, diabetes and other weight-related diseases because such drinks are easily categorized to tax and sensible to target because they “have little or no nutritional value.”

Dr. Backholer and other experts said the turning point for soda tax proponents came in 2014, when Mexico — Coca-Cola’s biggest consumer market by per capita consumption — approved a 10 percent tax.

Mexico also showcased how dirty the fight could get.

Last year, numerous advocates of a proposal to double Mexico’s tax to 20 percent received strings of upsetting and fraudulent texts from unknown numbers. One man got a message saying his daughter had been seriously injured; another found a text saying his wife was having an affair; a third received a link to a funeral home. Spyware was found on the phones. The proposal failed.

Elsewhere in the world, soda companies have assiduously worked their government connections and economic clout. In internal company emails leaked to an American watchdog group last year, Coke executives described strategies for winning over government ministers and other officials in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, Portugal, and regions of Spain.

The Australian Beverages Council wrote in its 2016 annual report that fighting a soft drinks tax “has been consuming vast amounts of resources,” and that “our learnings from other markets through our international network tells us that these types of threats must be constantly challenged before they get before a parliament for debate.”

In Colombia, where soda is often cheaper than bottled water, the soda-tax fight took place in a key market for beverage makers. Sales volume of carbonated drinks here has climbed more than 25 percent over the past 15 years; during that same time in the United States, it fell 12 percent, according to Euromonitor, a market research firm.

Coke and Pepsi were far less visible in the Colombia battle, leaving the big national beverage company, Postobón, in the spotlight. Postobón, a drinks maker and distributor for Pepsi, is part of a huge conglomerate that includes sugar cane growers, sugar mills and the country’s biggest media company, RCN Televisión, which helped disseminate the anti-tax message. Postobón and RCN declined interview requests.

The stage was set for a clash between a powerful industry and a stubborn public advocate.

Showdown Over an Ad

In early 2016, Colombia, a nation of 49 million, was facing the unfamiliar prospect of stability and peace. After decades of civil war and narco-terrorism, Colombians were enjoying the fruits of an aggressive United States-backed military campaign that had largely decimated the country’s drug cartels. Unemployment was near historic lows, the poverty rate was dropping and millions were hopeful about the possibility of lasting peace with the country’s main rebel group, the FARC.

In March 2016, the country’s health minister, Alejandro Gaviria Uribe, proposed a 20 percent tax on soda and sugar-sweetened beverages — the equivalent of about 10 cents on a liter bottle — that became part of a larger tax overhaul backed by Colombia’s president and the Ministry of Finance.

“For the first time in our lives, we thought we might become a normal country and be able to deal with issues other than violence,” said Diana Guarnizo, a lawyer with Dejusticia, a rights group that helped promote the soda tax. “Here we were, an organization that had dealt with peace, violence, land reform and gross injustice, and suddenly we had the luxury to talk about what mothers are putting in their children’s lunchboxes.”

The measure was designed to inject $340 million a year into Colombia’s chronically underfunded national health care system, but Mr. Gaviria had a larger goal: to dampen soda consumption in a country with an obesity rate that had tripled since 1980 to 19 percent of adults.

Tina Brown’s moment wasn’t just predicated on the excesses of Wall Street.","Most unexpected may be Brown’s many entries about the hazards and psychological challenges of editing while female. Media reporters and male competitors routinely trivialize her accomplishments. Never once during her tenure does she work up the nerve to ask for a proper raise, even after Vanity Fair becomes profitable and Harper’s Bazaar starts to court her. (She eventually enlists the help of a superagent.) Even she suffers from a self-esteem gap.

When Brown was first offered the job to rescue the recently revived (and incompetently revived) Vanity Fair, in 1983, she was just 29 years old. The magazine was an outpost of confusion in those days, and Condé Nast was a castle of paranoia, its towers filled with schemers hoping to avoid defenestration.

It took a while for Brown to master the politics of this byzantine kingdom, and it took a while for her to arrive at the formula that would ultimately be responsible for the magazine’s success: A mix of celebrity chronicles, foreign reportage, true-crime stories, profiles of power brokers and extravagant photo spreads — all sitting side by side in the back of the same limo.

If these diaries have a theme, it’s status anxiety. There was no finer moment than the ’80s to explore status anxiety. The book teems with gossip from that bygone era, with the Kissingers, Reagans and a thousand high-haired socialites in starring roles. (Along with our current president. “It feels, when you have finished it, as if you’ve been nose to nose for four hours with an entertaining con man, and I suspect the American public will like nothing better,” Brown writes in 1987, having just decided to excerpt “The Art of the Deal.”)

There’s swing in Brown’s voice and vinegar in her pen. Walter Mondale is “a decent, intelligent, slightly boring fellow who would make an excellent prime minister of Norway.” Michael Huffington, the ex-husband of Arianna, is “a tall glass of water with a weak smile.” Almost everything she shares about the Kissingers is perfect. The best, perhaps: when a friend cattily asks, “Have you noticed their dining room is an exact replica of the State Department’s?”

For legacy-media freaks, “The Vanity Fair Diaries” is a bound volume of crack. Tina Brown’s moment wasn’t just predicated on the excesses of Wall Street. It was predicated on the excesses of the magazine business, of a time when editors still had time and money to burn. A crisis in Brown’s world was being seated at the wrong table at the Four Seasons, or being forced to coordinate coverage of Andy Warhol’s death by speakerphone because the person best suited to do it was off in Gstaad.

Yet after reading these diaries, I still wonder how much of an audience exists for them. Pages upon pages are filled with stories about dinners with doyennes who, even in their day, were only a big deal in one or two ZIP codes. Many of its barons are long forgotten, dead or disgraced. The dish about Condé Nast’s kings and queens regnant will be tasty to those who know them, but will anyone beyond their own (dwindling) clan even care?

Tolstoy can ask you to remember hundreds of characters. I don’t think Tina Brown can.

Brown also never satisfactorily reconciles why she wanted to insert herself into the endless cocktail surf of the ’80s. She professes to be an introvert, and she repeatedly laments New York’s materialism, posturing and social churn. Yet she often writes these plaintive entries from her beach house in the Hamptons. “Why do I keep seeking out the very things I deride?” she asks.

Her reply — “perhaps because I was born to chronicle them” — suggests that large parts of her desires remain unexamined. She lived and celebrated these values as much as she chronicled them. “Vanity Fair’s fifth anniversary party!” she writes on March 1, 1988. “Maybe the best party in Manhattan since Truman Capote’s Black and White Ball.”

To me, Brown’s truest and most heartfelt confessions are about her maternal guilt and ambivalence. She’s beset by fears that her jet-engine work drive will never be compatible with a sane family life. “The weekend was hard, with G” — her toddler son, George — “being very difficult and Harry chained to his computer as bloody always,” she writes in 1989. “Two workaholics don’t make a rightaholic, particularly when it comes to raising kids.”

Knowing that her son has Asperger’s syndrome — Brown has written about it in recent years — makes certain entries especially painful. Gradually, we see her realize that her son is perseverating, mixing uneasily with other kids, missing crucial developmental milestones. Before he’s properly diagnosed, a neurologist chalks up his differences and delays to his premature birth. “Was it my fault for working too hard and long?” Brown asks herself. Your heart dissolves. It’s so hard to imagine a high-powered father asking himself this same question.

Brown may have been a complicated feminist figure. But she was also a trailblazer, willing to take risks and get battered and bruised in the arena. In 1992, she took over The New Yorker and had the temerity to transform it. She even dared to add photographs. I hope she also kept a diary during those years.

“The question is not if we will continue to use coal, but how,” said Holly Krutka, vice president of coal generation and emissions technologies at Peabody Energy.

While many energy experts agree that technologies like carbon capture for coal plants and nuclear power can play a critical role in reducing emissions, the fact that Trump administration officials have played down concern over global warming has triggered deep suspicion about American intentions.

“It’s a total distraction,” said Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank based in Washington.

Still, Mr. Steer acknowledged, countries throughout Asia and Africa are continuing to build coal plants in their quest to provide energy access for millions living without electricity. “This is not wickedness on the part of these countries that want to get cheaper energy,” he said.

Trump administration officials made a similar point. “We need to lift one billion plus people out of energy poverty,” Mr. Banks said. He argued that while renewable energy has a “bright future,” only fossil fuels at the moment can deliver enough energy to allow people to rise out of poverty.

Yet even as the Trump administration pushes for a revival of the coal industry, other countries say they are phasing it out. France has vowed to eliminate coal from its electricity mix by 2022, and Italy by 2025. The United Kingdom and Canada said this week that they, too, would take steps to phase out coal.

“We’re passed the time that we want to be using coal,” said Catherine McKenna, Canada’s environment minister. “People do not want polluting coal. They do not want it.”

Some developing countries described a more balanced view, however, conceding a need for fossil fuels in the short term while ultimately calling for stronger global action on climate change and a shift toward cleaner forms of energy, including renewables like wind and solar energy.

Officials from Bangladesh, which still gets most of its electricity from natural gas and has plans to build 25 new coal-fired plants by 2022, said they would welcome the use of technology to improve the efficiency of their coal plants as a steppingstone toward renewable energy.

“Keep in mind that this is a developing country that has a huge need” for electricity, said Muhammad Azizul Haque, a deputy secretary in Bangladesh’s Environment Ministry. “So there has to be balance, it’s not just saying, O.K., we’ll go for renewables. It’s very complicated, because people need energy.”

Pakistan, for its part, has begun importing more liquefied natural gas in order to reduce its reliance on burning coal and oil for electricity, said Tariq Banuri, executive director of Pakistan’s Global Change Impact Study Center. Those imports have helped offset 1 percent of the country’s emissions.

Mr. Banuri said that Pakistan’s emissions were likely to grow in the coming decades as it lifts itself out of poverty, though the country is also making a big push on renewable energy and could do more if wealthier nations provided more aid to help drive down the cost of wind and solar even further.

Biden Critiques Trump and Demurs on 2020

Former Vice President Joe Biden appeared on “The Late Show” on Monday for the first time since President Trump took office. Speaking to Stephen Colbert, Mr. Biden said he hoped Mr. Trump’s presidency would be remembered as an outlier.

STEPHEN COLBERT: One of the things that many people said when President Trump was elected: that we have to hold on to certain standards, and we can’t normalize the behavior that got President Trump elected. But on another level, whoever is the president is, you know, de facto presidential. What do you think has changed about the presidency with him being president? Or how will this influence future presidencies? JOE BIDEN: I think, God willing, it will go down as the single exception in American history. [Applause] Look, I think that a lot of the folks in the audience, my guess is, when the president was elected and the political people he gathered around him came into play, you kind of thought, ‘Well, maybe it’s amusing, or a little bit embarrassing sometimes.’ But it didn’t go to the heart of who we were. But I’ll lay you eight-to-five, and I’m speaking to a large crowd — a Republican audience — out in Thousand Oaks, California, and I asked the same question. I said, ‘How many of you are now worried about the stability of the republic? How many of you are now worried about this new phony nationalism that’s us against them? How many are worried about this populism that is designed to essentially undermine the essence of the Bill of Rights, which is, there are certain inalienable rights that nobody, no matter what the majority is, they cannot overrule? I mean, I just think there’s an attack on a system. And I think people are worried.”

Mr. Biden was on the show to promote a new memoir, “Promise Me, Dad,” which tells of how he dealt with the death of his son Beau. Mr. Biden is already the subject of rumors about a possible presidential run in 2020, and he did not dispel those rumors while explaining the “promise” that gave the book its name.

“That was the promise: ‘Promise me, Dad, you’re going to stay engaged. It wasn’t, ‘Promise me, Dad, you’re going to run for president,’” Mr. Biden said, adding: “He did want me to run for president, but that wasn’t the promise. Barack asked me — the president asked me at lunch one day when Beau was sick, he said, ‘What do you want to do with the rest of your life?’ And I said, ‘I want to do what I’ve done — the same answer I would have given you when I was 29, when I was 39, and my age right now. I want to make a difference, and I think I can.”

Mr. Sands said any similarity was “entirely coincidental.”

Scholars generally refer to a work by the artist as a “Leonardo,” but, as Mr. Sands explained, “da Vinci” has “much higher levels of recognition.”

The “Salvator Mundi” is being sold by the family trust of the Russian billionaire collector Dmitry E. Rybolovlev, who bought it in 2013 for $127.5 million and had never exhibited the work in public before now. The sense that this is rare opportunity to view a Leonardo was elevated in New York, where no museum collection contains a painting by the artist.

The National Gallery of Art in Washington possesses the only example in North America. The museum paid over $5 million in a private transaction in 1967 (roughly $36.4 million in today’s dollars) to secure “Ginevra de’ Benci,” a portrait from the 1470s. No other painting by the artist has appeared on the open market in the last 100 years.

“It’s the 16th Leonardo painting,” said Dianne Dwyer Modestini, based in New York, who restored the “Salvator Mundi.” The painting, showing Christ with his right hand raised in blessing and his left holding a crystal orb, was bought by an unrecognized dealer in 2005, in an overpainted and damaged condition.

While Christie’s claims “an unusually uniform scholarly consensus” that the painting is by Leonardo, some respected experts on Renaissance art who have seen the work have failed to succumb to Stendhal syndrome.

“Even making allowances for its extremely poor state of preservation, it is a curiously unimpressive composition and it is hard to believe that Leonardo himself was responsible for anything so dull,” wrote Charles Hope, an emeritus professor at the Warburg Institute at the University of London, in his 2012 review of a National Gallery exhibition that included the “Salvator Mundi.”

Ms. Modestini, the restorer, said in an interview that she hopes the work will ultimately be on public view in a museum. “It’s easy to be negative about a damaged picture, and you can argue that a section of drapery might have been painted by a studio assistant, but this should be allowed to live as a Leonardo rather than be someone’s trophy,” she said.

Instead, Iowa Pacific has begun leasing rail space, about 100 cars per track mile, to rail companies that want to store cars that are not needed.

Ed Ellis, the president of Iowa Pacific, said leasing space raises money needed for track maintenance and repairs.

In addition to the old mining rail line, Iowa Pacific also operates a connecting railroad, the Saratoga and North Creek Railway, which runs 60 miles from Saratoga Springs to North Creek, home of the Gore Mountain ski resort. It began operating the railway, which is used primarily for sightseeing rides, in 2011 under a lease agreement with Warren County and the town of Corinth, which own the tracks on the scenic railroad.

Iowa Pacific, however, is responsible for maintaining the tracks from Saratoga to Tahawus, which Mr. Ellis said costs more than $750,000 per year. Leasing storage space on the tracks, Mr. Ellis said, is a way to generate revenue to allow the company to run the scenic railway while it continues to seek customers for the rocks from the mines.

“We’re patient investors,” he said. “This is not about quarterly earnings. This is about the long-term future of railroads.”

But critics suspect that the storage deal will prove anything but temporary and oppose parking the rail cars for aesthetic reasons and also over concerns that the cars could damage the environment if they start deteriorating.

“In essence, Iowa Pacific is trying to build this linear junkyard through the Adirondack Park,” said Peter Bauer, the executive director of Protect the Adirondacks, an environmental group. “It appears that Iowa Pacific will continue to bring in more oil tanker cars until the state steps in and halts this activity.”

Mr. Ellis said that all the rail cars had been inspected and thoroughly cleaned by their owners.

The state Department of Environmental Conservation and the Adirondack Park Agency, another state entity that regulates land use in the park, also oppose the storage arrangement. “We are seriously concerned about potential environmental impacts and are evaluating all legal and regulatory options at our disposal,’’ the agencies said in a joint statement.","Empty Rail Cars Roll Into the Adirondacks, Stirring Controversy",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/nyregion/empty-rail-cars-roll-into-the-adirondacks-stirring-controversy.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

No matter where you lived in New York, sooner or later all roads led to 116th Street and Lexington Avenue, the commercial and cultural heart of East Harlem.

Joseph Rodriguez was no exception: Though born and raised in Brooklyn — with detours at Rikers and a life-changing encounter with photography — he, as a teenager, liked to hang out at his uncle’s candy store and numbers spot where the streets were abuzz with music and life. Those early encounters led to a May 1990 National Geographic cover story and the most important project of his life after he spent the latter half of the 1980’s photographing El Barrio’s streets and residents in their homes and on the block.

Now, a revised version of that body of work will be on display at the Bronx Documentary Center, as well as in the new book, “Spanish Harlem: El Barrio in the ’80s.”

While it is “easy to make gritty pictures of poverty,” Mr. Rodriguez was looking to go deeper and connect with people whose struggles he knew intimately as the son of a single mother.

“I carried this story for a long time before I could go out and make the work,” he said. “That was an important path for me to understand patience and waiting, connecting and trust.”

His images reflect an intimacy — and long-term commitment — that marks his later work in East Los Angeles, Romania and Puerto Rico. For him, this project was deeply personal, and still is.

“We’re not garbage people, we have a presence,” he said. “One thing that was extremely important was to show our children with some dignity. You see their strength. We’ve gone through hell and back, just like now in Puerto Rico. But we get up, and we fight back.”

Pakistan, for its part, has begun importing more liquefied natural gas in order to reduce its reliance on burning coal and oil for electricity, said Tariq Banuri, executive director of Pakistan’s Global Change Impact Study Center. Those imports have helped offset 1 percent of the country’s emissions.

Mr. Banuri said that Pakistan’s emissions were likely to grow in the coming decades as it lifts itself out of poverty, though the country is also making a big push on renewable energy and could do more if wealthier nations provided more aid to help drive down the cost of wind and solar even further.

But any nuanced discussions of energy policy were overshadowed by anger at the Trump administration for disengaging from the global community on climate change.

During a question-and-answer session, audience members pressed American officials to clarify the White House’s stance on climate change.

Recipe: Wild Rice and Mushroom Casserole","The traditional Thanksgiving meal is a giant spread that lacks for nothing. Unless you have a dietary restriction, in which case it might lack something you can actually eat.

There is likely to be flour lurking in the gravy, bacon in the brussels sprouts, chicken stock in the dressing and butter in nearly everything else. While you would think most people would be safe with cranberry sauce, there’s always the possibility that the host somehow got the idea to use honey instead of sugar, or dash in some soy sauce to give it that umami tang.

What every modern Thanksgiving table needs is one great dish that anyone can eat. It should be satisfying and hearty enough to be a meal on its own, but appealing enough to share as a side dish.

This golden-topped casserole of wild rice, white beans and seared mushrooms fits the bill.

The white beans, some of which are puréed, give it creaminess, while the wild rice adds a robust, chewy texture. The combination of mushrooms, leeks and fennel makes it autumnal. And plenty of sautéed spinach not only helps lighten the starchiness of the beans and rice, but also adds some necessary color.

Like many casseroles, this one is adaptable so you can tailor it to your tastes and your crowd. You can use gluten-free panko for celiac friends, or leave off the Parmesan in the topping for vegans and the lactose-intolerant. If you can’t get, or don’t want to spring for, the pricey wild rice, brown rice makes an equally nubby substitute. Cilantro haters can substitute basil.

One thing to keep in mind is that canned beans vary a lot in terms of salt content. If possible, find a brand that lists sea salt as an ingredient. These tend to have a better flavor than unsalted beans. But in either case, taste as you go, adjusting the salt as you see fit.

Conveniently for Thanksgiving (or any other dinner party), you can assemble the components for this dish the day before you want to serve it. Store the filling and topping separately in the fridge. Just before baking, spread the crumbs over the casserole and bake until steaming hot inside and golden on top.

Then serve it to your loved ones, because this is a dish they all can love.

It is a prep school meant to do more than merely prepare students for college, but also equip them with survival skills for an unknown new world, in which proficiency with alternative fuels and sustainable building practices — and the experience of living in a nontraditional, unpredictable environment — might be more useful benchmarks than SAT scores.

FOR ALL ITS idealistic trappings, Green School was founded, initially, on a pragmatic concern. “I wanted to stay in Bali,” John Hardy told me, “and I didn’t have anywhere to send the kids.” John, who grew up in Canada, moved to Ubud in 1975. He met Cynthia in Bali in the ’80s, and their two daughters attended Green School. (Hardy’s other two children, from a previous marriage, were too old to attend by the time the school was founded, though his eldest, Elora, has a Bali-based company that specializes in building with bamboo and helped design several structures at the school.) The local Balinese schools were all about learning “by rote,” he said; at the other end, the traditional expat-driven international schools were a “monoculture” of privilege. The Hardys enlisted local friends and acquaintances, along with some international recruits, and in 2008, Green School was born.

It is not hard to see in John and Cynthia Hardy something of the spirit of Rudolf Steiner — the polymathic, charismatic Austrian whose principles informed the school he created in 1919 for the children of the workers in a German cigarette factory called Waldorf-Astoria. (The name lives on in more than 1,000 Waldorf schools worldwide.) While the Hardys abandoned an early idea to actually start a Steiner school — too much dogma, John told me — the influence remains. Not simply in the Green School’s emphasis on “holistic” (i.e., not strictly academic) development and “experiential” learning, but in highlighting the aesthetics of the classroom. (Steiner once called the schoolroom a “veritably barbaric environment.”)

Photo

Kate Druhan, a pragmatic, droll Australian and former human resources manager who serves as the school’s board of management chair, told me the school has cherry-picked its curriculum — a dose of Australia here, some International Baccalaureate there, with a dash of Singapore Math for good measure — and stressed what she called “integrated thematics” across subjects; when learning about ancient Egypt, for example, students will explore its history, but they might also use the pyramids to study geometry. But what most distinguishes Green School from other expat-driven international schools found the world over is its strong connection to the local community, and its emphasis on doing. “At most schools,” Medema said, “you learn about making a bridge in a book. At progressive schools, you maybe make it out of matchsticks or carve it out of soap. At Green School, you actually just go and make it.”

That the school’s model is still in flux may be in the very nature of progressive education, which, going back to Steiner and other pioneers, has defined itself against not only reigning pedagogy, but, to a certain extent, against current society. (For example, Steiner wanted his schools to be free from rigid class boundaries.) But it is not always clear what that means; as Druhan told me, she prefers the word “progressive” to “alternative,” because “you can go in all kinds of directions.” With technology, for example, Medema said, “a lot of parents will come here thinking, I don’t want my kid near any wires — I thought Green School was zero tech.” Another group, she continued, wants facilities that are top-notch, “but in the jungle.”

Ambitiously idealistic experiments often collapse under the weight of their own internal contradictions, and it is certainly possible to find these at Green School: Here are mostly Western, affluent families, many of them temporarily abandoning their comfortable lives for a metaphysical gap year of voluntary simplicity (or life rebalancing or spiritual reawakening) in an exotic stage-setting, at a school whose annual tuition (roughly $15,000 a year for a sixth-grader), while a bargain compared to New York City private-school standards, is far beyond the reach of the average Balinese. (Hardy’s original vision of having at least 20 percent of the school comprised of Balinese scholarship students was, Druhan noted, easier to scale when the school had 90 students. Today, about 9 percent of the student body are on scholarships.) Still, as much as any parent who’s unsure whether his child is getting the best education (in other words, all parents), I surveyed with envy the kids merrily clambering down jungle paths, the river gurgling in the background and the colorful shrines bedecking the hillsides, thinking grimly of my daughter encased in her sealed-window institutional public school building, shunted to the school gym to watch movies on days with a little bit of bad weather.

Faced with a problem involving the school’s hydropower system, the students were working with master’s students at the University of Cologne in Germany to design and build a new system that will combine solar and hydro power. On sunny days, surplus solar power will pump river water up to a holding tank. On cloudy days, that water will be released downhill, powering a turbine. Green School’s students scuba dive with CoralWatch and spend summers as oil-rig hounding “kayaktivists” and attend U.N. climate conferences; they start fashion companies like Nalu (which dedicates a portion of sales to help children buy school uniforms in India and Indonesia) and lobby the Balinese government to reduce the scourge of plastic bags on the island. “They really do want kids to go off and change the world, as clichéd as that sounds,” Blair told me.

BUT EVEN AMID this backdrop of plucky inventiveness and rational reuse, this armature of sustainable skills, was there not only an impulse toward betterment but a small whiff of dystopia — a prep school prepping for a world that is increasingly out of whack? Is the old paradigm really over?

According to Green School parents I spoke to, it is. A variety of “digital nomads,” early retirees, midcareer rebooters and Steiner evangelists, they spoke of being on a shared mission. Regan Williams, who first enrolled as a boarding student (a rarity here; as Medema told me, “You can go to jail for life in Bali for doing teenage stuff”), inspired the rest of her family to come over from Santa Barbara, Calif. Her father, Rob Williams, wrote me over email, “the families are bonded by the fact you have to be a little nuts to move to the middle of the jungle in Bali. … Everyone is sweaty and has bug bites. … Our kids are challenged, engaged and happy.” Alan Fleischmann, a doctor retired from the Mayo Clinic, told me over beers one night that he and his wife Kara chose Green School for their 6-year-old daughter after an exhaustive global search: “We’re trying to work out how you educate for a life in 20 years’ time — what are the skills she might need, and where do you get them?” This being Bali, other factors entered the decision-making process as well. He and his “witchy” wife, as he lovingly termed her, tuned in to Bali, and received a portent of sorts. “You can argue it’s coincidence, but we had a dramatic indication that Mother Bali wanted us here.” As for his daughter’s education, Fleischmann considers skills like memorization largely useless. “I’ve never studied tropical medicine,” he said, though he is often pressed to consult in Bali. “Fifteen minutes on my phone and I know as much as anyone.” At Green School, he said, he saw examples of “project-based management” — “how do you get through something using critical thinking. All that emphasis is not found in a lot of other places.”

Photo

Many families, Medema told me, come on the vacation and end up staying for the education. Michael Diamond, a.k.a. Mike D. of the Beastie Boys, who enrolled his two sons (Davis, 15, and Skyler, 13) this year (he and his ex-wife take turns living in Bali), first visited the school at the insistence of Skyler, whose friend had recently enrolled. Diamond was struck by how different it felt from the “traditional boarding school model — you go here because your grandfather went here and then you’re going to go to Yale and then work at this law firm and charge people $500 an hour to argue about nothing.” The sense I had from many Green School parents, echoing the school’s idea of nurturing and developing the whole student, was not only the hope that the school would help make their children better citizens, but would leave them better placed to navigate a world in which values and norms were changing. That the old prep school model might be lacking is not necessarily a progressive thought; the head of Manhattan’s elite Trinity School recently warned in a letter to parents that his institution was in danger of becoming a “credentialing factory,” helping to produce a “cognitive elite that is self-serving, callous and spiritually barren.”

When I asked Druhan if she could sum up Green School in one moment, she paused. One of her strongest memories was when her young son was doing the “rice thematic”— rice being of central economic and cultural import in Bali. His class had gone out in the fields to learn how to grow rice. He raved about the farmer. “He said, ‘Mum, he’s like a scientist! He has so much knowledge, and he doesn’t have even any instruments.”’ The students went on not only to harvest the rice, but cook an elaborate dinner in an underground fire pit, which they served to the farmers, parents and teachers. “That was everything that’s good about Green School in one moment: The hands-on learning, the respect for school values, the connection to the community.” As a tear brimmed, she changed tack. “Then there are other moments,” she said, with a wry smile. “I sat down with my coffee the other day and there were six parents talking about what the best coffee enema was — exactly how it works and the condition of how it came out. I thought, ‘Well, that’s only at Green School.’ ”",The School Prepping for Apocalypse,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/t-magazine/bali-green-school.html

But the growing signs that policies are being written to impose costs on states behind enemy lines are worrisome. A new spoils system based on state partisanship wouldn’t just poison our politics. It could also cripple our economic future.

How do the tax bills favor red over blue states? Most notably, they curtail or eliminate the deductibility of state and local taxes. This is the largest single pay-for in the plans — roughly $1.3 trillion over 10 years in the Senate legislation, which kills the deduction. And a majority of those bearing the cost are tax filers in blue states. Indeed, all of the states that have above-average use of the state and local taxes deduction voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.

The other major tax break in the cross hairs of House Republicans is the home mortgage interest deduction. As with local taxes, all the states that have an above-average number of homes that would be affected by the deduction cap in the House bill voted for Mrs. Clinton. (The Senate version doesn’t include this provision.)

Some of the pay-fors aimed at blue states look even more gratuitous. The House bill would phase out certain deductions for personal casualty losses — but “grandfathers” victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, though not the horrific California fires.

In sum, Republicans have put the majority of their tax cuts on the nation’s credit card, but they’ve handed most of the rest of the bill to blue states.

To see just how unusual that approach is, think back to 2009, when President Barack Obama briefly had a filibuster-proof Democratic majority in the Senate. Did he use it to shift spending away from red states? Hardly. His signature accomplishment, the Affordable Care Act, was most generous to poorer states, where more people lacked insurance — that is, red states.

This effect was of course blunted by the Supreme Court’s ruling that states could refuse the law’s Medicaid expansion and blunted further by the unwillingness of many red states to accept the expansion’s extremely generous terms. Even so, struggling parts of red America have come to depend heavily on Medicaid and other safety-net programs expanded by Democrats in 2009 and 2010.

Nor is the A.C.A.’s favoring of red states an exception. Compared with blue-state residents, people in red states get back much more in federal spending relative to the federal taxes they pay, mainly because red states are poorer on average. In other words, the Republican elimination of the state and local tax deduction is not fixing an “unfair” situation. It makes the existing blue state disadvantage even larger.

The A.C.A.’s universalistic approach has been the norm for a simple reason: National parties represent coalitions of local representatives that cut across state lines. Despite distinctive regional bases, the two major parties have generally featured a significant degree of geographic diversity, so partisan majorities had no political reason to systematically extract resources from some regions to the benefit of others.

As with other lines of division in American politics, however, the geographic lines have been hardening. Today, blue-state Republicans and red-state Democrats are much less common. As the political scientist David Hopkins has pointed out, the 15 coastal and Northeastern states that now form the Democrats’ geographic stronghold send only two Republicans to the Senate. The trends in the House are similar, with the Republican majority containing fewer and fewer seats in solidly blue states.

But Democrats haven’t sought big transfers toward “their” states. Why are Republicans distinctive? Because of a second crucial feature of our federal system: Parties get rewarded not just for winning over specific people but also for winning in specific places. Because Republicans are stronger in the most sparsely populated areas, they possess a growing structural advantage. This, in turn, increases their incentive and capacity to favor red over blue states.

The Republicans’ advantage stems from two main sources. First, the overrepresentation of less-populous states in the Senate has become more consequential as the population gap between crowded and rural states grows and as rural states become more solidly Republican. Second, the increasing concentration of Democratic voters in urban areas — and Republican gerrymandering to exploit this — means more and more Democratic votes are “wasted” on easy wins. As a consequence, Republicans in both the House and the Senate can lose the national popular vote and still control a majority of seats. Democrats, by contrast, still need to win some red regions of the country.

Of course, the remaining Republican legislators in blue states face cross-pressures. But many come from deep-red areas and feel more vulnerable to primary challenges than to a general election opponent. They also fear the wrath of Republicans’ increasingly assertive big-money donors, who often reside outside a politician’s district. As Chris Collins, another New York Republican who is conflicted about the tax bills, admitted, “My donors are basically saying, ‘Get it done or don’t ever call me again.’ ”

Republican leaders are betting that enough blue-state Republicans will put loyalty to party ahead of the prosperity of their state — or at least recognize that the first part of the Republican two-step (big tax cuts for rich people in blue as well as red states) may redound to their benefit even if the second (pay-fors aimed at blue states) doesn’t.

But if their bet pays off, it isn’t just blue states that will suffer. Red America may hold the key to Republicans’ control of government, but blue America holds many of the keys to our nation’s economic future. Indeed, among the blue-state pay-fors, the most troubling may be those that will bleed institutions of higher education, particularly in the House bill. In their zeal to extract revenues from blue states, Republicans are threatening our nation’s ability to excel in a global knowledge economy.

The moral of Civil War pensions is cautionary. Pensions for Union veterans devolved into a spectacularly corrupt system that undermined political support for much-needed universal social policies. High tariffs outlived their utility and helped incite a global trade war in the 1930s. It took the Great Depression to unleash new social programs and major federal investment in the South.

The rare cache of supercentenarian genomes, the largest yet to be sequenced and made public, comes as studies of garden-variety longevity have yielded few solid clues to healthy aging. Lifestyle and luck, it seems, still factor heavily into why people live into their 90s and 100s.

To the extent that they have a genetic advantage, it appears to come partly from having inherited fewer than usual DNA variations known to raise the risk of heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease and other afflictions.

That is not enough, some researchers say, to explain what they call “truly rare survival,” or why supercentenarians are more uniformly healthy than centenarians in their final months and years.

Rather than having won dozens of hereditary coin tosses with DNA variations that are less bad, scientists suggest, supercentenarians may possess genetic code that actively protects them from aging.

But the effort to find that code has been “challenged,” as a group of leading longevity researchers put it in a recent academic paper, in part by the difficulties in acquiring supercentenarian DNA.

The New England Centenarian Study, one of a handful of longevity research groups around the world focusing on supercentenarians, now turns down prospective DNA donors under age 103: “We tell them they’re too young,” said Dr. Thomas Perls, the study’s director.

The DNA sequences being released this week were acquired almost single-handedly by James Clement, 61, the founder of a company advised by the prominent Harvard geneticist George Church.

A professed citizen-scientist, Mr. Clement collected blood, skin or saliva from supercentenarians in 14 states and seven countries over a six-year period. Many were still gardening, arguing, driving and flirting. Ms. Michelson, for one, was fond of reading and reciting Shakespeare.

The usefulness of such a small group for a genetic study is unclear, which is one reason Mr. Clement’s company, now defunct, has turned into a crowdsourcing project.

Complex traits like height, body mass index and disease risk — phenotypes, as they are known in genetics-speak — typically arise from a combination of hundreds of places in the genome where the DNA alphabet differs between individuals.

Zeroing in on which variations affect which phenotypes requires the statistical power of tens of thousands of DNA samples — almost certainly a dealbreaker when it comes to supercentenarians, whose verified number, worldwide, hovers at around 150.

On large swaths of the planet, where birth records are sketchy or nonexistent, identifying verified supercentenarians is virtually impossible. In the United States, researchers say supercentenarians account for about one in five million people.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Amateur genealogists dedicated to validating the ages of the world’s oldest people estimate that even the unverified total comes to only about 1,000.

Still, some researchers hope that despite the limited number of available genomes, it will be possible to identify the secret sauce of supercentenarians with methods used to uncover the genetic basis for other rare conditions. No one quite knows how many genomes might be necessary.

“This is what we call an ‘extreme phenotype,’ ” said Dr. Church, who ultimately arranged for the genomes to be sequenced so that Mr. Clement could release them through a nonprofit. “The farther out you go on the bell curve, the more likely you are to find something, even with a small sample size.”

As the goal of slowing aging to extend human “health span” has gained traction in the scientific mainstream, research has largely been limited to animal studies.

A secretive Google spinoff called Calico, for California Life Company, is said to be scrutinizing the genome of the naked mole rat, celebrated for a life span 10 times longer than that of most of its rat cousins. Federally funded scientists are testing a drug on monkeys based on an experiment that doubled the lives of roundworms.

And in laboratories across the world, the markers of age in over-the-hill mice, rats and turquoise killifish are, sometimes, being reversed.

But what works in shorter-lived organisms often does not translate to humans, whose average life span in developed countries is approaching 80 years. So despite the limitations of Mr. Clement’s database, several prominent researchers have already expressed interest in it.

“This could show the utility of starting a bigger collection,” said Paola Sebastiani, a longevity researcher at Boston University.

An account of what Mr. Clement calls the Supercentenarian Research Project offers a glimpse at what that might entail, including perseverance, compassion and a sense of humor that trends toward dark.

Life or Death

It was an inauspicious start, Mr. Clement admitted in an email to a friend in January 2011. The first supercentenarian Mr. Clement had lined up to visit, Mississippi Winn, had died at 113 before he could get from his home in San Jose, Calif., to hers in Shreveport, La.

Photo

“RIP Miss Winn,” he posted on the Facebook page that family members had set up for Ms. Winn, believed to be the last living child of African-Americans born into slavery.

Such condolences would become a familiar refrain. Of the 70,000 or so Americans who live to be 100, only some two dozen are typically alive at 110.

Once that milestone is reached, as Mr. Clement quickly learned, the chance of dying within the next year is roughly 50 percent. After 113, the odds are closer to 66 percent. The oldest person on record, Jeanne Calment, was 122 when she died in 1997; only one other person is known to have lived beyond age 118.

“Even while you’re packing the car, the person may fall ill and say they’re not up to it,” Mr. Clement said, after the first of several plans for me to observe a DNA donation was abruptly canceled.

Mr. Clement could extract DNA from post-mortem samples, with permission from the family and assuming he could reach the funeral home in time. Exhumation is also possible, in theory, to obtain samples.

But for understandable reasons, he said, family members most often ended communications with him at the time of a supercentenarian’s death. To improve the odds of getting samples — and the gender balance, since supercentenarians are nearly all women — he lowered his target age from 110 to 106.

“It’s better to get there when they’re alive,” he said.

Guided by the World’s Oldest People email list, whose moderator, Robert D. Young, verifies ages on behalf of Guinness World Records and tracks supercentenarians for the Gerontology Research Group, Mr. Clement placed decal dots designating the locations of prospective participants on a map pinned to the wall of his home office.

He created Google alerts for the phrases “109th birthday,” “110th birthday,” and “111th birthday,” and for the obituaries of known supercentenarians.

Unlike so-called blue zones, where centenarians are said to cluster, there is no geographical shortcut for netting supercentenarians. So he called, emailed and sent Facebook friend requests to whatever contacts he could find, wherever he could find them.

A Birthday Invitation

There was, nominally, the prospect of making money.

But with a business plan that, even to some of his investors, sounded more like a research project, Mr. Clement seems to have undertaken the task largely because it provided the chance to act on a longstanding interest in human longevity, including his own.

A self-described transhumanist who eats mostly low-glycemic vegetables and nuts and walks seven miles a day, Mr. Clement has accumulated an eclectic résumé that includes starting a brew pub, practicing international tax law and cofounding a futurist magazine.

He harbors what he prefers to call a “healthy love of life,” rather than an aversion to death, and he is possessed of an apparently genuine conviction that longer lives would make humans more humane.

“My hat was off to someone who was willing to take the time out of his life to go get these precious specimens,” said Dr. Church, the Harvard geneticist, who has devoted a portion of his laboratory to research into the reversal of aging.

The kind of ultrarare mutations that supercentenarians might harbor, Dr. Church believed, were not likely to be detected with standard techniques, which scan only the places in the genome where DNA is already known to vary between individuals.

To look for as-yet-uncataloged variations would require sequencing all of the supercentenarians’ six billion genetic letters, a far more expensive procedure. When he and Mr. Clement first discussed the idea in 2010, the cost was about $50,000 per genome.

But the price was falling. And with the financial support of a handful of like-minded wealthy individuals who agreed to invest in the exploratory phase of the project, “it just seemed,” Mr. Clement said, “like something I could do.”

Even with the Harvard name as a calling card, several of the families he contacted over the next few years did not respond to his inquiries. A few, Mr. Clement knew, had already been approached by laboratories at Stanford and Boston University, which were collecting their own stashes of supercentenarian DNA.

“She already did her DNA donation,” Paul Cooper, the grandson of Besse Cooper, a 116-year-old former suffragist, told Mr. Clement, who had driven several hundred miles to her Monroe, Ga., nursing home in 2012.

Walter Breuning, of Great Falls, Mont., one of just a handful of men known to have lived to 114, replied in late 2010 that it was his preference not to risk winter meetings. He died early the next spring.

An invitation to the 111th birthday party of James Sisnett in Barbados finally served as Mr. Clement’s entree in February 2011. He died two years later.

Mr. Sisnett, who grew his own food until he was 105, was “still fascinated by seeing a nice-looking backside” when he was in his 110s, his daughter, Everine Carter, 88, recalled in a telephone interview.

Losing Precious Samples

The best time to get DNA from a supercentenarian, Mr. Clement found, is midmorning. By lunchtime, they would prefer to be eating. After lunch, they might be groggy or napping.

Most, like Dorothy Peel of London, then 108, had sharp minds. Ms. Peel inspected the informed consent form through her reading glasses and peppered him with questions about other supercentenarians he had met.

Crisscrossing Europe in 2011, Mr. Clement hit his collecting stride. But there were some bumps.

He had ordered an inexpensive kit that allowed him to prick a supercentenarian’s finger and deposit a drop of blood on a card to preserve it, often used by geneticists in the field.

Within a few months he had blood drops from 15 donors, including Ralph Tarrant of Sheffield, England, who at 108 completed the London Times crossword puzzle every afternoon.

Not until he had switched to hiring a phlebotomist to perform blood draws with a needle did he learn that the cards with the original 15 samples were defective. “We could not detect any DNA,” read a 2011 email from the laboratory.

Mr. Clement confessed the news to Dr. Church in a meeting at his Harvard office. “You didn’t test the cards?” the geneticist asked him gently.

Still, Mr. Clement had 23 good samples in hand, and the cost of sequencing by this time had fallen to some $15,000 per genome. With his remaining funds, he sequenced 15, leaving the rest in cold storage.

Mr. Clement quickly discovered 2,500 differences between the supercentenarian DNA and those of controls. But even with help from graduate students in Dr. Church’s lab, it was hard with such a small group to know which, if any, were significant.

So over the next few years, Mr. Clement, working without a salary, collected samples whenever he could, adding another dozen from supercentenarians across the United States.

In the spring of last year, a company Dr. Church had co-founded, Veritas Genetics, announced that it would sequence human genomes for $1,000 each. Dr. Church told Mr. Clement that Veritas would sequence the remaining samples, and so he set out to collect a few more.

Advice From America’s Oldest Man

In July 2016, I was invited to accompany Mr. Clement to Mr. Matthews’s home in California. As much as I looked forward to meeting my first supercentenarian, I was not prepared to envy his win in the genetic longevity lottery.

I had feared he would be lonely, a concern echoed by several of the Facebook viewers who watched me ply him with questions over a live video stream the morning we met. “I don’t want to outlive my friends and family,” one typed. “That’s no fun.”

The prospect of shifting today’s average life span to that of the known limit of all humanity is disorienting. An average life expectancy of 80 in some ways seems generous — it was just 48 when Mr. Matthews was born in 1906. Most of us expect around 80 years on the planet, assuming nothing horrendous happens.

“When you have children the first time, it don’t come with a manual, and it don’t come with a manual when your dad gets to be 100, then 105, then 110,” said Mr. Matthews’s son, Steve, 75, who also gave blood the day we visited.

But Mr. Matthews asserted without hesitation that he still enjoyed life. Pleasures included his lunchtime smoothie, his family, the kindness of his caregiver, and — this with a nod to a New York Times photographer and a rakish grin — “having my picture taken.”

He reminisced fondly about his second wife, Katherine, who died in 1980 and with whom he had loved to dance.

At 110, he said he had never been diagnosed with a serious illness. The younger Mr. Matthews recalled that his father had played a one-under-par, 18-hole golf game on his 99th birthday. Having built a successful real estate business, he provided financial support to his last surviving sibling, a sister who was 105.

Talking to him, it was hard not to fantasize about the possibility that, as another Facebook participant suggested, “by the time we get to that age, we may all be living to 110.”

At the time the oldest man in America, Mr. Matthews sometimes strained to hear, but his sense of humor and perspective were intact. If that was what we wanted, he advised, “Keep breathing.”

Mr. Matthews died this summer. His DNA was sequenced a few weeks later, and last month Mr. Clement uploaded it to the database. Like all normal human genome sequences, the beginning of his first chromosome reads like this:

SAN FRANCISCO — Missouri’s attorney general has opened an investigation into whether Google’s business practices violate its consumer protection and antitrust laws amid growing concern over the influence of powerful technology companies.

Josh Hawley, Missouri’s attorney general, said on Monday that his office had issued a subpoena to Google to seek information into the collection and use of users’ private information, the use of other content providers’ information on its sites and potential bias in search engine results.

Mr. Hawley, a Republican who is running for Senate in 2018, said that the Federal Trade Commission had given Google a “free pass” and that it was critical for consumers to understand what was happening with their personal information.

Check. Misleading examples and calculations to give the false impression of a tax cut for the middle class? Check.

But there are also some new aspects to this latest money grab. This time around, much more clearly than before, the goal seems to be to favor wealth, especially inherited wealth, over work. And buried in the legislation are multiple measures that would make it much harder for the children of the middle and working classes to work their way up.

So, about the wealthy: The prime example is the way G.O.P. plans would eliminate or sharply reduce taxes on inherited wealth, which currently apply only to a tiny number of huge estates. Yes, Republicans are still pretending that this is about helping small family businesses and family farms, but at this point that’s a sick joke: The best estimates suggest that only around 80 — eight-zero — of such businesses and farms pay any estate tax each year. This is about making wealthy heirs even wealthier — full stop.

There are other big examples, like a new tax loophole that would benefit business owners — but only as long as they don’t actually run their businesses. And there’s more. But let me shift focus instead to what Republicans are trying to do to ordinary families.

We’re still waiting for detailed analysis of the Senate bill, but the House bill doesn’t just raise taxes on many middle-class families: It selectively raises taxes on families with children. In fact, half — half! — of families with children will see a tax hike once the bill is fully phased in.

Suppose that a child from a working-class family decides, despite limited financial resources, to attend college, probably taking out a loan to help pay tuition. Well, guess what: Under the House bill, that interest would no longer be deductible, substantially raising the cost of college.

What if you’re working your way through school and your employer contributes toward your education expenses? The House bill would make that contribution taxable income.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

What if your parent is a university employee, and you get reduced tuition as a result? That tuition break becomes taxable income. So would tuition breaks for graduate students who work as teaching or research assistants.

So what we’re looking at here are a variety of measures that will close off opportunities for children who weren’t clever enough to choose wealthy parents.

Meanwhile, funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which covers more than eight million children, expired a month and a half ago — and so far, Republicans have made no serious effort to restore it. This is surely the shape of things to come: If tax cuts pass, and the deficit explodes, the G.O.P. will suddenly decide that deficits matter again and will demand cuts in social programs, many of which benefit lower-income children.

So this isn’t just ordinary class warfare; it’s class warfare aimed at perpetuating inequality into the next generation. Taken together, the elements of both the House and the Senate bills amount to a more or less systematic attempt to lavish benefits on the children of the ultra-wealthy while making it harder for less fortunate young people to achieve upward social mobility.

Or to put it differently, the tax legislation Republicans are trying to ram through Congress with indecent haste, without hearings or time for any kind of serious study, looks an awful lot like an attempt not simply to reinforce plutocracy, but to entrench a hereditary plutocracy.",Republican Class Warfare: The Next Generation,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/opinion/republican-taxes-next-generation.html

Biden Critiques Trump and Demurs on 2020

Former Vice President Joe Biden appeared on “The Late Show” on Monday for the first time since President Trump took office. Speaking to Stephen Colbert, Mr. Biden said he hoped Mr. Trump’s presidency would be remembered as an outlier.

STEPHEN COLBERT: One of the things that many people said when President Trump was elected: that we have to hold on to certain standards, and we can’t normalize the behavior that got President Trump elected. But on another level, whoever is the president is, you know, de facto presidential. What do you think has changed about the presidency with him being president? Or how will this influence future presidencies? JOE BIDEN: I think, God willing, it will go down as the single exception in American history. [Applause] Look, I think that a lot of the folks in the audience, my guess is, when the president was elected and the political people he gathered around him came into play, you kind of thought, ‘Well, maybe it’s amusing, or a little bit embarrassing sometimes.’ But it didn’t go to the heart of who we were. But I’ll lay you eight-to-five, and I’m speaking to a large crowd — a Republican audience — out in Thousand Oaks, California, and I asked the same question. I said, ‘How many of you are now worried about the stability of the republic? How many of you are now worried about this new phony nationalism that’s us against them? How many are worried about this populism that is designed to essentially undermine the essence of the Bill of Rights, which is, there are certain inalienable rights that nobody, no matter what the majority is, they cannot overrule? I mean, I just think there’s an attack on a system. And I think people are worried.”

Mr. Biden was on the show to promote a new memoir, “Promise Me, Dad,” which tells of how he dealt with the death of his son Beau. Mr. Biden is already the subject of rumors about a possible presidential run in 2020, and he did not dispel those rumors while explaining the “promise” that gave the book its name.

“That was the promise: ‘Promise me, Dad, you’re going to stay engaged. It wasn’t, ‘Promise me, Dad, you’re going to run for president,’” Mr. Biden said, adding: “He did want me to run for president, but that wasn’t the promise. Barack asked me — the president asked me at lunch one day when Beau was sick, he said, ‘What do you want to do with the rest of your life?’ And I said, ‘I want to do what I’ve done — the same answer I would have given you when I was 29, when I was 39, and my age right now. I want to make a difference, and I think I can.”

‘Thou Shalt Not Be Gross’

Mr. Trump’s mixed messages applied to China, too.
Just before leaving Manila on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters he had repaired what he claimed had been a “horrible” relationship between Mr. Duterte and the United States.
“I would actually say, probably better than ever before.”After 12 hectic days in Asia, even Mr. Trump’s critics acknowledge he projected an air of engagement.","“It was red carpet like nobody, I think, has probably ever received,” the president added.

By some measures, he was right. Mr. Trump made no major gaffes. The closest he came was calling the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un “short and fat” in a tweet. He also faced criticism for failing to challenge the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, who is accused of ordering thousands of extrajudicial killings, on human rights.

But Mr. Trump’s energy did not flag and he was accorded a lavish reception at every stop, especially Beijing, where President Xi Jinping threw open the doors of the Forbidden City.

“Like any Trump endeavor, there were the inevitable distractions with tweets about the physical appearance of leaders and clear signals that he prefers the company of tyrants like Putin and Duterte,” said Kurt M. Campbell, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs.

Still, Mr. Campbell said, “If this trip were a high-wire act, President Trump managed to get to the other side.”

And yet there were subtler signs of tension, which spoke to the conflicting messages Mr. Trump brought to Asia and suggested a level of disarray in the White House’s policy toward the region.

Before his meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia, for example, Mr. Trump had a brief contretemps with Mr. Turnbull over trade imbalances after he asserted that the United States ran deficits with “almost everybody.”

“Except us,” Mr. Turnbull interjected.

Mr. Trump made trade a major part of his message in Asia, and his tone grew more bluntly nationalistic as the trip wore on. After declaring in Beijing that he did not blame the Chinese for chronic imbalances with the United States, he delivered a withering denunciation in Vietnam of regional trade pacts, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, from which Mr. Trump has withdrawn the United States.

The president delivered that message in a speech that was supposed to explain his concept of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” region. The idea, which Trump officials borrowed from the Japanese, is that the region’s four major maritime democracies — the United States, Japan, Australia and India — will constitute a bulwark against a rising China.

But this theme was largely lost in the jeremiad on trade. Critics said it testified to the stubborn divide within the administration between mainstream foreign policy figures like Matthew Pottinger, the senior director for Asia at the National Security Council, and economic nationalists like the policy adviser Stephen Miller, who took a strong hand in writing the speech.

“The Indo-Pacific framing is clearly the handiwork of his more experienced and internationally-minded senior national security team, while the ‘America First’ theme of demanding zero-sum concessions from all our trading partners is not,” said Michael J. Green, senior vice president for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Mr. Trump’s invitation for one-on-one trade negotiations with the United States, Mr. Green said, was likely to fall on deaf ears in Asian countries, many of which went though fierce debates before signing on to the Pacific trade deal and now want to reap its benefits.

“That’s like a sheriff squaring up for a showdown with the town outlaw by announcing to the posse that he wants a gunfight with each of them at the same time,” said Mr. Green, who served as President George W. Bush’s senior adviser on Asia policy.

Indeed, while Mr. Trump was preaching his go-it-alone economic message, the 11 countries still in the Trans-Pacific Partnership made significant progress toward finalizing the agreement without the United States. They have given it an even wordier new name, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.

“I think this will be a strong message for not only Asia, but also other regions in the world,” Japan’s economy minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, told reporters.

Mr. Trump’s mixed messages applied to China, too. In Beijing, he embraced the Chinese leader unlike any American president going back to Richard M. Nixon. He said nothing publicly about China’s human rights record. And he cast Mr. Xi as a popular leader who could solve the nuclear crisis with North Korea.

“He’s a strong person,” Mr. Trump said to reporters. “He’s a very smart person. I like him a lot; he likes me. But, you know, we represent two very different countries. But we get along very well. And that’s a good thing that we get along; that’s not a bad thing.”

White House officials said Mr. Trump’s charm offensive had paid off in extracting new commitments from China to shut down North Korean bank accounts. But officials acknowledged that China had not budged on their No. 1 request on North Korea: to cut off all shipments of oil to the North.

Nor did it announce major moves to open its markets during Mr. Trump’s visit, in part because the president did not ask for any.

Moreover, Mr. Trump soft-pedaled his call for China not to colonize the South China Sea. While he emphasized the need for free navigation and open shipping lanes during his visits to Vietnam and the Philippines, he did not single out China, which has clashed with those neighbors as it has built military installations in the disputed waterway.

One of Mr. Trump’s aides marveled at the sheer size of China’s claims in the South China Sea, noting that Air Force One flew for three hours over these contested waters on its way from Hanoi to Manila.

During his meeting with Vietnam’s president, Tran Dai Quang, Mr. Trump offered his deal-making skills to mediate disputes in the South China Sea. But some Asian countries are no longer as ready to pick fights with China. Mr. Duterte stopped construction last week on a sandbar in disputed waters, as part of a broader effort to draw closer to Beijing.

Just before leaving Manila on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters he had repaired what he claimed had been a “horrible” relationship between Mr. Duterte and the United States. “We have a very good relationship,” he said. “I would actually say, probably better than ever before.”

After 12 hectic days in Asia, even Mr. Trump’s critics acknowledge he projected an air of engagement. The question, they said, is whether his mixed messages will open the door further for China’s incursions in the region.

“Despite all the craziness of Trump, the U.S. remains in the game in Asia,” said Evan S. Medeiros, a former adviser to President Barack Obama on China. “But the U.S. is no longer driving the agenda.”",Trump’s Mixed Messages Fail to Reassure Asian Allies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/world/asia/trump-asia-trade-north-korea.html

Tommy, 50, of Queens, N.Y., who takes Abilify for schizoaffective disorder, participated in a clinical trial for digital Abilify.","But, he added, “if used improperly, it could foster more mistrust instead of trust.”

Patients who agree to take the digital medication, a version of the antipsychotic Abilify, can sign consent forms allowing their doctors and up to four other people, including family members, to receive electronic data showing the date and time pills are ingested.

A smartphone app will let them block recipients anytime they change their mind. Although voluntary, the technology is still likely to prompt questions about privacy and whether patients might feel pressure to take medication in a form their doctors can monitor.

Dr. Peter Kramer, a psychiatrist and the author of “Listening to Prozac,” raised concerns about “packaging a medication with a tattletale.”

While ethical for “a fully competent patient who wants to lash him or herself to the mast,” he said, “‘digital drug’ sounds like a potentially coercive tool.”

Other companies are developing digital medication technologies, including another ingestible sensor and visual recognition technology capable of confirming whether a patient has placed a pill on the tongue and has swallowed it.

Not all will need regulatory clearance, and some are already being used or tested in patients with heart problems, stroke, H.I.V., diabetes and other conditions.

Because digital tools require effort, like using an app or wearing a patch, some experts said they might be most welcomed by older people who want help remembering to take pills and by people taking finite courses of medication, especially for illnesses like tuberculosis, in which nurses often observe patients taking medicine.

The technology could potentially be used to monitor whether post-surgical patients took too much opioid medication or clinical trial participants correctly took drugs being tested.

Insurers might eventually give patients incentives to use them, like discounts on copayments, said Dr. Eric Topol, director of Scripps Translational Science Institute, adding that ethical issues could arise if the technology was “so much incentivized that it’s almost is like coercion.”

Another controversial use might be requiring digital medicine as a condition for parole or releasing patients committed to psychiatric facilities.

Abilify is an arguably unusual choice for the first sensor-embedded medicine. It is prescribed to people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and, in conjunction with an antidepressant, major depressive disorder.

Many patients with these conditions do not take medication regularly, often with severe consequences. But symptoms of schizophrenia and related disorders can include paranoia and delusions, so some doctors and patients wonder how widely digital Abilify will be accepted.

“Many of those patients don’t take meds because they don’t like side effects, or don’t think they have an illness, or because they become paranoid about the doctor or the doctor’s intentions,” said Dr. Paul Appelbaum, director of law, ethics and psychiatry at Columbia University’s psychiatry department.

“A system that will monitor their behavior and send signals out of their body and notify their doctor?” he added. “You would think that, whether in psychiatry or general medicine, drugs for almost any other condition would be a better place to start than a drug for schizophrenia.”

The newly approved pill, called Abilify MyCite, is a collaboration between Abilify’s manufacturer, Otsuka, and Proteus Digital Health, a California company that created the sensor.

The sensor, containing copper, magnesium and silicon (safe ingredients found in foods), generates an electrical signal when splashed by stomach fluid, like a potato battery, said Andrew Thompson, Proteus’s president and chief executive.

After several minutes, the signal is detected by a Band-Aid-like patch that must be worn on the left rib cage and replaced after seven days, said Andrew Wright, Otsuka America’s vice president for digital medicine.

The patch sends the date and time of pill ingestion and the patient’s activity level via Bluetooth to a cellphone app. The app allows patients to add their mood and the hours they have rested, then transmits the information to a database that physicians and others who have patients’ permission can access.

Otsuka has not determined a price for Abilify MyCite, which will be rolled out next year, first to a limited number of health plans, Mr. Wright said. The price, and whether digital pills improve adherence, will greatly affect how widely they are used.

Questions about the technology’s ability to increase compliance remain.

Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, chairman of psychiatry at Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, said many psychiatrists would likely want to try digital Abilify, especially for patients who just experienced their first psychotic episode and are at risk of stopping medication after feeling better.

But he noted it has only been approved to track doses, and has not yet been shown to improve adherence.

“Is it going to lead to people having fewer relapses, not having unnecessary hospital readmissions, being able to improve their vocational and social life?” he asked.

He added, “There’s an irony in it being given to people with mental disorders than can include delusions. It’s like a biomedical Big Brother.”

Abilify, a widely used drug, went off patent recently, and while other companies can sell the generic form, aripiprazole, Otsuka, has exclusive rights to embed it with Proteus’s sensor, said Robert McQuade, Otsuka’s executive vice president and chief strategic officer.

“It’s not intended for all patients with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar,” he added. “The physician has to be confident the patient can actually manage the system.”

Dr. McQuade said, “We don’t have any data currently to say it will improve adherence,” but will likely study that after sales begin.

Proteus has spent years bringing its sensor to commercial use, raising about $400 million from investors, including Novartis and Medtronic, Mr. Thompson said.

Until now, the sensor could not be embedded in pills, but pharmacies could be commissioned to place it in a capsule along with another medication.

In 2016, the encapsulated sensor started being used outside of clinical trials, but commercial use is still limited, Mr. Thompson said.

Nine health systems in six states have begun prescribing it with medications for conditions including hypertension and hepatitis C, the company said, adding that it has been found to improve adherence in patients with uncontrolled hypertension and others.

AiCure, a smartphone-based visual recognition system in which patients document taking medicine, has had success with tuberculosis patients treated by the Los Angeles County Health Department and is working with similar patients in Illinois, said Adam Hanina, AiCure’s chief executive.

He said AiCure has shown promising results with other conditions, including in schizophrenia patients whose pill-taking would otherwise require direct observation.

A Florida company, etectRx, makes another ingestible sensor, the ID-Cap, which has been or is being tested with opioids, H.I.V. medication and other drugs.

Made of magnesium and silver chloride, it is encapsulated with pills and avoids using a patch because it generates “a low-power radio signal that can be picked up by a little antenna that’s somewhere near you,” said Harry Travis, etectRx’s president, who said the company plans to seek F.D.A. clearance next year.

The signal is detected by a reader worn around the neck, but etectRx aims to fit readers into watchbands or cellphone cases.

“I get questions all the time, ‘Hey is the government going to use this, and can you track me?’” said Eric Buffkin, an etectRx senior vice president. “Frankly, there is a creepiness factor of this whole idea of medicine tracking.

“The thing I tell them first and foremost is there’s nothing to reach out of this technology to pry your mouth open and make you take a pill. If you are fundamentally opposed to this idea of sharing the information, then say, ‘No thank you.’”

Seeking to address concerns about privacy and coercion, Otsuka officials contracted with several bioethicists. Among them, I. Glenn Cohen, a Harvard law professor, said safeguards adopted include allowing patients to instantly stop physicians and others from seeing some or all of their data.

Asked whether it might be used in circumstances like probation or involuntary hospitalization, Otsuka officials said that was not their intention or expectation, partly because Abilify MyCite only works if patients want to use the patch and app.

How patients will view Abilify MyCite is unclear. Tommy, 50, of Queens, N.Y., who takes Abilify for schizoaffective disorder, participated in a clinical trial for digital Abilify.

Tommy, who withheld his last name to protect his privacy, encountered minor issues, saying the patch was “a little bit uncomfortable” and once gave him a rash.

A compliant patient, Tommy said he does not need monitoring. “I haven’t had paranoid thoughts for a long time — it’s not like I believe they’re beaming space aliens,” he said. If offered digital Abilify, he said, “I wouldn’t do it again.”

But the method might appeal to patients who want to prove their compliance, build trust with their psychiatrist, or who feel “paranoid about getting accused of not taking their medicine.”

Steve Colori, 31, of Danvers, Mass., who wrote a memoir about his illness, “Experiencing and Overcoming Schizoaffective Disorder,” said he took Abilify years ago for symptoms including believing,“I was a messiah.”

Although he sometimes stopped taking medication, he would consider digital pills “overbearing and I think it stymies someone and halts progress in therapy.”

William Jiang, 44, a writer in Manhattan with schizophrenia, took Abilify for 16 years. He said he steadfastly takes medication to prevent recurrence of episodes of paranoia when “I was convinced everybody was trying to murder me.”

He said some noncompliant patients might take digital Abilify, especially to avoid Abilify injections recommended to patients who skip pills.

“I would not want an electrical signal coming out of my body strong enough so my doctor can read it,” Mr. Jiang said.

They often must wait about three months before submitting an official complaint, yet must file one no later than 180 days after the episode. Once filed, victims must submit to up to 30 days of mandatory counseling and complete another 30 days of mediation.

If mediation fails, the person then must wait 30 more days before seeking an administrative hearing or filing a lawsuit in Federal District Court.

“The system is so stacked,” said Debra Katz, a Washington lawyer who often works on sexual harassment cases. “They don’t want people to come forward.”

With such rigid policies, even the most dogged complainants may find no avenue for resolution. In one case, a fellow at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, M. Reese Everson, brought a complaint against a House member to the Office of Compliance. But she said the office told her it could not handle her case because, as a fellow and not a full-time employee, she did not fall under its jurisdiction.

She ended up filing her complaints with the District of Columbia government, where they have languished for over two years.

Few deny the growing sense that Congress is, for many women, a hostile workplace. Last Thursday, the Senate approved a resolution that would create mandatory anti-harassment training for all Senate employees and interns, and would require training every two years. At least two other pieces of legislation that would make the changes even broader are in progress.

Kristin Nicholson, a former chief of staff to Representative Jim Langevin, Democrat of Rhode Island, said Congress had not gone far enough. “We think training needs to be in-person to be more effective,” said Ms. Nicholson, who now directs the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, “and we’re asking for reforms to the opaque process for reporting and resolving harassment claims.”

In interviews, a few who were harassed said they were never even informed of the Office of Compliance’s existence.

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

Rebecca Weir, a 39-year-old lawyer in Washington, had never heard of the office in 2001 when she said former Representative Gary Miller, Republican of California, asked her to twirl for him in his Diamond Bar, Calif., office.

”He said, ‘My God, you look amazing today. Just stunning.’ And he was kind of leering at me, and then he asked me to twirl,” Ms. Weir recalled. “I was stunned, but I was young and dumb and here’s a member of Congress that I’m working for asking me to twirl in his office. So I did.”

Ms. Weir said Mr. Miller’s chief of staff called from Washington soon after with some news.

“‘Well Rebecca, I don’t know what you did, but Gary just called me and said you can have a $1,250 bonus, effective immediately,’” Ms. Weir recalled.

On Monday, a woman who identified herself as Mr. Miller’s wife, Cathy Miller, denied the allegations. “I know my husband,” she said before adding that the claim was “yellow journalism.”

There also was no mandatory training in place on Katherine Cichy’s 27th birthday in 2013. Ms. Cichy, then an aide for now-retired Senator Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota, was walking through Union Station with colleagues when Ms. Cichy’s direct supervisor repeatedly called her “hot.”

Ms. Cichy reported the episode to her chief of staff at the time, who she said made light of it, saying, “It is what it is.”

Months later, Ms. Cichy took a job in another office. The man who harassed her stayed in Mr. Johnson’s office, as did his former chief of staff, Drey Samuelson, who said on Friday that he had warned the offending employee, “I would fire him, and it never happened again.” He said that he did not make light of the episode.

“Bottom line,” Ms. Cichy said, “my boss told me I was hot, and I had to sit in a room every day and work with him. And they didn’t do anything about it. Nothing.”

For female lobbyists, sexual suggestions appear to be part of the price of access.

In her 40 years on the Hill, Laura W. Murphy, the former head of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington legislative office, said she endured a number of sexually suggestive episodes as generations of lawmakers cycled in and out of Congress. In the 1980s, a House member, whose name she would not share, tried to kiss her in the produce aisle at a Capitol Hill grocery store. In the early 2000s, she said a lawmaker asked her for a working dinner, then propositioned her for sex.

“At first it was about work,” Ms. Murphy, 62, said. “But then it devolved into a very blatant overture to have sex.”

Like many women, Ms. Murphy did not report the episodes in part because she believed her career could be negatively affected and because she was not sure where she could turn.

All of the women now coming forward are putting pressure on the Office of Compliance, whose processes date back to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. Between 1997 and 2014, the United States Treasury paid $15.2 million in 235 awards and settlements for Capitol Hill workplace violations under the office’s byzantine procedures, according to a recent Washington Post analysis of the Office of Compliance.

Susan Tsui Grundmann, the office’s executive director, said that the office had received an increase in requests for harassment training in the past two weeks, and that the five-member board had repeatedly recommended since 2010 that Congress put in place regular mandatory harassment training.

Bradford Fitch, president and chief executive of the Congressional Management Foundation, a group that helps lawmakers and staff run their offices, said sexual harassment was vastly underreported in congressional offices.

This has been the case for decades: In 1989, Alice Cain was 22 and three months into a job as a chief of staff’s assistant for Paul Simon, who was then a Democratic senator from Illinois, when one of his top donors groped her and kissed her at a fund-raiser held at a Washington hotel.

Ms. Cain, who is now 50 and works for a nonprofit organization, said that several other women in her office had similar experiences with that donor, whom she declined to name out of respect for his family. But she said it was years before the women spoke to one another about the episodes.

“If I go into my boss’s office and say, ‘Oh, this guy did this to me’ — I don’t want to lose my job,” Ms. Cain said. “I think all of us made that calculation.”

She said she decided to share her story belatedly “for the 22-year-olds now.”

Others are reconsidering past experiences, episodes previously brushed off as playful or not a big deal, that register now as assault.

Hannah Hudson was in her early 20s and working for a Democratic congressman from Oklahoma in 2009 when she was joined on a work trip by staff members from a Republican senator’s office. At a work outing, she said, a senior aide for that senator tried to tug open her wrap dress, which she had pinned closed, asking, “Why are you holding out on us?”

Ms. Hudson, who is now 32 and works as a photographer, did not think to report the episode. She said she tried to brush it off because she felt that what had happened to her was not as bad as what had happened to others.

She does remember feeling grateful when a male colleague who silently witnessed the episode pulled her aside privately to ask if she was all right.

“How much of a patriarchal society do we live in that the person who came up to me in private and said, ‘Oh, are you O.K.?’ is the hero?” she asked.

She paused.

In unveiling the third iteration of the travel ban in late September, the administration said that the eight countries did not share with the United States information to enable proper screening of their nationals.

The administration crafted the latest policy after judges ruled that the previous two versions were unconstitutional attempts to bar Muslims from the country and violated the Constitution.

A day before the newest ban was to go into effect, Judge Derrick K. Watson of Federal District Court in Honolulu issued a nationwide order that froze most of it. A day later, a federal judge in Maryland issued a similar but narrower order, which halted the ban only for people with bona fide ties to the United States.

Both judges deemed the ban to be discriminatory against Muslims and similar to the previous ones.

In Maryland, Judge Theodore D. Chuang of the Federal District Court in Greenbelt cited the president’s statements and Twitter messages criticizing Muslims to justify his ruling.

“To extent that the government might have provided additional evidence to establish that national security is now the primary purpose for the travel ban, it has not done so,” he wrote.

In Hawaii, Judge Watson wrote that the latest ban “suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor.”

The Trump administration appealed both decisions, citing national security concerns. It said that it is not trying to bar Muslims from entering the United States, but rather to exercise control over who enters from some of the world’s most menacing countries.

The Ninth Circuit’s decision on Monday limits the scope of the Hawaii injunction and brings it in line with the one issued in Maryland.

“This is certainly good for the administration,” conceded Betsy Fisher, policy director for the International Refugee Assistance Project, the lead plaintiff in the Maryland case. Ms. Fisher added that for travelers from the six countries, however, “everyone can expect longer processing times to allow for proving bona fide relationships.”

The Supreme Court was scheduled to review the second version of the ban when Mr. Trump issued the third, and legal experts believe the latest version will reach the top court.

But that order also imposed new restrictions on 11 countries until the government has completed a 90-day review of security measures.

No,” Mr. Seeger said.
Mr. Stewart expected to receive a gross award of $2.8 million from the concussions settlement.
Mr. Stewart does not dispute being injured for parts of his career.
But players feared the money would run out before every claim was filed, so the league agreed to “uncap” payments.","When the league agreed to the settlement several years ago, retired players were told that they could expect speedy payouts, assuming the diagnoses for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and other ailments covered in the settlement were in order.

But the N.F.L. installed so many safeguards and trapdoors into the deal, lawyers for the players said, that in the eight months since the court-approved administrator of the settlement began accepting claims, many players have been forced to spend months scrounging for paperwork they did not think they had to keep, finding new doctors to confirm established diagnoses and lodging time-consuming appeals.

The requests, the league said, are part of its efforts to deter potential fraud and do not represent foot-dragging or a lack of will to help the sick men. But as a result, the players now accuse the nation’s richest league, with $14 billion in revenue, of trying to wear them down so they accept smaller payouts, or none at all.

“Players will be shorted what they earned,” said Andrew Stewart, a retired defensive lineman with Parkinson’s disease who expected to receive nearly $3 million but, after a series of delays and requests, has been offered less than a third of that amount and is appealing. “This is not a settlement. This is about paying sick men as little as possible.”

Mr. Stewart, who was in the league from 1989 to 1993 and now lives in Canada, received a Parkinson’s diagnosis nearly a decade ago and has been receiving aid from two N.F.L. benefit plans. But to receive money from the settlement, he was required to get a diagnosis from an American doctor.

Alerted to some of the delays and accusations of unfairness leveled by lawyers for the players, Anita B. Brody, the federal judge overseeing the case, met with the N.F.L., the plaintiffs’ chief lawyer and a court-appointed administrator on Monday in Philadelphia to look at ways handle claims more efficiently and more transparently.

“Like an insurance company, they deny everything, and they go through a series of denials until people give up,” said Sheilla Dingus, who runs Advocacy for Fairness in Sports, an unaffiliated nonprofit group that monitors the league’s legal cases. “Unfortunately, the N.F.L. has the capital to keep this going a lot longer than some of these players will live.”

Orran Brown, the court-approved administrator of the settlement, said it was common for the parties to settlements to fine-tune their agreements to account for issues that arise. He said that players were now, for instance, being asked to turn in the raw scores from their neurocognitive exams even though that was not explicit in the original agreement.

He said the bulk of the claims that had been sent back to players were for missing paperwork. But another group of claims has been reviewed because many players were receiving identical diagnoses from the same physician, leading to questions of whether the players had been properly examined.

Mr. Brown said he understood that players and their lawyers might view these additional requirements with suspicion. But he said they were part of an effort to prevent fraud, not block real claims.

“It does seem people feel they are being nickeled and dimed on paperwork,” Mr. Brown said. “But there’s nothing nefarious or conspiratorial in this. The goal is to make sure everyone gets paid for legitimate claims.”

The former players who have filed claims are seeking up to $5 million each — though most will probably receive far less — for severe neurological diseases tied to years of head hits on the field. A total of 20,000 retired players registered so they could submit claims now or in the future from the settlement, which offers one-time cash awards for those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head hits that is diagnosed posthumously.

Chris Seeger, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said that the administration of such class-action settlements often had “growing pains” because of unanticipated problems. In this case, some former players have “pushed the envelope,” he said, by, among other things, obtaining diagnoses from psychologists, not neurologists; having doctors affirm diagnoses without examining patients; or submitting claims without the necessary medical records.

By bouncing claims back to players, the administrator is trying to address “some funny things that didn’t look right,” and to ensure that when claims are finally evaluated, they have a better chance of being approved, Mr. Seeger said.

Mr. Seeger disputes claims by lawyers who accuse the N.F.L. of foot-dragging and trying to reduce payments to players.

“Is this working perfectly? No,” Mr. Seeger said. But “if there aren’t sufficient records to support a diagnosis, then we have a problem,” he said. “The procedures are laid out, but there is early on typically confusion. Some of it is legitimate stuff that is getting worked out.”

Many lawyers for the players do not agree with that explanation. The high number of claims that have been questioned, they said, is evidence that fraud prevention is being used as a way to keep down payouts.

“I worked at State Farm for 10 years, so I understand all the tactics,” said Patrick Tighe, a lawyer in Florida who represents 90 players. “There are all sorts of ways to slow down the claims.”

All 35 claims Mr. Tighe has filed have been audited or sent back because of “deficiencies,” he said. Jim Acho, a lawyer in Michigan who represents former players, including Gale Sayers, said that just four of the nearly three dozen claims he had filed were approved, and that two of those were audited.

Jason Luckasevic, who represents dozens of former N.F.L. players, has filed more than 100 claims, and more than 85 percent of them have been flagged for deficiencies.

“The settlement was sold by the N.F.L. and Seeger as quick pay,” Mr. Luckasevic said. “This was something everyone feared. This is the N.F.L. disability plan version 2.0.”

The N.F.L., which insisted on much of the fraud prevention language in the settlement, denies that it has pushed the administrator to deliberately delay the payment of genuine claims, and it said that stricter requirements were not added after the deal was made final.

“There have been no changes in the terms of the settlement agreement or the criteria for claims approval since the settlement was finalized,” Brian McCarthy, a spokesman for the N.F.L., said in a statement, adding that neither the league nor Mr. Seeger had taken any steps to delay the payment of legitimate claims.

The frustration among players is particularly acute for those whose neurological diseases were diagnosed years before the settlement was approved, and who are receiving benefits for those ailments from the N.F.L. under one of its regular disability plans. The delays are making it harder for them to cover escalating medical costs and, in some cases, to repay high-interest loans they took out using their settlement as collateral.

Yet many players are afraid to speak publicly about their cases because they fear the N.F.L. will deny their claims or strip them of other benefits.

Mr. Stewart, one of the few who would talk, said the league must be held accountable. He was found to have Parkinson’s disease in 2009, when he was 43.

Mr. Stewart expected to receive a gross award of $2.8 million from the concussions settlement. But after he filed a claim, he was told that another doctor had to confirm his diagnosis.

The new diagnosis, though, would have applied to his current age, 51, which would have reduced his award by $1.2 million because in the settlement, older players are paid less than younger players on the presumption that their disease is related to age, not football.

After Mr. Stewart submitted much additional paperwork, the administrator recognized the earlier diagnosis. But the award was reduced to $750,000 because the administrator calculated he had played only one season, not four.

In the deal, the more eligible seasons a player has, the higher the exposure and the higher the award. But the number of seasons is reduced if players spent time on the injured reserved list because they presumably were not exposed to head hits then.

Mr. Stewart does not dispute being injured for parts of his career. But in his day, coaches forced him to keep practicing — often with the aid of painkillers — so he was exposed to head hits even if he did not play on game day.

In many ways, the N.F.L. case is different from many settlements, experts said. Most settlements describe the kinds of documents to support claims, like a credit card number or a receipt. In the N.F.L. settlement, many retirees are applying for benefits for dementia, which can be complicated to diagnose because it is more subjective than, say, A.L.S.

Because awards can reach millions of dollars, the players’ lawyers — many of whom receive a percentage any settlement — have an incentive to make their clients look worse than they may be, a reason for the N.F.L. to be alert to fraud, experts said.

Indeed, when the deal was first announced in 2013, the N.F.L. agreed to pay $765 million. But players feared the money would run out before every claim was filed, so the league agreed to “uncap” payments. In return for unlimited liability, the N.F.L. insisted on stronger rules to block fraudulent claims.

But the slow pace of approved claims has raised questions about whether those rules were meant to do more than fight fraud.

Kenneth Feinberg, who has administered large class-action settlements, including those related to the BP oil spill and the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, said that in the cases he had handled, defendants had a right to try to prevent fraud. But the delays that have come from questioning a large number of claims can erode trust in the settlement.

“It’s not just how many claims have been found eligible, but how quickly the money goes out the door,” said Mr. Feinberg, who is not involved in the N.F.L. case. “All the words in the world are no substitute for visible evidence of generosity, and checks flowing to families in need.”",Debilitated Players Accuse N.F.L. of Stalling on Settlement Payments,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/sports/football/nfl-concussion-lawsuit.html

The first identified fatality on the list is Emanuel T. Tout, a 23-year-old Sudanese man, who died in a German prison on Dec. 25, 1993, of self-inflicted wounds. It was not clear why 1993 was chosen as the start date.

The final entry is on May 29, 2017, when two bodies were found and 28 people were listed as missing after they either drowned or were trampled to death when a boat sank just off the Libyan coast. The names of the deceased were not known and neither was their region of origin.

That the tally appeared in a Berlin newspaper was possibly a reflection of Germany’s central role in the refugee crisis that has engulfed Europe in recent years. In 2015, Chancellor Angela Merkel threw open her country’s borders to refugees and migrants, many of them from Syria, and around one million people arrived.

While many Germans initially welcomed them, a subsequent backlash helped propel the far-right Alternative for Germany party into Parliament. In negotiations to form a new governing coalition and under pressure from her Bavarian political partners, Ms. Merkel was forced to agree to limit the number of asylum seekers to 200,000 a year.

Recipe: Braised Chicken With GochujangMany of the Finger Lakes cabernet franc wines exhibited restrained fruit, whispers of spice and musky smoke in a brooding package.","For the Finger Lakes, though, it was a sound decision. The critical acclaim for its rieslings has fed a growth in production and the arrival of new producers.

By 2011, the last year for which New York kept records of grape acreage, riesling was by far the region’s most planted of white vinifera grapes, the European species that accounts for all the familiar fine-wine grapes. Even so, the region still has many acres of hybrid and native American grapes, like concord and Niagara, a legacy of its history both as a producer of cheap fortified wines and of small wineries that did the bulk of their business selling directly to visitors.

Still, few regions in the world flourish with only one signature wine. For as long as riesling has prospered in the Finger Lakes, winemakers there have debated what its red counterpart ought to be.

I’ve had charming pinot noirs, made in a fresh, delicate style rather than with opulent fruit. I’ve had intriguing teroldegos and blaufränkisches. Yet the most consistently good and distinctive reds I’ve had from the Finger Lakes have been cabernet francs.

In the last five years or so, I have seen more cabernet francs from the region. It has not been a lot — cab franc acreage accounts for less than a third of riesling acreage — but enough to notice.

As with riesling, focusing on cab franc is not at all a marketing no-brainer. It’s the other cabernet, the one without a clear identity and name recognition. The easy path is not necessarily the best path, as was true with riesling, so maybe cabernet franc, too, makes sense.

Seeking a deeper understanding of Finger Lakes cabernet franc, the wine panel recently tasted 20 bottles primarily from the 2014 and ’15 vintages, with one ’16 thrown in. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Christy Frank — who, with her husband, owns Copake Wine Works in Columbia County, N.Y. — and Thomas Pastuszak, wine director of the NoMad.

Thomas and his wife, Jessica Brown, also happen to own a small Finger Lakes label, Terrassen Cellars, that makes cabernet franc. Our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch, was unaware of the connection and included a bottle in our blind tasting. To avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest, we did not include it in our rankings.

As we tasted through the 20 bottles, a clear profile of Finger Lakes cabernet franc emerged. These wines were pale in color, savory and spicy, more than sweetly fruity. Indeed, the fruit flavor tended more toward the tart end of the spectrum, leavened with herbal and mineral touches.

These wines spoke plainly of cool-climate viticulture, a phrase often bandied about by regions that have little claim to it. Yet it is a true description of conditions in the Finger Lakes, where alcohol levels only occasionally rise above 13 percent, compared with the 14 percent to 15 percent seen regularly in California. The best cabernet francs were light- to medium-bodied with almost delicate textures and lively acidity, the sort that would go especially well on the Thanksgiving table.

“People are looking for more food-friendly wines,” Thomas said. “Cool-climate cabernet franc will appeal to those seeking mineral-driven, acid-driven, more firmly tannic wines.”

It’s certainly a lovely, desirable style, though perhaps not mainstream American yet.

“Up in Copake, a lot of people want something local,” Christy said. “But they also want something that’s big and rich, so it’s a fine line.”

As a sommelier, Thomas has tried to pique his customers’ interest in NoMad’s excellent selection of Finger Lakes wines.

“I used to say, ‘Think of a lighter version of cabernet sauvignon,’” he said. “Now I say, ‘A spicier version of pinot noir.’ It’s been more successful in terms of peoples’ expectations.”

Our top wine, a 2014 from Lakewood Vineyards, epitomized the prevailing Finger Lakes style. The wine was fresh, with an almost crunchy texture and nuanced, savory flavors of flowers, herbs and spicy fruit. By contrast, our No. 2 bottle, a 2015 Le Breton from Schneider & Bieler, was darker and more concentrated than many of the other wines. It nonetheless was well balanced, with the typical tart, herbal flavors.

No. 3 was the 2014 Wisdom from Inspire Moore, a deliciously saline, savory mouthful, with flavors of both tart and sweet fruit. No. 4 was the 2014 North Block Six from Atwater Estate, floral and herbal, with a kind of tense energy to it.

Other wines well worth trying include the savory 2014 Hermann J. Wiemer; the floral, earthy 2015 Damiani; the spicy, refreshing 2016 Hosmer and the delicate but deep 2015 Keuka Lake Vineyards.

Almost any of these bottles is an excellent value. None of our favorites cost more than $25.

A few cabernet franc-based wines like Bloomer Creek’s excellent White Horse were not included in our tasting because they didn’t meet the 75 percent threshold for using the name of the grape on the label. Perhaps we were being arbitrary, but it was how we narrowed the field.

The focus on riesling and cabernet franc is not to say that the Finger Lakes do not produce many other fine wines. I’ve had good chardonnays and gamays. I’ve enjoyed pinot noirs. And the sommelier Pascaline Lepeltier has recently teamed with Nathan Kendall, of N. Kendall, to make Chëpìka, an intriguing pétillant naturel made of the native grapes Catawba and Delaware.

It’s the kind of experimentation that suggests a serious exploration of the region’s potential. It will only get better from here.

Recipe: Braised Chicken With Gochujang

Many of the Finger Lakes cabernet franc wines exhibited restrained fruit, whispers of spice and musky smoke in a brooding package. The wines could handle food with some complexity and heat, so I turned to a slow braise, which infuses meat with deep flavor and produces a warming, stewlike dish. It’s the cooking method of choice when the weather brings a chill. The process is what I call the usual three-step affair (brown chicken parts or meat, add other ingredients and some liquid, cover and slowly simmer). But I gave the chicken a bit of heat, unpacking the Korean condiment gochujang with sake, ginger, garlic and some well-mannered poblano chiles. The finished dish would welcome a pillow of steamed rice alongside. FLORENCE FABRICANT

Whatever new elements arrive in 2017, the foreboding is the same as always.

Nonetheless, the projected disasters almost never occur. Everybody has a great time. Remembering this will not help to achieve preliminary serenity, but understanding the process can make the angst easier to endure.

In order to help, the Thanksgiving wine panel annually tries to eliminate wine selections from your areas of concern. Each year, we share a Thanksgiving feast in advance. We each bring two bottles of wine to the meal, each costing no more than $25, with the aim of adding to our understanding of which types of wines work best.

As with many families, we welcomed a new member this year. Our colleague Tejal Rao — sitting in for Julia Moskin, who was away on assignment — joined me, Florence Fabricant, Pete Wells and our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch.

Over the years, we have learned and affirmed that wine is the least consequential issue anybody will face at Thanksgiving. Why is that?

Rule No. 3: If the food is good and the company convivial, you cannot go wrong with the wine. If the food is bad and the company annoying, wine can only help.

What’s the worst that can happen with wine? Only one potential disaster looms: running out.

The single most important guideline for selecting wine for Thanksgiving is simply to have enough on hand. We generally recommend one bottle per wine-drinking adult. This may seem like a lot, but it is simply a hedge against an insufficient supply. You do not have to finish it all. If you like, you can even give away unopened bottles with the leftovers.

Beyond quantity, you need to provide both reds and whites. You can add rosé or a sparkling wine, but both red and white are essential. You will have guests who contend that red wine gives them headaches or white wine gives them heartburn. This is not the time to debate these issues. Let guests drink what they want unfettered.

In our calculus, we imagine Thanksgiving as a large, freewheeling buffet meal, with lots of different dishes and a sprawling patchwork of flavors. It’s not the time to fret about pairing particular dishes with certain bottles. The trick is to provide versatile, nimble wines that pair well with many foods and will not be as fatiguing as everything else.

That generally means bottles not especially high in alcohol, generally below 14 percent. They should not be tannic or oaky, but they must be energetic with lively acidity, which helps to refresh and cleanse the palate.

Over the course of many years we have identified wines that almost always work well: Beaujolais and bone-dry sauvignon blancs are crowd-pleasers. Basic Italian reds made of barbera or sangiovese are fine, as are Italian whites made of fiano or carricante. Loire reds, pinot noirs, chardonnays, chenin blancs, mencías from Spain, rieslings — all are fine choices.

These wines, I should say, fit our particular vision of the feast. If you are having a small dinner party for six with multiple courses and you would like to serve precious bottles poured into exquisite glasses, by all means do.

For our party, we assume a crowd who might be drinking from tumblers or even paper cups. These are fine for big parties. But I do recommend steering clear of plastic goblets, which have a nasty habit of separating bowl from stem at the worst possible moments for your clothing, carpeting and anxiety threshold.

Almost all the wines the panel sampled were excellent, and the few that fell short were nonetheless fine. Tejal brought the two most fascinating wines, both white, sort of.

The first, the 2016 Caprice du Chameau from La Vrille et Le Papillon, a brother-and-sister team who make natural wines in the Ardèche region of southeastern France, was unfiltered, giving the wine a hazy appearance. Yet it was sublimely light and spicy, vibrant and thoroughly delicious. Surprisingly, it was made of viognier, which I usually associate with heavier, fruitier wines. Though visually unusual, the wine was ideal, with what Pete called “a feeling of over the river and through the woods.”

Tejal’s second bottle was more challenging, a 2015 from RuBor Viticultores, made of chasselas, a Swiss white grape unaccountably planted 70 years ago in Cebreros in the Sierra de Gredos, a range of hills that cuts through central Spain. Though made from white grapes, the wine had been made as if it were a red. Instead of immediately separating the juice of the grapes from the skins, the producers macerated them together, extracting tannins and pigment.

The gritty, amber-colored result was savory, intense and unusual, and perhaps better for a crowd of questing wine fanatics than a general-interest holiday group. I would happily serve it with cheese, though not for the long haul of a feast.

Pete brought a rosé sparkling wine, a light, lacy cava from Dibon in the Penedès region of Spain. This fruity cava, unusually made entirely of the garnacha grape, would make a delightful aperitif, though we all would prefer not to drink sparkling wine throughout the feast.

His other wine was an inspired selection, a 2013 Tinto, or red, from the intriguing Barraida region of Portugal from Sidónio de Sousa, made from the baga grape. It was spicy, herbal and lightly fruity, and had just the sort of light-bodied charm that could carry through the entire meal.

Bernie took an unusual tack in selecting his white. He chose a Quincy, a Loire sauvignon blanc, because, he said, he remembered a meal many years ago when a Quincy was universally reviled.

This suggestion of overt hostility to the group could not be rewarded. We disappointed him by thoroughly enjoying the wine, a clean, citrusy 2013 from Domaine Trotereau. We compounded the issue by liking his red even more, a 2013 pinot noir from Red Tail Ridge in the Finger Lakes. Its pale brick color seemed more typical of an older wine, but it was bright, juicy and fresh.

Florence’s white, a 2016 sauvignon blanc from Matanzas Creek in Sonoma County, was an archetypal Thanksgiving white: neutral rather than flamboyant, a subtle character actor that would enhance rather than dominate. It had the sort of texture that continually invited another sip.

Her red was also from Sonoma, a 2012 Buena Vista merlot. It had the opposite character of the Matanzas Creek, with fruit flavors that were too intense. Tejal called the effect “sinister,” but even so, it was easily tolerable.

My own wines included a savory white Bordeaux, a 2015 Lune d’Argent from Clos des Lunes, made by the excellent Domaine de Chevalier. Though primarily sémillon with a quarter sauvignon blanc, it had a lot in common with the Matanzas Creek in that it was more interesting texturally than aromatically.

My red was a 2015 Cahors from Château Combel-la-Serre, an easygoing wine that combined plummy fruit and chalky mineral flavors. It was made of malbec, but was more restrained than many of the fruity malbecs from Argentina.

Collectively, most of these wines added good options to the tried-and-true selections. Tejal, however, second-guessed her choice of the Spanish chasselas. “I realized that maybe something I personally liked is not for everybody,” she said.

She’s correct only to the extent of the distance that a wine lies from the mainstream. Otherwise, I live by the last rule.

Rule No. 4: Choose wines that you like; everybody else will like them, too.

Recipe Pairing: Cornbread Madeleines With Jalapeño

A recent dinner at Gloria, an intimate new seafood restaurant in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, started on a fine note. Warm rounds of individual jalapeño-studded cornbread were served while we sipped cocktails. Always on the prowl for something new for the Thanksgiving menu, I thought of the cornbread as we sampled these Thanksgiving wine selections. Phil Johnson, an owner of Gloria, provided the recipe. But for Thanksgiving, instead of the four-inch cornbread disks served at the restaurant, I baked the batter in madeleine pans. I then froze the little cakes, so I would have them for the holiday. (I will reheat them covered in foil on a baking sheet at 275 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes.) The madeleines would welcome any quaff, cider or beer, not just wine. And the batter can also be baked in cast-iron corn stick molds, though the yield would be fewer, about 15. FLORENCE FABRICANT

182,"['dr', 'deal', 'physician', 'physicians', 'burnout', 'suicide', 'dont', 'work', 'doctors', 'care', 'schonfeld', 'taking']","“It’s not that physicians are burned out and so don’t care, it’s that they care deeply,” said Dr. David Schonfeld, a developmental behavioral pediatrician at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.
Another statistic often cited in the physician wellness conversation is the suicide rate.
Physicians are at approximately twice the relative risk of suicide compared to people in other professions, Dr. McClafferty said.
And we don’t adequately teach the skills in medical training that doctors will need to deal with the realities of taking care of patients.
“The solution is not to weed out the ones who don’t care, but to support the large number of physicians who are deeply invested and have the capacity to provide excellent care, but lose that capacity over time,” Dr. Schonfeld said.","“It’s not that physicians are burned out and so don’t care, it’s that they care deeply,” said Dr. David Schonfeld, a developmental behavioral pediatrician at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. “You can’t experience compassion fatigue if you’ve not had compassion.”

Medical faculty members have been shown to have burnout rates ranging from 20 to 49 percent. And the hard-won reductions in resident work hours do not seem to have satisfactorily reduced burnout or depression among residents, perhaps because hospitalized patients are sicker on average than they used to be, perhaps because patient loads are higher (if you reduce work hours but don’t increase the number of doctors, well, you can do the math), or perhaps because of the increasing frustrations and time pressures connected to the electronic health record and documentation, which can take up more than half of some doctors’ time, often squeezed in at night or by coming in early.

Another statistic often cited in the physician wellness conversation is the suicide rate. Physicians are at approximately twice the relative risk of suicide compared to people in other professions, Dr. McClafferty said. “Women physicians especially are at a significantly higher risk of completed suicide than matched female controls in other professions,” she said. An estimated 300 to 400 physicians commit suicide every year.

If this were happening in any other high-profile industry, Dr. McClafferty said, “I can’t imagine people wouldn’t be rallying round, saying this is unacceptable, it has to stop.”

There is a clear link between physician depression and medical errors. In one study of pediatric residents at three high-powered training programs, those who were depressed made more than six times as many medication errors as those who were not. This study and others also found that residents experiencing burnout were more likely to perceive that they were making more errors, even if they were not.

We place physicians in situations where they are detecting problems, often connected to social conditions or poverty, Dr. Schonfeld said, but then don’t give them the support they need to address those problems. And we don’t adequately teach the skills in medical training that doctors will need to deal with the realities of taking care of patients. “There are more advanced skill sets, how to deal with conflict, how to deal with negotiation, how to deal with the distress of patients,” he said. “We just send trainees in, the training focuses on medications, pathophysiology, genetics, not the skills they need to be able to deal with those broader issues.”

So we might look to changes in the ways we train residents, not just limiting work hours but looking more closely at what the content of those work hours is like, and at the skills we teach, and at what we do and do not discuss.

“Because of organizational structures and competing responsibilities there’s less time, and physicians are really sad about this, and we need to struggle as a society to make it different,” Dr. Serwint said.

Studies are just beginning to be done of workplace interventions that address such issues as time pressure, workplace chaos, and a doctor’s sense of control, but the evidence supports the idea that it’s more effective to make changes at the level of the institution, rather than just telling the doctors to shape up in the wellness department.

“The solution is not to weed out the ones who don’t care, but to support the large number of physicians who are deeply invested and have the capacity to provide excellent care, but lose that capacity over time,” Dr. Schonfeld said. “Physicians enter medical school deeply committed to the field, they come with the desire to be empathic and compassionate, if we just create a system that nurtures what they come with then we will have less burnout and higher quality care.”

It should not be the doctor’s responsibility to feel that “if I’m just more mindful, if I just exercise more or do it better or more consistently, all will be well, and I shouldn’t be feeling burned out or exhausted,” Dr. McClafferty said.

The fact that nearly half of physicians and over 50 percent of trainees experience burnout at some point “shows that it is not predominantly an individual deficit, but an organizational and system problem,” Dr. Schonfeld said

“If you’re my physician,” Dr. McClafferty said, “I want you to be in good shape mentally, physically and emotionally, so you can be really successful at helping me.”",Taking Care of the Physician,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/well/family/taking-care-of-the-physician.html

STEWART Those were always the parties that you’d walk outside and go, it’s light again.

SMIGEL The first benefit my wife, Michelle, and I did for NBC was in 2003. Everybody who does the show, they’re happy to help and I’m very grateful. Jon was really curious, and when I told him why this exists, it was because my son Daniel couldn’t get into any kind of school that could help him at that age.

STEWART When you see people that you admire, you have this idea that they can solve anything that comes their way. To hear about what he was dealing with and how much they had to move heaven and earth, just to get basic necessities, it was shocking.

Is it harder now to put together a comedy event intended for a wide audience? Is it possible to be a comedian without a political point of view?

STEWART [old man voice] “It was a simpler time. A movie was a nickel. A sandwich, they paid you to eat.” Now everything is conflict. Everything exists now for clicks. You’re incentivized to pick not just the lowest-hanging fruit but the fruit that tastes the worst. Because what you want is a reaction, whether it be incredibly positive or incredibly negative. You can’t avoid that that is the world in which this is born, or even a world that we helped create.

Do you think you contributed to that environment? Do you feel responsible for ——

STEWART For the sad state of the world? I do, but not for that reason. I just assume I’m always doing something wrong. Some of it is that the news cycle is so relentless and ubiquitous. Comedy shows that are promoting more day-and-date stuff have to keep up with that.



SMIGEL Since Jon started, comedy has had to deal with the instant reaction it gets on the web. What frustrates me is seeing comedy succumbing to that. A lot of times, jokes now are judged on the target — on the point of view, rather than how funny they are.

Has the internet made people quicker to take offense at jokes?

STEWART I don’t think they’re quicker to offense. I think it’s quicker that you know about it. The outrage has always been there — it just wasn’t on your feed.

SMIGEL I did these Triumph specials last year, and by the time the election ended I was just like, “Enough.” I was so disgusted by both sides. I was supporting Hillary, but all she would talk about in emails I would get is that Trump is a misogynist. No policy stuff. Just that urge to be divisive and to call the other side names, I was happy to sit it out.

Take an example like Larry David’s “S.N.L.” monologue, where he joked about hitting on women at a concentration camp.

SMIGEL It fit right in with Larry’s way of making light of a serious situation. He was the butt of the joke. It seemed like a joke that a lot of old Jews would laugh at.

STEWART I did laugh at it. I am an old Jew.

SMIGEL On the web, a lot of people were defending it. I thought, O.K., this is good. People are saying, you can draw a line here, at what you can be outraged by.

What about when the outrage over a misbegotten joke — like what happened with Kathy Griffin — ends up ostracizing a performer?

STEWART In certain moments it leaves a mark. You see that it does leave permanent scars in its wake, in very rare instances. But there was that PR person, Justine Sacco, who had tweeted out a bad joke about AIDS and traveling to South Africa. By the time she got off the plane, her life was over. And she was just a civilian in the culture war, to a large extent.

SMIGEL You forget that this person who might have made a mistake on Twitter was maybe not 100 percent evil and worthy of losing everything.

STEWART I think that I contributed to that culture. I took a long, hard look at that idea of unfairness and context. I felt like we [“The Daily Show”] worked really hard to maintain that credibility. But there’s no question that it influenced and partook sometimes in a dehumanizing process. No question. Even with situations like Anthony Weiner. When the pile-on occurs, that person turns into a two-dimensional Flat Stanley, as everybody pounds on them. And then that person ends up, actually, turning out to be horrible and has to go to jail. [laughter]

Knowing this capacity for outrage exists, are you more wary, as comedians, about what you say in your performances?

STEWART We’re not victims of this culture, by any stretch of the imagination, and those comments are the price of doing business in the cultural sphere.

SMIGEL What bothers me is that temptation to fuel your side’s fire; it’s on both sides, more than ever. I don’t want to be part of that problem. There was a point where I was like, O.K., this guy’s been elected. Now if I keep relentlessly hitting him with my puppet, am I really being helpful? Or am I just profiting?

For people who don’t share your politics and feel alienated by what they see in TV comedy — who wish we could go back to a more evenhanded era of Johnny Carson — do they have a point?

STEWART Here’s what I would say: Tough shit. Honestly. The idea that you’ve lost the pleasure of watching Carson? We all have lost that pleasure. I used to like watching Carson, too. But I think that’s a cop-out. The people that say, “This culture isn’t for me,” live in a nostalgic world. Those are the people that are the first to tell minorities, “Suck it up.” Those are the first people to say to individuals that are being relentlessly either ostracized or legally threatened, “Oh, snowflake, watch yourself.” But God forbid somebody doesn’t say “Merry Christmas.” It’s the empty rhetoric of grievance, and I don’t feel bad in any way, whatsoever.

SMIGEL Colbert, especially, is hilarious, night in and night out. Sarah [Silverman]’s trying really hard. She’s doing a show on Hulu where she’s really trying to engage with people, and face them as human beings.

Webber不少大学会要求你在高中最后一年提交入学申请时，就早早选好专业。然而，你的想法很有可能会改变。教育部说，约有30%的学生至少会换一次专业。学生们会得到大量关于选专业的建议。盖洛普(Gallup)9月的一项调查显示，大多数建议都来自于家人和朋友，仅有11%的学生会从高中顾问那里寻求指导，28%的人会从大学顾问那里寻求建议。而且，大多数人都不觉得这些建议特别有用。原因可能在于，许多关于专业的惯性思维都是错误的。误解一：STEM（Science, technology, engineering, mathematics，即科学、技术、工程、数学）总能让你赚大钱。计算机科学和工程确实占据薪酬榜首，但具体专业内的薪水差距还是很大的。“学生和家长们很清楚哪种专业的薪水最高，但他们对这些专业内部差异的程度没什么概念，”天普大学(Temple University)研究学术界收入的经济学副教授道格拉斯·A·韦伯(Douglas A. Webber)说。他举了一个例子：英语专业四分之一收入最高的人群一生中挣到的钱，要多于四分之一收入最低的化学工程师。但如果你拿不到最高的薪水呢？和一般毕业于商科和STEM领域的学生相比，就连那些终身收入水平仅高于其专业中等水平的英语或历史系毕业生也算不错的。商科是最受欢迎的大学本科学位，拿该专业的中等终身收入水平来说，一般商科毕业生一辈子能挣286万美元。当你把商科毕业生和那些人们眼中的低收入专业放在一起比较时，就会发现，那些在自己领域内薪酬略微高于中等的人，和商科毕业生比起来挣得差不多。比如，收入位列第60百分位的英语专业学生一生能挣276万美元，同样排名的心理学专业学生能挣257万美元，历史专业学生则能挣264万美元。误解二：女性要掌控一切。如今的大学校园里，女性明显占大多数，构成今年秋季入学学生的56%。和男性相比，她们成功毕业的可能性也更大。但乔治城大学教育与劳动力中心(Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce)一项将于今年晚些时候发表的报告显示，在选专业时，女性往往会把自己局限在报酬较低的领域，比如教育和社会服务。看看那些收入最高的领域，以及女性学习这些专业中的比例，就可以说明问题：商业经济(31%)、化学工程(28%)、计算机科学(20%)、电气工程(10%)、机械工程(8%)。“就算在高等教育的每一个阶段都占据优势，女性仍然无法赢过男性，”乔治城大学该中心主任安东尼·P·卡内瓦莱(Anthony P. Carnevale)说。卡内瓦莱博士不愿就女性做出此类选择的原因做出猜测。但他指出，在男性占优势的这些领域中，如果女性的比例能上升10%，性别薪资差距将大幅缩小：男性每得到1美元的报酬，女性所获得的报酬将从78美分提高到90美分。误解三：选专业比选学校更重要。并非如此。在阿肯色、科罗拉多、明尼苏达、田纳西、德克萨斯、弗吉尼亚和华盛顿这七个州里，学生们可以在公开数据库中搜索，查询这些州各高校毕业生的早期收入。这些数据库显示，从挑选学生标准更为严格的学校毕业的学生会挣得更多。毕竟，大学越好，通过校友、同学父母，乃至最终通过同班同学得来的职业关系网络就更佳。这些大学生更有条件去选择低收入领域的专业，因为他们的人脉能帮他们找到好工作。在精英大学里，艺术、人文和社会科学专业比在二线大学里更为普遍，二线大学的学生们往往会选择商业、教育和卫生等针对就业的专业。总而言之，根据FiveThirtyEight网站对《巴伦周刊》(Barron’s)排名的78所“最热门学校”与1800所“不太热门学校”的对比分析，在不太热门的学校里，半数以上的学生选择以事业为导向的专业；而在精英学校里，不到四分之一的学生这样做。“热门大学的学生可以在本科期间探索自己的知识兴趣，因为他们可以在研究生院获得职业培训，或者进入一个能让他们获得最高职位的关系网，不管他们的本科专业是什么，”卡内瓦莱说。与二线大学相比，精英大学的学生也更有可能学习两个专业。二线大学的学生往往有更迫切的财务需求，他们必须工作，没时间学习两个专业。一个小贴士：范德比尔特大学(Vanderbilt University)社会学副教授、曾研究双学位的兴起的理查德·N·皮特(Richard N. Pitt)表示，有重叠需求的互补专业更容易应付，但两个不相关的专业很可能会让你在就业市场上更受欢迎。“这能增加知识的广度，”他说。误解四：文科专业找不到工作。文科是政治人士最喜欢攻击的一个目标，最近的攻击来自肯塔基州长马特·贝文(Matt Bevin)。“如果你学的是形意舞蹈，那么上帝保佑你，因为现在美国没有很多雇主在寻找拥有这种技能的人，”贝文在9月份的一次演讲中说。形意舞蹈的市场需求可能不大，但文科专业所注重的能力——写作、综合、解决问题——正是雇主们想要的。哈佛大学(Harvard)的教育与经济学副教授戴维·J·戴明(David J. Deming)2017年进行的一项研究发现，在过去30年里，需要所谓的软技能和思考能力的工作，在就业和薪酬方面的增长幅度最大。文科的一个问题是很难找到第一份工作。不过，波士顿分析就业市场趋势的Burning Glass科技公司进行的一项研究发现，如果文科毕业生能熟练掌握社交媒体或数据分析等八项技术技能中的一项，那么他们获得初级职位工作机会的几率就会大幅增加。《你无所不能——“无用”的文科教育的惊人力量》(You Can Do Anything: The Surprising Power of a ‘Useless’ Liberal Arts Education)一书的作者乔治·安德斯(George Anders)表示，长期以来，家长和学生们一直认为文科毕业生找不到工作，这种观念忽视了现代经济的一个现实：现在的工作所需要的技能不是哪一个大学专业能够轻松涵盖的。安德斯在书中介绍了哲学、社会学和语言学等专业的毕业生所干的五花八门的工作，包括销售、金融和市场研究。“一旦首席执行官们看到文科毕业生有用，”安德斯说，“他们就会觉得自己需要更多此类人才。”误解五：尽早选择专业很重要。为什么要钻到一个领域里，而不是先体验完大学提供的各式课程，比如出国学习、俱乐部活动，或者一门出人意料的选修课？加州大学洛杉矶分校(University of California, Los Angeles)的一项全国性调查显示，在入校时认为自己不会换专业的学生中，20%的人在第一学年结束后选择了一门新专业。换专业可能会浪费你一两个学期的时间，尤其是当你选的新专业与你第一次选的专业无关的话。为了降低这种风险，亚利桑那州立大学(Arizona State University)、佐治亚州立大学(Georgia State University)以及布朗克斯区的莱曼学院(Lehman College)等几所大学创立了“元专业”(meta-majors)，也就是一个更大的学术门类下的数个专业组合。“我们已经不再试图让学生们在入学时选专业，”佐治亚州立大学负责招生管理和学生成功的副教务长兼副校长蒂莫西·里尼克(Timothy Renick)说。取而代之的是所有新生都从七个元专业中选择一个专业，它们代表着更大的学术和工作领域，比如商业、教育和STEM。第一学期，学生们聚集在学习社区里，在这个元专业范围内选择一组普遍教育课程。这样的课程设计是为了让学生们了解该领域不同专业之间的差异。“商业元专业的学生可以了解金融、会计、管理和营销的区别，这样他们就可以在知情的前提下选择自己的专业，”里尼克博士说。他们通常会在第一学年结束后选择专业。误解六：你需要一个专业。印第安纳大学(Indiana University)和州立埃弗格林学院(Evergreen State College)等大学允许学生无视正式的专业列表，设计自己的学习课程。时报的纵横字谜编辑威尔·肖茨(Will Shortz)在印第安纳大学设计了自己的课程——谜语学。“专业是人为设置的，具有限制性，”麻省理工学院(Massachusetts Institute of Technology)的系主任克里斯汀·奥尔蒂斯(Christine Ortiz)说。她目前选择暂时离职去设计一所新的非赢利大学，它将不设专业，也没有课堂或教室。“专业是从大学的学术架构中衍生出来的，与经典学科相关联。没必要受这种束缚。它们没有考虑到那些跨学科的新兴领域。”专业往往滞后于职场的变化。难怪只有不到三分之一的大学毕业生从事的是与自己的专业相关的工作。天普大学的韦伯表示，根据当前的工作需求选专业是有风险的，尤其是如果这种职业受到自动化威胁的话。“我反对主修会计，”他说，“以及任何可以通过电脑编程取代的学科。”本文最初发表于2017年11月3日。Jeffrey J.

“一旦首席执行官们看到文科毕业生有用，”安德斯说，“他们就会觉得自己需要更多此类人才。”

误解五：尽早选择专业很重要。

为什么要钻到一个领域里，而不是先体验完大学提供的各式课程，比如出国学习、俱乐部活动，或者一门出人意料的选修课？

加州大学洛杉矶分校(University of California, Los Angeles)的一项全国性调查显示，在入校时认为自己不会换专业的学生中，20%的人在第一学年结束后选择了一门新专业。

换专业可能会浪费你一两个学期的时间，尤其是当你选的新专业与你第一次选的专业无关的话。为了降低这种风险，亚利桑那州立大学(Arizona State University)、佐治亚州立大学(Georgia State University)以及布朗克斯区的莱曼学院(Lehman College)等几所大学创立了“元专业”(meta-majors)，也就是一个更大的学术门类下的数个专业组合。

“我们已经不再试图让学生们在入学时选专业，”佐治亚州立大学负责招生管理和学生成功的副教务长兼副校长蒂莫西·里尼克(Timothy Renick)说。

取而代之的是所有新生都从七个元专业中选择一个专业，它们代表着更大的学术和工作领域，比如商业、教育和STEM。第一学期，学生们聚集在学习社区里，在这个元专业范围内选择一组普遍教育课程。这样的课程设计是为了让学生们了解该领域不同专业之间的差异。

“商业元专业的学生可以了解金融、会计、管理和营销的区别，这样他们就可以在知情的前提下选择自己的专业，”里尼克博士说。他们通常会在第一学年结束后选择专业。

误解六：你需要一个专业。

印第安纳大学(Indiana University)和州立埃弗格林学院(Evergreen State College)等大学允许学生无视正式的专业列表，设计自己的学习课程。时报的纵横字谜编辑威尔·肖茨(Will Shortz)在印第安纳大学设计了自己的课程——谜语学。

“专业是人为设置的，具有限制性，”麻省理工学院(Massachusetts Institute of Technology)的系主任克里斯汀·奥尔蒂斯(Christine Ortiz)说。她目前选择暂时离职去设计一所新的非赢利大学，它将不设专业，也没有课堂或教室。

“专业是从大学的学术架构中衍生出来的，与经典学科相关联。没必要受这种束缚。它们没有考虑到那些跨学科的新兴领域。”

专业往往滞后于职场的变化。难怪只有不到三分之一的大学毕业生从事的是与自己的专业相关的工作。天普大学的韦伯表示，根据当前的工作需求选专业是有风险的，尤其是如果这种职业受到自动化威胁的话。

“我反对主修会计，”他说，“以及任何可以通过电脑编程取代的学科。”

Implicit in Avedon’s version was the persistent threat to our existence, something the Cuban missile crisis had brought that much closer two years before “Nothing Personal” was published.
Avedon’s mother was furious and summoned the doorman upstairs to apologize to young Baldwin for the insult.","Baldwin’s essay begins with a withering description of the television ads he is forced to endure while watching the news — ads that aim to sanitize, brighten, straighten, tame and tweak the skin, hair, teeth and bodies of viewers into an impossible standard of perfection that positions the enemy to be, well, nature itself.

The portraits in “Nothing Personal” present a stark yet authentic counterpoint to the American image of eternal youth and anodyne good cheer. The book’s most resonant chords hover at a frequency detected in the balance of Avedon’s austere minimalism and Baldwin’s mournful jeremiad.

Only one portrait in “Nothing Personal” bears a date: “Maj. Claude Eatherly, Pilot at Hiroshima, August 6, 1945.” It refers not to when the photograph was made but to when Major Eatherly flew weather reconnaissance over Hiroshima and then gave the O.K. to drop the first atomic bomb, code-named “Little Boy.” Avedon first contacted Eatherly to photograph him in early 1963. “For a long, long time I have felt a connection with you, as have my wife and many of my friends,” Avedon wrote to him in Galveston, Tex., “because what happened to you is almost like a metaphor of what many Americans feel has happened to them.” Avedon flew to Galveston to make his tightly cropped portrait of Eatherly, brow furrowed and hand cupped over his eye as if to scrutinize the distant horizon.

In a series of museum talks, Colin Westerbeck, the eminent photography historian, argued that Major Eatherly is the central portrait in “Nothing Personal,” perhaps even in Avedon’s entire career. He pointed out the absence of shadow and the blown-out background in Avedon’s portraiture that left “every wrinkle, stubble, wen and nervous tick” on his subjects faces strikingly visible. “When that bank of strobes went off in Avedon’s studio — pfoom! — subjects must have felt as if they’d been caught in an atomic bomb blast,” Mr. Westerbeck said.

That “bomb blast” became the signature style with which Avedon went on to create many series of photographs, including “The Family,” 69 portraits of the most powerful and influential Americans in 1976, published in Rolling Stone for the country’s bicentennial. His 1985 book, “In the American West,” consists of portraits of anonymous workers, drifters, cowboys and random citizens made throughout the Western United States over five years, a contrast to the pantheon of accomplishment and celebrity that characterized most of Avedon’s portraiture.

In conceiving “Nothing Personal,” Avedon might have had in mind a dialogue with “The Americans,” by Robert Frank, published five years earlier — an artist’s book that struck a sober note about the story America told itself versus the realities of daily life for its citizens. At the time, “The Americans” was little known outside of New York art circles, but the book had a profound influence on photographers — including Avedon — and on the direction of photography itself. While Mr. Frank had traveled across the country to capture happened-upon moments in ordinary life, Avedon’s idiom was the portrait, with which he was equally intent on telling a deeper truth about America. Implicit in Avedon’s version was the persistent threat to our existence, something the Cuban missile crisis had brought that much closer two years before “Nothing Personal” was published. At the time, Avedon considered the portraits in the book to be “some of my very best work.”

Yet, to his surprise and chagrin, the public reaction was swift and hostile. Writing in The New York Review of Books, Robert Brustein lashed out at the book’s extravagant “snow-white covers with sterling silver titles” before excoriating the effort in his critique. (It predated by six years Tom Wolfe’s incendiary 1970 essay, “Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny’s,” in New York magazine — a savage takedown of New York’s intellectual circle of “limousine liberals” as conspicuous hypocrites.) “‘Nothing Personal’ pretends to be a ruthless indictment of contemporary America,” Brustein wrote, “but the people likely to buy this extravagant volume are the subscribers to fashion magazines, while the moralistic authors of the work are themselves pretty fashionable, affluent, and chic.”

Truman Capote came to Avedon’s defense in a letter to the editors published the following month: “Would he rather it was printed on paper-toweling?” Capote asked. “Brustein accuses Avedon of distorting reality. But can one say what is reality in art? — ‘An artist,’ to repeat Picasso, ‘paints not what he sees, but what he thinks about what he sees.’ This applies to photography — provided the photographer is an artist, and Avedon is.”

The year before “Nothing Personal” was published, Avedon had traveled to the South to photograph leaders of the civil rights movement, among them Martin Luther King Jr., as well as those who staunchly opposed it, such as Gov. George Wallace, of Alabama. When he returned to New York, he opened his studio to photographers from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (S.N.C.C.) to train them to shoot rallies and sit-ins in a photojournalistic style that the mainstream press would publish. He convinced Marty Forscher, the owner of Professional Camera Repair Service, to donate 75 cameras and a supply of film to the S.N.C.C. for three years. In 1965, Visual Arts Gallery, where Avedon was a board member, mounted a show of S.N.C.C. photographers’ work.

At DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, Avedon, who was Jewish, and Baldwin, who was African-American, were editors of “The Magpie,” the school’s literary magazine. They conceived a project with text and photographs called “Harlem Doorways” that never fully got off the ground. In later years, Avedon recounted the time as students when Baldwin came to visit him at home on East 86th Street, and the doorman made him use the service elevator. Avedon’s mother was furious and summoned the doorman upstairs to apologize to young Baldwin for the insult.

Can Avedon’s illustrious image coexist with evidence of his social conscience? It is found throughout his work and in the causes he championed, both publicly and privately. In 1955, he photographed Marian Anderson, who was performing in Verdi’s “Un Ballo in Maschera,” the first African-American soloist to sing on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera. In the portrait, her mouth is rounded into an oval so expressive that you can almost hear her voice — an unusual feat of visual onomatopoeia. The portrait ran in Harper’s Bazaar and Avedon considered its publication his own small stand against racial discrimination.

In 1959, when Avedon first photographed China Machado, a Chinese-born, Portuguese-American fashion model — encouraged by Diana Vreeland, the fashion editor of Bazaar — the magazine’s publisher said: “Listen, we can’t publish these pictures. The girl is not white.” Avedon was so angry that he threatened to leave Bazaar.

Yet the hard-charging first movement, “Mercury,” was more than capable of standing on its own as a sizzling orchestral piece. Its references to vintage big-band jazz were refracted through some piercing harmonies. And the writing for brass instruments often merged seamlessly with buzzing, noisy motifs from the composer’s “sampling keyboard,” a vivid instrument of her own design, similarly prominent in some of her earlier work.

By the narrator’s interruptions during the following movement — a witty modernization of a crooner-and-orchestra number — the transitions came across as forced and a touch repetitive. But this early clunkiness abated as soon as Ms. Gosfield’s music was allowed to merge with the dramatic passages for Ms. Weaver’s narrator and the various “outdoor” characters.

One ideal blend came during the opera’s most memorable aria, sung by the character Mrs. Martinez — a witness to the panic outside the hall. The mezzo-soprano Suzanna Guzmán performed the song at one of the raid siren locations, accompanied by pizzicato bass and a lyrically swooning violin stationed nearby. The music was relayed to the crowd in Disney Hall as Mr. Sharon’s staging there brought a visualization of the alien (dubbed La Sirena in the libretto, and sung by Hila Plitmann) being described by Mrs. Martinez. The collapse of physical distance was simple in design, perhaps, but stunning in execution.

These dizzying shifts in narrative space helped the opera seem like more than just a collection of clever gestures. Mr. Sharon wrote in a program note that “there is no privileged perspective” from which to view the production. But at critical moments, it’s obviously hard for audience members not to wonder about which position confers the best possible view. Those unavoidable considerations, in turn, pull the opera away from the comparatively well-trod “fake news” conceit, and toward a poetic way of exploring how different communities might absorb the same developing news story from different vantages and through different media.",Review: A ‘Fake News’ Opera on the Streets of Los Angeles,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/arts/music/review-war-worlds-los-angeles-philharmonic.html

Immigration restriction would be a policy that is tainted by Trump failure, but the fact is pure Trumpism is D.O.A.
If Trump falls, is it Trump the realist who falls or Trump the “Jacksonian” hawk?
Still, at some point a new synthesis needs a bold politician or politicians to actually champion it, the way Trump himself sort of did.
They’re closer to Trumpism or Bannonism or whatever on domestic policy, but not on foreign policy.","Douthat: I agree that he’s raised those questions, Dan, but he did that during the campaign, too. In some sense people assume that campaigns pose questions and that administrations supply answers. And at the very least, one answer this administration has supplied is that personnel is policy, and that if you don’t have people standing by and ready to implement an agenda, it doesn’t matter what you campaigned on — you’ll get bog-standard pre-Trump Republicanism, whatever rhetorical gloss you put on it.

Olsen: That’s certainly true for the economic policy agenda. No one tasked with administering policy in any of those areas is supportive of a new approach. So they’re giving the president either small-government conservative options (like Mick Mulvaney at the Office of Management and Budget), business-G.O.P. choices or a hybrid of the two (almost everyone else). Immigration policy is the one exception, but that’s also the area where Trump’s ideas already overlapped with a significant Republican faction’s approach. I often imagine that Trump has these instincts and no one around him with knowledge wants to go there, so he gets options that don’t come close to matching what he campaigned on.

McCarthy: We’ve seen other candidates, even a Democratic president, champion a different kind of foreign policy — more restrained or at least less fixated on “exporting democracy” — in recent years. Two Republicans named Paul (Ron and Rand) advanced ideas in that vein, and Barack Obama was elected as a foreign-policy reformist. But their softer, more cerebral approaches didn’t shake up the way Washington thinks about the world nearly as much as Donald Trump has done. The “shambolic” quality of Trump is precisely what is opening up these questions in a way that posing them intellectually never seemed to do.

Douthat: So where do you see this shake-up happening most, Dan? Is it happening in think tanks and other institutions? Among the people Trump has appointed (to the extent he has appointed them) to staff the State Department and Defense Departments? It seemed like Obama did create a faction within the Democratic foreign policy establishment, or at least within his White House, that was committed to an Obama-ism defined in part by its resistance to hawkishness and interventionism. Is such a faction coming into being on the right outside the realist and paleocon periodicals?

McCarthy: It’s happening at every level. It’s significant that National Review has hired more foreign-policy realists or noninterventionists recently, such as my old American Conservative colleague Michael Brendan Dougherty. Among congressmen and think-tank types that I talk to in D.C., I find much more questioning about the purposes and instruments of United States foreign policy than I did before. Not all of that is because of Trump, but he’s accelerated it. As yet, though, there’s no single institution that really embodies the new questions, let alone systematic answers. American Affairs has broached them, but I find the foreign-policy views there less penetrating than the rest of the journal.

Douthat: And Henry, from your more pessimistic perspective, are any Trumpist or populist ideas gaining traction within the G.O.P. but outside the White House? It seems to me that many of the ideas for a more middle-class agenda that you and I share already have a lot of support within the conservative commentariat. But that’s been true for a while now, really since the Tea Party wave ebbed. What’s been missing is a sense among Republican politicians that these proposals — even something with as much support as a larger child-tax credit — should be the center of their agenda rather than just window dressing for the usual upper-bracket or business tax cuts. On the evidence of the new tax legislation, that’s still true — but does it have to be?

Olsen: The G.O.P. remains intellectually wedded to dying dogma. The congressional party really wants to do nothing other than cut taxes for businesspeople and the top bracket based on what can only be called religious devotion to supply-side theory. I do not think they represent their voters, and Trump’s nomination is proof of that. I think it will take a big defeat, though, before mainstream Republican pols start to realize the old ways aren’t politically sustainable. Just the sort of defeat that an inept reaction to last week’s election thrashing would create — and, boy, it sure looks like the first reaction might be exactly that!

Douthat: And yet in Steve Bannon, you have someone with real prominence who keeps saying that the party needs to change in something like the direction that you advocate — who talks about building a “workers’ party,” ditching libertarianism and even doing outreach to minority voters with economic-nationalist themes. But then when it comes to the specifics of his strategy, Bannon always seems more inclined toward seeking out racialized cultural fights, or linking himself to substance-free resentment vehicles like Roy Moore, than toward pursuing the economic-policy shift he’s officially in favor of accomplishing. What do you think of the frequent liberal argument that this is a problem inherent to right-wing populism — that the lurches toward race-baiting are inescapable, that the effort to build a pan-ethnic conservative populism is foredoomed?

Olsen: We have to remember that Bannon is really a political newbie, and one who doesn’t like or really “get” the Republican Party to begin with. So he has been very ineffective inside or outside at promoting a positive agenda that can work within the existing G.O.P. His primary challenge strategy is basically one that creates an alliance with the Tea Party groups but ignores the real political differences populists ought to have with them. So he will be forced to either avoid those differences in the candidates he backs, which means they will campaign only on immigration and Muslim terrorism, or he’ll let them go whole Tea Party, or they’ll just attack Mitch McConnell and “the establishment” on a contentless, personal campaign. None of those approaches will build real support for a workers’ party. A serious attempt to do that requires a language of citizenship rather than resentment and a policy agenda beyond “let’s get the foreigners.” Unless and until he does that, Bannon will continue to be suspected of simply peddling racialized populism.

McCarthy: If I can add to Henry’s point, the line between right-wing media and politics has blurred to the point where we can’t tell if Bannon is a media figure aiming for ratings and clicks or a political figure aiming for policy and elections. Trump seemed like a media figure — and then he became president. I used to think Fox News and talk radio were Pied Pipers getting Republican voters to support Bush-type politicians who were actually a bad fit for those right-leaning voters. But now the right-wing populist media isn’t doing anyone’s bidding — and in fact, politicians may be helpless before it, for good or ill.

Douthat: But Bannon was, for a brief time, trying to actually be a political figure, trying to work inside the White House, inside the system, to advance Trumpism. And while he was there he didn’t do much to advance Henry’s economic-populist vision, or his own promise of a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill.

Olsen: Bannon’s economic populism really consists of two things: restrict trade and restrict immigration. That’s got loads of problems, not the last of which is that trade helps many workers, too. And it takes the business-conservative faction inside the G.O.P. head on without sufficient support from the broader Tea Party wing, at least on trade. So he was always going to have a terrible time on that unless Trump was willing to tell aides who don’t agree with him to just do something specific that Trump probably doesn’t know enough to describe. The G.O.P. will become a workers’ party only when enough people within it see both the justice and the necessity of it becoming so — and that is still a ways off.

Douthat: But Bannon did fight a bunch of battles on your territory, Dan — taking the less interventionist line on a range of issues, from Syria to Afghanistan to maybe North Korea. And he lost most of those battles, not to the ideological neoconservative types, but mostly just to Trump’s generals. So we’ve ended up with a foreign policy in which the generals are the custodians of the foreign policy status quo, right?

McCarthy: You’re right that Bannon is serious about policy, Ross, in his way. When it comes to blurring the line, I should emphasize I don’t mean that Bannonism is “fake politics.” It’s real, but it’s radically different from the politics we’re used to. It’s a new hybrid: a media-political entity. Democrats thought that Ronald Reagan was such a thing, but this time it’s come true. As for the generals, they’re not advancing a grand ideological program in foreign policy, although they may be loyal to the ghost of one simply by force of inertia. They’re keeping up a degree of surface continuity, but the foundations of our policy have been called into question. You’re right that that’s not enough, but it’s where deep change has to start.

Douthat: O.K. — but then who follows it through? Trump is president, we assume, for another three years, and then he (presumably) will run for re-election. As long as he’s bestriding the Republican world, it seems that no G.O.P. politician is going to emerge as a clear champion of the next Republicanism, whatever it might be. Or maybe that’s wrong. But it seems to me that he has only a few figures right now who are even would-be heirs — Tom Cotton certainly (whose foreign policy views I suspect you strongly dislike, Dan) and maybe even Ivanka Trump, depending on her ambitions, but beyond them nobody obvious at all.

Olsen: True, but it takes only one to start something. Fear, and a lack of policy-specific work in a host of specific areas, are the major things holding back the next iteration of conservatism, and fear is by far the largest. Once pols start taking the leap, however, and see they get cheers from voters, the numbers will start to swell. The fact is there are very few Republican voters who really care about the issues the party’s donors and the Wall Street Journal editorial board are pushing. Had any establishment Republican — say, Scott Walker or John Kasich — been willing to explore these themes, they would have pre-empted Trump and the rest of the field. There is a large market for a conservative-populist party, which is exactly what Reagan tried to create during his lifetime.

McCarthy: What Trump has done is to re-politicize basic questions of policy, including foreign policy, that for a long time had been the domain of a narrow range of expert opinion. When it comes to who follows through, I don’t think we should be looking for a single figure, we should be looking rather for a national discussion, a political discussion, throughout our institutions. There’s no blueprint, as some of my realist friends in the academy sometimes seem to believe, that can be smoothly applied to create a new foreign policy. There has to be political give and take — ”political” in the broad sense, in the media as well as in Congress, and among the public. Once Trump no longer personally bestrides the Republican scene, there will be a whole host of squirming and wriggling new mutations evolving their way out of the new environment — I just couldn’t guess what’ll they look like when they’ve all grown up.

Douthat: But do you worry at all, Dan (and this goes for you too, Henry), that if Trump is perceived as a crashing failure — or for that matter if he’s somehow ejected from office — that the ideas that you think he’s tacitly championed will be seen as inherently tainted and discredited as well, even or especially among the people who might otherwise be interested in taking them up, in having the kind of conversation you envision?

I share a lot of your views, I think, when it comes to the intellectual bankruptcy and persistent failure of the Western elite. But I also don’t underestimate that elite’s capacity to retain a hold on power when their critics are self-marginalizing or self-destructive. And among my many concerns about Trump from the first was that he would discredit even the good ideas that I do think he’s elevated, both by associating them with darker tendencies (realism with xenophobia, populism with racism) and by associating them with simple incompetence.

Olsen: Yes, there is that risk, but in one sense the fact that Trump has really abandoned populist domestic policy helps to insulate that against his implosion. Someone who tackles trade in the way it should be, encouraging fair trade and providing real adjustment support for workers subject to global pressures, isn’t really engaging Trump. Anyone who says, “Let’s cut payroll taxes, not corporate taxes” is plowing new ground. And so on. Immigration restriction would be a policy that is tainted by Trump failure, but the fact is pure Trumpism is D.O.A. on that score, too. Immigration restriction will become law only as part of a larger deal that is much more like what Tom Cotton proposes than what Ann Coulter promotes.

McCarthy: In part I’m not worried about what you describe, Ross, precisely because Trumpism is so inchoate. If Trump falls, is it Trump the realist who falls or Trump the “Jacksonian” hawk? But more important, politics should carry precisely these risks. It’s not that you want to be indifferent to your associations, but ultimately you can’t think you’ll curry favor with everyone and offend no one — that’s an anti-political ideal.

Douthat: Yes, and I do think the problems in the West run deep enough that Trumpism’s association with Trump, even if he’s seen as catastrophic, will not prevent these ideas from returning to the surface in some form.

McCarthy: We can also look at past examples: When Barry Goldwater was blown out in 1964, pundits were certain that conservatism (Goldwater-style) was permanently discredited. The joke was on them.

Olsen: Well, if you had asked that question about conservatism generally on Oct. 26, 1964, you would have had to say no. But then Reagan gave his “A Time for Choosing” speech on Oct. 27. American politics is very fluid and open, and it doesn’t take much or very long for someone to break through.

Douthat: Yes, I thought that if Trump had lost, there would have been room for someone smart to step up and play Reagan to his Goldwater — to give a big speech embracing some of his themes, promising to carry the cause forward, and so on, and claim the mantle away from the island-of-misfit-toys figures who attached themselves to Trump’s campaign. But Reagan, of course, was not an officeholder at the point when he gave his speech. So perhaps it would have needed to be someone out of politics, because Republican officeholders are so timorous.

But I am not at all convinced that having Trump be the president is helpful to the process of finding Trumpism’s Reagan (unless it turns out to the Rock), to that process, since it seems to me to be trapping the Republican politicians who should be arguing and experimenting on all these fronts. And I also feel that we’ve all been having these conversations, in our world of punditry, since the crackup of the Bush administration 10 years ago now, without having anyone except Trump really taking up the ideas that they imply.

McCarthy: The world of punditry has been having the conversation at some levels, and you’re plugged into them, Ross. But you never before had someone expressing the views that, say, Tucker Carlson now routinely does, in prime time on Fox. The conversation is becoming a public one in a way that it had not been before: It was very narrowly restricted to a few thinkers ahead of the curve.

Douthat: Fair enough! Still, at some point a new synthesis needs a bold politician or politicians to actually champion it, the way Trump himself sort of did. We journalists have described the world of conservatism, but the point is to change it. So at the risk of trying too hard to pin you guys down: Is there any right-of-center political figure, now on the American scene, who gives you hope for the G.O.P. after Trump? (I’ll offer my own non-answer after yours.)

McCarthy: There are plenty of Republicans who are smart and principled and in some respects forward-thinking, but who nonetheless seem to be pre-Trump figures — I have in mind Mike Lee and Rand Paul in particular. Whether they become more or less salient post-Trump is something I’m interested to see. My guess is that the really salient figures will be newer ones who aren’t yet on my radar.

Olsen: The conservative-populist alliance is increasingly becoming obviously the only way forward for non-Social Democrats who don’t want to become catchall centrists like Emmanuel Macron or Justin Trudeau. It is the $1,000 bill lying on the ground waiting for someone to pick it up. Eventually, someone will. I think Cotton is farthest along in pursuing it. Nikki Haley is more hawkish than Dan will like, but she would be very well positioned to take up that mantle if she were to leave the United Nations after 2018 and become more of an “all purpose” political figure. We also need more pundits to show some courage, too. Conservatism itself needs to be redefined, and you can’t create a revolution of the heart and the mind simply by adding a couple of tweaks here and there. That’s triangulation, and triangulation always disappoints.

McCarthy: I agree with Henry. Haley is not someone I’m fond of, and neither is Tom Cotton, but they’ve both acclimated themselves to the Trump era very effectively. I hope Republican realists can adapt as well. That will require them to be a bit more right-wing or populist in their mass appeal; for too long, they’ve been too wonkish and above-the-fray.

Douthat: My sense of things is that on the domestic front, you have a lot of different Republican figures who have sympathy for a genuinely populist agenda, ranging from Cotton to Marco Rubio to Mike Lee and others.

Olsen: Sympathy for some aspects, yes. But the populist mind-set starts, as it did with Reagan, with the average person as your touchstone. Rubio, like most Republicans, always talks about the striver, the person who wants to get ahead. His dad’s stint as a bartender, for example, seems to have value for him because it led to his being able to go to college, not because it was worthy in and of itself. That’s just not the way to think about economic populism, so it’s not too surprising to me that he remains distinctly orthodox in what he’s willing to do.

Douthat: Yes, I agree: Even now, figures like Cotton and Rubio are wary of going too far with it, of getting too far away from Reaganite orthodoxy. Neither of them are likely to (for instance) blow up the tax bill because it isn’t friendly enough to the middle class, the way Ted Cruz blew up various deals to build his brand. They’re not sure there’s enough support there for strong populism, as opposed to populist gestures.

Olsen: I regretfully agree that no one who seems sympathetic to populism is willing to blow up the tax bill, but they might not have to: They might be correctly figuring that Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, John McCain or Bob Corker will do it for them first.

Douthat: But then on foreign policy, the fact is that most of these proto-populists (with the exception of Lee) are also more hawkish, not less, than the Republican norm. They’re closer to Trumpism or Bannonism or whatever on domestic policy, but not on foreign policy. Which was what made Trump so distinctive: He combined ideas that go together in the minds of many voters, but not in the mind of Republican elites. I sometimes liked to say, before 2016, that the G.O.P. needed a synthesis of Rubio and Rand Paul, and that’s strangely part of what Trump’s campaign delivered. But I am much more skeptical than you, Dan, that this synthesis has gained ground since.

McCarthy: Ross, I don’t really agree that Rubio, for example, is close to Trump on domestic policy. And I think there are different senses of populist and distinctly different ideas of what a middle-class economic policy looks like. I’ve found it telling, actually, that the “other side” from me, who tend to be aligned with neoconservatives in foreign policy, talk a lot about tax-code tweaks and measures that might be intended to foster a “pro-family” welfare state, but they rarely if ever get into industrial policy. Whereas the populists I’m more sympathetic to in foreign policy, including Trump and Bannon and, in the classic case, Pat Buchanan, do seem interested in trade and industry. Even “libertarian populists” like Ron Paul, interestingly enough, tend to make hay about the iniquities of Nafta while not, of course, favoring tariffs.

Douthat: Those are both fair points. I agree that Trump went much further than Rubio or any broader “reform conservatism” in questioning the foundations of economic policy. And certainly immigration is a big dividing line, and a place where someone like Cotton has separated himself from those would-be reforming Republicans who still back the Bush-era elite-Republican consensus. But at the same time the Rubio-Ivanka partnership on family policy is basically the only place where Trump’s campaign promises have had even a modest effect on Republican negotiations on Capitol Hill.

Any last words?

Olsen: Conservative-populism will only come about when a group of Republicans decide they want it. Anyone who seriously looks at popular opinion should realize that the business-Jeb approach is D.O.A. within the party and won’t gain enough millennial or minority voters in any event. Cruz-Flake-Paul-style conservatism is deader than Jacob Marley. Someone reading this exchange will see the logic of a conservative-populist alliance, just as an on-the-decline actor was reading Human Events and National Review back in the 1950s but had enough common sense to see how it could be blended with something else to really take off. Our time will come, and much sooner than most pundits think.

McCarthy: Your point about Capitol Hill is well taken, Ross, but then, that’s why Bannon is unleashing primary attacks against Republican incumbents. We still have a Bush-Republican Congress, and the next phase of the Trump insurgency, or the populist insurgency, will be to storm the House and Senate. I’ve said in other venues that in some ways the “revolution” was premature, it happened right at the top, at the presidential level, before lower levels of politics had been changed or any outside institutional support structure was in place. But you have to take what you get, and not imagine the world will play to your plans.

I memorized their walking patterns to and from office buildings, and tried to track them midday.

Just follow him down the hall as he goes to vote, makes his way to a policy lunch with his colleagues or leaves a committee hearing (where you have been standing by a back doorway waiting for him to emerge).

I have chased members of Congress down hallways in high heels, rain boots and, once, because a shoe fell off, sock-footed. As more news organizations send more reporters into the Capitol Hill fray, getting to lawmakers away from the swarm that envelops them as they emerge from the Senate subway can be more challenging.

Like my colleagues, I learned which elevator they preferred to use in their office buildings, and at what time and where on the Capitol campus they tended to eat breakfast. I memorized their walking patterns to and from office buildings, and tried to track them midday.

Some lawmakers, like Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, seem to enjoy the stalking, and are happy to talk to reporters in hallways at just about any hour of the day or night. Others, like Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, and Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, almost uniformly refuse to talk when approached, march straight ahead barking “No comment” or look up at a spot on the ceiling that suddenly seems fascinating.

Many simply repeat talking points honed in the aforementioned policy lunches. Others, like Mr. Corker and Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, speak quite candidly — and often eloquently — when unscripted. Some will speak only on a very limited number of topics, to a very specific set of reporters (sometimes home state writers, sometimes those whom they have known for years, sometimes only conservative or liberal media); others pretend to be talking on a cellphone when approached. This is quite transparent, and yet the technique lives on.

While most of our hallway pursuits are in the interest of Murphy Brown-like quote fulfillment, there are plenty of other types of reporting that can go on in halls, especially when a reporter gets a senator or House member alone.

Lawmakers will confirm rumors, provide tips and offer guidance as to what other people in Washington — White House officials among them — are up to. Many can unpack a policy goal, unravel the politics of a specific bill and tell you who said what in a meeting. Hallway interviews are also a very good, if painstaking, way to figure out how a bill that appears to be too close to call is going to turn out.

As I noted on Twitter in 2015 when I was trying to figure out whether a national security bill had the votes in the Senate to pass: “I have stalked Republicans like a crazy ex girlfriend for a week, and my best guess is there are 57 votes in the Senate for USA Freedom now.” 57 it was.

“I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay.
In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.
The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat.
“The humidity of Key West made a lot of things a little ripe, but the photos are beautiful,” Scott DeWolfe said.","It seems fitting that during Walker Evans’s one-month stay in Havana in 1933 he would befriend Ernest Hemingway. The two shared an appreciation of a spare style that would influence countless others in photography and literature. In fact, Evans entrusted Hemingway with a trove of original prints to ensure they would not be confiscated by the authorities who were violently suppressing popular outrage against the dictator Gerardo Machado.

Now, 46 of those vintage prints are being sold by DeWolfe and Wood Rare Books of Alfred, Me., and Michael Brown Rare Books of Philadelphia, and are featured in a catalog whose comprehensive introductory essay was written by Mr. Brown. The collection is owned by Benjamin Bruce, known as Dink. His father, Telly Otto Bruce, known as Toby, was Hemingway’s friend and factotum and had safeguarded the images for decades in Key West, Fla., where Hemingway had lived.

Evans had gone to Cuba to make pictures for “The Crime of Cuba,” a book by Carleton Beals that was a fierce critique of American adventurism. “The Beals book is an expose of our misgovernment in Cuba, and the disgraceful part we have played in her tragic history past and present, economic, social, political,” read the review in Kirkus. “Sins of omission perhaps even more than sins of commission. The story of Cuba is the story of tyranny-Spain, the United States, Wall Street, and now, closely linked with the immediate past, the dictatorship of Machado, which makes Mussolini look like a Sunday School picnic.”

Evans got a taste of that supercharged political climate in his earliest days there, according to Mr. Brown’s essay, where a bus ride could turn into a journey of intrigue as who-knows-who was tailing him as he tried to meet with opposition figures. At the same time, the city thrilled him.

“When you are still bewildered,” Evans wrote in his diary, “you notice more things, as in a drunk. I was drunk with a new city for days.”

That feeling became literal when he met Hemingway, likely through an introduction by one of Beals’s newspaper contacts on the island. “I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay. “Drinking every night. He was at loose ends … and he needed a drinking companion, and I filled that role for two weeks.”

Photo

But as the essay also noted, Hemingway’s prose style may have had an influence on Evans, whose vision had been influenced earlier by a stay in Paris, where he came to appreciate the work of Eugène Atget. The images — out of a total of 400 taken during his one-month sojourn, betray that influence in photos of facades and streets. Some of them show more isolated, intimate scenes in public, from a haggard looking country family to beggars. In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.

The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat. Once there, the images ended up in storage either behind, or next to, Sloppy Joe’s, the famous Key West saloon.

“The humidity of Key West made a lot of things a little ripe, but the photos are beautiful,” Scott DeWolfe said. “What is fascinating is I think Evans was printing these where he was able to. Unlike later prints, most of these are uncropped, and slightly different. One print has Evans’s thumbprint. It’s as close to a first generation print you could possibly find.”

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.
The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said.
Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq.
“One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.","A serpentine river gently cuts through a mountain plateau. Shepherds tend their flock while young men hunt wild game, fish along ancient tributaries or kayak over rapids. This pleated landscape of rolling hills and jagged mountains is most verdant in spring, when the junipers are full, the grass a vibrant emerald.

These quiet moments and images are not often associated with Iraq. But the Kurdish region, in the country’s northern reaches, is home to such reprieves. Beyond the oil fields of Taqtaq and Kirkuk, far east of Mosul and many miles north of Baghdad, the semiautonomous region often feels timeless and progressive, restive and at peace.

What the Vietnamese photographer Lam Duc-Hien first imagined of Iraq before traveling there on assignment were the usual media tropes from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq — tanks and violence, surges and refugees. Mr. Lam, who was working for nongovernment organizations and a French newspaper, said he had never heard of the Kurdish people, who by then were fleeing Saddam’s oppressive and violent Baath Party. But after he settled down in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a region he documented for more than two decades, he found the country to be vastly different than what he had expected.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.

Photo

Over the years he has lived and worked there, he often traveled with the peshmerga, the Kurdish military, while on duty and off. “When I spend time with them, we always go to the mountains,” he said. “For me, it is like coming back to the 19th-century, because we are fishing with Kalashnikovs. For me, it’s incredible.”

Often referred to as a people without a country, the Kurds have for many years sought refuge in the mountains that abut Turkey and Iran. “I focused specifically on different ethnic groups and different religions in Kurdistan,” he said. “It’s small place, but it is very diverse.”

The robust culture of daily Kurdish life is captured in Mr. Lam’s photographs, a collection that stretches from the 1990s through to the war against the Islamic State. The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said. “I spend more time with them than taking pictures of them.”

A child leans in for a kiss from his little companion beneath a tree in the village of Badawan; a group of women in traditional Kurdish dresses dance atop a mountain plateau; families gather on the first day of Eid al-Adha to break the Ramadan feast at the grave of a loved one. “Each time I get back here,” Mr. Lam said, “I feel like I have a link with the people.”

Photo

Though Mr. Lam’s images sometimes show refugees and internally-displaced persons living in camps within the Kurdish region, he often shied away from the violence that has wracked the region and nearly divided the country, choosing instead to focus on the vitality of the people, not their blemishes.

Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq. He has heard whispers of secession since 1991. “One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.

But that dream has become a nightmare for many following an independence referendum in September. Disputed areas controlled by Kurdish forces were reclaimed by the Iraqi army. Flights were suspended to and from the region. A number of Kurds have since been killed or maimed in clashes with federal forces.

Photo

The recent infighting reminded Mr. Lam of a time when, during travels in the areas outside the Kurdish region, he lost that sense of fellowship — and safety — he had felt among the Kurdish people. After two bombs exploded in Baghdad’s Sadr City in 2013, with corpses littering the streets as he worked, Mr. Lam reluctantly fled the country.

“When you get involved with the Kurdish soul or friendship,” Mr. Lam said, “it’s very difficult to get out.”

He returned to Erbil soon after.

Mr. Cordery’s big boss figure may insist that it’s the message, not the medium, that ultimately prevails.","Mr. van Hove, the visionary international director who set Broadway shivering with his hyper-intense productions of Arthur Miller’s “A View From the Bridge” and “The Crucible,” is an artist who thinks with his gut. And in collaboration with the designer Jan Versweyveld, his longtime partner in aesthetic demolition, he has found vivid, viscera-tugging stage equivalents for the anger and displacement that infused a wild-eyed movie now regarded by many as prophecy.

That’s the cinematic satire that took home a clutch of Oscars in 1977 for telling Americans that their souls were being cannibalized by big television and the bigger corporations behind it. Directed with high bombast by Sidney Lumet, with a fulminating script by Paddy Chayefsky, “Network” tapped into the populist rage of a post-Nixon society, suspicious of all authority and stressed to the end of its tether.

It seems safe to say that such emotions are very much with us again, if they ever really went away. And when it’s in sensory attack mode (as opposed to podium lecture mode), this revamped “Network,” piously adapted from Chayefsky’s screenplay by Lee Hall, feels as pertinent to our time as it did to its own.

True, the monster television that Chayefsky condemned, in which minds were numbed and massaged through a central household set, looks kind of puny these days. Most homes are now filled with multiple screens, which record and transmit as well as receive images, turning daily existence into one big reality show.

But without resorting to obvious technological anachronisms, Mr. van Hove and Mr. Versweyveld have created a world of invasive lenses that scramble the lines between public and private, between thought and deed. It’s not just what happens on sound stages that’s magnified into splintered simulcast images. (Tal Yarden is the feverishly imaginative video designer.)

Photo

What happens behind the scenes is also captured, flattened and projected. That includes activities in broadcast control rooms, offices, bedrooms, boardrooms and even a restaurant where a pair of adulterous lovers conduct a cool quickie in full view of their fellow diners.

Those voyeurs at the next table, by the way, could well be you, as this production offers ticket buyers the option of dining onstage during the performance. Such inclusiveness is just another way of reminding us that we’re all complicit in this landscape of nonstop surveillance. (The same notion is underscored, more predictably, when a TV warm-up man tries to work the audience into a rabid froth.)

As Beale, the aging anchorman whose onscreen nervous breakdown turns him into a ratings sensation (played on screen by Peter Finch), Mr. Cranston (“Breaking Bad” on television, “All the Way” on Broadway) is the perfect stark raving center for this meticulously calibrated mayhem.

From the first words Beale utters, he projects a lifetime of assumed gravitas now shading into burnout. When he’s reborn as an evangelist of the airwaves — urging his public to open their windows and scream they’re not going to take it anymore — he’s the avenging phoenix that would inevitably rise from such ashes.

Watching him romancing the cameras, and seeing him transformed into an army of simulcast selves, is one of this production’s great, disorienting pleasures. If only he didn’t have to sermonize so much.

I know, I know. Beale’s jeremiads are what make him a star. But like the movie, this “Network” often eclipses character with its bloviating didacticism. And whenever there’s a big speech to be made — by Beale, or his honorable best friend, Max Schumacher (Douglas Henshall), or the show’s various embodiments of institutional evil — the production slows down and e-nun-ci-ates with organ music (really) as underscoring.

There is a large supporting cast, but as individuals they don’t register very convincingly. Mr. Henshall is just fine as a weary producer of fraying integrity who falls for a beautiful young co-worker, Diana Christensen, who is (poor thing) television incarnate.

She is played by Michelle Dockery, a fine actress of stage (“Pygmalion”) and television (“Downton Abbey”). But her generically eager performance here pales next to memories of Faye Dunaway’s audaciously stylized onscreen interpretation.

Caroline Faber has the thankless role (and excruciating dialogue) of Schumacher’s betrayed wife. Tunji Kasim and Richard Cordery are serviceable as the hot and cold incarnations of bureaucratic monstrosity.

In an introduction to the script, Mr. Hall writes that there’s scarcely a word in it that isn’t Chayefsky’s. I do wish he’d been less reverent, since many of those words now sound tin-eared and melodramatic. (I found myself thinking that the show might have been better if it had been performed in Dutch by Mr. van Hove’s Toneelgroep Amsterdam troupe.)

It’s when all the technological bells and whistles are operating that this “Network” thrills, even as it agonizes. Mr. Cordery’s big boss figure may insist that it’s the message, not the medium, that ultimately prevails. But in this case, stagecraft nearly always trumps script in translating a fabled movie from the past into a palpable, searing present.","Review: ‘Network’ With Bryan Cranston Is Convulsive, Immersive and Still Mad as Hell",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/theater/network-review-bryan-cranston-national-theater.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The oppressively hot afternoons in the Delta and the cool, quiet country nights of the rural woodlands inspired many of the greatest American storytellers, including William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty and Shelby Foote, and the blues musicians Robert Johnson and Son House.

This year, to honor the bicentennial of Mississippi’s statehood, residents throughout the state are following that tradition, telling the stories of their own communities with photographs employing the 21st-century technology of smartphones. The project, “Celebrating Storytellers,” was created by Chandler Griffin and Alison Fast, partners in Blue Magnolia Films and Barefoot Workshops, and will culminate next month with an exhibit of 200 five-foot-wide images in storefront windows in Jackson, Miss. Similar exhibits have already been held in five other cities.

“We didn’t want to just have big parties for the bicentennial with nothing that’s lasting afterwards,” Mr. Griffin said. “We really wanted to engage with communities. We wanted to go from town to town, and create spaces where people could have conversation about their community and what revitalization means.”

He and Ms. Fast went to a dozen towns and cities in Mississippi asking community leaders to help identify people who understood the fabric of their communities and invited them to a free, weeklong workshop and to begin documenting where they live with iPhones. The stories were chosen by the participants, who received guidance from the workshop team that included Aaron Phillips, a photographer who started out as a student at the Barefoot Workshops, and Natalie Irby, the executive producer.

There will be 100 participants in all ranging in age from 14 to 91.

In Mound Bayou, a small economically-depressed Delta city that was founded by former slaves in 1887, Myrna Smith-Thompson documented the rundown home of Isaiah Montgomery, a former slave of Jefferson Davis, who helped found the community. Ms. Smith-Thompson, who was born and raised in Mound Bayou, leads the Knights of Tabor, a benevolent community organization that is restoring local historic sites. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather led the organization before her.

“It’s not just a house,” she wrote for the project. “It’s the home of a man who in 1887 had a dream of turning a swampy piece of land filled with wild animals and mosquitoes and unimaginable obstacles into a negro self-governing community in Mississippi, for the people. He had the audacity to ask newly freed slaves to clear this land and make a nice place to live with all the amenities afforded to others. He had the nerve to attempt to influence free slaves to become self sufficient to create a safe haven for blacks amidst a climate of fear and hostility.”

At the start of the project last year, the emphasis was on Mississippi’s revitalization, not “race and reconciliation,” Mr. Griffin said. But the subject came up in every single workshop they held. In Clarksdale, an group of high school students from the mostly-black public school and an almost all-white private school made race the focus of their projects. Before meeting at the workshop they had rarely mixed, but they got together afterward for dinners and attended each other’s graduations. These experiences, Mr. Griffin said, “lead to change in communities.”

Mr. Griffin is a fifth-generation Mississippian, and attended Jackson Prep, a private institution that was started as a segregated school in 1970 in response to the federally mandated integration of the public schools. When he graduated in year 1994 he felt like he “had blinders on and was not exposed to anything.”

He attended art school in Savannah, Ga. and taught photography at the Maine Workshop in Rockport, M.E. before moving to New York City to “make his mark.” He rarely told anyone he was from Mississippi.

Photo

After a while, he realized that he didn’t really know Mississippi outside of where he grew up, so he returned to start Barefoot Workshops in Clarksdale and to learn more about his home.

“I fell in love with Mississippi in 2005 when I ran that first workshop, and ever since then I’ve just been trying to figure out ways to help tell the story and talk about the awesome things in Mississippi, as well as the problems, and look at the people working on solutions.”

Looking back at the experience, Ms. Smith-Thompson said the project taught her “to see things differently and how to tell stories with pictures” and made her “feel like a younger person.” For Christmas, she is buying a new iPhone to continue documenting her community.

“Storytelling helps us to share our different perspectives of our community with someone else, in a non-threatening way,” she explained. “The harsher the situation, the more impactful storytelling may be.”

MINERVA, N.Y. — The Hudson River is a small stream as it courses through pristine forests in the Adirondacks in northern New York, not far from its source on Mount Marcy, the state’s highest peak.

During World War II, the federal government built a 30-mile long railroad that sliced through this verdant patch, stretching from North Creek to Tahawus, a remote village about 125 miles north of Albany.

State officials opposed the railroad at the time because of its intrusion on the Adirondack Forest Preserve.

But the war effort superseded environmental concerns and the tracks were laid. The railroad was needed to carry ilmenite, a mineral used to make titanium for armored vehicles, from mines in Tahawus.

Today, a new battle is raging over plans to store up to 3,000 empty rail cars on the tracks, which were reopened five years ago after nearly a quarter century of remaining idle. More than 80 cars, some of which had been used to transport oil, began arriving a few weeks ago from the Midwest, to the consternation of environmental groups backed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.

“It is unsightly,’’ Mr. Cuomo told reporters recently in Glens Falls. “It is out of character with the Adirondacks. Nobody goes to the Adirondacks to look at old trains. They go there to look at the natural beauty.’’

Iowa Pacific Holdings, a rail company based in Chicago, bought the rail line with plans to haul rocks from abandoned mines that could be used for large-scale construction projects such as building roads. So far, however, the firm has not found a market for the venture.

Instead, Iowa Pacific has begun leasing rail space, about 100 cars per track mile, to rail companies that want to store cars that are not needed.

Ed Ellis, the president of Iowa Pacific, said leasing space raises money needed for track maintenance and repairs.

In addition to the old mining rail line, Iowa Pacific also operates a connecting railroad, the Saratoga and North Creek Railway, which runs 60 miles from Saratoga Springs to North Creek, home of the Gore Mountain ski resort. It began operating the railway, which is used primarily for sightseeing rides, in 2011 under a lease agreement with Warren County and the town of Corinth, which own the tracks on the scenic railroad.

Iowa Pacific, however, is responsible for maintaining the tracks from Saratoga to Tahawus, which Mr. Ellis said costs more than $750,000 per year. Leasing storage space on the tracks, Mr. Ellis said, is a way to generate revenue to allow the company to run the scenic railway while it continues to seek customers for the rocks from the mines.

“We’re patient investors,” he said. “This is not about quarterly earnings. This is about the long-term future of railroads.”

But critics suspect that the storage deal will prove anything but temporary and oppose parking the rail cars for aesthetic reasons and also over concerns that the cars could damage the environment if they start deteriorating.

“In essence, Iowa Pacific is trying to build this linear junkyard through the Adirondack Park,” said Peter Bauer, the executive director of Protect the Adirondacks, an environmental group. “It appears that Iowa Pacific will continue to bring in more oil tanker cars until the state steps in and halts this activity.”

Mr. Ellis said that all the rail cars had been inspected and thoroughly cleaned by their owners.

The state Department of Environmental Conservation and the Adirondack Park Agency, another state entity that regulates land use in the park, also oppose the storage arrangement. “We are seriously concerned about potential environmental impacts and are evaluating all legal and regulatory options at our disposal,’’ the agencies said in a joint statement.

But so far no action has been taken.

Most of the mining rail line crosses through Essex County, which borders Warren to the north. “The Adirondacks are beautiful and we want to keep it that way,” said Stephen R. McNally, the supervisor of the town of Minerva, which is in Essex.

Warren County officials say they are disappointed by the performance of the sightseeing railroad, which they say has not lived up to promises by Iowa Pacific that it would boost the local economy.

Iowa Pacific was supposed “to support economic development and business activity that creates jobs in our area,’’ said Ronald F. Conover, the chairman of the Warren County board of supervisors. “Storing rail cars doesn’t do that.”

Not everyone, however, is against the storage of rail cars.

“It’s a slippery slope,” said Thomas R. Scozzafava, the supervisor of the town of Moriah in Essex County. “Where does it stop? It’s like trying to tell a grocery store, we don’t like the shopping carts out front. What about car dealerships and marinas? Are we going to tell them they can’t store cars and boats? It’s a railroad, that’s what you do.”

Mr. Ellis downplayed the argument that the line of parked rail cars are unsightly, noting that they are over two miles from the nearest road. “The cars are really out of sight, out in the middle of nowhere, in a place that’s seldom seen,” he said.

Mr. Bauer is among a number of environmentalists who would prefer that the railroad tracks be torn up and turned into a recreational trail, something that has been done across the country in places where tracks have been largely abandoned or barely used.

For now, though, empty rail cars continue to arrive in the forest with more to come, a consequence in part of the rising global supply of oil for which there are no customers.

Iowa Pacific says it is simply trying to take advantage of what is happening in the oil market to finance its business.

“If there’s an opportunity to make money,’’ Mr. Ellis said, “you make money.”

Her discomfort was not just because she was extremely shy and suffered from manic-depression, but because she anticipated, rightly, the fury that would greet her scholarship.

But it was still a game changer. “It made me a feminist,” said Ms. Pogrebin, adding that her first book, “How to Make it in a Man’s World,” and “Sexual Politics,” were published the same year by the same publisher, Doubleday, and that the two women shared an editor, Betty Prashker.

“Betty gave me Kate’s manuscript,” Ms. Pogrebin said, “and after reading it, I wanted to toss mine in the trash. I felt like I was capitulating to the patriarchy, and Kate was arguing for revolution. ‘Sexual Politics’ was my epiphany.”

Ms. Steinem began her reflections by reading a note from Catharine A. MacKinnon, the feminist activist and legal scholar who argued persuasively that sexual harassment was a title IX issue, and who wrote the introduction to last year’s reprint of “Sexual Politics” by Columbia University Press. Quoting Ms. MacKinnon, Ms. Steinem declared that Ms. Millett “conceived the critique of sexuality as male-dominated from the bedroom to the boardroom to the potted plant.”

Then Ms. Steinem paused and looked out at the crowd. “Don’t you kind of wish we could read Kate on Harvey Weinstein?” she said, to loud applause and laughter from a group clearly familiar with the producer’s alleged emissions into a potted plant.

The speakers recalled Ms. Millett’s upstate New York farm, otherwise known as The Farm, which she conceived as a utopian women’s arts colony, and where bare-breasted women grew Christmas trees that Ms. Millett would sell on the Bowery each December. In the early days, said Linda Clarke, an old friend, neighbors would complain about the nudity and call the police, until Ms. Millett won them over.

On the farm, Ms. Clarke said, Ms. Millett was finally the president of her own university, a reference to Ms. Millett’s frustration at not being able to hold on to an academic post. (In 1968 she was fired from her teaching position at Barnard College for her role in the student protests there.)

The nine female speakers, including Yoko Ono, who spoke from a wheelchair, recalled Ms. Millett’s Dadaist artwork (chairs with human arms and legs; stools wearing shoes; giant vulvas) and her proud bohemianism — what Eleanor Pam, the president of the Veteran Feminists of America, called her reverse elitism.

“She was probably the only person in the world who believed that being evicted from the Bowery was a step down,” Ms. Pam said.

The actor Kathleen Turner was a stand-in for both Hillary Clinton and Robin Morgan, the author and activist. In her distinctive, throaty bass, Ms. Turner read a short letter from Mrs. Clinton, and a stirring recollection from Ms. Morgan. In one war story, Ms. Morgan described a party thrown in Ms. Millett’s Bowery loft to pay for the legal fees of women who had been arrested at a Miss America pageant protest in Atlantic City in 1968. So many people showed up, the floor buckled. As a result, most of the money raised that night went to shoring up the building, rather than to the lawyers it was destined for.

More seriously, Ms. Turner said, “A feminist generation is marching again, this time into shadow. Another generation will march into the sun.”

In between speeches, the folk singer and activist Holly Near led the audience in familiar protest anthems from back in the day, including “Bread and Roses,” from the poem about striking female mill workers, and Ms. Near’s own, “Singing for Our Lives,” which she wrote after Harvey Milk was murdered. Everyone seemed to know the words. Ms. Ono joined hands with Ms. Keir and Ms. Chesler.

The first fall auction of the season at Christie’s on Monday was solid, if low energy. There were several empty seats, and some bids had to be coaxed out from the room.

But the bidding briefly jolted to life on Vincent van Gogh’s vibrant 1889 landscape, “Laboureur dans un champ,” which jumped on one bid from $42 million to $55 million.

The painting eventually sold for $81.3 million with fees, just shy of setting a new auction high, not counting inflation, for the artist; the previous top price was $82.5 million in 1990, the zenith of the Impressionist art boom.

The Van Gogh, which depicts the view from the window of the artist’s room in the asylum at Saint-Rémy-de- Provence, was among the highlights of Monday’s Impressionist and modern sale, which totaled $479.3 million, the highest total in that category for the auction house in a decade. Of the 68 lots offered, 60 — or 88 percent — sold.

Among the other highly anticipated lots of the evening was Fernand Léger’s 1913 canvas from his “Contraste de formes” (Contrasts of forms) series, one of some 50 Cubist canvases produced by Léger in 1912-1914, which the MoMA website describes as “among the most defiantly abstract works yet seen.” Ambitiously valued at $65 million the painting sold Monday for $70.1 million with fees, a high for the artist.",Van Gogh Injects Excitement Into Otherwise Solid Auction at Christie’s,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/arts/christies-fall-auction-impressionist-modern-van-gogh.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

BMW offers a compact spare kit — including jack and wrench — for many of its X Series sport utility vehicles and for the 5 and 7 Series sedans.

The disappearance of the spare tire might be more than just an exercise in efficiency.","An increasingly popular alternative to spares is the so-called run-flat design, which most new BMW models use. Intended to make roadside tire changes unnecessary, this solution employs a reinforced tire sidewall that typically lets the driver continue for 50 miles at up to 50 miles an hour after air pressure is lost. But they can be more costly: It may be necessary to replace, rather than simply patch, a damaged tire, and replacements are typically priced $25 to $50 higher than a conventional design.

Another alternative is the self-sealing tire, an older solution reappearing in modern form on the battery-powered Chevrolet Bolt, where reduced weight translates to more miles per charge. Designed solely as an electric vehicle, the Bolt has no provision for carrying a spare. According to Michelin, which supplies the Bolt’s Energy Saver A/S Selfseal rubber, the extra cost of a self-sealing tire — which can continue down the road even with a nail in the tread — is about $33 compared with conventional tires of the same size.

But some models are losing the spare without the benefit of run-flat or self-sealing rubber, instead including conventional tires and a leak repair kit — packaged in an aerosol can or used in conjunction with a small air compressor powered by the car’s battery.

Such kits skim weight while skipping the tire, but have limited abilities to deal with any road hazard more serious than a nail hole in the tire’s tread section. A larger tear in the tire — something that can happen when modern low-profile tires meet a pothole — or damage to the sidewall or wheel rim will not be fixed by a leak kit. The sealants, which are usually one-time use devices, have a finite shelf life — usually from four to eight years, AAA said — and cost about $40 to replace.

Even if a leak sealant kit gets you back on the road in a hurry after a minor puncture, it could complicate a permanent repair. Affixing an internal patch after a sealant has been used requires a thorough cleanup of all the goo inside, said Tom Carter, technical communications director for Michelin.

For a car owner — and certainly renters who might not know what they are getting into — the best way to prevent an unpleasant middle-of-the-night surprise is to check for a spare and be sure that it holds air. If there’s a sealant kit instead, read the owner’s manual (which may be on a DVD or available on the car’s display screen) and learn how to use it.

In some cases, greater peace of mind is available from the automakers.

For instance, although mainstream versions of the 2017 Honda Civic come from the factory with space-saver spares, the Civic Si does not. A spare wheel kit, including a jack and tools, is available from Honda dealers as an accessory for the Civic Si at a suggested retail price of $254. The tire, which must be purchased separately, runs about $115 from sources like Tirerack.com.

BMW offers a compact spare kit — including jack and wrench — for many of its X Series sport utility vehicles and for the 5 and 7 Series sedans. In most cases, it’s a $150 option when ordering the car, though on some models with conventional tires it is free. On the sport utility models, the compact spare fits entirely within a compartment under the rear floor, but on the sedans it juts out too high, meaning the floor panel cannot lie flat.

Not surprisingly, independent online retailers have also emerged to fill the hole. Buyers should make sure to compare prices with the dealership and to determine that there is a storage spot in the car where the tire can be secured. As designers work to smooth airflow under the car for fuel-economy improvements, those compartments are going away, too.

The disappearance of the spare tire might be more than just an exercise in efficiency. It may be a sociological statement. A survey by AAA found that some 20 percent of drivers do not know how to change a flat tire, and with the rise of roadside assistance coverage for new cars, that number is unlikely to shrink.

The era of cars proudly displaying a spare tire mounted on the front fender or rear bumper — a standby of prewar classics — is long gone, and the tradition of suburban dads gathering to inspect a neighbor’s new purchase may have to undergo a major change.

Instead of crowding around the front end to see what’s under the hood, perhaps they’ll be checking the trunk to see if it’s got a spare.","Cars Lose the Spare Tire for a Leaner Ride, but It Could Cost You",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/business/spare-tires.html

Another 22 have been waiting more than 30 years. And wait times keep growing.

Recognizing the problem, Congress in August passed broad reforms to cut delays. President Trump quickly signed them into law, telling veterans gathered at the signing, “This is a big one.”

While veterans groups largely praised the move, critics said it would do little to help veterans already in the appeals system. That is true for Mr. Bey, who was recently told it would be at least another 14 months before he heard anything about his case.

“I hate to use a hackneyed expression, but they are rearranging the deck chairs and the ship is still sinking,” said John Wells, a retired Navy commander and lawyer who runs Military-Veterans Advocacy, a nonprofit.

The main cause of delays, according to the department, was a design flaw that fed appeals with simple errors into a legal system that was meant to rule on complex cases. That led to thousands of cases with issues as small as a typo clogging up the flow of cases to be processed.

“We tried to do everything in one stream and it couldn’t work efficiently,” said David McLenachen, who leads the department’s benefits appeals office.

The new law triages appeals into three streams: A fast stream — like the express lane at a supermarket — to correct simple errors; a medium stream, in which a more experienced department specialist reviews more complex issues at a local level; and a final stream where veterans can take cases to an independent board of appeals. The agency plans to hire hundreds of additional claims processors with the goal of clearing each case within four months.

But lawyers who represent veterans say the changes do not address the core problem: The department’s vast number of errors, which have generated hundreds of thousands of appeals. A 2017 report by the Government Accountability Office found nearly half of cases were plagued by mistakes and reached the Board of Veterans Appeals — the final authority for veterans benefits cases — only to be sent back for fixes.

Cases that have been sent back can sit for years before they are addressed, then sit again as they wait for the board to read the revisions.

Making a fair ruling on injuries of war is far from easy, and veterans advocates say some cases will inevitably take time to sort out. But as Mr. Bey’s case shows, even simple issues can languish, and recent changes by Congress have so far offered veterans like him no relief.

Mr. Bey was working with a crew scraping barnacles off buoys in Chesapeake Bay in 1977 when his ship suddenly listed to port, causing a shelf holding heavy equipment to tip. Mr. Bey braced himself against the equipment to protect crew members working below, and held it until others could help him. The next morning he turned to grab his duffel bag and collapsed in agony. “It was like a dentist’s drill, but in my back,” he recalled.

He spent four days in an Air Force hospital, military records show. They also reflect that during the five remaining years of his service, he was struck periodically by debilitating spasms.

But in 1983, when Mr. Bey submitted a claim to get free medical care and a small pension for his back from the Department of Veterans Affairs, the department sent back a letter saying it could find no evidence in his exit physical exam that showed the injury.

He appealed, asking that the department review his entire medical record. He was denied. He dug through the National Archives outside Washington, found records of his hospitalization, and submitted them. He was denied again. He got a civilian doctor to perform X-rays and write a letter documenting damage to his spine. He was denied again. He appealed to the Board of Veterans Appeals. His claim was denied.

Each denial was punctuated by months or years of delay as paperwork sat waiting. In the meantime, Mr. Bey worked as a researcher for an intellectual property law firm, got married and raised his children.

Because his claim had been denied, he was unable get medical care from a veterans hospital, and, he said, his back pain grew worse to the point that he was unable to work a full-time job.

“We see hundreds of cases like this,” said Bart Stichman, a lawyer and the joint executive director of National Veterans Legal Services Program, a nonprofit advocacy group. “One veteran with diabetes spent years trying to prove her case. She lost a foot. The V.A. finally granted the benefit, but by that time she’d lost her other foot.”

The veterans department said it was working to improve response time and reduce errors.

“The problem isn’t the process,” Mr. Bey said as he sifted through stacks of files showing agency errors in his case. “It’s that the quality of work is so bad. If people had done their job right, this would have been over in the Reagan administration.”

By 2016, Mr. Bey had exhausted all but his last appeal. He submitted the same evidence that had always led to a denial in the past, but, hoping to bolster his chances, sent it through the office of his senator, Bill Nelson of Florida.

Mr. McConnell’s pronouncement made it clear that the accounts were as good as proven in his eyes and increased the prospect that Mr. Moore would face a significant challenge to joining the Senate even if he prevails in the election on Dec. 12. A parade of new calls from Republican senators for Mr. Moore to bow out followed.

Expelling Mr. Moore could present an advantage to Senate Republicans since it could create a vacancy and set off another special election in Alabama, giving the party a chance to find a new candidate. The uproar over his candidacy is also providing Mr. McConnell and his allies with evidence that the effort to oust establishment Senate Republicans being led by Stephen K. Bannon, the former adviser to President Trump, could be disastrous if Mr. Moore is an example of who they intend to support.

But the fight over Mr. Moore could also elicit a harsh backlash from conservative activists aligned with Mr. Bannon and deepen the party split that is already looming as an obstacle in the 2018 midterm elections.

Republicans are also weighing the potential of a write-in campaign behind an alternative candidate. It worked for Senator Lisa Murkowski in Alaska in 2010, but such successes are exceedingly rare. A write-in campaign by a Republican could split the party vote and bolster the chances of the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor. Mr. Jones could also win outright, a result that could solve many thorny problems for Mr. McConnell but would leave Republicans with one less seat and a narrow 51-49 majority when they are already struggling.

Mr. McConnell does not appreciate such complications. When Mr. Craig was arrested and pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in the airport sting, Mr. McConnell set out to prevent him from even returning to the Capitol to avoid a spectacle. The leadership stripped Mr. Craig of his committee leadership positions and made clear that if he decided to return, he would face additional ethics scrutiny.

Mr. Craig quickly announced he would resign his Senate seat. He then reneged and decided to serve out his term, but the ethics committee admonished him for his behavior and he was treated as an outcast by many of his colleagues.

In the Packwood case, Mr. McConnell delivered findings on the Senate floor, describing his colleague’s “physical coercion” of women and “a habitual pattern of aggressive, blatantly sexual advances, mostly directed at members of his own staff or others whose livelihoods were connected in some way to his power and authority as a senator.” Republicans ultimately lost that seat after Mr. Packwood’s resignation.

“I don’t think there has ever been a leader with a more aggressive no-tolerance policy toward sex abuse allegations,” said Josh Holmes, a former top aide to Mr. McConnell who remains a close adviser. “In his mind, there is no political calculation to make when this kind of thing arises. It’s far more important to protect the integrity of the Senate than the partisan makeup of its membership.”

With that statement, about accounts of lecherous behavior and child molestation by the Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said words that thousands of victims of sexual harassment and assault have waited in vain to hear.

Mr. McConnell and a growing list of other Republicans have been pressing Mr. Moore to quit the race after four women — Leigh Corfman, Wendy Miller, Gloria Thacker Deason and Debbie Wesson Gibson — told The Washington Post that Mr. Moore had pursued them as teenagers when he was a prosecutor in his 30s. Ms. Corfman said that when she was 14, in his home, Mr. Moore undressed her to her underwear and placed her hand on his crotch. The molestation troubled her for years, she said. On Monday, a fifth woman, Beverly Young Nelson, said that when she was 16, Mr. Moore molested her in his car. The Post corroborated points of the first four women’s stories with friends and relatives, providing the kind of bulletproofing that women need when they accuse powerful men.

Mr. Moore’s accusers kept silent for years for fear of what’s happening now: their past relationships, family, friends, finances, political affiliations and every vowel and consonant of their stories being mined in a partisan effort to discredit them. The authors of the warped Pizzagate conspiracy fiction have revealed personal details about Ms. Corfman online. Breitbart, house organ of Steve Bannon’s solipsistic revolution, fruitlessly dispatched two “reporters” to Alabama to sift through the women’s lives for nuggets to shame them.

The Van Gogh, which depicts the view from the window of the artist’s room in the asylum at Saint-Rémy-de- Provence, was among the highlights of Monday’s Impressionist and modern sale, which totaled $479.3 million, the highest total in that category for the auction house in a decade. Of the 68 lots offered, 60 — or 88 percent — sold.

Back Story

The twice-a-year fashion weeks in New York, London, Milan and Paris have dominated the industry calendar for decades.

In recent years, however, new contenders have started jostling for attention, including Dubai, where Arab Fashion Week begins on Wednesday.

The five-day event is a predictably splashy affair, showcasing talent from the 22 countries in the Arab League. Plenty of emerging Western designers are also on the schedule, eager to cater to the valuable Middle Eastern client base.

Expect a broad mix of both Western-style ready-to-wear and modest clothing in the catwalk collections. As a growing global chorus of women demands attire in tune both with Islam and the societies around them, designers are responding with flowing printed tunics and colorful head scarves. Interestingly, designers from abroad are often the more conservative.

Modest fashion is becoming a commercial phenomenon. The global Muslim clothing market is forecast to be worth $368 billion by 2021, according to the latest Global Islamic Economy report.

With its blend of trends from around the world, Arab Fashion Week is playing a considerable role in reshaping perceptions of 21st-century Muslim identity in ways that go far beyond the veil.

President Trump’s recently concluded trip to Asia had the potential to advance important American security and economic interests. Played correctly, his ambitious five-country, 12-day trip could have steadied his administration’s rocky start in this vital region. Instead, it left the United States more isolated and in retreat, handing leadership of the newly christened “Indo-Pacific” to China on a silver platter.

The trip began with solid performances in Japan and Korea, where Mr. Trump’s relatively measured words left key allies reassured of the United States’ commitment to their security. The president largely shelved his belligerent trade rhetoric, called for allies to buy more American military hardware and reopened the door to diplomacy with North Korea. Weather curtailed his surprise trip to the Korean Demilitarized Zone, but that may have been a blessing, since hostile words might have prompted hostile action.

But in China, the wheels began to come off his diplomatic bus. The Chinese leadership played President Trump like a fiddle, catering to his insatiable ego and substituting pomp and circumstance for substance.

China always prefers to couch state visits in ceremony rather than compromise on policy. This approach seemed to suit President Trump just fine, as he welcomed a rote recitation of China’s longstanding rejection of a nuclear North Korea and failed to extract new concessions or promises. He also settled for the announcement of $250 billion in trade and investment agreements, many of which are nonbinding and, in the words of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, “pretty small.” Missing were firm deals to improve market access or reduce technology-sharing requirements for American companies seeking to do business in China.

Mr. Trump showered President Xi Jinping of China with embarrassingly fawning accolades, calling him “a very special man” and stressing that “my feeling towards you is an incredibly warm one.” He blamed his predecessors rather than China for our huge trade deficits and hailed Mr. Xi’s consolidation of authoritarian power. Such scenes of an American president kowtowing in China to a Chinese president sent chills down the spines of Asia experts and United States allies who have relied on America to balance and sometimes counter an increasingly assertive China. Their collective dismay was only heightened by Mr. Trump’s failure to mention publicly any concerns about the disputed South China Sea or even to insist that the American press be allowed to ask the leaders questions.

According to Mr. Tillerson, these stunning displays of Trumpian affection for Mr. Xi were complemented by more concrete discussions behind closed doors. With the notable exception of climate change, the administration wisely seems to have committed to continue cooperation with China in several key areas. But intensive diplomacy in the run-up to these critical leader-level meetings could have yielded real results to advance mutual interests and bypass the Chinese penchant for show over substance.

Tim Herrera: Thank you for chatting with me, Abby! Let’s start easy: What are a few benefits of counting calories?

Abby Langer: Counting calories does give you an overall picture of what you’re eating in a day, so that’s a good thing. It’s also helpful for people to understand relative calorie values. (Like that a burger is higher in calories than an apple.)

Counting calories can also be very motivating. I mean, I wanted that slice of gingerbread at Starbucks yesterday, but it was 400 calories … no way.

TH: Those are all really strong positives. So what are some of the downsides here?

AL: Well first of all, nobody really knows how many calories they really need. I mean, 2000 or 2200 is what everybody says an adult male needs, but what if you’re smaller than average? What if you’re more active?

Also, the calorie counts on packaging can actually be off by up to 20 percent and still be within FDA guidelines! Can you imagine? Your 200 calorie snack is now 240 calories or 180 calories.

And don’t forget that processed food is absorbed differently by the body than whole, uncooked food. So really, what I’m trying to say is this: If you think you know how many calories you need, and how many you’re truly getting, you’re probably incorrect. Isn’t that annoying?

(Not to mention the fact that people who are at risk for or who have a history of an eating disorder can be majorly triggered by counting anything.)

TH: Yeesh, that’s so many downsides. What are some alternative tracking methods you’d recommend if people want to track their eating habits?

AL: Writing down what you ate, when you ate it and how you felt — especially if you’re prone to emotional eating — is a great way to keep track of things without drilling it down into numbers. It can be a hassle, but food records can be really effective.

TH: I love food tracking apps, and I feel like they’re sort of a middle ground between a lot of what you’ve talked about. What are your thoughts on those kinds of apps?

AL: The issue with those is that they still count calories, so even if your intentions are good the calorie-count part can be irresistible for some people. And some apps also track activity and subtract calories burned by exercise from calories eaten, and that couldn’t be more wrong.

TH: Yes! They do do that. It sounds like you’re not a fan …

AL: It’s not how your body works. You can’t exercise off food like that! I believe you can only exercise off up to 30 percent of the calories you eat in one day, but with some apps it appears that you can negate your whole day of eating with a trip to the gym. Nope.

TH: So, O.K., despite the downsides, counting calories is still such an easy to way to track food intake. So if people are going to do it anyway (ahem), what’s the bottom line? What should we take away?

AL: I would try to remember to look for patterns versus taking every calorie literally. And remember: Never feel bad or guilty about overindulging every once in a while, even when it’s a scary thing to look at on your tracker. One crazy day of eating never a diet ruined.

“Those seats are designed to make the best possible use of the space,” an American spokesman, Josh Freed, said.
A spokesman for Spirit Airlines, Paul Berry, said the emphasis on pitch was an inaccurate way to assess today’s newer seat designs.
“While it’s only 28 inches in pitch, it actually feels like it’s about 30 inches,” he said.
One group, Flyers Rights, is petitioning the Federal Aviation Administration to set minimum dimensions for airline seat width and pitch.","While low-cost airlines like Spirit have narrowed the distance between rows of seats to as little as 28 inches, most of the big American airlines have kept the distance — what’s known in the business as seat pitch — at 30 inches. Anything less, the major airlines have found, pushes already beleaguered travelers to their limits.

This year, the news leaked that American Airlines was considering a cabin redesign that would leave a few rows in its new Boeing 737 Max fleet with just 29 inches of pitch, plans the carrier quickly dropped after a rash of complaints.

“We got a lot of pushback from our customers and, most notably, from our team members,” the airline’s chief executive, Doug Parker, told investors on a conference call in July. “While we could convince ourselves that that might be able to produce somewhat higher revenues on the aircraft, what it was doing to our perception with our team wasn’t worth it.”

The push to shrink the space between rows of seats comes as major carriers are squeezing 10 abreast in more long-haul jets, so that the middle section has four seats — and, by definition, two middle seats — rather than three.

But customers will be spared this experience on most flights within the United States, Mr. Aboulafia said, because there just isn’t enough space. “The good news is that pretty much every domestic flight you’re going to take is going to be in a 737 or A320 — no way can you do four-three,” he said.

Traditional airline seats were fashioned out of rigid aluminum frames, then wrapped in thick foam padding. But that approach, said Alex Pozzi, vice president for research and development in interior systems for Rockwell Collins, a manufacturer of aircraft seats, is no longer used, with the availability of more sophisticated, high-tech materials.

“We’ve been using a lot of advanced materials, a lot of composite materials, to allow the actual physical structure to get smaller,” he said. “We’ve also removed a lot of the hard points in the seat and gone to fabric suspension systems,” leading, he said, to seats more akin to ergonomic desk chairs.

“The less size that the seat structure itself takes up, the more space that’s left over for the passenger,” Mr. Pozzi said.

Or, as the case may be, for more passengers. “Over the last five years, as slimline seats become more common and were adopted by more airlines, airlines took the opportunity to basically take the space they were saving and, depending on the airline, most of the airlines took that space and added in an extra row or two,” said Jami Counter, vice president of TripAdvisor Flights, which owns the site SeatGuru.com. “The actual pitch would shrink, but theoretically, your leg room wouldn’t.”

“Now,” he added, “you’re cramming another person in there so you still have more people in that exact same space. It becomes a much more unpleasant flying experience.”

On American Airlines’ new 737s, which will be put into service beginning soon, seats have a minimum 30-inch pitch, although American says most seats have 31 inches. Seatback TV screens were eliminated and replaced with brackets that passengers can use to mount their own devices to watch video, and power sources to keep those devices running. The magazine holder is now closer to the top of the seatback to free up more knee room.

“Those seats are designed to make the best possible use of the space,” an American spokesman, Josh Freed, said.

Airlines contend that improved ergonomics and, in some cases, slightly wider seats make up for a tighter pitch. A spokesman for Spirit Airlines, Paul Berry, said the emphasis on pitch was an inaccurate way to assess today’s newer seat designs.

“If you just go by inches, it’s kind of an old measure. We’re kind of basing it on comfort level and the way we’ve engineered our seats,” he said. “While it’s only 28 inches in pitch, it actually feels like it’s about 30 inches,” he said.

But some consumer advocates say the issue goes beyond comfort. One group, Flyers Rights, is petitioning the Federal Aviation Administration to set minimum dimensions for airline seat width and pitch. The group won a round in its court battle with the F.A.A. in July, when a Federal District Court told the agency to address what it referred to as “the incredible shrinking airline seat.”

Paul Hudson, president of Flyers Rights, said the need for seat regulation is driven by safety concerns. Passengers have been getting taller and wider, even as airlines push for slimmer seats, but regulations still stipulate that planes have to be able to be evacuated in just a minute and a half.

“Obviously, if you’re squeezed into a very confined space, it’s going to be harder to get up and get out in an emergency,” Mr. Hudson said.

“The seats were originally designed for people, for men who averaged about 5 foot 10 inches and 170 pounds,” he said. “Right now, the average man is just under 200 pounds.”

The airline industry contends that further regulation is unnecessary. Carriers referred questions to the trade group Airlines for America, which responded with an emailed statement that read, in part, “All U.S. carriers meet or exceed federal safety standards and we continue to believe that there is no need for government to interfere.”

But some air travel professionals contend that advocates like Flyers Rights may have a point in arguing that tightly packed seats may be an impediment to evacuations.

“It won’t be necessarily a passenger comfort regulation, but more around safety,” Mr. Counter said.

Mr. Harteveldt agreed. “There may be a legitimate issue around safety,” he said. “That’s why we’re now starting to see this topic bubble up.”",Air Travelers Resisting the ‘Incredible Shrinking Airline Seat’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/business/airline-seat.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

But life in Villa Altagracia, D.R., had been difficult. Little work was available. Ms. De La Cruz took cleaning jobs whenever she could, and Mr. Castro had a small food company.

In 2009, Mr. Castro moved to Manhattan seeking a better life for his family. In 2014, during one of his infrequent visits home, the couple married in a civil ceremony. Days later, he brought Ashanty to New York. His wife and stepdaughter stayed behind as they waited for their visas to be processed.

Ashanty spoke to her mother daily by phone after her move, but that was no substitute for being together.

Even though they have reunited, it has sometimes been a struggle to bridge the gap and re-establish roles. On a recent evening, seated on a couch at Ashanty’s bilingual middle school for an interview, Ms. De La Cruz and her older daughter waited for Ashanty, who was running late. Unable to find them, Ashanty wandered the halls of the school, Salomé Ureña de Henriquez Intermediate School, which is affiliated with Children’s Aid, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.

Finally, she called her stepsister and joined them briefly, and then almost forgot to ask permission before leaving to go to the library to finish homework.

“It’s still difficult,” her mother said. “I say, ‘Listen to me,’ and she doesn’t.”

Hoping to reconnect with Ashanty, Ms. De La Cruz, 45, signed up for parenting classes provided through the school’s partnership with Children’s Aid. She has taken more classes there than almost any other parent, said Lidia Aguasanta, a program coordinator. Ms. De La Cruz has completed coursework on subjects like social and emotional intelligence and nutrition.

In May, Ms. Aguasanta hosted a parent-student assembly at which students read aloud memories of their parents. Reading from her paper in English, Ashanty said, “I was so happy when my dad told me that my mother was coming to this country.” She said she could always depend on her mother to come to school if she had a problem, concluding, “She does everything so that I could have a good future.”

Even before her words were translated, they brought her mother to tears.

They have had to learn how to be a family again while also adjusting to living in a new country. They were especially unprepared for New York winters. Mr. Castro earns about $1,400 a month constructing windows, and Ms. De La Cruz has not secured work since arriving in the United States. In December, Children’s Aid used $250 from the Neediest Cases Fund for Old Navy gift cards to buy the family sweaters, coats and boots. They also received $125 in Key Foods gift cards for groceries.

Ms. De La Cruz faced a deadline this past August for the $330 immigration fees for her and her older daughter. She wondered how she and her husband would scrape together the money. But the younger Ms. De La Cruz, now 20, eased her worries: Since moving to the Bronx, she had saved enough in tips from her waitressing job in Newark to pay the fees ahead of schedule.

“It was such a beautiful moment,” her mother said of learning the news.

Her older daughter shrugged, calling it her obligation and saying, “I wanted it to be a surprise.”

They both understand what it means to be separated from a child. When they immigrated to New York, the younger Ms. De La Cruz left behind her 3-year-old daughter, Darah. Mr. Castro’s permanent residency covered the sisters, but not his stepgrandchild. Ms. De La Cruz sends money to the Dominican Republic for Darah, and they connect daily through the WhatsApp messaging app.

After telling senators at his confirmation hearing in January that he had not had any contacts with Russians, it was revealed that Mr. Sessions held multiple meetings with a Russian ambassador during the campaign.

Now, Mr. Sessions must contend with comments he made last month, in another hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. “I did not, and I’m not aware of anyone else that did,” Mr. Sessions told senators when asked whether he believed members of the campaign had communicated with Russians.

Democrats on the committee put Mr. Sessions on alert in a letter last week, saying that they would want clarification on “inconsistencies” between those statements and those of the two campaign advisers, George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, who have acknowledged having contact with Russians.

The White House will have its eye on his performance.

The White House will be carefully watching Mr. Sessions’s performance. The attorney general has been in hot water with the president since he decided in March to recuse himself from all matters related to Russia, leaving him without control over the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russian efforts to meddle in the election.

Any hiccups in Mr. Sessions’s testimony would most likely only make his problems at the White House worse.

Mr. Sessions will have to mind the partisan divide.

The House Judiciary Committee has a reputation as one of the most politically divided in Congress — and those differences are likely to be on plain display on Tuesday as both Republicans and Democrats wrestle with the sharp changes in policy at the Justice Department instituted under Mr. Sessions.

Republicans mostly approve of those changes, but Democrats will probably grill Mr. Sessions on the effects of curtailing the Obama-era enforcement of antidiscrimination laws, especially protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and the Trump administration’s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

Republicans, on the other hand, are almost certain to press Mr. Sessions on the progress of investigations into potential leaks of classified information, which have tripled under his watch, and into the handling of the Hillary Clinton email case by the Obama Justice Department.

But they will be pleased that Mr. Sessions is coming with good news. On Monday, the Justice Department notified the committee that senior prosecutors were looking into whether a special counsel should be appointed to investigate the Obama administration’s decision to allow a Russian nuclear agency to buy Uranium One, a company that owned access to uranium in the United States. The department will also examine whether any donations to the Clinton Foundation were tied to the approval. Republicans are investigating the matter themselves but have been clamoring for the department to get involved.

Then again, Mr. Sessions’s days at the department could be numbered.

The race to fill Mr. Sessions’s former Senate seat in Alabama has fallen into turmoil in recent days after five women accused the Republican nominee of misconduct when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Despite mounting accusations and calls by fellow Republicans, including the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, to step aside, the candidate, Roy S. Moore, has remained defiant.

That’s where Mr. Sessions comes in.

Two White House officials floated on Monday a scenario under consideration that would have Mr. Sessions either run for his old seat as a write-in candidate to challenge Mr. Moore or be appointed to it should Mr. Moore win and be immediately removed from office. Mr. McConnell is said to be supportive of the idea.

Though a long shot, the move could provide Republicans with a convenient — if awkward — solution to two issues: the prospect of Mr. Moore in the Senate and Mr. Trump’s frustration with Mr. Sessions. While Mr. Sessions remains extremely popular in the state, his relationship with Mr. Trump never really recovered after the attorney general’s recusal.",What to Watch For as Jeff Sessions Testifies About Russia Contacts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/us/politics/jeff-sessions-congress-russia.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Authoritarian leaders exercise a strange and powerful attraction for President Trump. As his trip to Asia reminds us, a man who loves to bully people turns to mush — fawning smiles, effusive rhetoric — in the company of strongmen like Xi Jinping of China, Vladimir Putin of Russia and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines.

Perhaps he sees in them a reflection of the person he would like to be. Whatever the reason, there’s been nothing quite like Mr. Trump’s love affair with one-man rule since Spiro Agnew returned from a world tour in 1971 singing the praises of thuggish dictators like Lee Kuan Yew, Haile Selassie, Jomo Kenyatta, Mobutu Sese Seko and Gen. Francisco Franco.

Mr. Trump’s obsessive investment in personal relations may work for a real estate dealmaker. But the degree to which he has chosen to curry favor with some of the world’s most unsavory leaders, while lavishing far less attention on America’s democratic allies, hurts America’s credibility and, in the long run, may have dangerous repercussions.

In China, he congratulated Mr. Xi for securing a second term as ruler of an authoritarian regime that Mr. Trump had spent the 2016 campaign criticizing. He again absolved Mr. Putin of interfering in the United States election, despite the finding of American intelligence agencies that Moscow did extensive meddling. As for Mr. Duterte, Mr. Trump effused about their “great” relationship while saying nothing about the thousands of Filipinos who died in a campaign of extrajudicial killings as part of the Philippine president’s antidrug war. En route, he gave a verbal thumbs-up to the Saudi crown prince for arresting hundreds of senior officials and cementing control of the kingdom.

It’s not uncommon for American presidents to foster relations with strongmen. Serving the national interest often means working with leaders who are undemocratic, corrupt, adversarial or all three, and for decades there was no alternative to dealing with whoever had the top job in the Kremlin. People still talk about how naïve President George W. Bush was when he looked into Mr. Putin’s eyes in 2001 and declared the Russian president “trustworthy.” President Barack Obama stuck with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the democratically elected president of Turkey, long after Mr. Erdogan evolved into a dictator. The Chinese and Saudi leaders were favorites of President George H. W. Bush. President Richard Nixon assiduously cultivated China’s Mao Zedong, the shah of Iran and the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.

Climate progress has historically been driven from the bottom-up, not the top down from Washington. Though Congress failed to pass a cap-and-trade bill to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in 2009 during the Obama administration, the United States has still reduced emissions faster and farther than any other large nation.

In fact, we are already almost halfway to reaching our Paris commitment, thanks largely to consumer preferences and market forces. Half the country’s coal plants have closed or are being phased out while air quality improves and electricity bills fall for American consumers.

In the current political climate, however, there is a risk that nonfederal actions will go unrecognized by the global community. To ensure the world sees the continued commitment of the United States to tackling climate change, and the extent to which local governments and businesses are driving progress, we have introduced an initiative called America’s Pledge, which will document the progress we are making — and the bolder actions we must still take — to meet our Paris commitments.

This week in Bonn, we released a report detailing existing nonfederal climate initiatives and policies across America. The report also identifies major new opportunities for cities, states and businesses to take climate action without the federal government.

For instance, more states can opt in to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a carbon pricing program involving nine Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states to drive down power plants emissions, or California’s independently managed vehicle emissions programs, including its Zero Emission Vehicle Mandate, which nine states have adopted. More cities can adopt greener building codes, policies and programs to reduce electricity waste.

And more businesses can follow the lead of the 43 American supermarket chains that have committed to reducing their emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, a potent greenhouse gas used in refrigeration. Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Red Bull and Unilever have installed more than 5.5 million air-conditioning units using HFC-free refrigerants worldwide, with nearly 400,000 of those installed in the United States. More companies can follow their lead.

Together, these actions will strengthen the economy and improve public health, while also helping the United States move faster toward its Paris commitment. Over the next year, we will aggregate and quantify these actions and continue pushing for new efforts to speed up decarbonization.

The Paris agreement succeeded where previous attempts failed because it solicited nationally determined pledges from nations based on local actions already taking place. For the United States to reach its commitment, much more needs to be done.

Now, high blood pressure will be defined as 130/80 millimeters of mercury or greater for anyone with a significant risk of heart attack or stroke. The previous guidelines defined high blood pressure as 140/90. (The first number describes the pressure on blood vessels when the heart contracts, and the second refers to the pressure as the heart relaxes between beats.)

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death among Americans. The new criteria, the first official diagnostic revision since 2003, result from growing evidence that blood pressure far lower than had been considered normal greatly reduces the chances of heart attack and stroke, as well as the overall risk of death.

Recent research indicates this is true even among older people for whom intensive treatment had been thought too risky. That finding, from a large federal study in 2015, caught many experts by surprise and set the stage for the new revision.

That calculation must be individualized, and experts are recommending that patients use a calculator developed by the guidelines committee at ccccalculator.ccctracker.com.

Nearly half of all American adults, and nearly 80 percent of those aged 65 and older, will find that they qualify and will need to take steps to reduce their blood pressure.



Even under the relatively more lenient standard that had prevailed for years, close to half of patients did not manage to get their blood pressure down to normal.

“Is it going to affect a lot of people, and is it going to be hard to meet those blood pressure goals?” asked Dr. Raymond Townsend, director of the hypertension program at Penn Medicine. “The answer is a pretty significant yes.”

According to the new guidelines, anyone with at least a 10 percent risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next decade should aim for blood pressure below 130/80.

But simply being age 65 or older brings a 10 percent risk of cardiovascular trouble, and so effectively everyone over that age will have to shoot for the new target.

Younger patients with this level of risk include those with conditions like heart disease, kidney disease or diabetes. The new standard will apply to them, as well.

People whose risk of heart attack or stroke is less than 10 percent will be told to aim for blood pressure below 140/90, a more lenient standard, and to take medications if necessary to do so.

If there is any good news for patients here, it is that nearly all the drugs used to treat high blood pressure are generic now. Many cost pennies a day, and most people can take them without side effects.

In formulating the guidelines, the expert committee reviewed more than 1,000 research reports. But the change is due largely to convincing data from a federal study published in 2015.

That study, called Sprint, explored whether markedly lower blood pressure in older people — lower than researchers had ever tried to establish — might be both achievable and beneficial.

The investigators assigned more than 9,300 men and women ages 50 and older who were at high risk of heart disease to one of two targets: a systolic pressure (the higher of the two blood pressure measures) of less than 120, or a systolic pressure of less than 140.

In participants who were assigned to get their systolic pressures below 120, the incidence of heart attacks, heart failure and strokes fell by a third, and the risk of death fell by nearly a quarter.

Those patients ended up taking three drugs on average, instead of two, yet experienced no more side effects or complications than subjects in the other group.

Some experts in geriatrics had expected many more complications among older patients receiving more intense treatment, especially increased dizziness, falls and dehydration.

Instead, the benefits for older people were impressive. With a lower risk of heart attacks and strokes, they were more likely to maintain their independence.

“They had half the rate of disability,” said Dr. Jeff Williamson, head of the Sticht Center on Aging at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center and the only geriatrician on the committee drawing up the new guidelines.

But more intensive drug treatment in so many more patients may increase rates of kidney disease, some experts fear. In the Sprint trial, the incidence of acute kidney injury was twice as high in the group receiving drugs to reduce their systolic pressure to 120.

“Although the lower goal was better for the heart, it wasn’t better for the kidney,” said Dr. Townsend of Penn Medicine, who is a kidney specialist. “So yeah, I’m worried.”

While agreeing that lower blood pressure is better, Dr. J. Michael Gaziano, a preventive cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the VA Boston, worries about having doctors and patients fixating on a particular goal.

It’s true, he said, that doctors ought to be more aggressive in treating people at high risk. But, he added, “If a patient comes in with a blood pressure of 180, I will not get him to 130.”

Lifestyle changes like diet and exercise can help many patients lower blood pressure. But many of the newly diagnosed are likely to wind up on drugs, said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale University.

“This is a big change that will end up labeling many more people with hypertension and recommending drug treatment for many more people,” he said.

The current treatment strategy has not been so successful for many patients, he noted.

“How they tolerate drugs, whether they want to pursue lower levels, are all choices and should not be dictated to them,” said Dr. Krumholz. “Or we will have the same situation as today — many prescriptions that go unfilled and pills untaken.”","Under New Guidelines, Millions More Americans Will Need to Lower Blood Pressure",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/health/blood-pressure-treatment-guidelines.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

PARIS — If you thought it was challenging for women to come forward and accuse Harvey Weinstein of rape, consider accusing the Islamic theologist Tariq Ramadan. Emboldened by the enormous response in France to the #MeToo wave that was born in Hollywood, two Frenchwomen decided last month to sue Mr. Ramadan for rape and sexual abuse. One of the women, Henda Ayari, has gone public. The second has described her ordeal to journalists but has remained anonymous. And for good reason: Henda Ayari has had to appeal for help after becoming the target of a vicious campaign of insults and slander on social networks, mostly from Muslim extremists. Mr. Ramadan, a grandson of the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, denies the accusations.

It is not only that the Swiss-born Mr. Ramadan, 55, who has taken a leave of absence from Oxford University, where he has taught contemporary Islamic studies (a chair financed by Qatar), is a prominent figure on the intellectual and religious Islamic scene in France. What makes his accusers particularly brave is that they, like him, are practicing Muslims. By the very fact of having spent time alone with him, they have, in the eyes of rigorist teachings of Islam, violated the rules of modesty that women are required to follow.

The sexual revolution that liberated Western women in the 20th century has yet to occur in most of the Muslim world. But we may be seeing a beginning, six years after the crushed hopes of the Arab revolutions. In North Africa, at least, and in the Arabic communities within France, the seeds of women’s rebellion are bearing fruit slowly. Tunisia, the one Arab country that did not turn its back on the Arab Spring, is breaking barriers.

“In Arabic, revolution means whirlwind,” the Tunisian film director Kaouther Ben Hania, a woman, recently told the French public radio channel France-Inter. “So it turns everything upside down, it changes everything, and overnight we find ourselves talking about everything, while under the dictatorship we did not talk. I would never have been able to do this movie before the revolution.”

Just released in France and in her country, Ms. Ben Hania’s movie “The Beauty and the Dogs” is a harrowing tale of a 20-year-old student raped by two policemen in Tunis after being caught walking on a beach with a boyfriend at night. The film concentrates on the night that follows, during which Mariam, the student, tries stubbornly to file a complaint, which would require getting a doctor to examine her and policemen to take her testimony. Gradually, as hours pass and she encounters more obstacles, her violated dignity leads to a political awakening. Threatened with arrest at dawn, she does not give in. In the end, Ms. Ben Hania explains, “it is the policemen who are afraid of her.

I was a typical beginner, even if I didn’t live in your typical neighborhood: This was the South Bronx during the era when arson and abandonment fueled by government dysfunction turned it into a globally-infamous and desolate urban landscape.

My spirit sometimes felt as broken as the sidewalks and buildings of my neighborhood on Fox Street, since I had grown disillusioned with art school and was floundering with my identity. I was a Puerto Rican and a New Yorker, but it was hard to reconcile those two identities. I struggled in New York because I wasn’t recognized as American. And when I moved to the island for a while, I wasn’t recognized as Puerto Rican, either.

Even in art school I sometimes wasn’t recognized as the one thing I had set out to be – a photographer. Luckily, one of my teachers who was familiar with my work suggested I meet a friend of hers, Mel Rosenthal, who taught photography at Empire State College.

Mel instantly liked what I was shooting, and it was fitting that we met at that time. While I was photographing the Longwood section of South Bronx, Mel was out making pictures on the streets of his youth a few miles north in the Bathgate neighborhood for images that would later be published as “In the South Bronx of America.”

Mel let me into his life, and I was alongside him when he took many of the pictures in his book. We made the connections between his youth as a Jewish man who returned to where he had grown up on the streets of the South Bronx and seeing how its current residents – my family and friends – had been disenfranchised. Mel introduced me to politics and taught me who the players were and how they were being exposed. There was the catalyst that got me thinking how I could use photography to change and document that.

Mel’s approach to documentary photography was shaped by his own strong belief in social justice, which led him back to his old neighborhood to document how its beleaguered residents confronted its decline, the impact of city policies of official neglect, or the guerilla ingenuity of Puerto Rico’s Villa Sin Miedo, a land rescue effort to provide affordable housing.

What was central in his work – and what he taught us – was that when people let you into their lives, your photographs can amplify their voices on the issues that mattered to them, despite the silence and indifference of the rest of the city and its power brokers. Under his guidance, I started making those connections between my neighborhood’s decline and the larger forces buffeting it, from political neglect and corruption to the greed of landlords who cut services and then abandoned their properties or hired people to torch them for insurance.

Photo

My work from that era was influenced by Mel’s lessons and his own example as a compassionate photographer on a mission. Sure, I took pictures of the fires, the abandoned buildings or skeletal cars dumped on the streets. But I also caught early B-Boys dancing at the Hunts Point Palace, kids playing on the streets and the other rhythms of life. And, sadly, I also have portraits of friends who would not survive much past their teenage years, their lives cut short by drugs, AIDS or guns.

I am but one of many young, socially aware photographers fortunate to have attended Mel’s seminal workshops where he introduced us to the world of documentary photography and photojournalism. The summer workshops were a six-week intensive course where some of the best photojournalists in the world shared their images of the issues of the time, from covering the wars in Central America to poverty in the middle America and around the world.

The students who attended those workshops fanned out throughout New York City covering the rise of AIDS and the birth of political activism in the gay and lesbian community, as well as protests against racism and police brutality that turned the streets of black and Latino communities into raging battlegrounds. There wasn’t a single week where there wasn’t a demonstration taking place and that was the real classroom where Mel’s students learned their craft.

Mel came into his own as a photographer during the social unrest of the 1960s. Maybe it’s not a coincidence that his former students are now photojournalists documenting very similar deep divisions that are consuming our country.

Mel died last week from the effects of Alzheimer’s, a disease that slowly and painfully took him from us. The best memorial we can give him is to continue the practice as he taught it.

“At first it was about work,” Ms. Murphy, 62, said.","Under federal law, complainants must undergo a confidential process, where co-workers who might be able to provide corroborating evidence are excluded. They often must wait about three months before submitting an official complaint, yet must file one no later than 180 days after the episode. Once filed, victims must submit to up to 30 days of mandatory counseling and complete another 30 days of mediation.

If mediation fails, the person then must wait 30 more days before seeking an administrative hearing or filing a lawsuit in Federal District Court.

“The system is so stacked,” said Debra Katz, a Washington lawyer who often works on sexual harassment cases. “They don’t want people to come forward.”

With such rigid policies, even the most dogged complainants may find no avenue for resolution. In one case, a fellow at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, M. Reese Everson, brought a complaint against a House member to the Office of Compliance. But she said the office told her it could not handle her case because, as a fellow and not a full-time employee, she did not fall under its jurisdiction.

She ended up filing her complaints with the District of Columbia government, where they have languished for over two years.

Few deny the growing sense that Congress is, for many women, a hostile workplace. Last Thursday, the Senate approved a resolution that would create mandatory anti-harassment training for all Senate employees and interns, and would require training every two years. At least two other pieces of legislation that would make the changes even broader are in progress.

Kristin Nicholson, a former chief of staff to Representative Jim Langevin, Democrat of Rhode Island, said Congress had not gone far enough. “We think training needs to be in-person to be more effective,” said Ms. Nicholson, who now directs the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, “and we’re asking for reforms to the opaque process for reporting and resolving harassment claims.”

In interviews, a few who were harassed said they were never even informed of the Office of Compliance’s existence.

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

Rebecca Weir, a 39-year-old lawyer in Washington, had never heard of the office in 2001 when she said former Representative Gary Miller, Republican of California, asked her to twirl for him in his Diamond Bar, Calif., office.

”He said, ‘My God, you look amazing today. Just stunning.’ And he was kind of leering at me, and then he asked me to twirl,” Ms. Weir recalled. “I was stunned, but I was young and dumb and here’s a member of Congress that I’m working for asking me to twirl in his office. So I did.”

Ms. Weir said Mr. Miller’s chief of staff called from Washington soon after with some news.

“‘Well Rebecca, I don’t know what you did, but Gary just called me and said you can have a $1,250 bonus, effective immediately,’” Ms. Weir recalled.

On Monday, a woman who identified herself as Mr. Miller’s wife, Cathy Miller, denied the allegations. “I know my husband,” she said before adding that the claim was “yellow journalism.”

There also was no mandatory training in place on Katherine Cichy’s 27th birthday in 2013. Ms. Cichy, then an aide for now-retired Senator Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota, was walking through Union Station with colleagues when Ms. Cichy’s direct supervisor repeatedly called her “hot.”

Ms. Cichy reported the episode to her chief of staff at the time, who she said made light of it, saying, “It is what it is.”

Months later, Ms. Cichy took a job in another office. The man who harassed her stayed in Mr. Johnson’s office, as did his former chief of staff, Drey Samuelson, who said on Friday that he had warned the offending employee, “I would fire him, and it never happened again.” He said that he did not make light of the episode.

“Bottom line,” Ms. Cichy said, “my boss told me I was hot, and I had to sit in a room every day and work with him. And they didn’t do anything about it. Nothing.”

For female lobbyists, sexual suggestions appear to be part of the price of access.

In her 40 years on the Hill, Laura W. Murphy, the former head of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington legislative office, said she endured a number of sexually suggestive episodes as generations of lawmakers cycled in and out of Congress. In the 1980s, a House member, whose name she would not share, tried to kiss her in the produce aisle at a Capitol Hill grocery store. In the early 2000s, she said a lawmaker asked her for a working dinner, then propositioned her for sex.

“At first it was about work,” Ms. Murphy, 62, said. “But then it devolved into a very blatant overture to have sex.”

Like many women, Ms. Murphy did not report the episodes in part because she believed her career could be negatively affected and because she was not sure where she could turn.

All of the women now coming forward are putting pressure on the Office of Compliance, whose processes date back to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. Between 1997 and 2014, the United States Treasury paid $15.2 million in 235 awards and settlements for Capitol Hill workplace violations under the office’s byzantine procedures, according to a recent Washington Post analysis of the Office of Compliance.

Susan Tsui Grundmann, the office’s executive director, said that the office had received an increase in requests for harassment training in the past two weeks, and that the five-member board had repeatedly recommended since 2010 that Congress put in place regular mandatory harassment training.

Bradford Fitch, president and chief executive of the Congressional Management Foundation, a group that helps lawmakers and staff run their offices, said sexual harassment was vastly underreported in congressional offices.

This has been the case for decades: In 1989, Alice Cain was 22 and three months into a job as a chief of staff’s assistant for Paul Simon, who was then a Democratic senator from Illinois, when one of his top donors groped her and kissed her at a fund-raiser held at a Washington hotel.

Ms. Cain, who is now 50 and works for a nonprofit organization, said that several other women in her office had similar experiences with that donor, whom she declined to name out of respect for his family. But she said it was years before the women spoke to one another about the episodes.

“If I go into my boss’s office and say, ‘Oh, this guy did this to me’ — I don’t want to lose my job,” Ms. Cain said. “I think all of us made that calculation.”

She said she decided to share her story belatedly “for the 22-year-olds now.”

Others are reconsidering past experiences, episodes previously brushed off as playful or not a big deal, that register now as assault.

Hannah Hudson was in her early 20s and working for a Democratic congressman from Oklahoma in 2009 when she was joined on a work trip by staff members from a Republican senator’s office. At a work outing, she said, a senior aide for that senator tried to tug open her wrap dress, which she had pinned closed, asking, “Why are you holding out on us?”

Ms. Hudson, who is now 32 and works as a photographer, did not think to report the episode. She said she tried to brush it off because she felt that what had happened to her was not as bad as what had happened to others.

She does remember feeling grateful when a male colleague who silently witnessed the episode pulled her aside privately to ask if she was all right.

“How much of a patriarchal society do we live in that the person who came up to me in private and said, ‘Oh, are you O.K.?’ is the hero?” she asked.

She paused.

A mix of fresh ambition and the familiar has come to define this diverse neighborhood, where less than 10 percent of the population traces its ancestry to Australia or England. It is visible at places like the Usual Cafe, a modern coffee shop near John Street where baristas in denim pull shots against a background of lush plants and white tiles.

Corey Nguyen, 28, who grew up in Australia and owns the Usual with his partner, Jenny Ngo, said they wanted to introduce Cabramatta, which is dominated by traditional cafes selling Vietnamese-style coffee, to a more artisanal cafe culture.

“For us it’s never been a competition,” he said. “They do their thing, we do ours. I wish them all the best.”

It’s a good thing, said Andrew Nguyen, 24, who waited with a friend for his coffee after a traditional Vietnamese lunch. “All your Asian fixes are here,” he said. “It’s home to us.”

For many of Cabramatta’s first Vietnamese residents, it felt like anything but.

Before their arrival, the population was mostly working-class Australians and European migrants. A German-Austrian society center near the train station is one of a few remaining signs of that past.

During the ’70s, primarily American servicemen brought heroin to Sydney from Southeast Asia, said Andrew Jakubowicz, a professor of sociology at the University of Technology Sydney. Cabramatta, with its links to Italian criminal groups and a new connection to Southeast Asia, would soon become a distribution point for the rest of the city.

For the Vietnamese, harboring the lingering trauma of war, the lack of an established Asian community in Cabramatta made it “a fairly desperate time,” Professor Jakubowicz said. “There was no history and structure available to respond to, and Australia was still very racist.”

One of those former refugees, Hue Kim, 75, now spends her weekends selling Kaffir lime leaves, rosemary and other herbs on the sidewalk just a few feet from Ms. Nguyen’s bubble tea shop.

She remembers attending her first English class shortly after arriving, pregnant, in Sydney 37 years ago. Her teachers, she said, noticed that her shirt was stained with milk. “They told me to nurse my newborn before coming back,” she said in Vietnamese. “So I didn’t go back.”

Many of the Vietnamese children who came during this time were unaccompanied. Others were left to their own devices while their parents worked long hours. Isolated culturally and economically, some of the young Vietnamese arrivals banded together, tapping into the drug trade and preying on the members of their own community.

Tony Hoang, 35, a pastor who spent his teenage years dealing heroin as part of a gang, recalled the time as marked with instability, anger and a need to belong. “It was attractive to be a part of a group that loved each other,” he said.

The violence took a shocking turn in 1994 with the assassination of John Newman, who represented Cabramatta in the State Parliament. A rival local politician who had immigrated from Vietnam was later convicted of the crime.

It was Australia’s first political assassination, and one that would further feed notions of a wave of ethnic migrant violence in Cabramatta.

Frustration over the area’s lawless reputation eventually prompted a parliamentary inquiry. The 2001 report led to the creation of drug treatment and intervention programs and the hiring of more police officers with wider powers to tackle drug crimes. Today, crime levels compare with those in other parts of metropolitan Sydney.

Not all of Cabramatta’s problems have been solved. Housing prices, like elsewhere in Sydney, have risen into the millions of dollars.

And a new wave of migrants, including refugees from Syria and the Middle East, are raising the same kinds of tensions that confronted Vietnamese migrants in the 1970s.

According to the 2016 census, Vietnamese is still the predominant ethnic group in Cabramatta, making up 33 percent of its roughly 22,000 residents. Chinese make up 24 percent, and Cambodians account for 8 percent. At least 40 other ethnic groups are also represented.

Frank Carbone, the mayor of Fairfield City, the western Sydney district surrounding Cabramatta, said that while 7,000 new refugees had been resettled in the region since January 2016, the federal government had not provided any financial support.

Today, though, the children of the initial wave of Vietnamese migrants are seeing a return on their parents’ persistence and creating their own legacy.

On a quieter stretch of John Street, patrons lined up outside Pho Tau Bay, a popular restaurant. Inside, Chi Giang, 36, a placid man in glasses, worked the register as waiters ferried bowls of steaming broth.

Born in an Indonesian refugee camp to Vietnamese parents waiting for Australian visas, Mr. Giang manages the restaurant, which his mother began in the kitchen of their home in 1980. Her closely guarded beef noodle soup recipe often tops critics’ lists of the best Vietnamese food in Sydney, and the profits from the restaurant are enough to sustain Mr. Giang’s entire extended family.

“Over the years, I’ve seen kids coming in as babies,” Mr. Giang said, gesturing to a young family at a nearby table. “And then years later, they’re taller than me, and they’re still coming for beef noodle soup.”",How a Sydney ‘War Zone’ Became a Center of Vietnamese Resolve,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/world/australia/cabramatta-crime-vietnamese.html

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off.","The Parisian sun casting a warm glow on a balcony overlooking narrow streets, laundry drying overhead. The bustle of a market. Sprawling Provençal vineyards.

Julia Child’s time in France inspired her to capture the country through its cuisine, introducing French cooking to kitchens around the world. But it was that same French magic — and Ms. Child herself — that inspired her husband, Paul, to also capture the country, albeit through a different medium, photography. A new book lets him offer a personal glimpse into the world beyond the kitchen.

“There is this combination of intimacy and formal, rigorous design,” said Alex Prud’homme, the couple’s grandnephew and a co-author of “France Is a Feast: The Photographic Journey of Paul and Julia Child.”

The Childs met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, leading them to various postings around Europe. But it was Paris, where they arrived in 1948, that captured their hearts.

“Apart from our official lives — cooking and government — the other things we do fall into fairly repetitive categories whose two main divisions are, being entertained and entertaining others,” Mr. Child wrote to his twin brother, Charlie. “Sometimes when we’re being entertained it isn’t people, but just Paris herself who acts as hostess.”

While Ms. Child took French cooking classes, and eventually began work on “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck, Mr. Child was engaged in diplomatic duties as a cultural attaché for the United States government. And he was rarely without a camera.

The photographs, taken between 1948 and 1954, focus on the beauty of postwar France. The perfectly-landscaped parks, the bustling waterfront in Marseille, the glow of Place de la Concorde at night, a cold fog settling over the Sacré-Coeur basilica. The shadow play on the grand entryways and the underpasses along the Seine.

But Mr. Child’s main subject was always his wife. Ms. Child in the kitchen; changing her clothes on the side of the road; legs propped up in a telephone booth; sunbathing in Cassis.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

The detail and expansive catalog of Mr. Child’s work raise the question: Did he have a sense that their lives would have a bigger impact than their immediate Parisian universe?

“He was an obsessive photographer and note taker, it’s almost like he knew back then that their lives were worth preserving for posterity,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “It’s like they were leaving breadcrumbs.”

Mr. Prud’homme helped Ms. Child write her memoir, “My Life in France” (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006), but he felt it wasn’t complete. That’s when Katie Pratt, a longtime family friend of the Childs and the book’s co-author, discovered a “Pandora’s box” of hundreds of black and white and color photographs, everything from surrealistic street documentary to formal portraits and landscapes.

Negatives were clearly labeled. Log books and letters provided a time frame, and were often accompanied by long letters detailing their routine: embassy comings and goings during the Cold War, their meals, the price of wine or the performance they saw the evening before. Everything was for the taking.

Mr. Child had a “distinct style,” Ms. Pratt said.

“His style as a visual artist, whether it was photography or other mediums, it was very important for him to have strong, well-organized, well-balanced compositions, often with perspective and depth,” she said. “There’s often a story going on.”

Mr. Child’s style was heavily influenced by artists living in France at the time. And as a cultural attaché, he quickly gravitated to the top artists of the day: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Edward Steichen were all friends of his. They even shared the same printer, using Pictorial Service owned by Pierre Gassmann in Paris.

“My interpretation was that Paul was a very independent-minded guy who really developed his own aesthetic, but he was swimming in the waters of these masters of 20th-century photography,” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off. But he always remained behind the camera.

“Paul and Julia, in their own ways, were really good teachers,” Ms. Pratt said. “They really cared about not only perfecting their craft and communicating it clearly with others. They put it to operational proof and shared it with others.”

“That’s something they learned while in the O.S.S.,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “Don’t trust common wisdom, find out for yourself whether something works or doesn’t. That’s something they both did in their art, and cooking.”

That the tally appeared in a Berlin newspaper was possibly a reflection of Germany’s central role in the refugee crisis that has engulfed Europe in recent years.","The newspaper printed 100,000 copies of The List. It was distributed with the newspaper’s edition of Nov. 9 and the rest are being given away during a series of artistic and performance presentations in Berlin. The list can also be downloaded in the form of a 48-page document.

Der Tagesspiegel said the asylum-seekers, refugees and migrants on its list had died “as a result of the restrictive policies of Fortress Europe,” both at the continent’s outer borders or after arriving in Europe itself.

In 1995, for instance, 18 Sri Lankans, identified by name on The List, were asphyxiated in a sealed truck trailer in Hungary.

“We want to honor them,” Der Tagesspiegel said. “And at the same time we want to show that every line tells a story and that the list keeps getting longer every day.”

The list also seemed to show that, while recent attention has focused on people fleeing since the so-called Arab Spring of 2011, the lure of a new life in Europe long predates turmoil in the Middle East.

The first identified fatality on the list is Emanuel T. Tout, a 23-year-old Sudanese man, who died in a German prison on Dec. 25, 1993, of self-inflicted wounds. It was not clear why 1993 was chosen as the start date.

The final entry is on May 29, 2017, when two bodies were found and 28 people were listed as missing after they either drowned or were trampled to death when a boat sank just off the Libyan coast. The names of the deceased were not known and neither was their region of origin.

That the tally appeared in a Berlin newspaper was possibly a reflection of Germany’s central role in the refugee crisis that has engulfed Europe in recent years. In 2015, Chancellor Angela Merkel threw open her country’s borders to refugees and migrants, many of them from Syria, and around one million people arrived.

While many Germans initially welcomed them, a subsequent backlash helped propel the far-right Alternative for Germany party into Parliament. In negotiations to form a new governing coalition and under pressure from her Bavarian political partners, Ms. Merkel was forced to agree to limit the number of asylum seekers to 200,000 a year.

“I thought if you’re writing hateful comment towards Hillary or Trump that are really, really angry and horrible, I thought that person is going to be horrible in person as well,” Mr. Lien said.
Many of them are trolls, but many of them are just really strongly opinionated people,” Mr. Lien said.
“Just to see their homes, their decorations around them, their computers — all of those things give quite a lot of personality to the photo,” Mr. Lien said.
Mr. Lien spent weeks researching and studying commenters.","Nick Haynes didn’t seem so bad.

Sure, online he had promised civil war if Hillary Clinton were elected, but Mr. Haynes was first and foremost a family man. He’d given up his days of motorcycles and drinking to live a sober life in a sleepy Pennsylvania town with his four children, where he had a full-time job as a truck driver.

But his family life contrasted sharply with his other full-time job, that of a prolific online commenter. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he tweeted an average of 57 times a day about a corrupt system, biased media and “Killary.” He compared voting for Mrs. Clinton to killing your own children.

It was this disconnect between “normal life” and intense online debate that drove Kyrre Lien, a photographer based in Oslo, to look into the lives of the online commenting community. For a project called “The Internet Warriors,” Mr. Lien combed through tens of thousands of online comments to put together a group of 27 internet debaters from around the world, representing all sides of the political spectrum.

“They had steady jobs, they had family, they had friends and lived quite a normal life, but at the same time, you saw they had these hateful comments,” he said. “That was part of what drove me to dig into this.”

In the case of Mr. Haynes, Mr. Lien assumed that he would personify his comments.

“I thought if you’re writing hateful comment towards Hillary or Trump that are really, really angry and horrible, I thought that person is going to be horrible in person as well,” Mr. Lien said. “But many of the people were actually quite nice, made me coffee and tea and, until politics came up, it was like flipping the switch on a different personality.”

Still, Mr. Lien is hesitant to categorize them as internet trolls.

“Labeling them all as internet trolls would be too harsh. Many of them are trolls, but many of them are just really strongly opinionated people,” Mr. Lien said. “All of the people I met are really dedicated in the cause they’re fighting.”

They have full-time jobs and families, they are men and women of all ages, who feel marginalized in some way or another. Take, for example, Ashleigh Jones, 22, a psychology student in Cardiff, Wales. She’s amassed more than 180,000 tweets on various subjects including entertainment, L.G.B.T. issues and “hot guys.”

Photo

“Some people have also called me a troll, like when I said that ISIS should kill David Cameron,” Ms. Jones told Mr. Lien, referring to the former British prime minister. “I don’t think I’m a troll. I might have strong opinions, but they are just that — opinions. For me, a troll is someone who is ruining the discussion, and that’s not me.”

The photographs feature portraits of the commenters, many of them in their natural commenting habitat inside their homes. Video interviews accompany the subjects online, as well as a book.

“Just to see their homes, their decorations around them, their computers — all of those things give quite a lot of personality to the photo,” Mr. Lien said.

Mr. Lien spent weeks researching and studying commenters. One thread took him down a dark path on Kim Kardashian’s Facebook account. He spent three or four days going through all the comments on her account looking for frequent commenters with a consistent message. But in the end, that was one type of opinion he wasn’t able to capture on camera — misogynists.

Mr. Lien found that the motivation behind commenters depends on their political affiliation. On the right, it’s “because they feel threatened and society is letting them down, they’re being left by themselves,” Mr. Lien said, whereas people on the left “feel that we need to stand up for what we believe in.”

Sofia Srour, 23 and Muslim, defends her religion daily.

“There is so much ignorance and hate directed towards my religion in the comment section that I quickly become irritated. Anger drives me,” she told Mr. Lien. “I have spent more than three hours every day sharing my views on Islam. It’s a bit scary to engage in these discussions, but I feel that it’s important to balance out all the negativity that is posted.”

Mr. Lien may have spent four years trailing the lives of what he calls internet warriors, but the photographer is far from calling himself a troll.

“I’d like to be more of an internet peacekeeping force than an internet warrior,” he said.

SAN FRANCISCO — Missouri’s attorney general has opened an investigation into whether Google’s business practices violate its consumer protection and antitrust laws amid growing concern over the influence of powerful technology companies.

Josh Hawley, Missouri’s attorney general, said on Monday that his office had issued a subpoena to Google to seek information into the collection and use of users’ private information, the use of other content providers’ information on its sites and potential bias in search engine results.

In the terror-struck and vertiginous days after Donald Trump’s election a year ago, as I tried to make sense of America’s new reality, I called people who lived, or had lived, under authoritarianism to ask what to expect. I wasn’t looking for concrete predictions — one of the disorienting things about that moment was that no one, no matter how learned, had any idea what was happening — but for insights into how the texture of life changes when an autocratic demagogue is in charge.

A secular Turkish journalist told me, her voice sad and weary, that while people might at first pour into the streets to oppose Trump, eventually the protests would probably die out as a sense of stunned emergency gave way to the slog of sustained opposition. The Russian dissident writer Masha Gessen warned that there’s no way, with a leader who lays siege to the fabric of reality, to fully hold on to a sense of what’s normal. “You drift, and you get warped,” she told me.

They were both right. The country has changed in the past year, and many of us have grown numb after unrelenting shocks. What now passes for ordinary would have once been inconceivable. The government is under the control of an erratic racist who engages in nuclear brinkmanship on Twitter. He is dismantling the State Department, defending the hollowing out of the diplomatic corps by saying, on Fox News, “I’m the only one that matters.”

He publicly pressures the Justice Department to investigate his political opponents. He’s called for reporters to be jailed, and his administration demanded that a sportscaster who criticized him be fired. Official government statements promote his hotels. You can’t protest it all; you’d never do anything else. After the election, many liberals pledged not to “normalize” Trump. But one lesson of this year is that we don’t get to decide what normal looks like.

Last month Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, took an unannounced trip to Saudi Arabia, where he met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who later had a number of his rivals, including a Trump critic, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, put under arrest. In The Washington Post, David Ignatius described Kushner’s talks with Prince Mohammed this way: “The two princes are said to have stayed up until nearly 4 a.m. several nights, swapping stories and planning strategy.” A year ago, that sentence would have been unintelligible as a description of American diplomacy, even as a wry joke.

There’s a metaphysical whiplash in how quickly alarm turns into acceptance and then into forgetfulness. It was astonishing when Trump installed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist, a man who had previously run a white nationalist tabloid; now it feels like ages ago that he was even in the White House.

Whether he deserves credit is, being charitable to him, up for debate. But what’s absolutely true is that if the global economy — and stock market — is a confidence game, confidence is clearly winning.

Mr. Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said he keeps a small amount of cash on hand as a precaution. “I keep a little bit, you know, as a hedge. I call it my ‘Trump hedge’ because you just never know. Now 280 characters can change the market in a heartbeat,” he said, not-so-jokingly alluding to the new character limit on Twitter, Mr. Trump’s communication tool of choice.

Measuring confidence, is of course, a subjective matter. There are dozens of surveys of chief executives and others asking them how “confident” they feel. Earlier this year, The Conference Board reported that chief executives’ confidence had reached 2008 pre-recession highs in the first quarter, though more recent surveys have showed a slight waning.

Still, merger activity, which this column has long argued is the purest measure of confidence — since most executives only do deals when they are genuinely confident in their own business and the economic environment — has reached a record high. It bolted in the past several months after what seemed like a surprisingly lackluster beginning of the year as executives appeared to be paralyzed by a sense of uncertainty, trying to gauge the first steps of a new president.

It appears that chief executives have found themselves certain that whatever “uncertainty” exists isn’t that uncertain after all.

Still, there are pockets of the economy that are causing anxiety. “The last two or three years have not been fun whatsoever,” Mickey Drexler, the chairman of J. Crew, said at the conference about the traditional retail business, which has been upended by Amazon and changes in consumer behavior. “It’s been miserable.” Those challenges are extending to mall owners and commercial real estate, too.

The question is whether all the enthusiastic talk from chief executives is reflective of a truly robust economy or whether we are missing something.

“There’s so many people talking about the record level of the stock market. The stock market is not a proxy for the economy of America,” said Howard Schultz, executive chairman of Starbucks. “I’m deeply concerned about the millions of Americans who are not participating in the economy.”

That may be worth remembering. If there is a lesson in having confidence, especially when everyone else is feeling that way, it is that it can quickly reverse.

“In the aftermath of corporate and public-sector disasters, it often emerges that participants fell prey to a collective form of willful blindness and overconfidence: mounting warning signals were systematically cast aside or met with denial, evidence avoided or selectively reinterpreted, dissenters shunned,” Roland Bénabou a professor at Princeton University wrote in a seminal work on confidence and groupthink. “Market bubbles and manias exhibit the same pattern of investors acting ’colorblind in a sea of red flags,’ followed by a crash.”",Navigating a Breathtaking Level of Global Economic Change,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/business/dealbook/navigating-global-economic-change.html

Nor is Maria Borrallo, the full-time nanny to Prince George and Princess Charlotte.

But something about Instagram’s ostensible greater intimacy, perhaps, makes the exclusion more jarring. Ivanka Trump leaves her nanny out of frequent Instagrams of her three children; it’s been noted that she mentions the word “nanny” but once in her book, “Women Who Work.”

One may think parents just want to take credit for all the child care, but there are also potential security concerns. “They don’t want to promote that this might be a nanny for a child of means,” said Seth Norman Greenberg, marketing director at Pavilion Agency, a high-end domestic staffing company based in New York.

A nanny’s immigration or income status can also be a deterrent. In the last nine years, Oliver Quillia, a producer and father of two in the Bronx, has posted exactly one photo on Instagram of his beloved nanny, Lynn, whose last name he withheld for similar reasons. “If it weren’t for the ‘under the table’ pay we give her, I would probably post way more photos of her,” Mr. Quillia, 47, said.

But when oversharing parents omit nannies on Instagram or Facebook, it can indeed be intended to shape perception of their own characters. “I think many of us on social media, probably subconsciously, want to perpetuate this idea that we’re doing it all on our own,” said Natalia Mehlman Petrzela, an associate professor of history at the New School and a mother of two.

Ms. Petrzela is a self-described “exhibitionist” on Facebook, but it wasn’t until five years after she and her husband hired their nanny, Nancy Peter, that she realized she’d never posted a photo of the woman they consider a “third parent.” (Ms. Petrzela’s husband hadn’t, either, but he’s not active on social media).

“My children respect and love her so much, and I do too,” Ms. Petrzela, 39, recalled thinking. “Why am I making that invisible?”

Ms. Petrzela, who is white, had also considered the racial context between her and Ms. Peter, who is Afro-Caribbean. Though Ms. Petrzela is confident their relationship is respectful, “the history of white families being ministered to by women of color is not a really beautiful history,” Ms. Petrzela said. “Part of me felt hyper-aware about even the impression that any of those dynamics are repeating themselves in our home.”

While Ms. Peter is not on Facebook, she said she appreciates being included. “It makes me feel part of the family,” she said. “I did not give birth to the kids, but I love them very much.” Of other parents who don’t want pictures with their nannies, she said, “It’s not fair. I’m going to tell you the truth: most parents feel that if the children are too close to the nanny, that they’re losing something.”

Lauren Stein, a media executive and mother of two boys in New York, says she praises her live-in nanny (whose name she’d rather not share) “in real life” but worries that posting odes to her on Facebook would only make Ms. Stein look fancier-than-thou and fuel mockery from her relatives.

“A lot of them crack jokes, like, “Oh, Lauren, you’re here without your help? Is that hard for you? Are you surviving?’” Ms. Stein, 35, said.

That class discomfort goes both ways, according to Grace Savage, a former nanny in Los Angeles. “I think that a deeply institutionalized notion of ‘place’ is to blame,” Ms. Savage, 35, said. “The domestic doesn’t feel welcome in the photo, and the employer feels no inclination to extend such welcome.”

According to Ms. Gold, lifting the veil of secrecy and posting more about nannies on Instagram and Facebook would be a new way to value them, while also getting real with other parents about what it takes for working moms and dads to juggle it all.

“It’s great to say, ‘I have help,’” Ms. Gold said.

Andrea Lavinthal, the style and beauty director at People magazine, is a rare parent who does so on social media. Last week, she posted an Instagram Story of her 1-year-old son, Saxon, perched on the lap of his nanny, Ann Marie, who did not want her last name published.

The rare cache of supercentenarian genomes, the largest yet to be sequenced and made public, comes as studies of garden-variety longevity have yielded few solid clues to healthy aging. Lifestyle and luck, it seems, still factor heavily into why people live into their 90s and 100s.

To the extent that they have a genetic advantage, it appears to come partly from having inherited fewer than usual DNA variations known to raise the risk of heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease and other afflictions.

That is not enough, some researchers say, to explain what they call “truly rare survival,” or why supercentenarians are more uniformly healthy than centenarians in their final months and years.

Rather than having won dozens of hereditary coin tosses with DNA variations that are less bad, scientists suggest, supercentenarians may possess genetic code that actively protects them from aging.

But the effort to find that code has been “challenged,” as a group of leading longevity researchers put it in a recent academic paper, in part by the difficulties in acquiring supercentenarian DNA.

The New England Centenarian Study, one of a handful of longevity research groups around the world focusing on supercentenarians, now turns down prospective DNA donors under age 103: “We tell them they’re too young,” said Dr. Thomas Perls, the study’s director.

The DNA sequences being released this week were acquired almost single-handedly by James Clement, 61, the founder of a company advised by the prominent Harvard geneticist George Church.

A professed citizen-scientist, Mr. Clement collected blood, skin or saliva from supercentenarians in 14 states and seven countries over a six-year period. Many were still gardening, arguing, driving and flirting. Ms. Michelson, for one, was fond of reading and reciting Shakespeare.

The usefulness of such a small group for a genetic study is unclear, which is one reason Mr. Clement’s company, now defunct, has turned into a crowdsourcing project.

Complex traits like height, body mass index and disease risk — phenotypes, as they are known in genetics-speak — typically arise from a combination of hundreds of places in the genome where the DNA alphabet differs between individuals.

Zeroing in on which variations affect which phenotypes requires the statistical power of tens of thousands of DNA samples — almost certainly a dealbreaker when it comes to supercentenarians, whose verified number, worldwide, hovers at around 150.

On large swaths of the planet, where birth records are sketchy or nonexistent, identifying verified supercentenarians is virtually impossible. In the United States, researchers say supercentenarians account for about one in five million people.

Amateur genealogists dedicated to validating the ages of the world’s oldest people estimate that even the unverified total comes to only about 1,000.

Still, some researchers hope that despite the limited number of available genomes, it will be possible to identify the secret sauce of supercentenarians with methods used to uncover the genetic basis for other rare conditions. No one quite knows how many genomes might be necessary.

“This is what we call an ‘extreme phenotype,’ ” said Dr. Church, who ultimately arranged for the genomes to be sequenced so that Mr. Clement could release them through a nonprofit. “The farther out you go on the bell curve, the more likely you are to find something, even with a small sample size.”

As the goal of slowing aging to extend human “health span” has gained traction in the scientific mainstream, research has largely been limited to animal studies.

A secretive Google spinoff called Calico, for California Life Company, is said to be scrutinizing the genome of the naked mole rat, celebrated for a life span 10 times longer than that of most of its rat cousins. Federally funded scientists are testing a drug on monkeys based on an experiment that doubled the lives of roundworms.

And in laboratories across the world, the markers of age in over-the-hill mice, rats and turquoise killifish are, sometimes, being reversed.

But what works in shorter-lived organisms often does not translate to humans, whose average life span in developed countries is approaching 80 years. So despite the limitations of Mr. Clement’s database, several prominent researchers have already expressed interest in it.

“This could show the utility of starting a bigger collection,” said Paola Sebastiani, a longevity researcher at Boston University.

An account of what Mr. Clement calls the Supercentenarian Research Project offers a glimpse at what that might entail, including perseverance, compassion and a sense of humor that trends toward dark.

Life or Death

It was an inauspicious start, Mr. Clement admitted in an email to a friend in January 2011. The first supercentenarian Mr. Clement had lined up to visit, Mississippi Winn, had died at 113 before he could get from his home in San Jose, Calif., to hers in Shreveport, La.

“RIP Miss Winn,” he posted on the Facebook page that family members had set up for Ms. Winn, believed to be the last living child of African-Americans born into slavery.

Such condolences would become a familiar refrain. Of the 70,000 or so Americans who live to be 100, only some two dozen are typically alive at 110.

Once that milestone is reached, as Mr. Clement quickly learned, the chance of dying within the next year is roughly 50 percent. After 113, the odds are closer to 66 percent. The oldest person on record, Jeanne Calment, was 122 when she died in 1997; only one other person is known to have lived beyond age 118.

“Even while you’re packing the car, the person may fall ill and say they’re not up to it,” Mr. Clement said, after the first of several plans for me to observe a DNA donation was abruptly canceled.

Mr. Clement could extract DNA from post-mortem samples, with permission from the family and assuming he could reach the funeral home in time. Exhumation is also possible, in theory, to obtain samples.

But for understandable reasons, he said, family members most often ended communications with him at the time of a supercentenarian’s death. To improve the odds of getting samples — and the gender balance, since supercentenarians are nearly all women — he lowered his target age from 110 to 106.

“It’s better to get there when they’re alive,” he said.

Guided by the World’s Oldest People email list, whose moderator, Robert D. Young, verifies ages on behalf of Guinness World Records and tracks supercentenarians for the Gerontology Research Group, Mr. Clement placed decal dots designating the locations of prospective participants on a map pinned to the wall of his home office.

He created Google alerts for the phrases “109th birthday,” “110th birthday,” and “111th birthday,” and for the obituaries of known supercentenarians.

Unlike so-called blue zones, where centenarians are said to cluster, there is no geographical shortcut for netting supercentenarians. So he called, emailed and sent Facebook friend requests to whatever contacts he could find, wherever he could find them.

A Birthday Invitation

There was, nominally, the prospect of making money.

But with a business plan that, even to some of his investors, sounded more like a research project, Mr. Clement seems to have undertaken the task largely because it provided the chance to act on a longstanding interest in human longevity, including his own.

A self-described transhumanist who eats mostly low-glycemic vegetables and nuts and walks seven miles a day, Mr. Clement has accumulated an eclectic résumé that includes starting a brew pub, practicing international tax law and cofounding a futurist magazine.

He harbors what he prefers to call a “healthy love of life,” rather than an aversion to death, and he is possessed of an apparently genuine conviction that longer lives would make humans more humane.

“My hat was off to someone who was willing to take the time out of his life to go get these precious specimens,” said Dr. Church, the Harvard geneticist, who has devoted a portion of his laboratory to research into the reversal of aging.

The kind of ultrarare mutations that supercentenarians might harbor, Dr. Church believed, were not likely to be detected with standard techniques, which scan only the places in the genome where DNA is already known to vary between individuals.

To look for as-yet-uncataloged variations would require sequencing all of the supercentenarians’ six billion genetic letters, a far more expensive procedure. When he and Mr. Clement first discussed the idea in 2010, the cost was about $50,000 per genome.

But the price was falling. And with the financial support of a handful of like-minded wealthy individuals who agreed to invest in the exploratory phase of the project, “it just seemed,” Mr. Clement said, “like something I could do.”

Even with the Harvard name as a calling card, several of the families he contacted over the next few years did not respond to his inquiries. A few, Mr. Clement knew, had already been approached by laboratories at Stanford and Boston University, which were collecting their own stashes of supercentenarian DNA.

“She already did her DNA donation,” Paul Cooper, the grandson of Besse Cooper, a 116-year-old former suffragist, told Mr. Clement, who had driven several hundred miles to her Monroe, Ga., nursing home in 2012.

Walter Breuning, of Great Falls, Mont., one of just a handful of men known to have lived to 114, replied in late 2010 that it was his preference not to risk winter meetings. He died early the next spring.

An invitation to the 111th birthday party of James Sisnett in Barbados finally served as Mr. Clement’s entree in February 2011. He died two years later.

Mr. Sisnett, who grew his own food until he was 105, was “still fascinated by seeing a nice-looking backside” when he was in his 110s, his daughter, Everine Carter, 88, recalled in a telephone interview.

Losing Precious Samples

The best time to get DNA from a supercentenarian, Mr. Clement found, is midmorning. By lunchtime, they would prefer to be eating. After lunch, they might be groggy or napping.

Most, like Dorothy Peel of London, then 108, had sharp minds. Ms. Peel inspected the informed consent form through her reading glasses and peppered him with questions about other supercentenarians he had met.

Crisscrossing Europe in 2011, Mr. Clement hit his collecting stride. But there were some bumps.

He had ordered an inexpensive kit that allowed him to prick a supercentenarian’s finger and deposit a drop of blood on a card to preserve it, often used by geneticists in the field.

Within a few months he had blood drops from 15 donors, including Ralph Tarrant of Sheffield, England, who at 108 completed the London Times crossword puzzle every afternoon.

Not until he had switched to hiring a phlebotomist to perform blood draws with a needle did he learn that the cards with the original 15 samples were defective. “We could not detect any DNA,” read a 2011 email from the laboratory.

Mr. Clement confessed the news to Dr. Church in a meeting at his Harvard office. “You didn’t test the cards?” the geneticist asked him gently.

Still, Mr. Clement had 23 good samples in hand, and the cost of sequencing by this time had fallen to some $15,000 per genome. With his remaining funds, he sequenced 15, leaving the rest in cold storage.

Mr. Clement quickly discovered 2,500 differences between the supercentenarian DNA and those of controls. But even with help from graduate students in Dr. Church’s lab, it was hard with such a small group to know which, if any, were significant.

So over the next few years, Mr. Clement, working without a salary, collected samples whenever he could, adding another dozen from supercentenarians across the United States.

In the spring of last year, a company Dr. Church had co-founded, Veritas Genetics, announced that it would sequence human genomes for $1,000 each. Dr. Church told Mr. Clement that Veritas would sequence the remaining samples, and so he set out to collect a few more.

Advice From America’s Oldest Man

In July 2016, I was invited to accompany Mr. Clement to Mr. Matthews’s home in California. As much as I looked forward to meeting my first supercentenarian, I was not prepared to envy his win in the genetic longevity lottery.

I had feared he would be lonely, a concern echoed by several of the Facebook viewers who watched me ply him with questions over a live video stream the morning we met. “I don’t want to outlive my friends and family,” one typed. “That’s no fun.”

The prospect of shifting today’s average life span to that of the known limit of all humanity is disorienting. An average life expectancy of 80 in some ways seems generous — it was just 48 when Mr. Matthews was born in 1906. Most of us expect around 80 years on the planet, assuming nothing horrendous happens.

“When you have children the first time, it don’t come with a manual, and it don’t come with a manual when your dad gets to be 100, then 105, then 110,” said Mr. Matthews’s son, Steve, 75, who also gave blood the day we visited.

But Mr. Matthews asserted without hesitation that he still enjoyed life. Pleasures included his lunchtime smoothie, his family, the kindness of his caregiver, and — this with a nod to a New York Times photographer and a rakish grin — “having my picture taken.”

He reminisced fondly about his second wife, Katherine, who died in 1980 and with whom he had loved to dance.

At 110, he said he had never been diagnosed with a serious illness. The younger Mr. Matthews recalled that his father had played a one-under-par, 18-hole golf game on his 99th birthday. Having built a successful real estate business, he provided financial support to his last surviving sibling, a sister who was 105.

Talking to him, it was hard not to fantasize about the possibility that, as another Facebook participant suggested, “by the time we get to that age, we may all be living to 110.”

At the time the oldest man in America, Mr. Matthews sometimes strained to hear, but his sense of humor and perspective were intact. If that was what we wanted, he advised, “Keep breathing.”

Mr. Matthews died this summer. His DNA was sequenced a few weeks later, and last month Mr. Clement uploaded it to the database. Like all normal human genome sequences, the beginning of his first chromosome reads like this:

On the plate, the egg looks like an eye plucked from a baby dragon. The yolk is the green-black of smoked glass, with a gray, nearly calcified halo, trapped in an oval of wobbling amber and emitting the faintest whiff of brimstone.

So begins the $285, 19-course tasting menu at Benu in San Francisco. The egg is a traditional Chinese snack, often called (poetically, if inaccurately) a 1,000-year-old egg, preserved for a few weeks or months in lye or slaked lime, salt and tea. It’s sold by street vendors, tossed into stir-fries and scattered over congee throughout China, parts of Southeast Asia and the world’s Chinatowns. To more than a billion people, it is an utterly commonplace food.

But to present it as an amuse-bouche at one of the most acclaimed fine-dining restaurants in the United States, to a predominantly non-Asian clientele, is radical. For despite America’s long, complicated love affair with Asian cooking, it is hard to imagine such a food, so alien to Western culinary ideals in appearance, aroma, flavor and texture, being served in this kind of setting, let alone embraced, a decade ago.

This, though, is the new American palate. As a nation we were once beholden to the Old World traditions of early settlers; we now crave ingredients from farther shores. The briny rush of soy; ginger’s low burn; pickled cabbage with that heady funk so close to rot. Vinegar applied to everything. Fish sauce like the underbelly of the sea. Palm sugar, velvet to cane sugar’s silk. Coconut milk slowing the tongue. Smoky black cardamom with its menthol aftermath. Sichuan peppercorns that paralyze the lips and turn speech to a burr, and Thai bird chilies that immolate everything they touch. Fat rice grains that cling, that you can scoop up with your hands. (As a child raised in a Filipino-American household, I was bewildered by commercials for Uncle Ben’s rice that promised grains that were “separate, not sticky,” as if that were a good thing.)

These are American ingredients now, part of a movement in cooking that often gets filed under the melting-pot, free-for-all category of New American cuisine. But it’s more specific than that: This is food borne of a particular diaspora, made by chefs who are “third culture kids,” heirs to both their parents’ culture and the one they were raised in, and thus forced to create their own.

Could we call it Asian-American cuisine? The term is problematic, subsuming countries across a vast region with no shared language or single unifying religion. It elides numerous divides: city and countryside, aristocrats and laborers, colonizers and colonized — “fancy Asian” and “jungle Asian,” as the comedian Ali Wong puts it. (She’s speaking specifically of East and Southeast Asians, who followed similar patterns of immigration to the U.S. and who are the primary focus of this piece.) As a yoke of two origins, it can also be read as an impugning of loyalties and as a code for “less than fully American.” When I asked American chefs of Asian heritage whether their cooking could be considered Asian-American cuisine, there was always a pause, and sometimes a sigh.

But this is what happens in America: Borders blur. When there aren’t many of you — Americans of Asian descent are only 6 percent of the population, a legacy of decades of immigration quotas and denial of citizenship — you find common cause with your neighbors. The term Asian-American was not imposed on us, like “Yellow Peril” in the late 19th century or “Oriental”; it was coined in the 1960s by Yuji Ichioka, a California-born historian and civil rights activist, to give us a political voice. If we call this kind of cooking just American, something is lost.

The rise of contemporary Asian-American cuisine began with Korean-American chef David Chang’s Momofuku Noodle Bar , which opened in New York in 2004 and was followed four years later by fellow Korean-American chef Roy Choi’s Kogi BBQ truck in Los Angeles. Their approach to cooking is typically, reductively, framed as an East-meets-West marriage of big flavors and elevated (i.e., French) technique — as if every Asian cuisine were hellbent on storming the palate (some, like Cantonese, are, in fact, renowned for their subtlety); as if culinary refinement were proprietary to the West.

But the history of Asian-American cuisine goes further back than that, to the first tearooms and banquet halls set up by Chinese immigrants who came to seek their fortune in Gold Rush California in the 1850s. By the end of the 19th century, despite Congress’s passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 and attempts to condemn San Francisco’s Chinatown as a threat to the American way of life — “in their quarters all civilization of the white race ceases,” declared a pamphlet published by the Workingmen’s Party of California in 1880 — Cantonese restaurants were all the rage in New York. The food was cheap and fast, swiftly stir-fried in woks, a technique that remained a mystery for decades to most in the West. (One journalist, touring a Chinatown kitchen in 1880, did wonder if “the funny little things we saw at the bottom of a deep earthen jar were rat’s-tails skinned.”)

When outsiders came flocking in the 1890s, Chinese chefs altered and invented dishes to please them. This was less concession than calculation, capitalizing on opportunity. The work of immigrants — in food as in the arts — has always been dogged by accusations of impurity and inauthenticity, suggesting that there is one standard, preserved in amber, for what a dish should be or what a writer or artist with roots in another country should have to say. It’s a specious argument, as if being born into a culture were insufficient bona fides to speak of it. (Immigrants are always being asked to show their papers, in more ways than one.) The history of food, like the history of man, is a series of adaptations, to environment and circumstance. Recipes aren’t static. Immigrant cooks, often living in poverty, have always made do with what’s on hand, like the Japanese-Americans rounded up and shipped to internment camps during the Second World War, who improvised rice balls with rations of Spam, and the Korean and Filipino-Americans who, having survived on canned goods in the aftermath of war, eked out household budgets by deploying hot dogs in kimbap and banana-ketchup spaghetti.

Sometimes the nostalgia for this kind of food can be difficult to convey to those who don’t share the same history. At Bad Saint , a Filipino restaurant in Washington, D.C., the chef Tom Cunanan makes adobo with pig tails, a cheap, snubbed part of the animal that was treasured by Depression-era Filipino immigrants working in California labor camps. Diep Tran, the Vietnamese-American chef of Good Girl Dinette in Los Angeles, told me that she wishes she could serve a breakfast of nothing but baguette accompanied by condensed milk diluted with hot water, for dipping. “It’s refugee food,” she said. “Proustian, kind of like Spam. But people get upset; they think they’re being ripped off.”

Almost every Asian-American chef I spoke to — most of whom are in their late 20s to early 40s — came to the U.S. as children or were born to parents who were immigrants. (In 1952, the last racial barriers to naturalization were lifted, and in 1965, immigration quotas based on national origin — for Asia, 100 visas per country per year — were abolished.) Almost all had stories of neighbors alarmed by the smells from their families’ kitchens or classmates recoiling from their lunchboxes. “I was that kid, with farty-smelling food,” said Jonathan Wu, the Chinese-American chef at Nom Wah Tu in New York. “I still feel that, if I’m taking the train with garlic chives in my bag.”

So these chefs’ cooking, born of shame, rebellion and reconciliation, is not some wistful ode to an imperfectly remembered or never-known, idealized country. It’s a mixture of nostalgia and resilience. It wasn’t taught — certainly not in the way other cuisines have been traditionally taught. Graduates of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., recalled that little time was devoted to Asian cooking; at Le Cordon Bleu in London and in Paris, none. One instructor took offense when Preeti Mistry, whose Indian-inflected restaurants include Juhu Beach Club in Oakland, Calif., likened a French stew to curry. Another told David Chang that pork stock, essential to tonkotsu ramen, was “disgusting.”

Neither does their cooking have much kinship with the “fusion” cuisine of the early 1990s, when non-Asian chefs like Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Gray Kunz began folding Eastern ingredients into otherwise Western dishes. (“Fusion” is another term that sits uneasily with Asian-American chefs. “I wouldn’t call myself ‘fusion,’ ” said Maiko Kyogoku, the owner of the idiosyncratic Bessou in New York. “To describe food that way? It’s an extension of myself.”) In spirit, Asian-American cooking is closer to other American-born cuisines with tangled roots: the Lowcountry cooking of coastal South Carolina, which owes a debt to slaves from West Africa who brought over one-pot stews and ingredients like okra, peanuts and black-eyed peas; and Tex-Mex, which is not a bastardization of Mexican food but a regional variant of it, cultivated by Tejanos, descendants of Hispanics who lived in Texas when it was part of Mexico and, before that, New Spain.

There’s also no one cultural touchstone or trauma that binds Asian immigrants: no event on a national scale that has brought us together. But part of what distinguishes our experience from that of other immigrants and people of color is the fraught, intimate relationship between our countries of origin and the U.S., which has been foe and protector, oppressor and liberator, feared and adored. In 1899, the British writer Rudyard Kipling urged the U.S. to “take up the White Man’s burden” in the Philippines after the Spanish-American War:

Go send your sons to exile

To serve your captives’ need

[...] Your new-caught, sullen peoples,

Half devil and half child.

This begot more than a century of American military intervention in East and Southeast Asia, and a history of conflicting images: Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima; the Vietcong in black pajamas and the American atrocities at My Lai; teeming refugee camps and smiling American G.I.s handing out candy, decade after decade, to throngs of dark-haired, starving children.

Any immigrant is an outsider at first. But for Asians in America, there is a starker sense of otherness. We don’t fit in to the American binary of white and black. We have been the enemy; the subjugated; the “lesser” peoples whose scramble for a foothold in society was historically seen as a menace to the American order. And yet we’ve also been the “good” immigrants, proving ourselves worthy of American beneficence — polite, humble, grateful, willing to work 20-hour days running a grocery store or a laundry or a restaurant that will never be “authentic” enough, to spend every dime on our children’s test prep so that they get into the best schools, because we believe in the promise of America, that if you work hard, you can become anyone. If you try hard enough, you might even be mistaken for white.

Among the children of immigrants, Asians in America seem most caught in a state of limbo: no longer beholden to their parents’ countries of origin but still grasping for a role in the American narrative. There is a unique foreignness that persists, despite the presence of Asians on American soil for more than two centuries; none of us, no matter how bald our American accent, has gone through life without being asked, “Where are you from? I mean, originally?” But while this can lead to alienation, it can also have a liberating effect. When you are raised in two cultures at once — when people see in you two heritages at odds, unresolved, in abeyance — you learn to shift at will between them. You may never feel like you quite belong in either, but neither are you fully constrained. The acute awareness of borders (culinary as well as cultural) that both enclose and exclude, allows, paradoxically, a claim to borderlessness, taking freely from both sides to forge something new. For Asian-American chefs, this seesaw between the obligations of inheritance and the thrill of go-it-aloneness, between respecting your ancestors and lighting out for the hills, manifests in dishes that arguably could come only from minds fluent in two ways of life.

Thus the kaiseki at Niki Nakayama’s n/naka , in Los Angeles, always includes a pasta course. Her slyly voluptuous “carbonara” of abalone livers and egg yolks is a homage to Tokyo-style wafu spaghetti with briny pickled cod roe — only here it’s capped with shaved truffles. At Tao Yuan , in Brunswick, Me., Cara Stadler takes tiles of goat cheese made by a local creamery and sears them, as is done in Yunnan, to approximate rubing, a sturdy farmer’s cheese. But instead of merely sprinkling the cheese with sugar or salt, she counters its meatiness with a bright grace note of mint and watermelon from summer’s height. A Caesar salad might be supplanted by a canoe of romaine, grilled for a hint of smoke and loaded with dainty jako (dried baby sardines) and quail eggs as anchors, as at Bessou in New York. Or, as re-envisioned by Chris Kajioka at Senia , in Honolulu, it might be a mossy cliff of charred cabbage — a wink at an iceberg wedge — dusted with shio kombu (shredded kelp boiled in soy and mirin), soaked through with dashi and ginger, and surrounded by daubs of heady green goddess dressing and buttermilk turned to gel. It’s not so much a salad as a cheeky biography of it by the barbarian at the gates, achieving the quintessence of an American classic through Asian ingredients.

And while Asian-American cooking may not be expressed in or identified by a single set of flavors, one thing that does unite such disparate traditions is an emphasis on textures. Indeed, if the cuisine can be said to have revolutionized American food, it’s by introducing unfamiliar mouth feels — crackle where one doesn’t expect it, slime in a country that’s always shied away from that sensation — into our culinary vocabulary. Justin Yu, who recently opened Theodore Rex in Houston, rhapsodizes about “the crunch that you can hear in the back of your head”; unrendered, gelatinous animal skin, “a fun burst of fat and softness”; broths barely skimmed, or with a spoonful of fat added “to coat the lips.” The maverick Katsuya Fukushima, of Daikaya in Washington, D.C., once turned natto — a gooey, slippery skein of fermented soybeans, with the perfume of castoff socks — into an earthy caramel over soft-serve. Like Latin-American food, which made Americans crave heat, Asian-American cuisine has made “difficult” textures not only desirable but as integral to food as flavor itself. That certain ingredients still make some Western diners squeamish is part of its provocative fun.

But the question remains: Does calling this kind of cooking Asian-American cuisine deepen and contextualize our understanding of it, or is it just a label, like speaking of Asian-American art or fiction — a way of simplifying a complex story and making it a marketable cliché? The danger is fetishizing Asian features, a tendency that diminishes: If you are an exotic object or phenomenon, you may never become recognized or acknowledged as more. “White chefs are using these ingredients and saying, ‘Oh, it’s so strange,’ ” Tin Vuong, of Little Sister in Los Angeles, said. “It isn’t.” Instead of a historical matrix of Asian culinary traditions, “young cooks just see a big pantry,” Fukushima said. “Take a little bit of this, a little bit of that — there’s no soul to it.”

Chang believes that food “has the potential to sort of show that we’re all the same.” But even he isn’t entirely comfortable with the ubiquity of kimchi. “Let’s say you spent no time in Asia, you just found a recipe on YouTube,” he said. “That’s appropriation. It’s not about skin color. You have to have a story, pay respect to what it was and what it means.” At the same time, it seems reductive to expect Asian-American chefs to make food that somehow reflects their personal “story.” On season three of “Top Chef,” Hung Huynh, a Vietnamese-American contestant, was faulted for cooking that was technically dazzling but lacked explicit reference to his roots. “You were born in Vietnam,” Tom Colicchio, the head judge, said. “I don’t see any of that in your food.” (It’s hard not to hear an echo of the trope of the inscrutable Oriental, whose motives can’t be deciphered, and the common criticism of Asian-Americans at school and at work as being overly cerebral and lacking feeling.) The strictures of reality TV do demand a baring of the soul, but not all Asian-American chefs want to work with Asian flavors — and when they do, it’s not always in expected ways.

Must every Italian chef make lasagna, every French chef coq au vin? Anita Lo, who closed her fine-dining restaurant Annisa in New York earlier this year, cooked there for 17 years without fealty to one region or cultural tradition. This puzzled some diners. “I had someone come in and say, ‘Where’s the big Buddha head?’ ” she said. When publications request recipes and she submits one without Asian ingredients, the response is often, “We were really hoping for something Asian” — or Asian-ish: Anything with soy, apparently, will do. “I send in Japanese, which isn’t even my background, but that works,” she said.

Corey Lee’s “Benu” cookbook is filled with stories: of his grandmother foraging for acorns; of his mother forcing him to drink a tonic of brewed deer’s antlers; of his father bringing home live lobster for his son’s birthday, and of the joys of eating tomalley (the wet gray-green paste that acts as a lobster’s liver and pancreas) on buttered bread. All suggest that Lee’s dishes, however rarefied, are also deeply autobiographical. But Lee demurs, the way a novelist might, fending off a critic’s attempt to find in his books correlations to actual events, wanting them to stand alone as fully imagined works of art. “There’s great pressure for chefs to have a story,” he said. “Maybe there’s no story beyond, ‘I want to serve this food and it tastes good.’ ”

It’s the eternal plea of the minority, to ask to be judged not by one’s appearance or the rituals of one’s forbears but for the quality of one’s mind and powers of invention. Certainly our country was predicated on the right to shed one’s past and be reborn, to come from nothing and work your way up; in this, Asians may be among the most American of Americans. But why is the choice always between exotic caricature or rootlessness? The philosopher Slavoj Zizek argues that the embrace of “ethnic” restaurants is merely “tolerance” of a “folklorist Other deprived of its substance”: “The ‘real Other’ is by definition ‘patriarchal,’ ‘violent,’ never the Other of ethereal wisdom and charming customs.” Too often Asian-American chefs are presumed to double as educators or ambassadors, representing an entire race, culture or cuisine.

In the end, doesn’t it matter — not to others, but to ourselves — where we are from? And no, I don’t mean “originally.” I mean the forces that made us: the immigrants who raised us, with all their burdens and expectations, their exhortations to fit in but never forget who we are; and the country we grew up in, that is our only home, that taught us we are “other” but also seems, in some confused, tentative way, to want to learn something from us.

For Asian-American chefs, this is the conundrum, and the opportunity. The foods of their childhoods were once mocked and rejected by their non-Asian peers (and by their ashamed or rebellious younger selves); then accepted in dilute, placating form; and now are able to command audiences who clamor for their sensations and aggressive flavors, and who might be unnerved if they knew exactly what they were putting in their mouths. What may be most radical about Asian-American cuisine is the attitude that informs and powers it, reflecting a new cockiness in a population that has historically kept quiet and encouraged to lay low. It’s food that celebrates crunchy cartilage and gelatinous ooze, that openly stinks, that declares: This is what I like to eat. What about you? Do you dare?

The school did not reply to questions about the case, including whether the administration was aware of the trooper’s conclusion. The academy recently entered into an agreement with the police to comply with state reporting requirements, and go beyond them.

Neither of the deans, Arthur J. Cosgrove and Melissa D. Mischke, responded to emails seeking comment.

Like St. Paul’s School in Concord, N.H.; St. George’s School in Middletown, R.I.; Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass.; Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, Conn., and many other prestigious prep schools, Phillips Exeter has been reeling from revelations of sexual misconduct, and questions about whether the school properly handled them.

In most cases, the accusations have involved teachers preying on students. This year, a former Phillips Exeter admissions officer pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a 14-year-old prospective student in the 1970s, and the academy said that an investigation had revealed credible allegations against three former teachers and a former school psychologist. Last year, the school fired a teacher for sexual misconduct with a student, and revealed that another teacher, after admitting to such misconduct, had been allowed to retire quietly and for years remained a presence on campus, with emeritus status.

While some accused of abuse have been prosecuted, it is rare for school administrators who failed to report misconduct to face any legal penalty.

In the case described in the state police report, Michael W. Jones, an alumnus who has been a leading critic of the academy’s handling of sexual abuse cases, said it was “outrageous” that the two deans still had their administrative positions, and that the school had not addressed the matter in more detail. “There should be transparency and consequences,” he said.

The 17-year-old girl’s lawyer, Carmen Durso, declined to comment.

When The Boston Globe reported last year on the girl’s groping allegation and the way it was handled by the school, the news prompted a strong backlash among alumni, many of whom said they would withhold donations to the academy. In a statement, the academy said that “without question, the situation could and should have been handled in a better way,” but it did not say explicitly what had been done wrong, or by whom. Until now, the police account of the deans’ response to the groping allegation, and the trooper’s desire to charge the deans, had not been publicly known.

The state police report shows that the two female students met in October 2015 with Mr. Cosgrove, dean of residential life; Ms. Mischke, dean of students; and a teacher who was the younger student’s faculty adviser and who had encouraged her to go to the deans. The police report includes the two accusers’ and the faculty adviser’s descriptions of the meeting; the two deans declined to be interviewed by investigators.

The younger accuser said that days before she went to the deans, a popular male senior texted her that it was his 18th birthday, and asked her to meet him in the church basement, a quiet place where students sometimes studied, and which he was assigned to monitor. There, she said, he touched her buttocks and breasts and kissed her, even as she repeatedly told him not to, until she left.

The other accuser recounted a similar incident in the same place with the same male student, who she said put his hands under her shirt and touched her breasts, prompting her to leave.

A state law mandates that anyone in a long list of positions, including school officials, “having reason to suspect” sexual abuse of a person under age 18, which it defines very broadly, must report it to the state Department of Health and Human Services.

The girl said that the month after their first meeting, she asked Mr. Cosgrove what punishment her classmate had received, and he declined to tell her. Several months later, the girl felt unsafe with the male student still on campus, and showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, her faculty adviser told investigators. In April 2016, they met again with the two deans.

In both the October and April meetings, the teacher said, when the girl described what had happened to her as an “assault,” Mr. Cosgrove corrected her, saying that it was just harassment.

After the second meeting, the girl went to the police, and prosecutors soon charged the male student, Chukwudi Ikpeazu, with misdemeanor sexual assault. But a year later, in July 2017, as his trial was about to begin, they set aside the charge, and if he meets certain conditions — which have not been made public — prosecutors will drop the case.

Mark Cuban, whose disdain for President Trump is so acute that he is considering running for president himself in 2020 as a Republican because it “means you get to go head-on with Trump right in the primaries — and so there’s nothing I’d have more fun doing.” Still, though, he said he believes the economy is in good enough shape that when it comes to investing in the stock market, “I just, you know, I just let it ride.”

Mr. Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said he keeps a small amount of cash on hand as a precaution. “I keep a little bit, you know, as a hedge. I call it my ‘Trump hedge’ because you just never know. Now 280 characters can change the market in a heartbeat,” he said, not-so-jokingly alluding to the new character limit on Twitter, Mr. Trump’s communication tool of choice.

Measuring confidence, is of course, a subjective matter. There are dozens of surveys of chief executives and others asking them how “confident” they feel. Earlier this year, The Conference Board reported that chief executives’ confidence had reached 2008 pre-recession highs in the first quarter, though more recent surveys have showed a slight waning.

Still, merger activity, which this column has long argued is the purest measure of confidence — since most executives only do deals when they are genuinely confident in their own business and the economic environment — has reached a record high. It bolted in the past several months after what seemed like a surprisingly lackluster beginning of the year as executives appeared to be paralyzed by a sense of uncertainty, trying to gauge the first steps of a new president.

It appears that chief executives have found themselves certain that whatever “uncertainty” exists isn’t that uncertain after all.

Still, there are pockets of the economy that are causing anxiety. “The last two or three years have not been fun whatsoever,” Mickey Drexler, the chairman of J. Crew, said at the conference about the traditional retail business, which has been upended by Amazon and changes in consumer behavior. “It’s been miserable.” Those challenges are extending to mall owners and commercial real estate, too.

The question is whether all the enthusiastic talk from chief executives is reflective of a truly robust economy or whether we are missing something.

“There’s so many people talking about the record level of the stock market. The stock market is not a proxy for the economy of America,” said Howard Schultz, executive chairman of Starbucks. “I’m deeply concerned about the millions of Americans who are not participating in the economy.”

That may be worth remembering. If there is a lesson in having confidence, especially when everyone else is feeling that way, it is that it can quickly reverse.

“In the aftermath of corporate and public-sector disasters, it often emerges that participants fell prey to a collective form of willful blindness and overconfidence: mounting warning signals were systematically cast aside or met with denial, evidence avoided or selectively reinterpreted, dissenters shunned,” Roland Bénabou a professor at Princeton University wrote in a seminal work on confidence and groupthink. “Market bubbles and manias exhibit the same pattern of investors acting ’colorblind in a sea of red flags,’ followed by a crash.”",Navigating a Breathtaking Level of Global Economic Change,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/business/dealbook/navigating-global-economic-change.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

“This is what we’re up against,” Stu grouses, retelling the tale.

Perhaps best known now as the deposed creator of “Smash,” Ms. Rebeck has long made her way through the man’s world of both theater and television. I remember hearing a male theater director, years ago, disparage her in glaringly misogynistic language — a tipoff that his judgment reflected him more than her. So she understands this terrain from the inside.

As sitcomish as it sometimes feels, “What We’re Up Against” has a complex view of its characters and their dynamics. Janice (Marg Helgenberger) has been at the firm for years, and before Eliza’s arrival she was its only woman architect. (The unseen support staff is, she notes, all female.)

Janice recognizes the structural flaws in the office culture, but like a lot of people who find themselves the sole representative of a demographic group, she opts not to dwell on them. She gets along by not threatening the men — keeping her expectations low, her comments flattering and her work mediocre. Also, she dresses like a librarian. (The costumes, which don’t always nail the era, are by Tilly Grimes.)

Eliza hopes that Janice will be an ally. Janice, halfheartedly gaslighting her, hopes that Eliza will tone it down. She doesn’t, and that’s the fun of Ms. Rebeck’s revenge fantasy, which lets no one off the hook for their bad behavior.

The cast is an impressive assemblage of talent, and Ms. Rodriguez and Ms. Helgenberger both do fine. Oddly, though, the flashiest roles belong to men: the showboating worm Weber and, especially, the toxic Stu — hardly the only villain here, but the one with the most power, and he relishes abusing it.

Playing Stu is a tricky challenge that Mr. Young expertly meets, giving a comic performance with just enough bite that we can’t dismiss Stu as a buffoon. His body language — the way he cringes in not-so-mock fear when he talks about Eliza — is like a cry straight from his psyche.

But Ben (Jim Parrack), a project leader at the firm, is more insidiously harmful. A casual sexist, he’s also a pragmatist, and good work is his principal concern. He knows Eliza could help with that, but he’s not the kind of guy to make waves. Instead he goes along.

In the production’s bi-level set, by Narelle Sissons, we get a cross-section view of the office. With lumber and metal seams exposed at the edges, we see how this structure was built. It’s a metaphor for what Ms. Rebeck’s play does: rips away the smooth surfaces and lays bare the skeleton, where it’s plain that the rot is in the bones.","Review: ‘What We’re Up Against,’ a Sexism Story More Timely Than Ever",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/theater/review-what-were-up-against-theresa-rebeck-marg-helgenberger.html

Researchers said the emissions growth was driven largely by increased burning of coal in China and India.

“The question is not if we will continue to use coal, but how,” said Holly Krutka, vice president of coal generation and emissions technologies at Peabody Energy.

Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who has spent tens of millions of dollars on a campaign to shut down coal plants, said, “Promoting coal at a climate summit is like promoting tobacco at a cancer summit.” Mr. Bloomberg, who is attending part of the Bonn conference, this week donated $50 million to environmental groups to help countries shift away from coal, starting in Europe.

While many energy experts agree that technologies like carbon capture for coal plants and nuclear power can play a critical role in reducing emissions, the fact that Trump administration officials have played down concern over global warming has triggered deep suspicion about American intentions.

“Nuclear and carbon capture are critical to reducing CO 2 emissions, but going to Bonn to promote the technologies without admitting climate change is a crisis is a logical absurdity,” said Josh Freed, director of the clean energy program at the centrist think tank Third Way.

He said that denying that climate change is a problem while pushing technology to solve it made no sense. “Why would anyone trust or work with you?” he said.

Several American lawmakers who flew to Germany for the climate change talks denounced the coal discussion. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, a Democrat, pre-empted the White House event by striding into the packed conference room and calling it a “sideshow” that the rest of the world would ignore.

“It’s a total distraction,” said Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank based in Washington.

Still, Mr. Steer acknowledged, countries throughout Asia and Africa are continuing to build coal plants in their quest to provide energy access for millions living without electricity. “This is not wickedness on the part of these countries that want to get cheaper energy,” he said.

Trump administration officials made a similar point. “We need to lift one billion plus people out of energy poverty,” Mr. Banks said. He argued that while renewable energy has a “bright future,” only fossil fuels at the moment can deliver enough energy to allow people to rise out of poverty.

Yet even as the Trump administration pushes for a revival of the coal industry, other countries say they are phasing it out. France has vowed to eliminate coal from its electricity mix by 2022, and Italy by 2025. The United Kingdom and Canada said this week that they, too, would take steps to phase out coal.

“We’re passed the time that we want to be using coal,” said Catherine McKenna, Canada’s environment minister. “People do not want polluting coal. They do not want it.”

Some developing countries described a more balanced view, however, conceding a need for fossil fuels in the short term while ultimately calling for stronger global action on climate change and a shift toward cleaner forms of energy, including renewables like wind and solar energy.

Officials from Bangladesh, which still gets most of its electricity from natural gas and has plans to build 25 new coal-fired plants by 2022, said they would welcome the use of technology to improve the efficiency of their coal plants as a steppingstone toward renewable energy.

“Keep in mind that this is a developing country that has a huge need” for electricity, said Muhammad Azizul Haque, a deputy secretary in Bangladesh’s Environment Ministry. “So there has to be balance, it’s not just saying, O.K., we’ll go for renewables. It’s very complicated, because people need energy.”

Pakistan, for its part, has begun importing more liquefied natural gas in order to reduce its reliance on burning coal and oil for electricity, said Tariq Banuri, executive director of Pakistan’s Global Change Impact Study Center. Those imports have helped offset 1 percent of the country’s emissions.

Mr. Banuri said that Pakistan’s emissions were likely to grow in the coming decades as it lifts itself out of poverty, though the country is also making a big push on renewable energy and could do more if wealthier nations provided more aid to help drive down the cost of wind and solar even further.

But any nuanced discussions of energy policy were overshadowed by anger at the Trump administration for disengaging from the global community on climate change.

But when Mr. Schein saw it, he immediately believed that the man holding the guitar was Johnson.
With help from Tom Crandall, a friend in the store’s repair shop, Mr. Schein won the auction in 2005.
Mr. Schein has been unable to look for other photos taken by Johnnie Mae Crowder.","The deal was done at a crossroads.

There, according to legend, the bluesman Robert Johnson sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for otherworldly musical prowess — guitar playing, singing and songwriting that would make him an idol, still studied and revered almost 80 years after his death.

Zeke Schein came to a crossroads, too, when he bought an old photo (Slide 1) that he believes is only the third known image of Johnson. Johnson’s family, a prominent forensic expert and musicians who’ve been transformed by the bluesman’s recordings agreed with Mr. Schein. But skeptics questioned the likeness, the date — even Mr. Schein’s motives.

Intent on defending himself and the image, Mr. Schein began a journey to learn more about the sharp-dressed men in the sepia print. He chronicles his search in “Portrait of a Phantom: The Story of Robert Johnson’s Lost Photograph,” a book he co-wrote with Poppy Z. Brite, recently published by Pelican.

He talked about the book at another crossroads, Matt Umanov Guitars, a Greenwich Village landmark where he has worked since 1989. He wrote that the store is such a magnet that “if you sit at the front counter of Matt Umanov Guitars, the world comes to you.” Since we began this conversation Matt decided to close the store after 53 years. Zeke put on his walking shoes, and moved on to Rudy’s, his next crossroads.

Mr. Schein discovered the photo while searching for old guitars on eBay. The 3-inch-by-4-inch print from sheet film wasn’t in great shape – “The photo looked haunted, like it had been to hell and back,” he wrote. But when Mr. Schein saw it, he immediately believed that the man holding the guitar was Johnson.

With help from Tom Crandall, a friend in the store’s repair shop, Mr. Schein won the auction in 2005. Mr. Schein was familiar with vintage and vernacular photography. He makes photographs as well as plays music, with a deep appreciation of the tools of each form, since before selling guitars, he’d sold cameras and worked in a lab. He immediately thought the image was a contact print from sheet film, likely done with a Speed Graphic, because of the sharpness.

“Looking at the paper,” Mr. Schein said, “I could tell it was that cheaper, crumbly paper that you would see in old photo albums, photos of maybe my grandparents and even early photos of my father would be on that type of paper.” He dated it to the 1930s. Johnson died in 1938.

Photo

“And then if you look at the print, if you see it online, you’ll see that the edges are black,” Mr. Schein said. “It’s not masked. So you’re not seeing white edging on there — you’re seeing what looks like a negative which was laid down flat.” (A negative’s clear edge comes out black on a contact-sheet print.)

Mr. Schein also guessed that the man in the lighter suit in the photo was Johnny Shines, another blues legend who died in 1992. Mr. Schein later learned of a documentary about Johnson, “Can’t You Hear the Wind Howl?” in which Shines said that there was a photo of him and Johnson taken in 1937 by a photographer named Johnnie Mae Crowder in Hughes, Ark., and that it ran in a local newspaper. If the two were posing for a newspaper photographer, she might very well have used a Speed Graphic, which was standard equipment then.

After showing the photo to friends and musicians who, like Mr. Schein, knew intimately the details of the two authenticated photos of Johnson, many agreed that he’d discovered a third image. Trouble was, when he showed the photo to two old Delta bluesmen, David “Honeyboy” Edwards and Robert Lockwood Jr., who’d both known Johnson, neither of them recognized the man holding the guitar.

Skeptics questioned whether the photo was from the 1930s, since it looked as if the man on the right wore a zoot suit, a 1940s fashion fad featuring wide lapels and shoulders and high-waisted baggy pants. But the style was based on the “drape suit” worn by African-Americans a decade earlier; in the 1933 film “International House,” Cab Calloway’s band wore similar suits.

Some also have suggested that the photo was reversed, since the man in the light suit wore his watch on his right wrist and the man in the dark suit has a pocket square on the right side of his jacket, rather than the left. If the photo is flipped, this meant Johnson is holding the guitar as a left-handed player, not a righty. But since the guitar is stringless, it could have been a studio prop, so it wouldn’t matter how Johnson held it.

More people joined the search. Frank DiGiacomo, who wrote about Mr. Schein’s photo for Vanity Fair in 2008, showed a copy to Claud Johnson, Robert’s son, who agreed that it was his father.

A lawyer for the Johnson estate sent a copy of the photo to Lois Gibson, a forensic specialist who had identified the sailor in Alfred Eisenstaedt’s famous image of a sailor kissing a nurse in Times Square at the end of World War II. She said that the man holding the guitar in Mr. Schein’s photo appeared to be Johnson.

The Vanity Fair piece seemed only to spur attacks on the photo and criticism of Mr. Schein, with some accusing him of pushing it for financial gain, even though he’d assigned the copyright to the Johnson estate.

“We do all share a love of that music and we all play it, including writers and historians who decided to attack what I was doing and also question the integrity — my integrity — in what I was doing and that of the Johnson family,” Mr. Schein said. “They were accusing us of only being in it for money, which was never the goal for either of us. I needed to at least explain my position, why I cared so much about trying to put out a musician’s image who affected me.”

Despite years of investigations, more needs to be done. Mr. Schein has been unable to look for other photos taken by Johnnie Mae Crowder. “I stumbled on this one,“ he said. “I don’t have the skill set to go further than I did.”

But maybe you do.

“In a wild-hopes situation — wildest hopes — I hope someone reads my story and has the knowledge and experience to take my research and what I’ve been able to do a step further.”

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

It was not clear whether that was a good thing or a bad one.

“Really hard,” Mr. Trump told journalists along for the ride.
As she gazed out pensively in the waning afternoon light, photographers snapped pictures of Mrs. Trump, a former fashion model, that looked worthy of a magazine spread.
“This is beautiful,” Mrs. Trump said according to an aide who was with her.","His go-it-alone approach may also undermine Mr. Trump’s own efforts, laid out in a forceful speech in Seoul, South Korea, to unite the world against the nuclear threat from North Korea.

Still, the president, citing the lavish receptions he received at every stop, treated friendly photo opportunities as goals in and of themselves.

“It’s been very epic,” Mr. Trump said. “There’s nobody that I can think of that I don’t have a very good relationship with.”

In Beijing, Mr. Xi treated his American counterpart to what Mr. Trump called a “state-plus-plus” visit, complete with a sunset tour of the Forbidden City and a grand welcome ceremony in front of the Great Hall of the People. Mr. Trump scarcely mentioned concerns about China’s poor record on human rights and democracy, nor did he insist that journalists be able to ask questions of the two leaders when they faced the press.

In Tokyo, Mr. Trump played golf with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who gave him gilded baseball hats that said “Donald and Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater.” They fed koi together at the Akasaka Palace in Tokyo, an episode that sparked a social media craze after video circulated of Mr. Abe tossing the last of his food at the fish and Mr. Trump, in turn, dumping his.

Through it all, Mr. Trump appeared to be making an effort to be a good sport. He joined other leaders in donning the matching, culturally appropriate shirts that are slightly silly staples of Asian summitry: an electric-blue silk one at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Da Nang, Vietnam, and a white sheer embroidered one in Manila at the gathering of the Association of South East Asian Nations. In Manila, he grimaced while jostling with Southeast Asian leaders for an awkward cross-armed handshake that was captured in a group photograph.

Asked about the single biggest accomplishment of his trip, Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One on his way home: “I think we made a lot of progress, just in terms of relationship.”

Mr. Trump will have you know he isn’t tired

It was Day 9 of his 12-day slog through Asia, and President Trump felt like gloating.

“Anybody that took the bet, pick up your money, O.K.?” he told reporters traveling with him from Da Nang to Hanoi, Vietnam.

“A lot of people said it’s almost physically impossible for someone to go through 12 days,” he added.

Mr. Trump, of course, is not just someone. He is a president who, at age 71, eschews physical exercise, covets his own bed and is a lover of junk food and red meat. Even some of the president’s own aides feared he might be laid low by a trip spanning five countries half a world away from home.

“Really hard,” Mr. Trump told journalists along for the ride.

White House officials, who had initially urged Mr. Trump to cut the tour into two separate trips to Asia, took pains to ease the load for the president. They built down time into his schedule almost every afternoon and made sure he had access, where possible, to familiar foods. Twice — as he was heading to Hanoi, and then from there to Manila — they diverted Air Force One on circuitous routes to allow Mr. Trump to depart earlier than planned from one stop and still stay on schedule for the next.

The president, though, did not take kindly to any hint that he might not be up to the journey. On Sunday, he chafed when North Korea’s state-run news agency responded to his Seoul speech by calling Mr. Trump a “lunatic old man.”

“Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ‘old’ when I would NEVER call him ‘short and fat?’ ” Mr. Trump shot back on Twitter, referring to the North Korean leader.

Even as Mr. Trump showed the first signs of fatigue at summit meetings during the final two days, he made sure other leaders took note of his staying power.

“We’ve had 12 days — I don’t know, how many days have you had there?” he said, turning to Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India at the start of their meeting on Monday.

He also made a point of noting that the press corps traveling with him was looking somewhat ragged.

“My press — I feel so sorry for them, they’re exhausted,” the president said as he departed midway through the summit meetings in Manila on Tuesday, skipping a group photograph and plenary session. “Would you like to stop in another couple of countries? Because we can do that if you want.”

The first lady tours a big, beautiful wall

Melania Trump looked lonely.

Trading her trademark stiletto heels for a pair of nude flats, Mrs. Trump spent a solitary afternoon last week pacing the Great Wall of China without her husband — a lover of big, beautiful walls himself — who had skipped a visit to one of the Seven Wonders of the World to move on to several days of summit meetings in Southeast Asia.

So Mrs. Trump struck out on her own, taking a cable car to the Mutianyu section of the ancient structure, then striding along the top with only a tour guide, an aide and a clutch of Secret Service agents for company. As she gazed out pensively in the waning afternoon light, photographers snapped pictures of Mrs. Trump, a former fashion model, that looked worthy of a magazine spread.

Reporters, as usual for this first lady and others, were kept at a far distance.

“This is beautiful,” Mrs. Trump said according to an aide who was with her. “This is amazing.”

1977年，“性骚扰”这个词还没有法律上的定义，也几乎没有进入公共词汇。而如今，虽然相关讨论已经出现了深刻的转变，但是重读《女士杂志》的那篇文章，似曾相识之感依然萦绕不去。

《女士杂志》1977年11月刊的封面故事是关于性骚扰的。

它描述了一名行政助理在上司要求她给自己进行口交后辞职；一名学生在遭到指导老师骚扰后退学；一名黑人医疗助理的白人主管问她所在社区的女性是否卖淫，后来又问她是否愿意和他以及其他几名同事进行群交。

那篇文章还提到了一项调查，88%的女性表示，她们在工作中遭到了性骚扰。作者认为，这个问题几乎渗透到了每一个行业中，但在“外表最光鲜的表演行业”尤为严重，好莱坞的试镜沙发依然是一项“深厚的传统”。

“我们到目前为止所看到的只是冰山一角，”文章说，“而这座冰山非常庞大、极具破坏性。”

40年后，随着对哈维·韦恩斯坦(Harvey Weinstein)等人的指控继续扩散，感觉就像我们已经撞上了这座冰山。人们争相用各种灾难隐喻来描述这个时刻：海啸、飓风、雪崩、山崩——不过最关键的是，许多有权势的男人的事业以惊人的速度分崩离析。

很多女性，也有一些男性，比以往任何时候都更公开、更有力地说出了自己的故事，它们发生在关闭的门后，甚至是在工作室和新闻编辑室等工作场所的开放空间里。各个公司纷纷重申零容忍政策，匆匆组织相关培训。

不过，这次的续集似乎有了一个出人意料的结局，或者至少有了一个情节转折：公众的愤怒更深、更持久，多米诺骨牌不断倒下。

也许是因为这次的控诉者大多是熟悉媒体的著名白人演员，她们的明星影响力比被控诉者更大（这么说吧，和葆拉·琼斯[Paula Jones]与比尔·克林顿[Bill Clinton]之间的力量对比是不同的）。也许，它还反映出，在当今这个美国历史上的特定时期，新一代职场女性——她们由职场母亲抚养长大——认为自己受够了。

当然，社交媒体不断膨胀的力量也起了作用：在过去几周里，有数以百万计的帖子使用了#metoo（我也是）这个标签，它还衍生出了意大利版（#QuellaVoltaChe，意思是“那个时候”）和法国版（#BalanceTonPorc，意思是“揭发那头猪”）；这场网络运动甚至蔓延到了国会。

声音的洪流

“在1970年代的女性运动中，有一个词叫‘醒悟时刻’，”史学家芭芭拉·伯格(Barbara Berg)说。她是2009年出版的《美国的性别歧视：依然活跃，正在毁灭我们的未来》(Sexism in America: Alive, Well and Ruining Our Future)一书的作者。“现在就是醒悟时刻。就像是说，‘够了’。然后就会产生雪球效应：一旦你看到女性对权力说出真相，而不是被告知，‘这就是你必须忍受的’，那么其他女性也会受到鼓励，挺身而出。”

在韦恩斯坦的案例中，原告们镇定自若地站了出来，而且似乎每天都有更多的人站出来，所以没有人必须像以前的希尔那样独自承受重担。“如果一个句子里包含安吉丽娜·朱莉(Angelina Jolie)和格温妮丝·帕特洛(Gwyneth Paltrow)，那么它一定会引起人们的注意，”社会学家迈克尔·基梅尔(Michael Kimmel)说。

回首往事

如果说现在是一个具有历史意义的社会变革时刻，那么我们值得回头看一看，我们是怎么走到今天的。

“人们几乎觉得有点困惑，”该团体的负责人1992年接受《纽约时报》采访时说。“你是说这是性骚扰？你是说我可以为此做点什么？”

从“我相信”到#metoo

值得注意的是，当时的运动口号（不是写在Facebook和Twitter上，而是写在徽章和保险杠贴纸上）不是“我也遇到过这种情况”，而是“我相信安妮塔”，这是一个表示团结的讯息，而不是自我暴露。

希尔之后是琼斯，她对克林顿的起诉被驳回。还有些人虽然在法庭上胜诉，后来却陷入困境：海军上尉葆拉·库格林(Paula Coughlin)被几名醉酒军官性侵，她后来遭到排挤，最终只得辞职。遭到律所合伙人骚扰的律师秘书蕾内·威克斯(Rena Weeks)后来再也没有工作过。

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at the Leica store in New York. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

A woman stands inside a subway car, her face bisected by a pole. Commuters at Grand Central are rendered as dreamlike silhouettes. Cars, pedestrians and buildings come at you at crazy angles. A man stepping into a Checker cab pauses to look at a dog, which stares back.

The city he chronicled between 1977 and 2001 explored neighborhoods that held steady when the city’s future looked grim. Over that period, his work became more political — as in the 1982 photo of four black nannies pushing white toddlers in strollers. But there is also a crazy, funny beauty too, which is no accident.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

Passion. It’s not about talent. It’s about education, hard work and passion. In German the word for passion is “leidenschaft” and it sort of means suffering, or to enjoy suffering, or be willing to suffer for it. That’s what passion is. It’s not like a hobby. The German word says it much better: Be willing to suffer or enjoy suffering for it.

What is your best advice to newcomers?

Be patient. At first, cooking is about repetition. We do things over and over and over again, and it takes a person who enjoys that.

Be focused. New York is an amazing place, but it’s also incredibly distracting. There are so many cuisines alone. You could say, hey, I want to learn how to make pizza, or Japanese food is really cool. Or I want to learn how to make French food, or how to bake, or how to make pasta. All these things can be super distracting, and my advice is, just focus on what you want to be the best at.

Don’t jump around. Think about what you want and then pick the restaurant that fits that, and stay there for two, three or four years. When I look at chefs who stayed somewhere for a long time, I see them much more evolved.

How do you become a top chef?

Cooking is a craft. To learn a craft, it’s not about creating at first. There is a right way to do a consommé, a stock, searing meat, or making an omelet. Every great chef starts by being a great craftsman — making that perfect omelet or making that perfect roast chicken. And then at some point creativity becomes a part of it. You start from a place of rules, and then you start breaking them.

Here’s what else is happening:

Yesterday we told you about the M.T.A.’s new subway announcements: The phrase “ladies and gentlemen” is out, and conductors will give more detailed descriptions of delays, as well as extra information like tourist sites and reminders for special events.

We asked readers what other changes they would like to hear regarding M.T.A. announcements, and more than 100 responded. Here’s what your neighbors said:

“Please upgrade the subway sound systems so that we could actually hear these improved announcements.”

— Robert Cowen, 77, Fresh Meadows, Queens

“I would like to hear absolutely nothing at all: Silence is golden.”

— Howard Steiner, 55, Upper East Side

And as for the replacement of “ladies and gentlemen” to be more inclusive, a few offered their thoughts:

“To me, ‘ladies and gentlemen,’ though not particularly offensive, seems silly. How about ‘short-haired people and long-haired people and bald people,’ or ‘introverts and extroverts,’ or whatever? It just seems completely irrelevant to divide the listening public into any categories at all. This is why I don’t call my elementary students ‘boys and girls.’ What possible reason is there to call attention to gender differences when telling people what station is next on the subway, or that it’s time to clean up at school?”

— Miriam Sicherman, 45, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn

“Hey, I don’t care if they use the word ‘chumps’ to describe us, just make the announcements understandable and correct.”

— Paul Beissel, 69, Greenpoint, Brooklyn

252,"['americans', 'high', 'guidelines', 'heart', 'dr', 'millions', 'older', 'pressure', 'blood', 'need', 'treatment', 'patients', 'risk', 'lower']","Now, high blood pressure will be defined as 130/80 millimeters of mercury or greater for anyone with a significant risk of heart attack or stroke.
The previous guidelines defined high blood pressure as 140/90.
If there is any good news for patients here, it is that nearly all the drugs used to treat high blood pressure are generic now.
That study, called Sprint, explored whether markedly lower blood pressure in older people — lower than researchers had ever tried to establish — might be both achievable and beneficial.
But, he added, “If a patient comes in with a blood pressure of 180, I will not get him to 130.”Lifestyle changes like diet and exercise can help many patients lower blood pressure.","If Americans act on the guidelines and lower their blood pressure by exercising more and eating a healthier diet, or with drug therapy, they could drive an already falling death rate from heart attacks and stroke even lower, experts said.

Now, high blood pressure will be defined as 130/80 millimeters of mercury or greater for anyone with a significant risk of heart attack or stroke. The previous guidelines defined high blood pressure as 140/90. (The first number describes the pressure on blood vessels when the heart contracts, and the second refers to the pressure as the heart relaxes between beats.)

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death among Americans. The new criteria, the first official diagnostic revision since 2003, result from growing evidence that blood pressure far lower than had been considered normal greatly reduces the chances of heart attack and stroke, as well as the overall risk of death.

Recent research indicates this is true even among older people for whom intensive treatment had been thought too risky. That finding, from a large federal study in 2015, caught many experts by surprise and set the stage for the new revision.

That calculation must be individualized, and experts are recommending that patients use a calculator developed by the guidelines committee at ccccalculator.ccctracker.com.

Nearly half of all American adults, and nearly 80 percent of those aged 65 and older, will find that they qualify and will need to take steps to reduce their blood pressure.



Even under the relatively more lenient standard that had prevailed for years, close to half of patients did not manage to get their blood pressure down to normal.

“Is it going to affect a lot of people, and is it going to be hard to meet those blood pressure goals?” asked Dr. Raymond Townsend, director of the hypertension program at Penn Medicine. “The answer is a pretty significant yes.”

According to the new guidelines, anyone with at least a 10 percent risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next decade should aim for blood pressure below 130/80.

But simply being age 65 or older brings a 10 percent risk of cardiovascular trouble, and so effectively everyone over that age will have to shoot for the new target.

Younger patients with this level of risk include those with conditions like heart disease, kidney disease or diabetes. The new standard will apply to them, as well.

People whose risk of heart attack or stroke is less than 10 percent will be told to aim for blood pressure below 140/90, a more lenient standard, and to take medications if necessary to do so.

If there is any good news for patients here, it is that nearly all the drugs used to treat high blood pressure are generic now. Many cost pennies a day, and most people can take them without side effects.

In formulating the guidelines, the expert committee reviewed more than 1,000 research reports. But the change is due largely to convincing data from a federal study published in 2015.

That study, called Sprint, explored whether markedly lower blood pressure in older people — lower than researchers had ever tried to establish — might be both achievable and beneficial.

The investigators assigned more than 9,300 men and women ages 50 and older who were at high risk of heart disease to one of two targets: a systolic pressure (the higher of the two blood pressure measures) of less than 120, or a systolic pressure of less than 140.

In participants who were assigned to get their systolic pressures below 120, the incidence of heart attacks, heart failure and strokes fell by a third, and the risk of death fell by nearly a quarter.

Those patients ended up taking three drugs on average, instead of two, yet experienced no more side effects or complications than subjects in the other group.

Some experts in geriatrics had expected many more complications among older patients receiving more intense treatment, especially increased dizziness, falls and dehydration.

Instead, the benefits for older people were impressive. With a lower risk of heart attacks and strokes, they were more likely to maintain their independence.

“They had half the rate of disability,” said Dr. Jeff Williamson, head of the Sticht Center on Aging at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center and the only geriatrician on the committee drawing up the new guidelines.

But more intensive drug treatment in so many more patients may increase rates of kidney disease, some experts fear. In the Sprint trial, the incidence of acute kidney injury was twice as high in the group receiving drugs to reduce their systolic pressure to 120.

“Although the lower goal was better for the heart, it wasn’t better for the kidney,” said Dr. Townsend of Penn Medicine, who is a kidney specialist. “So yeah, I’m worried.”

While agreeing that lower blood pressure is better, Dr. J. Michael Gaziano, a preventive cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the VA Boston, worries about having doctors and patients fixating on a particular goal.

It’s true, he said, that doctors ought to be more aggressive in treating people at high risk. But, he added, “If a patient comes in with a blood pressure of 180, I will not get him to 130.”

Lifestyle changes like diet and exercise can help many patients lower blood pressure. But many of the newly diagnosed are likely to wind up on drugs, said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale University.

“This is a big change that will end up labeling many more people with hypertension and recommending drug treatment for many more people,” he said.

The current treatment strategy has not been so successful for many patients, he noted.

“How they tolerate drugs, whether they want to pursue lower levels, are all choices and should not be dictated to them,” said Dr. Krumholz. “Or we will have the same situation as today — many prescriptions that go unfilled and pills untaken.”","Under New Guidelines, Millions More Americans Will Need to Lower Blood Pressure",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/health/blood-pressure-treatment-guidelines.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

President Trump’s recently concluded trip to Asia had the potential to advance important American security and economic interests. Played correctly, his ambitious five-country, 12-day trip could have steadied his administration’s rocky start in this vital region. Instead, it left the United States more isolated and in retreat, handing leadership of the newly christened “Indo-Pacific” to China on a silver platter.

The trip began with solid performances in Japan and Korea, where Mr. Trump’s relatively measured words left key allies reassured of the United States’ commitment to their security. The president largely shelved his belligerent trade rhetoric, called for allies to buy more American military hardware and reopened the door to diplomacy with North Korea. Weather curtailed his surprise trip to the Korean Demilitarized Zone, but that may have been a blessing, since hostile words might have prompted hostile action.

But in China, the wheels began to come off his diplomatic bus. The Chinese leadership played President Trump like a fiddle, catering to his insatiable ego and substituting pomp and circumstance for substance.

China always prefers to couch state visits in ceremony rather than compromise on policy. This approach seemed to suit President Trump just fine, as he welcomed a rote recitation of China’s longstanding rejection of a nuclear North Korea and failed to extract new concessions or promises. He also settled for the announcement of $250 billion in trade and investment agreements, many of which are nonbinding and, in the words of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, “pretty small.” Missing were firm deals to improve market access or reduce technology-sharing requirements for American companies seeking to do business in China.

Mr. Trump showered President Xi Jinping of China with embarrassingly fawning accolades, calling him “a very special man” and stressing that “my feeling towards you is an incredibly warm one.” He blamed his predecessors rather than China for our huge trade deficits and hailed Mr. Xi’s consolidation of authoritarian power. Such scenes of an American president kowtowing in China to a Chinese president sent chills down the spines of Asia experts and United States allies who have relied on America to balance and sometimes counter an increasingly assertive China. Their collective dismay was only heightened by Mr. Trump’s failure to mention publicly any concerns about the disputed South China Sea or even to insist that the American press be allowed to ask the leaders questions.

According to Mr. Tillerson, these stunning displays of Trumpian affection for Mr. Xi were complemented by more concrete discussions behind closed doors. With the notable exception of climate change, the administration wisely seems to have committed to continue cooperation with China in several key areas.

“Those seats are designed to make the best possible use of the space,” an American spokesman, Josh Freed, said.
A spokesman for Spirit Airlines, Paul Berry, said the emphasis on pitch was an inaccurate way to assess today’s newer seat designs.
“While it’s only 28 inches in pitch, it actually feels like it’s about 30 inches,” he said.
One group, Flyers Rights, is petitioning the Federal Aviation Administration to set minimum dimensions for airline seat width and pitch.","While low-cost airlines like Spirit have narrowed the distance between rows of seats to as little as 28 inches, most of the big American airlines have kept the distance — what’s known in the business as seat pitch — at 30 inches. Anything less, the major airlines have found, pushes already beleaguered travelers to their limits.

This year, the news leaked that American Airlines was considering a cabin redesign that would leave a few rows in its new Boeing 737 Max fleet with just 29 inches of pitch, plans the carrier quickly dropped after a rash of complaints.

“We got a lot of pushback from our customers and, most notably, from our team members,” the airline’s chief executive, Doug Parker, told investors on a conference call in July. “While we could convince ourselves that that might be able to produce somewhat higher revenues on the aircraft, what it was doing to our perception with our team wasn’t worth it.”

The push to shrink the space between rows of seats comes as major carriers are squeezing 10 abreast in more long-haul jets, so that the middle section has four seats — and, by definition, two middle seats — rather than three.

But customers will be spared this experience on most flights within the United States, Mr. Aboulafia said, because there just isn’t enough space. “The good news is that pretty much every domestic flight you’re going to take is going to be in a 737 or A320 — no way can you do four-three,” he said.

Traditional airline seats were fashioned out of rigid aluminum frames, then wrapped in thick foam padding. But that approach, said Alex Pozzi, vice president for research and development in interior systems for Rockwell Collins, a manufacturer of aircraft seats, is no longer used, with the availability of more sophisticated, high-tech materials.

“We’ve been using a lot of advanced materials, a lot of composite materials, to allow the actual physical structure to get smaller,” he said. “We’ve also removed a lot of the hard points in the seat and gone to fabric suspension systems,” leading, he said, to seats more akin to ergonomic desk chairs.

“The less size that the seat structure itself takes up, the more space that’s left over for the passenger,” Mr. Pozzi said.

Or, as the case may be, for more passengers. “Over the last five years, as slimline seats become more common and were adopted by more airlines, airlines took the opportunity to basically take the space they were saving and, depending on the airline, most of the airlines took that space and added in an extra row or two,” said Jami Counter, vice president of TripAdvisor Flights, which owns the site SeatGuru.com. “The actual pitch would shrink, but theoretically, your leg room wouldn’t.”

“Now,” he added, “you’re cramming another person in there so you still have more people in that exact same space. It becomes a much more unpleasant flying experience.”

On American Airlines’ new 737s, which will be put into service beginning soon, seats have a minimum 30-inch pitch, although American says most seats have 31 inches. Seatback TV screens were eliminated and replaced with brackets that passengers can use to mount their own devices to watch video, and power sources to keep those devices running. The magazine holder is now closer to the top of the seatback to free up more knee room.

“Those seats are designed to make the best possible use of the space,” an American spokesman, Josh Freed, said.

Airlines contend that improved ergonomics and, in some cases, slightly wider seats make up for a tighter pitch. A spokesman for Spirit Airlines, Paul Berry, said the emphasis on pitch was an inaccurate way to assess today’s newer seat designs.

“If you just go by inches, it’s kind of an old measure. We’re kind of basing it on comfort level and the way we’ve engineered our seats,” he said. “While it’s only 28 inches in pitch, it actually feels like it’s about 30 inches,” he said.

But some consumer advocates say the issue goes beyond comfort. One group, Flyers Rights, is petitioning the Federal Aviation Administration to set minimum dimensions for airline seat width and pitch. The group won a round in its court battle with the F.A.A. in July, when a Federal District Court told the agency to address what it referred to as “the incredible shrinking airline seat.”

Paul Hudson, president of Flyers Rights, said the need for seat regulation is driven by safety concerns. Passengers have been getting taller and wider, even as airlines push for slimmer seats, but regulations still stipulate that planes have to be able to be evacuated in just a minute and a half.

“Obviously, if you’re squeezed into a very confined space, it’s going to be harder to get up and get out in an emergency,” Mr. Hudson said.

“The seats were originally designed for people, for men who averaged about 5 foot 10 inches and 170 pounds,” he said. “Right now, the average man is just under 200 pounds.”

The airline industry contends that further regulation is unnecessary. Carriers referred questions to the trade group Airlines for America, which responded with an emailed statement that read, in part, “All U.S. carriers meet or exceed federal safety standards and we continue to believe that there is no need for government to interfere.”

But some air travel professionals contend that advocates like Flyers Rights may have a point in arguing that tightly packed seats may be an impediment to evacuations.

“It won’t be necessarily a passenger comfort regulation, but more around safety,” Mr. Counter said.

Mr. Harteveldt agreed. “There may be a legitimate issue around safety,” he said. “That’s why we’re now starting to see this topic bubble up.”",Air Travelers Resisting the ‘Incredible Shrinking Airline Seat’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/business/airline-seat.html

College and university endowment earnings are usually tax-exempt. But as endowments have sought greater investment returns in recent years, they have shifted more of their money out of traditional holdings like United States equities to alternative, potentially more lucrative investments. These include private equity and hedge funds that frequently borrow money, opening them up to tax consequences.

When schools earn income from enterprises unrelated to their core educational missions, they can be required to pay a tax that was intended to prevent nonprofits from competing unfairly with for-profit businesses.

Establishing another corporate layer between private equity funds and endowments effectively blocks any taxable income from flowing to the endowments, the reason they are called blocker corporations. The tax is instead owed by the corporations, which are established in no-tax or low-tax jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin Islands.

“Congress is essentially subsidizing nonprofits by allowing them to engage in these transactions,” said Norman I. Silber, a law professor at Hofstra University who co-authored a paper on blocker corporations in 2015. “They’re allowing them to borrow so that they can build up their endowments.”

The use of blocker corporations has raised concerns among policymakers in recent years. That’s partly because they cost the United States Treasury millions of dollars, but also because they legitimize an opaque offshore network sometimes used for nefarious purposes.

“They’re not cheating. They’re not hiding money or disguising money,” said Samuel Brunson, a law professor at Loyola University Chicago who has studied endowment taxation. “But they’re adding money to a system that allows people, if they want to hide their money, to do it.” Not only do the universities benefit — so does the wealthy and influential private equity industry.

Perhaps illustrating the sensitivity of the topic, officials at most of the college and university endowments that use blocker corporations, including Colgate, Dartmouth, Duke and Stanford, declined to comment specifically, citing longstanding policies against discussing their investments. Among them was Matt Kavgian, the director of strategic communications for Indiana University’s $2 billion endowment, which had invested $10 million with Quintana.

An exception was the Quintana shareholder Texas Christian University, whose chief investment officer, Jim Hille, acknowledged that the $1.5 billion endowment had used blocker corporations. Mr. Hille said the decision to use one often came down to whether the expected return would offset the cost of establishing a blocker corporation.

References to such corporations in the Appleby files, shared with The New York Times by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which obtained them from the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, date back at least to 2003. At that time, five elite schools — Columbia University, Dartmouth College, the University of Southern California, Stanford University and Johns Hopkins University — became partners in a Bermuda-based group called H&F Investors Blocker.

H&F Investors Blocker was formed to invest with one of the largest private equity firms, Hellman & Friedman, in shares of Axel Springer, a German publisher of newspapers and magazines.

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

Minutes from meetings at Appleby’s office in Hamilton, Bermuda, never mention tax avoidance or even explain why the word “blocker” is used in the partnership’s title. But an audit by Ernst & Young, contained in the minutes, shows that H&F Investors Blocker would owe no federal income tax.

By 2008, the University of Texas system — whose endowment last year was $24.2 billion, behind Harvard’s ($34.5 billion) and Yale’s ($25.4 billion) — asked Appleby to set up a Cayman Islands company called TX Liquidity Capital so “certain tax advantages will accrue to the system,” documents show.

Two years after Paris, the world is still off track

Under the Paris deal, nearly 200 countries submitted proposals for cutting their greenhouse gas emissions. Yet not one of the major industrialized nations is on course to hit those goals.

And even those goals are just a starting point — emissions would have to be cut even further to stop global average temperatures from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels, the point at which scientists say drastic consequences will be unavoidable.

• Where do the countries stand now, what have they pledged and what will they eventually need to achieve? These charts lay it out:

• Separately, a study released on Monday was another indication that the world has not turned the corner on cutting emissions. Industrial emissions had been steady for the past three years, but are projected to rise to record highs this year:

• Syria announced last week that it would join the Paris climate accord, meaning that every country in the world has now signed on to the pact or intends to join — and only one, the United States, has signaled its intention to withdraw from it. (Nicaragua, another holdout, said last month that it would join the agreement.)

• On the Friday before the conference opened, 13 federal agencies released a comprehensive scientific report that affirmed that humans are to blame for most of the global warming that has occurred since the start of the 20th century. That will not surprise anyone at the Bonn conference — but it does directly contradict statements from some top Trump administration officials.

Here’s some of our best climate coverage this year

The Bonn conference is a good occasion to catch up on some climate change reading.

• We answered 17 often-asked questions about climate change. If you’re looking for a climate F.A.Q., look no further. You can even send us your questions at the bottom.

• There is no silver bullet for climate change, but you might be surprised by a particular solution that would be more effective than others. See if you can guess which one it is.

• We went to Antarctica to see its flowing ice sheets for ourselves, and to learn about what they might portend. Read our Antarctic Dispatches here, and take yourself there in virtual reality.

• We also went to Alaska, and found out that its permafrost is no longer permanent. And as it thaws, it is dumping carbon into the atmosphere.

• Arctic sea ice is disappearing, too. Take a look at the trend in this chart. (It will be pretty easy to spot.)

• Shifting from ice to heat: Summers are getting hotter. You aren’t imagining it, and it wasn’t always this way.

• In those hotter summers, the most extreme hot days — with highs of 95 degrees Fahrenheit, or 35 degrees Celsius — are expected to multiply. And if countries renege on their Paris pledges and take no action, it will be even worse.

• Could you fix the world’s carbon budget? This feature from The Times’s Opinion Pages lets you try.

• And here are six maps that explain how Americans think about climate change. It turns out that people agree on certain issues more than you might expect.",The Bonn Climate Conference: All Our Coverage in One Place,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/climate/bonn-climate-change-conference.html

The oppressively hot afternoons in the Delta and the cool, quiet country nights of the rural woodlands inspired many of the greatest American storytellers, including William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty and Shelby Foote, and the blues musicians Robert Johnson and Son House.

This year, to honor the bicentennial of Mississippi’s statehood, residents throughout the state are following that tradition, telling the stories of their own communities with photographs employing the 21st-century technology of smartphones. The project, “Celebrating Storytellers,” was created by Chandler Griffin and Alison Fast, partners in Blue Magnolia Films and Barefoot Workshops, and will culminate next month with an exhibit of 200 five-foot-wide images in storefront windows in Jackson, Miss. Similar exhibits have already been held in five other cities.

“We didn’t want to just have big parties for the bicentennial with nothing that’s lasting afterwards,” Mr. Griffin said. “We really wanted to engage with communities. We wanted to go from town to town, and create spaces where people could have conversation about their community and what revitalization means.”

He and Ms. Fast went to a dozen towns and cities in Mississippi asking community leaders to help identify people who understood the fabric of their communities and invited them to a free, weeklong workshop and to begin documenting where they live with iPhones. The stories were chosen by the participants, who received guidance from the workshop team that included Aaron Phillips, a photographer who started out as a student at the Barefoot Workshops, and Natalie Irby, the executive producer.

There will be 100 participants in all ranging in age from 14 to 91.

In Mound Bayou, a small economically-depressed Delta city that was founded by former slaves in 1887, Myrna Smith-Thompson documented the rundown home of Isaiah Montgomery, a former slave of Jefferson Davis, who helped found the community. Ms. Smith-Thompson, who was born and raised in Mound Bayou, leads the Knights of Tabor, a benevolent community organization that is restoring local historic sites. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather led the organization before her.

“It’s not just a house,” she wrote for the project. “It’s the home of a man who in 1887 had a dream of turning a swampy piece of land filled with wild animals and mosquitoes and unimaginable obstacles into a negro self-governing community in Mississippi, for the people. He had the audacity to ask newly freed slaves to clear this land and make a nice place to live with all the amenities afforded to others. He had the nerve to attempt to influence free slaves to become self sufficient to create a safe haven for blacks amidst a climate of fear and hostility.”

At the start of the project last year, the emphasis was on Mississippi’s revitalization, not “race and reconciliation,” Mr. Griffin said. But the subject came up in every single workshop they held. In Clarksdale, an group of high school students from the mostly-black public school and an almost all-white private school made race the focus of their projects. Before meeting at the workshop they had rarely mixed, but they got together afterward for dinners and attended each other’s graduations. These experiences, Mr. Griffin said, “lead to change in communities.”

Mr. Griffin is a fifth-generation Mississippian, and attended Jackson Prep, a private institution that was started as a segregated school in 1970 in response to the federally mandated integration of the public schools. When he graduated in year 1994 he felt like he “had blinders on and was not exposed to anything.”

He attended art school in Savannah, Ga. and taught photography at the Maine Workshop in Rockport, M.E. before moving to New York City to “make his mark.” He rarely told anyone he was from Mississippi.

After a while, he realized that he didn’t really know Mississippi outside of where he grew up, so he returned to start Barefoot Workshops in Clarksdale and to learn more about his home.

“I fell in love with Mississippi in 2005 when I ran that first workshop, and ever since then I’ve just been trying to figure out ways to help tell the story and talk about the awesome things in Mississippi, as well as the problems, and look at the people working on solutions.”

Looking back at the experience, Ms. Smith-Thompson said the project taught her “to see things differently and how to tell stories with pictures” and made her “feel like a younger person.” For Christmas, she is buying a new iPhone to continue documenting her community.

“Storytelling helps us to share our different perspectives of our community with someone else, in a non-threatening way,” she explained. “The harsher the situation, the more impactful storytelling may be.”

This relationship held even when he excluded the United States, indicating that it could not be explained by some other factor particular to his home country. And it held when he controlled for homicide rates, suggesting that mass shootings were better explained by a society’s access to guns than by its baseline level of violence.

Factors That Don’t Correlate

If mental health made the difference, then data would show that Americans have more mental health problems than do people in other countries with fewer mass shootings. But the mental health care spending rate in the United States, the number of mental health professionals per capita and the rate of severe mental disorders are all in line with those of other wealthy countries.

A 2015 study estimated that only 4 percent of American gun deaths could be attributed to mental health issues. And Mr. Lankford, in an email, said countries with high suicide rates tended to have low rates of mass shootings — the opposite of what you would expect if mental health problems correlated with mass shootings.

Whether a population plays more or fewer video games also appears to have no impact. Americans are no more likely to play video games than people in any other developed country.

Racial diversity or other factors associated with social cohesion also show little correlation with gun deaths. Among European countries, there is little association between immigration or other diversity metrics and the rates of gun murders or mass shootings.

A Violent Country

America’s gun homicide rate was 33 per million people in 2009, far exceeding the average among developed countries. In Canada and Britain, it was 5 per million and 0.7 per million, respectively, which also corresponds with differences in gun ownership.

Americans sometimes see this as an expression of deeper problems with crime, a notion ingrained, in part, by a series of films portraying urban gang violence in the early 1990s. But the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries, according to a landmark 1999 study by Franklin E. Zimring and Gordon Hawkins of the University of California, Berkeley.

Rather, they found, in data that has since been repeatedly confirmed, that American crime is simply more lethal. A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner, for instance, but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process.

They concluded that the discrepancy, like so many other anomalies of American violence, came down to guns.

More gun ownership corresponds with more gun murders across virtually every axis: among developed countries, among American states, among American towns and cities and when controlling for crime rates. And gun control legislation tends to reduce gun murders, according to a recent analysis of 130 studies from 10 countries.

This suggests that the guns themselves cause the violence.

Comparisons in Other Societies

Skeptics of gun control sometimes point to a 2016 study. From 2000 and 2014, it found, the United States death rate by mass shooting was 1.5 per one million people. The rate was 1.7 in Switzerland and 3.4 in Finland, suggesting American mass shootings were not actually so common.

But the same study found that the United States had 133 mass shootings. Finland had only two, which killed 18 people, and Switzerland had one, which killed 14. In short, isolated incidents. So while mass shootings can happen anywhere, they are only a matter of routine in the United States.

As with any crime, the underlying risk is impossible to fully erase. Any individual can snap or become entranced by a violent ideology. What is different is the likelihood that this will lead to mass murder.

In China, about a dozen seemingly random attacks on schoolchildren killed 25 people between 2010 and 2012. Most used knives; none used a gun.

By contrast, in this same window, the United States experienced five of its deadliest mass shootings, which killed 78 people. Scaled by population, the American attacks were 12 times as deadly.

Beyond the Statistics

In 2013, American gun-related deaths included 21,175 suicides, 11,208 homicides and 505 deaths caused by an accidental discharge. That same year in Japan, a country with one-third America’s population, guns were involved in only 13 deaths.

This means an American is about 300 times more likely to die by gun homicide or accident than a Japanese person. America’s gun ownership rate is 150 times as high as Japan’s. That gap between 150 and 300 shows that gun ownership statistics alone do not explain what makes America different.

The United States also has some of the weakest controls over who may buy a gun and what sorts of guns may be owned.

Switzerland has the second-highest gun ownership rate of any developed country, about half that of the United States. Its gun homicide rate in 2004 was 7.7 per million people — unusually high, in keeping with the relationship between gun ownership and murders, but still a fraction of the rate in the United States.

Swiss gun laws are more stringent, setting a higher bar for securing and keeping a license, for selling guns and for the types of guns that can be owned. Such laws reflect more than just tighter restrictions. They imply a different way of thinking about guns, as something that citizens must affirmatively earn the right to own.

The Difference Is Culture

The United States is one of only three countries, along with Mexico and Guatemala, that begin with the opposite assumption: that people have an inherent right to own guns.

The main reason American regulation of gun ownership is so weak may be the fact that the trade-offs are simply given a different weight in the United States than they are anywhere else.

After Britain had a mass shooting in 1987, the country instituted strict gun control laws. So did Australia after a 1996 shooting. But the United States has repeatedly faced the same calculus and determined that relatively unregulated gun ownership is worth the cost to society.

That choice, more than any statistic or regulation, is what most sets the United States apart.

“In retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate,” Dan Hodges, a British journalist, wrote in a post on Twitter two years ago, referring to the 2012 attack that killed 20 young students at an elementary school in Connecticut. “Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.”",What Explains U.S. Mass Shootings?

Street performers, panhandlers, passing police officers — they stop and stand before the south side of the Washington Arch and watch.

The best vantage point to observe this phenomenon is near the southeast corner of the arch, looking up toward Fifth Avenue as unsuspecting people walk closer. They notice a crowd staring and phones pointing at the arch, and invariably turn to see why.

A few feet off the ground, a statue appears to have been mounted on the arch, its hands overhead clutching a small ledge, feet resting on another below.

Whether he deserves credit is, being charitable to him, up for debate. But what’s absolutely true is that if the global economy — and stock market — is a confidence game, confidence is clearly winning.

Mark Cuban, whose disdain for President Trump is so acute that he is considering running for president himself in 2020 as a Republican because it “means you get to go head-on with Trump right in the primaries — and so there’s nothing I’d have more fun doing.” Still, though, he said he believes the economy is in good enough shape that when it comes to investing in the stock market, “I just, you know, I just let it ride.”

Mr. Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said he keeps a small amount of cash on hand as a precaution. “I keep a little bit, you know, as a hedge. I call it my ‘Trump hedge’ because you just never know. Now 280 characters can change the market in a heartbeat,” he said, not-so-jokingly alluding to the new character limit on Twitter, Mr. Trump’s communication tool of choice.

Measuring confidence, is of course, a subjective matter. There are dozens of surveys of chief executives and others asking them how “confident” they feel. Earlier this year, The Conference Board reported that chief executives’ confidence had reached 2008 pre-recession highs in the first quarter, though more recent surveys have showed a slight waning.

Still, merger activity, which this column has long argued is the purest measure of confidence — since most executives only do deals when they are genuinely confident in their own business and the economic environment — has reached a record high. It bolted in the past several months after what seemed like a surprisingly lackluster beginning of the year as executives appeared to be paralyzed by a sense of uncertainty, trying to gauge the first steps of a new president.

It appears that chief executives have found themselves certain that whatever “uncertainty” exists isn’t that uncertain after all.

Still, there are pockets of the economy that are causing anxiety. “The last two or three years have not been fun whatsoever,” Mickey Drexler, the chairman of J. Crew, said at the conference about the traditional retail business, which has been upended by Amazon and changes in consumer behavior. “It’s been miserable.” Those challenges are extending to mall owners and commercial real estate, too.

The question is whether all the enthusiastic talk from chief executives is reflective of a truly robust economy or whether we are missing something.

“There’s so many people talking about the record level of the stock market. The stock market is not a proxy for the economy of America,” said Howard Schultz, executive chairman of Starbucks. “I’m deeply concerned about the millions of Americans who are not participating in the economy.”

That may be worth remembering. If there is a lesson in having confidence, especially when everyone else is feeling that way, it is that it can quickly reverse.

“In the aftermath of corporate and public-sector disasters, it often emerges that participants fell prey to a collective form of willful blindness and overconfidence: mounting warning signals were systematically cast aside or met with denial, evidence avoided or selectively reinterpreted, dissenters shunned,” Roland Bénabou a professor at Princeton University wrote in a seminal work on confidence and groupthink. “Market bubbles and manias exhibit the same pattern of investors acting ’colorblind in a sea of red flags,’ followed by a crash.”",Navigating a Breathtaking Level of Global Economic Change,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/business/dealbook/navigating-global-economic-change.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss
