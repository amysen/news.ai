Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

A heavy metal rendition of the Catalonian national anthem ""Els Segadors,"" or ""The Reapers"" has turned a virtually unknown Virginia-based band, A Sound of Thunder, into celebrities in the politically sensitive region in northeastern Spain. Within days of its release, the song racked up more than a million hits on YouTube, making it the band's most popular single since they started in 2008. Thousands of Catalonians voted for independence from Spain during a banned referendum in October that ended in violence and spurred a constitutional crisis in the euro zone's fourth-biggest economy. Back in Manassas, Virginia, Nina Osegueda, the band's lead singer, made a quick decision to release a video of the band's version of ""Els Segadors"" on Youtube. Osegueda, whose mother is Catalan, has strong ties to the region and originally recorded the anthem as a tribute to her mother. The song was never intended to be released as a single, but instead was part of the band's new full-length album, ""It Was Metal,"" to be released in March 2018. The violence that surrounded the referendum vote changed all that. ""We have a couple other singles that we were planning on releasing in advance to show people what the new album is going to sound like,"" she said. ""But then the vote happened and 800 people were injured by the police trying to vote. So I said we should try and just put the song out to show our support against police brutality."" ""Suddenly it was spreading all over the place... And then I noticed that someone shared us on Twitter and it wound up actually being a Catalan politician,"" Osegueda said. Music stations in Catalonia picked up the song and Osegueda was interviewed on several radio shows. The attention she has received has spread to her relatives as her Catalonian uncle was interviewed on local radio. On the band's YouTube page, fans have left messages saying they prefer the metal version to the original and many have said the song has struck an emotional chord. Osegueda recorded some parts of the song in Catalan. She doesn't speak the language and singing with proper pronunciation was intimidating, but she says the enthusiasm and support from her new found fans has been humbling. ""You know, we're not on a label. We do everything ourselves. So when we see this many people responding, it's like it's overwhelming,"" Osegueda said. The band, whose albums have been crowdfunded through various Kickstarter campaigns, will tour Catalonia for the first time in December, just days before regional elections on Dec. 21. They have shows planned in Barcelona, Tarragona and other Catalonian cities. For Osegueda, who has traveled to Catalonia a number of times, the upcoming visit feels different. ""I've always enjoyed going there on vacation. But now it's a lot deeper because there's so many people out there who saw our song as inspiration. So I feel like I definitely have a deeper connection now,"" she said.",Virginia heavy metal band strikes chord with Catalonia anthem,https://www.reuters.com/video/2017/11/09/virginia-heavy-metal-band-strikes-chord?videoId=372941926&videoChannel=118169&channelName=Editors%27+Picks

China’s life insurance industry could also be attractive to foreign acquirers due to the sector’s low penetration rate and growth potential, Fitch said in a report on Tuesday.

Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao on Friday said China had raised the foreign ownership cap on futures firms, securities companies and fund managers to more than 50 percent with immediate effect, and that the cap would be removed altogether in three years.

China will also drop foreign ownership restrictions on local banks and asset management companies, Zhu said.

The announcement came hours after U.S. President Donald Trump left Beijing after a state visit where he reiterated calls for improved access to Chinese markets.

“The scale of China’s larger banks could be a constraint for potential acquirers, and it is not yet clear how the strategic benefits would compare against the costs,” Fitch said. “The more likely acquisition targets in the banking sector would be the relatively smaller city commercial banks or rural banks.”

But such banks tend to have higher risks due to their narrower geographical presence, and profitability pressures are also stronger than in the broader banking sector, Fitch said.

In the non-bank sector, pricing competition is intense, especially in the brokerage and underwriting segments, where brokerage commission rates have fallen to less than 3 basis points, according to Fitch.

Business relationships also tend to be important to winning institutional business, which could be a hurdle for potential foreign entrants.

The life insurance sector could be more alluring, but the small life insurers that are the most likely acquisition targets usually focus on low-margin products amid tough market competition, Fitch warned.

“There is no point for talks for the sake of talks,” he said.

An announcement on Friday by Bkav, a Vietnamese cybersecurity firm, that it had cracked Apple’s Face ID, and a subsequent video apparently showing an iPhone being unlocked when pointed at a mask, were greeted with some skepticism.

Ngo Tuan Anh, Bkav’s vice president, gave Reuters several demonstrations, first unlocking the phone with his face and then by using the mask. It appeared to work each time.

However, he declined to register a user ID and the mask on the phone from scratch because, he said, the iPhone and mask need to be placed at very specific angles, and the mask to be refined, a process he said could take up to nine hours.

Apple declined to comment, referring journalists to a page on its website that explains how Face ID works.

That page says the probability of a random person unlocking another user’s phone with their face was approximately 1-in-a-million, compared to 1-in-50,000 for the previously used fingerprint scanner. It also says Face ID allows only five unsuccessful match attempts before a passcode is required.

Anh acknowledged that preparing the mask wasn’t easy, but he said he believed the demonstration showed facial recognition as a way to authenticate users would be risky for some.

Cybersecurity experts said the issue was not so much whether Face ID could be hacked, but how much effort a hack required.

“Nothing is 100 percent secure,” wrote Terry Ray, chief technology officer at U.S.-based cybersecurity company Imperva, in a note. “Where there’s a will, there’s a way. The questions are: How much trouble would someone go to, and how much would they spend, to get your data?”

Bkav’s Anh said the research took about a week, and included numerous failures. The mask frame was made of plastic, covered with paper tape to resemble skin, with a silicone nose and paper for eyes and mouth.

As far back as 2009, Bkav researchers highlighted what they said were problems with using facial recognition as a way to authenticate users. They said then that they had hacked three laptop manufacturers which used webcams to authenticate users.",Vietnamese researcher shows iPhone X face ID 'hack',https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-vietnam-hack/vietnamese-researcher-shows-iphone-x-face-id-hack-idUSKBN1DE1TH

High-risk binary options allow people to place bets on whether the value of securities such as shares, commodities, indices and currencies will rise or fall over periods that can be as short as 30 seconds or five minutes.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it would take over regulating firms that offer binary options, that can lure investors by advertising on social media under an illusion of respectability, from the Gambling Commission on Jan. 3.

The move comes after nearly 700 people reported losing a total of more than 18 million pounds on binary options scams in the first six months of this year, prompting police to raid 20 London offices last month as part of a broader crackdown on investment frauds.

The FCA warned investors that fraudsters were linking binary options adverts to websites that appear professional, promising higher-than-average returns for bets that are never placed, manipulating software to distort prices and payouts and often refusing to pay winnings before disappearing.

From next January, victims will be able to seek redress at the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, a safety net for investors in regulated businesses.

Countries such as Israel and Belgium have banned binary options trading, while the United States requires them to be traded on regulated markets.

The FCA also issued a warning to investors about the risks of putting money into speculative cryptocurrency contracts for differences (CFDs).

Cryptocurrency CFDs allow investors to speculate on a change in price of a virtual currency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which have proved volatile. The CFDs can have little price transparency, come with high charges and with leverage that can multiply losses.

Writing on Twitter, Hariri urged Lebanese to remain calm and said his family would stay in Saudi Arabia, calling it “their country”.

Hariri’s resignation while in Saudi Arabia pitched Lebanon into political crisis.

Top Lebanese government officials and senior politicians close to Hariri believe Saudi Arabia coerced him into quitting and has been holding him against his will ever since, though Hariri and Riyadh have denied this.

Hariri cited fear of assassination and accused Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world during his resignation speech.

Hariri gave his first public remarks on Sunday, saying in a televised interview in Riyadh he planned to return to Lebanon within days to affirm his resignation.

Lebanese President Michel Aoun, who has stated that he believes Riyadh is restricting Hariri’s freedom, has refused to his resignation until his return from Saudi Arabia.

Derek Kan, who was previously an official at San Francisco-based ride services company Lyft Inc, won confirmation to be undersecretary of transportation for policy on a 90-7 vote.

Senate Republicans have said their Democratic rivals were stalling a number of nominees over a dispute over funding for the $24 billion “Gateway Program,” which includes building a new tunnel underneath New York’s Hudson River. At least eight other Transportation Department nominations are pending and other jobs vacant, including a top auto safety regulator.

In addition to confirming Kan, the Senate voted 50-47 on Monday to advance the nomination of Steven Bradbury, a Washington lawyer, to be general counsel at the Transportation Department.

During the administration of President George W. Bush, Bradbury was one of the principal authors of the legal justifications for “enhanced interrogation techniques” called the “torture memos” by critics. Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, said in June that Bradbury “lacked the judgment to stand up against (the Bush) administration’s use of torture.”

Bradbury defended his work in June, saying the “questions we addressed raised difficult issues about which reasonable people could disagree.”

In September, President Donald Trump met with top elected officials from New York and New Jersey over the fate of the Gateway Program deemed critical to northeast U.S. transportation, but Trump made no commitments to finance the project.

Republican Senator John Thune accused Democrats of holding nominations “hostage” while awaiting “assurances that the Trump administration will approve and fund” the Gateway project.

“While no one questions the importance of this corridor, there are many other important projects that also are awaiting approval and funding at the Department. No project should get to cut the line based on the machinations of a handful of our” colleagues, Thune said.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on Monday he opposed Kan because of administration roadblocks to the project. “Time is running out and we must quickly build new tunnels,” Schumer said.

A Senate Democratic aide confirmed, separately, that Democrats were holding up some nominations “because they want assurances from the Transportation Department the Gateway Project will quickly move forward after it’s funded.”

The recommendation by the commission appointed by President Jacob Zuma came as a senior Treasury official resigned after news reports said he had complained about presidential interference in the budget process, and as state-owned utility Eskom said it was facing serious liquidity issues.

South Africa relies on foreign investors to finance its hefty budget and current account deficits. Investors are nervous ahead of important credit rating reviews scheduled this month and with the ruling African National Congress gearing up to elect Zuma’s successor as party chief in December.

The presidency said on Monday that Zuma would make an announcement on the higher education report once ministers had processed its findings.

Zuma set up the commission early last year in response to protests by university students demanding free education.

The rand and benchmark bonds weakened after the presidency said it would publish the report on Monday, but they were little changed after its release.

Currency traders and analysts said markets were waiting to see how the presidency would react to the report, but they said its recommendations were risky from an economic standpoint.

“If we start repeating this pattern of recording higher and higher budget deficits we are undoubtedly headed for downgrades,” said senior Nedbank economist Nicky Weimar.

South African GDP was around 4.3 trillion rand ($296.6 billion) last year, so an increase in government spending on higher education of 0.25 percent of GDP would amount to around $750 million of additional expenditure.

The commission also recommended that all university students should be funded through a cost-sharing model, whereby the government would guarantee income-contingent loans issued by commercial banks. Should a student fail to reach a certain income level, the state should repay the tuition loan, it advised.

Introducing those measures would make it more difficult for Treasury to rein in a projected budget deficit of over 4 percent of GDP for the 2017/18 fiscal year.

But it would be popular among young people and ANC voters, many of whom are dissatisfied that South African society remains deeply unequal more than two decades after the end of apartheid in 1994.

South Africa next holds a national election in 2019, and the ANC has seen its electoral majority shrink in elections.

TROUBLE AT TREASURY?

South African markets have also been pressured by fears that the independence of financial institutions is under threat.

Local media outlet Fin24 cited sources on Monday as saying that Treasury Deputy Director-General Michael Sachs had resigned last week after complaining that Zuma was interfering in the budget process.

Treasury confirmed Sachs’ resignation, saying only that his departure was because he wanted to “serve the public sector in a different capacity”.

International ratings agencies downgraded South Africa’s debt earlier this year after Zuma fired respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan in an abrupt cabinet reshuffle.

S&P Global and Moody’s are expected to review the country’s ratings again on Nov. 24, and all eyes are on whether they will downgrade its local-currency rating to “junk” status after Gordhan’s replacement, Malusi Gigaba, unveiled dismal medium-term budget forecasts last month.

Downgrades to sub-investment grade could trigger forced selling of up to $12 billion of South African bonds and pile further pressure on the rand, which is already trading at a 12-month low against the dollar.

China’s life insurance industry could also be attractive to foreign acquirers due to the sector’s low penetration rate and growth potential, Fitch said in a report on Tuesday.

Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao on Friday said China had raised the foreign ownership cap on futures firms, securities companies and fund managers to more than 50 percent with immediate effect, and that the cap would be removed altogether in three years.

China will also drop foreign ownership restrictions on local banks and asset management companies, Zhu said.

The announcement came hours after U.S. President Donald Trump left Beijing after a state visit where he reiterated calls for improved access to Chinese markets.

“The scale of China’s larger banks could be a constraint for potential acquirers, and it is not yet clear how the strategic benefits would compare against the costs,” Fitch said. “The more likely acquisition targets in the banking sector would be the relatively smaller city commercial banks or rural banks.”

But such banks tend to have higher risks due to their narrower geographical presence, and profitability pressures are also stronger than in the broader banking sector, Fitch said.

In the non-bank sector, pricing competition is intense, especially in the brokerage and underwriting segments, where brokerage commission rates have fallen to less than 3 basis points, according to Fitch.

Business relationships also tend to be important to winning institutional business, which could be a hurdle for potential foreign entrants.

The life insurance sector could be more alluring, but the small life insurers that are the most likely acquisition targets usually focus on low-margin products amid tough market competition, Fitch warned.

U.S. District Judge William Walls sent the jurors home for the day and told them to resume their deliberations on Tuesday, Steven Sandberg, a representative for Menendez, said in an email.

A representative for the court clerk’s office and the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Menendez is on trial on charges that he accepted private flights, campaign contributions and other bribes from a wealthy patron, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, in exchange for official favors between 2006 and 2013.

Lawyers for Menendez and Melgen have told the jury in Newark, New Jersey, that they did nothing wrong and that their actions stemmed from a close, brother-like relationship.

If Menendez is convicted, Republicans will be presented with a chance to gain a seat in the closely divided U.S. Senate, as his replacement would be named by Republican Governor Chris Christie. Christie will remain in office until Jan. 16, when Democratic governor-elect Phil Murphy will take his place.

The jury, beginning its first day of deliberations with a new member after another panelist was allowed to leave for a previously scheduled vacation, sent the judge a note on Monday afternoon saying they were deadlocked and could not reach a verdict on any of the counts, the Newark Star-Ledger newspaper reported.

“Is there any additional guidance and what do we do now?” the jury asked the judge in their note, according to the newspaper.

The judge then heard from attorneys from both the prosecution, who argued that the jury had only begun their deliberations again three hours earlier that day, and Menendez’s attorney, who argued for the judge to declare a mistrial, the Star-Ledger said.

Walls concluded that it would be appropriate for the jury to continue their deliberations.

He made the remarks, reiterating a staple criticism leveled by his ruling ANC about South Africa’s economy, against the backdrop of widespread allegations of corruption against Zuma and his friends, the Indian-born Gupta brothers.

Zuma was responding to a question about his role as an enemy of “white capital”, during an interview with the ANN7 news network, which was founded by the Guptas. Zuma and the Guptas have denied any wrongdoing.

“I don’t know why there is a debate in fact. Because there is a monopoly capital and in South Africa it is white ... because of our history, it does have a color. It is white,” Zuma, who steps down as head of the ANC in December but can remain head of state until elections due in 2019, said.

“Companies that dominate in the mines, there are not many ... You will find the same companies in charge. That means they are monopolizing the economy and they’re not black,” he said.

The Chamber of Mines in the world’s top platinum producer says that in 2016, 39 percent of the sector was owned by “historically disadvantaged South Africans” - meaning non-whites.

Zuma said the policy of “radical economic transformation,” which has also seen moves to change the constitution to allow for the expropriation of land for redistribution to landless blacks, was needed to “correct the past.”

“The ANC must follow this policy because if you don‘t, we are going to stay in poverty, in inequality, for a long time.”

The frontrunners to replace Zuma at the helm of the ANC are Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, a trade unionist who amassed a fortune in the world of business, and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, former chair of the African Union and Zuma’s ex-wife.

Ramaphosa is viewed more favourably by foreign investors, who help cover the country’s deficits. Many of them are unsettled by Dlamini-Zuma’s calls to radically redistribute wealth and her perceived links to her former husband.

In a separate interview on state broadcaster SABC, ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe said “state capture is a reality,” referring to allegations that the Guptas and others have undue political influence with access to state resources and contracts under Zuma.

Mantashe is regarded as an ally of Ramaphosa with ties that go back to the 1980s when they were involved in the founding of the National Union of Mineworkers.","South Africa's Zuma again denounces ""monopoly"" white economic power",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1DE0O8-OZATP

Tuesday’s report from the Labor Department also showed steady gains in underlying producer prices, which support expectations of a gradual increase in inflation and keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates in December.

The producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month after a similar gain in September. In the 12 months through October, the PPI jumped 2.8 percent, the largest increase since February 2012.

The PPI rose 2.6 percent year-on-year in September. Economists had forecast the PPI edging up 0.1 percent last month and increasing 2.4 percent from a year ago.

Prices for services advanced 0.5 percent last month after increasing 0.4 percent in September. A 24.9 percent surge in margins for fuels and lubricants retailing accounted for almost half of the increase in the cost of services last month.

That helped to offset a 4.6 percent drop in the cost of gasoline. Wholesale gasoline prices soared 10.9 percent in September in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas in late August and reduced refining capacity in the Gulf Coast area.

Gasoline prices are falling amid ample crude oil supplies. Last month’s rise in prices received by the nation’s farms, factories and refineries was also driven by rising costs for goods such as pharmaceutical preparations, fresh and dry vegetables, meat and tobacco.

The dollar pared losses against a basket of currencies after the data, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.

A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent last month. It has increased by the same margin for three straight months. The so-called core PPI increased 2.3 percent in the 12 months through October after advancing 2.1 percent in September.

A weakening dollar could gradually lift core PPI. The dollar has this year lost 5.4 percent of its value against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners.

Inflation has remained stubbornly low, despite the labor market nearing full employment. The main inflation measure tracked by the Fed has remained below the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target since mid-2012.

Despite moderate price pressures, the Fed is expected to raise interest rates next month. There is cautious optimism that tightening labor market conditions will spur faster wage growth next year.

The Fed has increased borrowing costs twice this year. October’s consumer inflation data scheduled for release on Wednesday could shed more light on the future course of monetary policy.

Last month, food prices rose 0.5 percent after being unchanged in September. Core goods increased 0.3 percent after a similar gain in the prior month. Prices for passenger cars were unchanged last month. The government introduced new motor vehicle pricing models into the survey in October.

An announcement on Friday by Bkav, a Vietnamese cybersecurity firm, that it had cracked Apple’s Face ID, and a subsequent video apparently showing an iPhone being unlocked when pointed at a mask, were greeted with some skepticism.

Ngo Tuan Anh, Bkav’s vice president, gave Reuters several demonstrations, first unlocking the phone with his face and then by using the mask. It appeared to work each time.

However, he declined to register a user ID and the mask on the phone from scratch because, he said, the iPhone and mask need to be placed at very specific angles, and the mask to be refined, a process he said could take up to nine hours.

Apple declined to comment, referring journalists to a page on its website that explains how Face ID works.

That page says the probability of a random person unlocking another user’s phone with their face was approximately 1-in-a-million, compared to 1-in-50,000 for the previously used fingerprint scanner. It also says Face ID allows only five unsuccessful match attempts before a passcode is required.

Anh acknowledged that preparing the mask wasn’t easy, but he said he believed the demonstration showed facial recognition as a way to authenticate users would be risky for some.

“It’s not easy for normal people to do what we do here, but it’s a concern for people in the security sector and important people like politicians or heads of corporations,” he said.

“(These) important people should absolutely not lend their iPhone X to anyone if they have activated the Face ID function.”

It’s the first reported case of researchers apparently being able to fool the Face ID software.

Cybersecurity experts said the issue was not so much whether Face ID could be hacked, but how much effort a hack required.

“Nothing is 100 percent secure,” wrote Terry Ray, chief technology officer at U.S.-based cybersecurity company Imperva, in a note. “Where there’s a will, there’s a way. The questions are: How much trouble would someone go to, and how much would they spend, to get your data?”

Bkav’s Anh said the research took about a week, and included numerous failures. The mask frame was made of plastic, covered with paper tape to resemble skin, with a silicone nose and paper for eyes and mouth.

As far back as 2009, Bkav researchers highlighted what they said were problems with using facial recognition as a way to authenticate users. They said then that they had hacked three laptop manufacturers which used webcams to authenticate users.",Vietnamese researcher shows iPhone X face ID 'hack',https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-vietnam-hack/vietnamese-researcher-shows-iphone-x-face-id-hack-idUKKBN1DE1TH

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

The Senate’s approval is needed to pass laws though it does not often block bills passed by the elected House of Commons. Some senators say police need more time to prepare and also oppose setting the federal age of legal use at 18.

Legalizing marijuana for recreational use was part of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s 2015 election campaign and the government has set a relatively quick deadline to put it in place. Canada would be the first Group of Seven country to allow the drug nationally.

The legislation is not expected to reach the upper house until December and some senators have said they will take as long as they need to review it.

That could put Trudeau and the upper house of parliament at loggerheads again. Senators, who are not elected, recently delayed the government’s budget bill before ultimately passing it.

Conservative Senator Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu said he expects implementation will need to be delayed until December 2018 or early 2019 to give police forces enough time to prepare for widespread use of the drug.

“I think it’s too early,” Boisvenu said on Friday by phone. “What they’ve (the police) told us until today is they will not be prepared next July.”

Boisvenu said Conservative senators will meet to discuss strategy about delaying the bill if necessary.

Member of Parliament Bill Blair, a former police chief and the government’s point person on the legislation, said added delays in regulation will put more underage users at risk.

“By all means, take the time to do it right, but unnecessary delay is unacceptable,” Blair said by phone.

The potential clash highlights a hurdle Trudeau has partly set up for himself after he expelled all Liberal senators from the party’s caucus in 2014 amid an expenses scandal and to curb partisanship.

Although Trudeau has appointed independent senators since then, he has no formal leverage to get the government’s legislation passed.

“The government, if it had a clear majority in the Senate, could at one point impose party discipline and have its bill voted on.

While overseas at a leaders conference, Trump tweeted some tax bill suggestions early on Monday that were starkly different from the two Republican plans being considered in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.

He called on lawmakers to add a highly risky provision to their tax effort: repealing the individual mandate included in the 2010 Obamacare health insurance law that requires Americans to have health coverage or pay a tax to Washington.

Neither of the two Republican plans includes such a politically divisive measure. Efforts by Republicans to dismantle Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, collapsed dramatically months ago.

Trump has pushed hard for adding the mandate repeal to the tax-cut package. He tweeted the same suggestion on Nov. 3 just before he departed for his multi-nation Asian tour.

In his latest tweet, he also urged slashing the top tax rate for high earners to 35 percent from 39.6 percent, despite criticism from Democrats that the Republican tax bills are deficit-expanding giveaways to the rich and corporations.

The House retains the existing top tax rate in its bill, while the Senate proposes cutting it slightly to 38.5 percent.

Trump is set to return to Washington on Tuesday. A White House aide confirmed that the president would speak to House Republicans on Thursday ahead of their expected tax bill vote.

“I am proud of the Rep. House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.} We’re getting close!” Trump wrote in his Monday Twitter post.

“Now, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?” he added.

CLOCK IS TICKING

Since taking office in January, Trump has not scored a major legislative accomplishment, while frequently shifting positions and confusing lawmakers on Capitol Hill on various issues.

Many Republicans view a win on overhauling the tax code as crucial to avoiding having to go to the voters in 2018’s congressional elections with no achievements to show for a year in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress.

The clock is ticking for them. The House is expected to vote soon, perhaps on Thursday, on a tax bill approved last week at the committee level. House tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady said he was confident Republicans had the votes for passage.

Brady told reporters in a Capitol hallway that including a repeal of the Obamacare individual healthcare mandate in the tax bill “remains under consideration.”

The Senate tax committee will debate its tax plan all week before heading home for the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday.

When both chambers return near the end of November, they will have only 12 legislative days before the end of 2017.

In that time span, Republicans hope to iron out differences between the two tax plans over the deduction for state and local taxes, the timing of a corporate tax rate cut and the future of the estate tax on inheritances.

Each of the Republican tax plans would add about $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, another issue causing dissension among Republicans.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said he hoped to have a tax bill ready in the week after Thanksgiving. Between now and then, an army of lobbyists will be pressuring lawmakers to protect favored special-interest tax breaks.

On Dec. 8, a three-month extension of the spending authority for the federal government expires, requiring congressional action that could divert lawmakers from the tax overhaul.

A lengthy amendment introduced on Monday to the Senate tax plan by Republican Orrin Hatch, chairman of the tax panel, would remove a provision that lets working Americans over 50 make tax-free catch-up contributions to their retirement plans.

Democrats have kept up steady criticism of the Republican tax bills and how they were drafted. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate measure was developed in secret by a small group that held no public hearings and ignored Democrats.

“And the reason for such reckless haste is all too obvious: the product is a wretched one ... it is focused on the wealthy to the exclusion of the middle class,” he said in a statement.","Risks ahead for U.S. tax push as disputes linger, Trump returns",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/risks-ahead-for-u-s-tax-push-as-disputes-linger-trump-returns-idUSKBN1DD245

The booing of the anthem, “The March of the Volunteers”, has become a fixture at football matches in the Chinese-ruled territory, with some parallels to protests in the United States where American football players have knelt during the national anthem, an act denounced by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Now the former British colony is preparing to introduce a law that will penalize people who boo the anthem, a measure that critics say undermines the city’s autonomy and freedoms guaranteed when it returned to China 20 years ago.

Details of the law, including jail terms and the scope of enforcement, have yet to be set. China extended the law to cover Hong Kong earlier this month.

Chinese President Xi Jinping in recent years has ushered in new legislation aimed at securing the country from threats both within and outside its borders, besides presiding over a sweeping crackdown on dissent and free speech.

Chinese officials have said the anthem law is necessary to safeguard the authority of the state.

Several hundred fans greeted the anthem before the match against Lebanon with jeers and boos, with some unfurling banners that said “Die for Hong Kong”, while others yelled “We are Hong Kong” in English, rather than the local Cantonese dialect.

Some security guards signaled to the supporters to behave.

“I‘m not scared even if it becomes law ... I will go to the toilet instead of sitting when the national anthem is on,” Hong Kong supporter Bendter Chong said when asked if he would continue to jeer the anthem when the law is enacted.

Tensions between Hong Kong and mainland China have increased in recent years amid calls for greater democracy. Mass street protests in 2014 paralyzed parts of the city although they failed to secure concessions on electoral reform from Beijing.

Most of the jeering was from youths, underscoring how the younger generation has become increasingly disaffected by political tension and economic hardship.

Security was tight at the Hong Kong Stadium, the venue for the city’s annual Rugby Sevens tournament, where about 10,000 gathered for the match. The stadium has capacity for 40,000.

The game ended Lebanon 1, Hong Kong 0.

“I’m not sure about the law, but for sure people will be more behaved,” said Hong Kong supporter Fai Chan. “But it is still a matter of whether it is worth our respect.”

Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” arrangement that guarantees a high degree of autonomy, including an independent judiciary and freedom of expression.

In 2015, Hong Kong football fans booed the Chinese anthem during a World Cup qualifier, prompting a fine for the Hong Kong Football Association from world body FIFA.

The association was warned by the Asian Football Confederation recently over the conduct of fans and said “a repeat violation may result in more severe punishment”.",Hong Kong soccer fans defy Beijing by booing Chinese national anthem,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1DE1PE-OCASP

Trump said his trip had resulted in at least $300 billion, possibly triple that figure, of deals being agreed. He did not elaborate.

“We’ve explained that the United States is open for trade but we want reciprocal, we want fair trade for the United States,” he said.

Trade and concern about possible protectionism under Trump’s “America First” agenda have come up during his visit to the region, which included stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam before concluding in the Philippines.

Earlier in the day, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau raised the plight of Rohingya refugees and extra-judicial killings in the Philippines at the summit, sensitive human rights issues skirted by almost all the others.

There was no pressure from Trump over the Philippines’ bloody war on drugs during a meeting on Monday with President Rodrigo Duterte on the sidelines of the summit.

A joint statement after the meeting said the two sides “underscored that human rights and the dignity of human life are essential, and agreed to continue mainstreaming the human rights agenda in their national programs.”

However, Trudeau said that during his conversation with Duterte, he “mentioned human rights, rule of law and specifically extra-judicial killings as being an issue that Canada is concerned with.”

“The president was receptive to my comments and it was throughout a very cordial and positive exchange,” Trudeau told a news conference.

More than 3,900 pushers and users have been killed in the war on drugs that Duterte declared when he took office last year. His government says the police act in self-defense, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability.

Duterte cursed Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, last year for raising concerns about the war on drugs and he subsequently declared that he was breaking with the United States, a close ally of the Philippines since World War Two. Trump, by contrast, said on Monday he had a “great relationship” with Duterte.

ROHINGYA CRISIS

Slideshow (8 Images)

Trudeau said he also met Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and raised the plight of Rohingya refugees, although he did not mention the Muslim minority by name.

“This is a tremendous concern to Canada and to many, many countries around the world,” he said.

The government in mostly-Buddhist Myanmar regards the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and does not recognize the term.

Over 600,000 Rohingya have fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh since military clearance operations were launched in response to attacks by Rohingya militants on Aug. 25.

The plight of the Rohingya has brought outrage from around the world and there have been calls for democracy champion Suu Kyi to be stripped of the Nobel peace prize she won in 1991 because she has not condemned the military’s actions.

Some countries in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), particularly Muslim-majority Malaysia, have voiced strong concern over the issue recently.

However, in keeping with ASEAN’s principle of non-interference in each others’ internal affairs, it appeared to have been put aside at the summit, which brought Southeast Asian nations together with the United States, Japan, China, India, Australia and Canada.","Trump skips East Asia summit plenary, but says trip was a success",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-asean-summit/trump-skips-east-asia-summit-plenary-but-says-trip-was-a-success-idUKKBN1DE0J8

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had conducted an in-depth review and provisionally concluded that Tesco’s purchase of Booker does not raise competition concerns.

Tesco’s move on Booker in January sparked further consolidation in Britain’s 185 billion pound grocery market as supermarkets seek additional sources of growth.

Analysts expect more M&A activity as supermarkets seek to utilize excess capacity within their supply chains.

“The wholesale trade in particular will be wondering why on earth it ever bothered engaging at all with the CMA, an organization that seemingly lives in a different universe,” said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.

“If Tesco and Booker can merge with unconditional approval, then the scope for further large-scale consolidation cannot be ruled out,” he said.

The provisional clearance will come as a big relief to Tesco. Most analysts had expected it would have to agree to store divestments or restrictions on operations to gain clearance.

Tesco and Booker have argued their deal will enhance competition in Britain and promote consumer interests. However, rival wholesalers, including Bestway, Spar, Bidfood and Sugro, reject that and have called for the deal to be blocked.

UNSHAKEABLE GRIP

They believe if the deal proceeds Tesco will have an unshakeable grip on the procurement of all grocery categories in Britain and that suppliers will find it even harder to resist Tesco’s demands.

Both Tesco and Booker, the country’s biggest grocery wholesaler, welcomed the CMA announcement. Tesco said it expected to complete the deal, which also requires shareholder approvals, in early 2018.

Shares in Tesco and Booker were both up 7 percent at 1422 GMT.

Rival grocers declined to comment on the record. But a source at one grocer described the CMA’s decision as “ridiculous”.

Though it is unusual for provisional findings to be reversed, rival wholesale and retail groups do have the chance to present further evidence and comment before the CMA’s final ruling due in December.

In consolidation moves already prompted by the deal, Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L), Britain’s No. 2 supermarket group, considered a bid for the Nisa convenience chain before the Co-operative Group (42TE.L) secured a 138 million pound deal. Morrisons (MRW.L), the No. 4, has signed a wholesale supply deal with the McColl’s (MCLSM.L) chain.

Some Tesco shareholders have criticized the Booker bid, saying Chief Executive Dave Lewis is overpaying and that it will distract from the company’s turnaround plan.

CALLS FOR HIGHER PRICE?

The approval could spur calls from Booker shareholders for Tesco to raise its bid.

One top 20 Booker investor said he believed Tesco should pay more “as Booker is Tesco’s last hope”. He said the investor would reiterate to Booker that it could extract a higher price.

Bernstein analysts said they expect some uncertainty to remain, with the focus shifting to whether investors will approve the deal.

Their analysis indicates that Tesco will achieve the required 50 percent shareholder approval and that the focus will be on Booker, where the threshold is 75 percent.

“With a higher shareholder hurdle and the Tesco share price below the level when the bid was made, Booker shareholders may argue for a higher share price,” the broker’s analysts said.

The Booker deal is Lewis’s boldest move yet, giving Tesco access to the faster growing “out of home” food market.

For each Booker share, Tesco is offering 0.861 new Tesco shares and 42.6 pence in cash.

The CMA said it found that Tesco as a retailer and Booker as a wholesaler supplying caterers and independent retailers Premier, Londis, Budgens and Family Shopper do not compete head-to-head in most of their activities.

In particular, it found that Tesco does not supply the catering sector that accounts for more than 30 percent of Booker’s sales.

“Our investigation has found that existing competition is sufficiently strong in both the wholesale and retail grocery sectors to ensure that the merger between Tesco and Booker will not lead to higher prices or a reduced service for supermarket and convenience shoppers,” said Simon Polito, chair of the CMA’s inquiry group.

Jordan, who plays Winn Schott on TV show “Supergirl,” posted an Instagram video on Thursday of himself on a hospital bed, saying that food he ate at a Chipotle made him severely sick and that he “almost died,” according to a People.com report.

“There have been no other reported claims of illness at the restaurant where (Jordan) dined. We take all claims seriously, but we can’t confirm any link to Chipotle, given the details he shared with us,” Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold said via email.

Hariri, a Saudi ally, resigned abruptly on Nov. 4 in a move Lebanese political leaders ascribed to pressure from Riyadh. Hariri said his resignation had been prompted by an assassination plot and accused Iran and Hezbollah of sowing strife in the region. He denies there are any constraints on his movement.

Patriarch Bechara al-Rai met Hariri as well as King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as part of a trip that was planned well before the Lebanese political crisis brought on by Hariri’s resignation.

“Hariri is returning as fast as possible and I support the reasons for his resignation,” Rai was quoted as saying by Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television.

Hariri said he was fine and would return to Lebanon in the next two days. On Twitter, he urged Lebanese to remain calm and said his family would stay in Saudi Arabia, calling it “their country”.

The events have thrust Lebanon back to the forefront of the conflict between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Iran.

Rai’s trip has come under heightened scrutiny in light of Hariri’s resignation, but an official visit to Saudi Arabia by such a senior non-Muslim cleric is significant as a rare act of religious openness by the conservative Muslim country.

The kingdom hosts the holiest sites in Islam and bans the practice of other religions, forcing Christians to risk arrest by praying in private homes.

Prince Mohammed says he wants Saudi Arabia to open up more to the world. In addition to imposing radical economic reforms, the 32-year-old heir-apparent has pledged to relax strict social norms and revive a “middle-of-the-road, moderate Islam open to the world and all religions, traditions and people”.

RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE

Rai heads the Maronite church, which has a presence in Lebanon, Syria and Cyprus and follows an Eastern rite of the Roman Catholic Church.

Flanked by Catholic clerics wearing vestments and gold crosses, Rai discussed religious tolerance and combating extremism with the king and his son, the Saudi state news agency said.

Prince Mohammed has taken a harder line on Iran since taking on wide-ranging authorities two years ago including as defense minister, with the kingdom waging a two-year-old war in Yemen against Houthi fighters aligned with Iran.

He has also pushed for more social freedoms in a country where authority has rested for decades on an enduring accommodation between the royal family and clerics who control the hardline Wahhabi strain of Islam that originated in Saudi Arabia.

The powers of the Saudi religious police have been curbed, enforcement of gender segregation has been relaxed and women have been granted some more freedoms, including the right to drive cars starting next year.

Rai is the second Christian patriarch to visit the country, after another such trip in 1975. He said the original invitation had been extended in 2013 by the late King Abdullah.","Lebanese patriarch, in Saudi, says supports reasons Hariri quit",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-lebanon-patriarch/lebanese-patriarch-in-saudi-says-supports-reasons-hariri-quit-idUSKBN1DE1XW?il=0

He said the company had been ready to go to court the day the deal was announced in October 2016.

The head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, said in a statement late on Thursday that he has “never been instructed by the White House” on the AT&T deal.
AT&T told the Justice Department on Monday that it believed it had complied with all legal requirements for the deal to be cleared, a person briefed on the matter said.","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s broadsides against cable network CNN may complicate the U.S. government’s legal case if it decides to block AT&T’s deal to buy media company Time Warner, according to legal experts.

Trump’s repeated claims that CNN produces “fake news” and other criticisms of the network could hurt legitimate legal arguments the Department of Justice may use to show the deal gives the company too much power over media rivals and is bad for consumers.

“His comments have soiled the process,” said John Kwoka, an economics professor at Northeastern University. “If I were AT&T’s lawyers I would certainly introduce them into the evidentiary record as meddling with what is really a law enforcement process.”

The fate of AT&T Inc’s (T.N) $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), hatched in October 2016, looks set to end up in court as the two sides have so far failed to agree on what conditions AT&T needs to meet in order to gain antitrust approval.

Justice Department staff have recommended that AT&T sell either its DirecTV unit or Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) Turner Broadcasting unit, which includes news company CNN, a government official told Reuters on Thursday, on the grounds that a combined company would raise costs for rival entertainment distributors and stifle innovation.

AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson said on Thursday he would not sell CNN to win antitrust approval and would fight the government in court if the two sides could not reach an agreement.

“If we feel like litigation is a better outcome then we will litigate,” Stephenson told the New York Times DealBook conference on Thursday. He said the company had been ready to go to court the day the deal was announced in October 2016.

TRAVEL BAN COULD BE PRECEDENT

The deal took on broader political significance soon after it was announced when Trump attacked it on the campaign trail last year, vowing that as president his Justice Department would block it. He has not commented on the transaction since taking office in January.

Trump’s aggressive campaign comments have harmed legal arguments of his administration before.

Earlier this year, an appeals court refused to reinstate a ban on travelers from a group of Muslim-majority nations on the grounds that it illegally targeted people of one religion.

Explaining the decision, the chief judge cited a statement on Trump’s campaign website calling for a ”total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” The U.S. Supreme Court later partially reinstated the travel ban.

OVER BY APRIL

Stephenson has rejected the Justice Department’s arguments against the deal, saying it was a classic “vertical” merger that removed no competitors from any market and denied the company would be too powerful.

He said a combined AT&T and Time Warner would create a data and advertising company competing against the newest and most disruptive entrants into the media sector: Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, not other wireless phone companies.

Stephenson told the conference he has no reason to think Trump would be a factor in the deal’s approval and said he hoped the matter would be settled well before the April 22, 2018 deadline when parties can walk away from a deal.

The head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, said in a statement late on Thursday that he has “never been instructed by the White House” on the AT&T deal.

AT&T told the Justice Department on Monday that it believed it had complied with all legal requirements for the deal to be cleared, a person briefed on the matter said. That sets a deadline for the government to sue if it wants to block the merger. Officials said that detail could be as early Nov. 27.

“I don’t want to be on a very select roll of wonderful people with a killer,” Geldof told state broadcaster RTE. “Someone who is at best a handmaiden to genocide and an accomplice to murder.”

More than 600,000 Muslims from Myanmar’s Rakhine state have fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh after military operations described by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing.

Their plight has drawn outrage around the world. But Suu Kyi, long seen as a champion of human rights, has been criticized for failing to speak out against violence. There have been calls for her to be stripped of the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991.

Suu Kyi was given the Freedom of Dublin in 1999 while she was held under house arrest by Mayanmar’s then military government. She received her award at a reception in Ireland in 2012, two years after her release.

“Her association with our city shames us all and we should have no truck with it, even by default. We honored her, now she appals and shames us,” Geldof said in a statement.

The Lord Mayor of Dublin, Micheal Mac Donncha, said the city council had discussed taking away the honor and the matter was still under review. Last month she was stripped of a similar honor by the British university city of Oxford, where she was an undergraduate.

But Mac Donncha, a councillor for the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party, also criticized Geldof’s gesture, saying it was ironic as Geldof held a British knighthood despite “the shameful record of British imperialism across the globe”.

The former Boomtown Rats singer was given an honorary knighted in 1986 in recognition of his charity work, including organizing the 1985 Live Aid concert to help those suffering from starvation and disease in Ethiopia.

Other foreign recipients of the Freedom of Dublin include John F. Kennedy, Nelson Mandela and Mikhail Gorbachev.

Irish rockers U2, who had campaigned for Suu Kyi’s release while she was a political prisoner, also voiced disappointment and said her silence was “starting to look a lot like assent”.

“Who could have predicted that if more than 600,000 people were fleeing from a brutal army for fear of their lives, the woman who many of us believed would have the clearest and loudest voice on the crisis would go quiet,” the band said in a statement.

“For these atrocities against the Rohingya people to be happening on her watch blows our minds and breaks our hearts.”

However, he declined to register a user ID and the mask on the phone from scratch because, he said, the iPhone and mask need to be placed at very specific angles, and the mask to be refined, a process he said could take up to nine hours.

Apple declined to comment, referring journalists to a page on its website that explains how Face ID works.

That page says the probability of a random person unlocking another user’s phone with their face was approximately 1-in-a-million, compared to 1-in-50,000 for the previously used fingerprint scanner. It also says Face ID allows only five unsuccessful match attempts before a passcode is required.

Anh acknowledged that preparing the mask wasn’t easy, but he said he believed the demonstration showed facial recognition as a way to authenticate users would be risky for some.

“It’s not easy for normal people to do what we do here, but it’s a concern for people in the security sector and important people like politicians or heads of corporations,” he said.

“(These) important people should absolutely not lend their iPhone X to anyone if they have activated the Face ID function.”

It’s the first reported case of researchers apparently being able to fool the Face ID software.

Cybersecurity experts said the issue was not so much whether Face ID could be hacked, but how much effort a hack required.

“Nothing is 100 percent secure,” wrote Terry Ray, chief technology officer at U.S.-based cybersecurity company Imperva, in a note. “Where there’s a will, there’s a way. The questions are: How much trouble would someone go to, and how much would they spend, to get your data?”

Bkav’s Anh said the research took about a week, and included numerous failures. The mask frame was made of plastic, covered with paper tape to resemble skin, with a silicone nose and paper for eyes and mouth.

As far back as 2009, Bkav researchers highlighted what they said were problems with using facial recognition as a way to authenticate users. They said then that they had hacked three laptop manufacturers which used webcams to authenticate users.",Vietnamese researcher shows iPhone X face ID 'hack',https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-vietnam-hack/vietnamese-researcher-shows-iphone-x-face-id-hack-idUSKBN1DE1TH?il=0

The prime minister said Britain would continue to provide assistance to states that were victims of aggression.

“The UK will remain unconditionally committed to maintaining Europe’s security,” May said in a speech at the Guildhall in London’s financial district.

“The comprehensive new economic partnership we seek will underpin our shared commitment to open economies and free societies in the face of those who seek to undermine them.”

The British government is playing one its strongest cards in the Brexit negotiations by offering to put its defense and security assets at the disposal of the EU in the hope of winning concessions on future trading and economic relations.

The country has bigger defense budgets than any other EU member state and its diplomatic and intelligence services are among the most extensive in Europe.

Its government also argues it is one of the leading EU contributors to a range of security measures, such as data and evidence sharing, extradition measures and to the EU’s police agency Europol.

May on Monday accused Russia of fomenting violence in eastern Ukraine, of repeatedly violating the national airspace of several European countries, and mounting a campaign of cyber attacks.

She also accused Russia of meddling in elections and hacking the Danish defense ministry, the German parliament and its state-media of planting fake stories and photo-shopped images in an attempt to undermine western institutions.

May said the government is working to reform NATO so it is better placed to counter Russian hostility and has stepped up military and economic support to Ukraine.

“We will take the necessary actions to counter Russian activity,” she said.

May also said she wanted better relations with Russia if it worked to promote peace.

“Russia can, and I hope one day will, choose this different path,” she said. “But for as long as Russia does not, we will act together to protect our interests and the international order on which they depend.”",British PM May pledges to protect Europe from Russian threats,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-security/may-pledges-to-protect-europe-from-russian-threats-idUKKBN1DD2M1

The new policy affects videos that feature people and groups that have been designated as terrorist by the U.S. or British governments but lack the gory violence or hateful speech that were already barred by YouTube.

A YouTube spokesperson, who asked not be named for security reasons, confirmed the policy in response to questions. The company would not specify when the policy went into effect.

As YouTube terms already barred “terrorists” from using the service, the new policy keeps out videos uploaded by others that militants likely would try to distribute if they could have accounts, according to the spokesperson.

Hundreds of videos of slain al Qaeda recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki lecturing on the history of Islam, recorded long before he advocated violence against the United States, were among those removed under the new policy, the spokesperson said.

Governments and human rights groups have pressed YouTube for years to crack down on extremist videos. They argue that the propaganda radicalized viewers and contributed to deadly terror attacks.

British Home Secretary Amber Rudd amplified the pressure during visits with tech companies in Silicon Valley in July and a speech in Washington, D.C. last week. European Union and U.S. lawmakers this year have threatened consequences for tech companies if concerns are not addressed.

Legislation could resemble a German law approved in June to fine social media companies 50 million euros ($57 million) if hateful postings are not promptly removed.

YouTube said discussions with outside experts prompted the new policy, but it was unclear why the company decided to act only recently. In June, the company announced that “inflammatory religious or supremacist content” that did not violate its policies would be allowed with warning labels and a restriction making them ineligible for ad revenue.

At the time, Google General Counsel Kent Walker said in a blog post, “We think this strikes the right balance between free expression and access to information without promoting extremely offensive viewpoints.”

The latest step goes farther and was praised by critics such as Paul Barrett, deputy director of the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights.

“If the terrorist is in the business of recruiting and inciting people to make violent attacks, you’ve got to the draw the line” against any of their content, Barrett said.

The new policy does not affect news clips or educational videos about terrorism. But YouTube will not always have an easy time distinguishing, experts said, pointing to tactics such as overlaying extremist commentary on news footage to get around censors.

YouTube has resisted imposing more editorial control because it fears making it harder for important videos to get a wide audience, Juniper Downs, YouTube’s global director of public policy, told a San Francisco conference sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League on Monday.

“We will lose something very valuable if we completely transform the way these platforms work,” she said during a panel discussion.

Internet freedom advocates such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation have urged tech companies to be cautious and transparent in responding to government pressure.

YouTube is relying on government lists of terrorists and terrorist groups for enforcement. Content moderators check the listings and make removal decisions after fielding reports from an automated system, users or partner organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League and The Institute for Strategic Dialogue.

Al-Awlaki, whom the U.S. killed in a 2011 drone strike, was designated a terrorist by the U.S. Treasury the year prior.

Beijing Sinnet Technology Co Ltd, Amazon’s China partner, said in a filing late on Monday that it would buy the U.S. firm’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud computing unit in China for up to 2 billion yuan ($301.2 million).

“In order to comply with Chinese law, AWS sold certain physical infrastructure assets to Sinnet,” an AWS spokesman said on Tuesday, adding AWS would still own the intellectual property for its services worldwide.

“‎We’re excited about the significant business we have in China and its growth potential.”

Chinese regulators are tightening rules on foreign data and cloud services, implementing new surveillance measures and increasing scrutiny of cross-border data transfers. Laws that came into effect in June require firms to store data locally.

“This move is mostly around regulatory compliance,” said Charlie Dai, Beijing-based analyst at Forrester Research. He added the move was necessary for AWS to build up its other business areas in the market.

AWS has a separate hardware venture in partnership with the Ningxia provincial government in China’s northwest. Amazon said on its website that its public cloud services in the country are exclusively managed by Sinnet.

Amazon’s cloud business in China already faced tougher rules due to China’s tight internet controls. In August, Sinnet told customers it would shut down VPNs and other services on its networks that allow users to circumvent China’s so-called Great Firewall system of censorship, citing direct instructions from the government.

The move casts a shadow over similar foreign ventures in the country. Microsoft Corp, Oracle Corp and IBM Corp are also facing tough new regulatory challenges in localizing their data storage units.

Global firms in China, including Apple Inc, have this year transferred data to Chinese ventures overseen by local authorities. Microsoft operates its Azure cloud services unit in partnership with China-based 21Vianet Group.

“We expect other foreign players, such as Oracle and IBM, will also ensure regulatory compliance as long as they want to provide public cloud services in China,” said Dai.

Microsoft, Oracle and IBM did not immediately respond to request for comment on Tuesday.

Cloud services have become a crowded and competitive field in China in recent years, with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s cloud unit opening over a dozen overseas data centers since 2016.

Chinese firms account for roughly 80 percent of total cloud services revenue in China, and roughly half of the data center market in 2017, according to Synergy Research Group.",Amazon sells off China cloud assets as tough new rules bite,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1DE0CL-OCATC

Just over half of the 10,000 people surveyed said they had confidence in President Ashraf Ghani’s government, which has struggled to establish security in the face of a growing Taliban insurgency. Last year, just under half of Afghans said they had confidence in Ghani.

However, nearly 39 percent of those surveyed said they would be willing to leave if they had the opportunity, the second highest figure in the survey’s more than decade-long history.

The main reason was increased security concerns. More than 70 percent of Afghans fear for their personal safety.

Attacks are up across the country. In May, more than 150 people were killed by a blast in Kabul’s diplomatic zone - one of the deadliest since the Taliban’s ouster in 2001.

On the day the survey was released, more than 20 policemen were killed in fighting with Taliban insurgents in the southern province of Kandahar.

The survey which was conducted in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan in July, primarily in rural households, pointed to a mixed picture, with steady gains in education and health over the past decade and a half matched by continuing concern over corruption, unemployment and security.

Around a third of Afghans, or 33 percent, believe the country was heading in a positive direction, up slightly from 29.3 percent last year to buck a years-long declining trend.

“After a historic decline in 2016, confidence in public institutions has slightly improved; growing confidence in the Afghan National Security Forces stabilised in 2017,” Abdullah Ahmadzai, Asia Foundation’s country representative in Afghanistan said in a statement.

The increase in optimism applied across ethnic groups except Uzbeks, who make an important minority in Pashtun- and Tajik-dominated Afghanistan.

While there was a slight rise in positive sentiment, it was down significantly from a peak in 2013 before the withdrawal of most foreign forces. Back then nearly 60 percent of Afghans were positive about their future.

The survey comes as the United States in August announced a boost in U.S. troops to Afghanistan, which could push optimism higher in the coming months.","Afghans believe country headed in wrong direction, but optimism rising slightly - survey",https://www.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-survey/afghans-believe-country-headed-in-wrong-direction-but-optimism-rising-slightly-survey-idINKBN1DE0PQ

Staff for Delta Air Lines Inc confirmed that the players had boarded a Delta flight from Shanghai to Los Angeles.

“What they did was unfortunate,” Trump told reporters earlier in Manila. He said the trio, who have been held since last week, could have faced long prison sentences, and described Xi’s response as “terrific.”

“They’re working on it right now,” Trump said.

Trump had raised the issue with Xi during a dinner held during the U.S. leader’s Nov. 8 to 10 state visit to Beijing. Trump was in the Philippines capital for a summit of Asian leaders.

Asked about the trio and Trump’s discussing the issue with Xi, China Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing in Beijing: “Until now, I have not received any update, so I am unable to provide any further information.”

The three basketball players from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) were detained by police on Nov. 7 in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou over allegations of shoplifting. They were not on the team’s return flight to the United States on Saturday.

A senior White House official said the players had been given relatively light treatment due to Trump’s intervention.

The UCLA team had been in China for a game against Georgia Tech in Shanghai on Saturday, which UCLA won 63-60. The teams had traveled to Hangzhou earlier in the week to visit the headquarters of the game’s sponsor, Chinese tech giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

The three students - freshmen LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill - were taken in for questioning by police about alleged shoplifting from a Louis Vuitton store during the Hangzhou visit.

A Reuters witness saw two other tanks parked beside the main road from Harare to Chinhoyi, about 20 km (14 miles) from the city. One, which was pointed in the direction of the capital, had come off its tracks. Soldiers at the scene refused to talk to Reuters.

Earlier on Tuesday the youth wing of Zimbabwe’s ruling party accused the military chief of subverting the constitution for threatening to intervene after President Robert Mugabe plunged the country into crisis by sacking Mnangagwa last week.

Mnangagwa, 75, a long-serving veteran of Zimbabwe’s 1970s liberation wars, had been viewed as a likely successor to Mugabe before the president fired him on Nov. 6.

His downfall appeared to pave the way for Mugabe’s wife Grace to succeed the 93-year-old president, the only leader Zimbabwe has known in 37 years of independence.

In an unprecedented step, the head of the armed forces, Constantino Chiwenga, openly threatened to intervene in politics on Monday if the purge of war veterans did not stop.

“We must remind those behind the current treacherous shenanigans that, when it comes to matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in,” Chiwenga said in a statement read to reporters at a news conference packed with top brass on Monday.

Grace Mugabe, 52, has developed a strong following in the powerful youth wing of the ruling ZANU-PF party. Her rise has brought her into conflict with the independence-era war veterans, who once enjoyed a privileged role in the ruling party under Mugabe, but who have increasingly been banished from senior government and party roles in recent years.",Tanks seen heading toward Zimbabwe capital: witnesses,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-zimbabwe-politics/tanks-seen-heading-toward-zimbabwe-capital-witnesses-idUSKBN1DE1NG

Qualcomm’s board of directors could meet as early as Sunday to review the unsolicited acquisition offer and decide on its strategy, the sources said. The preparations for the board meeting indicate that Qualcomm is poised to rebuff the bid as insufficient as early as Monday, although it may decide to spend a few more days this week to prepare its full response to Broadcom, the sources added.

Qualcomm Chief Executive Steven Mollenkopf has spent the past few days soliciting feedback from Qualcomm shareholders, and feels that Broadcom’s $70-per-share bid undervalues the company and does not price in the uncertainty associated with getting the deal approved by regulators, according to the sources.

Broadcom CEO Hock Tan, who said earlier this month he would redomicile his company to the United States from Singapore, has stated he is open to launching a takeover battle. The sources said Broadcom was preparing to submit a slate of directors by Qualcomm’s Dec. 8 nomination deadline. That would allow Qualcomm shareholders to vote to replace the company’s board and force it to engage with Broadcom.

Broadcom has also been deliberating the possibility of raising its bid for Qualcomm, including through more debt financing, some of the sources said, although it was not clear when Broadcom would choose to make such a move.

Qualcomm provides chips to carrier networks to deliver broadband and mobile data. It is engaged in a patent infringement dispute with Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and is also trying to close its $38 billion acquisition of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) after signing a deal in October 2016. Broadcom has indicated it is willing to acquire Qualcomm irrespective of whether it closes the NXP deal.

NXP shares have been trading above Qualcomm’s offer price, as many NXP shareholders, including hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, have been holding out for a better price. Qualcomm does not plan to significantly raise its price for NXP as a defensive strategy to make its acquisition by Broadcom more expensive, according to one of the sources.

Qualcomm shares closed at $64.57 on Friday, while Broadcom ended at $264.96.

(SOUNDBITE) (Korean) CHIEF OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS IN JOINT CHIEF OF STAFF (JCS), ROH JAE-CHEON, SAYING: ""His car had tumbled into a drain on the North's side - he hadn't crossed the border at that point. He was alone in his car and North Korean guards were shooting at him - so he started running on foot."" South Korean officials say there was a hail of bullets from the North as the soldier ran through the demilitarized zone, he was found unarmed and rushed to surgery while still in his uniform which indicated he held a lower rank. More than a thousand North Koreans defect to the South every year but most make the journey through China, and attempting to cross the DMZ is rare. Seoul says it's the first time North Korean soldiers have fired towards the South's side of the Joint Security Area - where soldiers from the two sides stand practically face to face, prompting complaints from lawmakers that South Korea should have shot back. Officials say Seoul has informed Pyongyang of the wounded soldier's condition. A UN investigation is underway.",North Korean soldier defects with multiple gunshot wounds,https://www.reuters.com/video/2017/11/14/north-korean-soldier-defects-with-multip?videoId=372972515&videoChannel=118169

Beverly Young Nelson said Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 16 and he was a prosecuting attorney in his 30s. At a New York news conference, the tearful Nelson said Moore groped her, tried to pull her shirt off and shove her head in his lap, then warned that “no one will believe you” if she told anyone.

“I was twisting and struggling and begging him to stop,” said Nelson, a waitress at an Alabama restaurant where Moore often ate when the incident occurred. “I had tears running down my face.”

Moore, a Christian conservative and former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, has refused to withdraw from the race. His campaign released a statement denying “any sexual misconduct with anyone” and saying the new allegations were part of a “witch hunt.”

At a news conference in Gallant, Alabama on Monday night, Moore told reporters that Nelson’s accusations are “absolutely false,” the Birmingham News reported.

“I never did what she said I did,” the newspaper quoted Moore as saying. “I don’t even know the woman. I don’t know anything about her.”

McConnell told reporters in his home state of Kentucky that party officials were considering whether a Republican write-in candidate could be found to challenge Moore in the Dec. 12 special election.

“I think he should step aside,” said McConnell, who previously said Moore should leave the race if the allegations were true. “I believe the women.”

Republican Senators Orrin Hatch, Susan Collins, Lindsey Graham, Todd Young and Cory Gardner joined McConnell in calling for Moore to drop out - a move that could open the door for Democrats to cut into Republicans’ narrow two-seat Senate majority.

Gardner, the head of the Senate Republican campaign arm, said Moore was unfit to serve in the Senate.

“If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate,” Gardner said in a statement.

Senator John Cornyn, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, withdrew his endorsement but said Alabama voters should make the final judgment on Moore.

Another prominent conservative who had endorsed Moore, Senator Ted Cruz, said Moore should either clearly refute the allegations or if they are true, drop out. “I am not able to urge the people of Alabama to support his candidacy so long as these allegations remain unrefuted,” Cruz told reporters in the Capitol.

Moore, 70, had been a heavy favorite to win the election against Democrat Doug Jones. He has denied the allegations first raised in a Washington Post story about his relationships with four women when they were teenagers, including a charge he initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s.

He said on Twitter that McConnell was the person who should step down.

“He has failed conservatives and must be replaced,” Moore said.

MANY SUPPORTERS STEADFAST

The state party and many other Alabama Republicans have not wavered in their support of Moore, who scored a decisive Republican primary victory in September over Luther Strange. Strange, who drew the support of President Donald Trump in the primary, had been appointed to fill the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he became U.S. attorney general earlier this year.

The growing furor over Moore sets up a confrontation between establishment Republicans and Moore’s supporters in the party’s populist movement led by former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.

A Democratic win in Alabama would be a blow to Trump’s agenda and shift the political outlook for next year’s congressional elections, giving Democrats a stronger shot at recapturing control of the Senate.

It is too late to remove Moore’s name from the ballot, but McConnell told reporters he was “looking at” potential write-in candidates who could mount a successful campaign. Asked if Strange might be a candidate again, he said: “We’ll see.”

But Strange told reporters it was “highly unlikely” he would mount a write-in campaign. “Now it’s going to really be up to the people of our state to sort this out,” he said.

A special-election victory had been a long shot for Democrats in Alabama, which has not elected a Democratic senator in a quarter century. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, was trailing by double digits in some opinion polls.

Moore, who is prone to incendiary comments on social and cultural issues, has survived controversy before. He was twice forced out of his position as chief justice, once for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the courthouse and once for defying the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage.

He threatened over the weekend to sue the Post and said the allegations were a smear campaign by his political opponents. Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.

While making the new allegations, Nelson showed reporters Moore’s signature in her high school yearbook. She said he had offered to give her a ride home one night, then pulled the car behind the restaurant and assaulted her.

“I was terrified,” she said. “I thought he was going to rape me.”

Nelson said she told her sister about the attack two years afterward, and eventually told her mother and husband. She said she backed Trump for president and was not coming forward because of politics but because she was inspired by the women who talked to the Post.",Senate Republicans ask Moore to withdraw as new accuser steps forward,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-moore/senate-republicans-ask-moore-to-withdraw-as-new-accuser-steps-forward-idUSKBN1DD21W

Tuesday’s report from the Labor Department also showed steady gains in underlying producer prices, which support expectations of a gradual increase in inflation and keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates in December.

The producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month after a similar gain in September. In the 12 months through October, the PPI jumped 2.8 percent, the largest increase since February 2012.

The PPI rose 2.6 percent year-on-year in September. Economists had forecast the PPI edging up 0.1 percent last month and increasing 2.4 percent from a year ago.

Prices for services advanced 0.5 percent last month after increasing 0.4 percent in September. A 24.9 percent surge in margins for fuels and lubricants retailing accounted for almost half of the increase in the cost of services last month.

That helped to offset a 4.6 percent drop in the cost of gasoline. Wholesale gasoline prices soared 10.9 percent in September in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas in late August and reduced refining capacity in the Gulf Coast area.

Gasoline prices are falling amid ample crude oil supplies. Last month’s rise in prices received by the nation’s farms, factories and refineries was also driven by rising costs for goods such as pharmaceutical preparations, fresh and dry vegetables, meat and tobacco.

The dollar pared losses against a basket of currencies after the data, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.

A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent last month. It has increased by the same margin for three straight months. The so-called core PPI increased 2.3 percent in the 12 months through October after advancing 2.1 percent in September.

A weakening dollar could gradually lift core PPI. The dollar has this year lost 5.4 percent of its value against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners.

Inflation has remained stubbornly low, despite the labor market nearing full employment. The main inflation measure tracked by the Fed has remained below the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target since mid-2012.

Despite moderate price pressures, the Fed is expected to raise interest rates next month. There is cautious optimism that tightening labor market conditions will spur faster wage growth next year.

The Fed has increased borrowing costs twice this year. October’s consumer inflation data scheduled for release on Wednesday could shed more light on the future course of monetary policy.

Last month, food prices rose 0.5 percent after being unchanged in September. Core goods increased 0.3 percent after a similar gain in the prior month. Prices for passenger cars were unchanged last month. The government introduced new motor vehicle pricing models into the survey in October.

The cost of healthcare services gained 0.3 percent after being unchanged in September.

The lawsuit filed in California state court in Oakland is at least the third filed this year by black workers who say they were addressed using racial slurs and that the company ignored their complaints.

But Monday’s lawsuit, filed by former Tesla employee Marcus Vaughn, is the first to bring those claims on behalf of a large class of black workers at the automaker’s Fremont, California factory.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

The company is also facing lawsuits accusing it of discrimination against gay and older workers. It has denied those claims.

Vaughn in the lawsuit says he was routinely called the “n-word” by supervisors and coworkers after he began working at the factory in April. He says he complained in writing to human resources officials, but the company never investigated his claims.

Vaughn says he was fired in October for “not having a positive attitude.” He is seeking unspecified damages under a California anti-discrimination law.

The growing number of discrimination lawsuits against Tesla come as the company is also facing a unionization campaign from the United Auto Workers.

In February, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk told the website Gizmodo that an employee who wrote a blog post criticizing the company was “paid by the UAW to join Tesla and agitate for a union.”

The union and the worker denied that he had been paid by UAW. Last month, the union filed a complaint with a federal labor board on behalf of scores of workers who it says were laid off because they support the union.

>> A possible step towards a massive cash injection for Uber on Tuesday. Japanese telecom's giant SoftBank says it's weighing up a billion dollar investment in the company, on top of a move to buy 17% of its shares. Sources tell Reuters a deal could ultimately be wort up to $10 billion.

Uber just approved the deal this week, but SoftBank execs in Tokyo made it clear on Tuesday that so far, nothing is set in stone. And if the share price isn't right, there won't be a deal. After a rocky few years of losses and criminal probes at Uber, missing out on SoftBank's cash would be a hard blow, as Reuter's Sam Nussey reports from Tokyo.

And the potential investment from SoftBank in the consortium could bring a period of stability to the company, it could really be a new chapter for the company. The deal is tied to governance reforms, bringing in of more outside investors and other measures.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Foreign interest in securities joint ventures involving Chinese partners has steadily waned over the past decade, due to lacklustre performance and differences over strategy - the latter aggravated by the lack of control. At the same time, overseas interest in mainland stocks and bonds has faded in the face of volatility, policy opacity, and the difficulty of repatriating profits. China has gone without foreign money that would have helped it meet its own goal of cutting overall indebtedness.

The relaxation of the rules, coming after U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit, marks a diplomatic solemnification of a process already underway. In June, UK-based HSBC (HSBA.L) was allowed to set up a majority-owned securities joint venture. Foreign asset managers have been launching wholly owned entities in anticipation of the full opening of China’s mutual fund industry, which Z-Ben Advisors estimates to have $1.7 trillion under management. It’s the second-largest market of its kind in the region, growing at a rollicking compound growth rate of 29 percent.

It’s true, local competitors look intimidating. Domestic giants like CITIC (600030.SS) and Haitong Securities (600837.SS) have moved steadily up league tables, and the fund management industry is cutthroat. Distortions in Chinese stock, bond and derivatives markets are unresolved. But as execution and efficiency become more important than plain old access to cheap capital, the Western players ought to have an advantage.

Foreign institutions have another selling point: they have big businesses outside of the People’s Republic. There’s a massive pile of cash held uninvested by the Chinese middle class, that could be put to more productive use. As Chinese warm to overseas stocks and bonds, foreign firms who jump in now will be well-positioned to sell into the trend. That’s worth the effort.

CONTEXT NEWS

- The Chinese government on Nov. 11 said it will raise foreign ownership limits in domestic financial firms, a long-anticipated step allowing foreign partners to take more control. The changes include raising the limit on foreign ownership in joint-venture firms involved in the futures, securities and funds markets to 51 percent from the current 49 percent.

- Full foreign ownership of local firms involved in the futures, securities and funds markets will be permitted after three years, while full overseas ownership of insurance firms will be allowed after five years. The foreign ownership limit of 20 percent on a single entity basis and 25 percent on an aggregate basis of any Chinese owned bank and financial asset management company will be removed.

- The announcement followed a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to China, during which the two sides announced of bilateral deals and investments which the Chinese government said were worth a combined $250 billion.

- Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao told a news conference that the change will come into effect following drafting of related rules.

That’s a blow for ECB supervisory tsar Daniele Nuoy. The strict new guidelines for bad debt she unveiled on Oct. 4 could now become bogged down in a legal fight. The proposals, the legal opinion says, amounted to a new set of binding pan-European rules for lenders – the domain of EU lawmakers, not the ECB. The central bank can only issue recommendations to individual banks.

Resurgent economic growth in countries such as Italy, whose banks hold 175 billion euros of EU NPLs, presents an opportunity to take bolder steps to address the problem while times are good. The ECB has suggested that new rickety loans should be completely written off within a maximum of seven years, and not sit on the banks’ books indefinitely. Italy, for one, fears its lenders will not be able to do it with comfort that quickly.

In fairness, the ECB move looked a tad cheeky. For a start, it was hidden in an addendum to existing guidelines. And its “comply or explain” approach would make it difficult for banks to deviate from the standard line without being perceived as financially weak. With an eye on the central bank’s proposals, investors have already picked out lenders that look vulnerable like Italy’s Banco BPM and UBI Banca, whose shares dropped sharply in the days after the ECB proposal was unveiled.

At a summit in the Philippines, Donald Trump forged a “great relationship” with President Rodrigo Duterte, who only a year ago had cursed “son of a bitch” Barack Obama for decrying his administration’s bloody war on drug pushers and addicts.

And Trump flashed a thumbs-up as he shook hands with Cambodia’s authoritarian prime minister, Hun Sen, who praised the U.S. president as a kindred spirit for telling countries to put their own interests first.

“You are a great man to me,” Hun Sen said, addressing Trump at a meeting with other Southeast Asian leaders, and then referenced Trump’s ‘America First’ policy.

“I would like to inform you that if you follow your new policy in respect of the independence and sovereignty of other countries, the United States will have a lot of friends and you will be much respected and loved.”

For other leaders across Asia, however, Trump’s go-it-alone instincts must have represented a puzzling departure from his predecessors, who were - to varying degrees - standard bearers of multilateralism, democracy and human rights.

During a tour that took him to Japan, South Korea, China and Vietnam and the Philippines capital, Trump called for joint efforts to tighten the screws on North Korea and its development of nuclear weapons in defiance of U.N. sanctions.

But at an Asia-Pacific summit in Vietnam, he declared that redressing the uneven balance of trade between Asia and the United States was at the center of his “America First” policy, which he says will protect U.S. workers.

Trump’s vision has up-ended a consensus favoring multinational trade pacts whose regional champion is now China. On the sidelines of the Vietnam meeting, 11 countries kept alive a Trans Pacific trade deal that Trump walked away from last year in the name of protecting American jobs.

One cabinet member from a major ASEAN country told Reuters there was little enthusiasm in the region for Trump’s bilateral approach to deals.

“As Singapore Prime Minister Lee pointed out, the reason bilateral trade deals are so attractive for the USA, is precisely why no one will want to enter into one with the USA: because the USA could bully anyone on a bilateral basis,” said the Cabinet member who did not want to be named.

“Why would anyone sign up for that?”

THE ART OF THE DEALS

Trump told reporters before leaving that he had sealed deals of “at least $300 billion, possibly triple that figure”.

U.S. businesses signed around $250 billion dollars worth of deals during Trump’s Beijing visit, but many of those were nonbinding. Missing was any agreement on market access or reduction in technology-sharing agreements that American businesses have long complained about.

For Trump, dogged at home by low public approval ratings and investigations into Russian links to his election campaign, the deals will be an important prize to flaunt on his return.

“The multi-billion-dollar deals he struck in Beijing may not help the U.S. trade deficit,” said a former Japanese diplomat in Tokyo, who declined to be named. “But optically ... he can tell people that because he went to China with business leaders, he was able to come back with a gift.”

Although there were few weighty deliverables from Trump’s tour, for Asian nations looking nervously at China’s increasing assertiveness, it may be welcomed as a sign that his administration is still committed to the region.

“What regional countries wanted was for him to simply show up – to underscore that America remained at least notionally committed to Asia,” said Shahriman Lockman, a senior analyst at the Institute of Strategic & International Studies in Malaysia.

A senior official in South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s administration said Seoul had been worried he ”would come to South Korea and engage in unexpected behavior and language, but it turned out Trump was quite considerate.”

“South Korea was able to rest assured regarding its partnership with the United States,” the official said.

He also got good reviews at the start of his Asia tour in Japan, which has been currying favor with Trump since right after his election when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe jetted off to Trump Tower with an expensive golf club as a present.

“The most important deliverable is that we can send an almost identical message to the world that we share an identical strategy,” a Japanese government official said.

LAVISH RECEPTION

For Asian leaders, Trump’s off-the-cuff style, freewheeling tweets, and rhetorical hyperbole, must have been daunting. But one thing they seemed to learn was that he responds well to a lavish reception.

“They say in the history of people coming to China there has been nothing like that, and I believe it,” Trump told reporters after his visit to Beijing, where President Xi Jinping extended him the honor of a personal tour of the Forbidden City.

One measure of the Asian trip’s success, he said, was the “red carpet, like I think probably nobody has ever received.”

Diplomats say the bonhomie in Beijing probably stemmed in large part from Washington’s expectations Xi will lean more heavily on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Trump’s pronouncements on North Korea during the trip swung from embracing diplomacy to warnings of military intervention. “Do not underestimate us. And do not try us,” he said in a speech to South Korea’s National Assembly.

Days later, after Pyongyang dismissed the speech as “reckless remarks by an old lunatic,” Trump tweeted: “Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ‘old,’ when I would NEVER call him ‘short and fat?’”. And then he tacked back toward diplomacy. “Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!”

David Pressman, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President Obama, said Trump arrived in Asia without a North Korea strategy and left without one.

“Short and fat is not a nuclear strategy,” he said, adding that Washington’s approach to North Korea was fed by “whim, ego, and theatrical calculations of a fickle and uninformed president.”",Trump heads home with 'America First' ringing in Asian ears,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1DE1LZ

EZB-Präsident Mario Draghi sprach am Dienstag bei einem Gipfeltreffen der einflussreichsten Zentralbanker der Welt von einer Erfolgsgeschichte, einen geldpolitischen Ausblick zu geben. Die sogenannte Forward Guidance sei ein vollwertiges Instrument der Geldpolitik geworden ist, sagte der Präsident der Europäischen Zentralbank in Frankfurt. Der Italiener beantwortete allerdings nicht genau, ob die Euro-Wächter den Ausblick auch nach einer Abkehr von der jetzigen Nullzinspolitik beibehalten werden. “Warum (aber) ein geldpolitisches Instrument abschaffen, das sich als wirksam erwiesen hat?”

Die EZB hat das Instrument erst im Juli 2013 eingeführt. Damals hatte sie erklärt, dass der EZB-Rat erwarte, dass die Schlüsselzinsen für eine längere Zeit auf dem gegenwärtigen oder einem noch tieferen Niveau liegen dürften. Unter Draghis Vorgänger an der EZB-Spitze, Jean-Claude Trichet, hatte es noch stets geheißen, die Notenbank lege sich niemals im voraus fest (“We never precommit”).

Auf ihrer jüngsten Ratssitzung im Oktober hieß es, mit einer Zinserhöhung sei erst nach Ablauf des vor allem in Deutschland umstrittenen Anleihen-Kaufprogramms zu rechnen. Viele Volkswirte rechnen nicht vor 2019 damit. Der Schlüsselzins liegt seit März 2016 auf dem Rekordtief von null Prozent.

YELLEN ZIEHT POSITIVE BILANZ IHRER AMTSZEIT

Auf der anderen Seite des Atlantiks verfolgt die US-Notenbank Fed aufgrund der dort früher einsetzenden wirtschaftlichen Erholung schon seit längerem den Kurs einer behutsamen Straffung ihrer Geldpolitik. Auch Fed-Chefin Janet Yellen wertete den Einsatz der Forward Guidance positiv. Sie betonte für die US-Notenbank aber: “Jedweder Ausblick sollte von den Aussichten der Wirtschaft abhängig und darauf bezogen sein.” Diese erlauben nach Einschätzung des Präsidenten des regionalen Fed-Ablegers in Dallas, Robert Kaplan, womöglich eine dritte Zinserhöhung im Dezember, wie er der “Financial Times” sagte. Sein Kollege, der Fed-Präsident von St. Louis, James Bullard, will hingegen erst noch ein stärkeres Anziehen der Inflation abwarten.

Yellen ließ in der Runde zudem indirekt Kritik an ihren Vorgängern anklingen. So nahm sie Bezug auf die als “taper tantrum” bekannte Achterbahnfahrt an den Börsen aus dem Jahr 2013, die der damalige US-Notenbankchef Ben Bernanke ausgelöst hatte. Er ließ damals in einer Anhörung im US-Kongress beiläufig die Bemerkung fallen, die Fed könnte bei anhaltend positiven Wirtschaftsdaten ihre Wertpapierkäufe allmählich zurückfahren. Yellen betonte, die Äußerungen hätten die Märkte damals überrascht und seien als Zeichen einer aggressiveren Geldpolitik interpretiert worden.

In ihrer Amtszeit habe sie ein ähnlich schwieriges Vorhaben, den im Oktober eingeleiteten Abbau der in der Finanzkrise auf mehrere Billionen Dollar aufgeblähten Bilanz der Notenbank, kommunikativ sorgfältig vorbereitet. Die Märkte sollten bei diesem Mammut-Vorhaben nicht auf dem falschen Fuß erwischt werden: “Und ich denke, wir waren erfolgreich damit.” Yellen wird Anfang Februar an der Spitze der Fed von dem bisherigen Direktoriumsmitglied Jerome Powell abgelöst, falls der Senat zustimmt.

Japans Notenbankchef Haruhiko Kuroda plädierte in der Diskussionsrunde dafür, die Kommunikation mit den Finanzmärkten und der Öffentlichkeit möglichst einfach zu halten. “Es sollte besser geradeheraus sein. Das ist der beste Weg.” Sein Kollege an der Spitze der Bank von England, Mark Carney, betonte, dass es für Notenbanken wichtig sei, die breite Öffentlichkeit zu erreichen - und nicht nur die Finanzmärkte. In Großbritannien wurden gerade zum ersten Mal seit zehn Jahren die Zinsen angehoben. Anders als die Fed reagierten die Pfund-Wächter damit aber nicht auf eine rund laufende Konjunktur. Vielmehr wollen sie die kräftig steigende Inflation im Zuge des Brexit-Votums eindämmen.",Top-Notenbanker versprechen Transparenz,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-yellen-idDEKBN1DE1RV

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

Outside the bloc, euro zone growth also exceeded that of Britain, the EU’s second-ranked economy which will leave the bloc in March 2019.","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone’s annual economic growth rate outstripped that of the United States in the third quarter setting up 2017 as the best year for the currency area since financial markets crashed a decade ago.

Germany was a major factor, but even some of the bloc’s laggards, such as Italy, showed signs of revival.

Eurostat, the European Union statistics office, confirmed a preliminary estimate that euro zone gross domestic product (GDP)grew 0.6 percent from July to September from the previous quarter and on a year on year basis was 2.5 percent higher.

This was higher than the 2.3 percent year-on-year rate for the U.S. economy, which had been growing faster than the euro zone. The U.S. quarterly numbers were slightly better than the euro zones at 0.7 percent, however.

“A robust labor market recovery, growing export markets, an accommodative monetary stance, improving lending conditions and modest inflation are but a few of the tailwinds that the euro zone economy is experiencing,” ING economist Bert Colijn said.

“Because of that, this could well be its strongest year for growth since 2007. The euro zone will likely outpace both the U.S. and UK in terms of GDP growth in 2017,” he said.

Euro zone GDP grew 3.0 percent in 2007, and reached 2.1 percent in 2010 and 2015.

Partly as a result of the growth, euro zone investments have turned in one of their best years since the single currency was born in 1999, confounding many who had bet on the bloc to be the disaster play of 2017.

The strong euro zone growth was powered by the biggest economy Germany, which shifted into an even higher gear in the third quarter, propelled by buoyant exports and rising company investments in equipment.

Seasonally adjusted German GDP rose 0.8 percent on the quarter, beating a consensus forecast of 0.6 percent, which was also the second-quarter growth rate.

Second biggest France grew 0.5 percent on the quarter and 2.2 percent in annual terms and the third biggest Italy beat expectations with a 0.5 percent quarterly, and 1.8 percent annual growth, supported by exports and domestic demand.

The Netherlands, the fifth biggest economy, grew an expected 0.4 percent on the quarter after a record jump of 1.5 percent in the previous three months, putting it on track for a 3.3 percent expansion this year, the strongest since 2007.

Outside the bloc, euro zone growth also exceeded that of Britain, the EU’s second-ranked economy which will leave the bloc in March 2019.

The British economy, affected by a drop in the pound against the euro since last year’s Brexit vote, expanded 0.4 percent on the quarter in sterling terms and just 1.5 percent annually.

Separately, Eurostat said euro zone industrial production fell by 0.6 percent month-on-month in September as expected by markets but rose 3.3 percent year-on-year, slightly beating economists’ average forecast of a 3.2 percent increase.

”The outlook for production in the fourth quarter remains strong,“ ING’s Colijn said. ”New orders for manufacturing surged in August and businesses are reporting large backlogs of work according to the PMI survey.

“That should result in continued strength in industry in the final quarter of the year, adding to the possibility that our estimate for GDP growth in 2017 of 2.3 percent could still be too low,” he said.

The stronger growth supports the European Central Bank’s decision last month to start weaning the euro zone off ultra-loose money by saying that from January it will halve the amount of bonds it buys every month to 30 billion euros ($35.1 billion). It nevertheless promised years of stimulus and left the door open to backtracking.","Euro zone growth, eclipsing U.S. economy, set to be best in decade",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-economy-gdp/euro-zone-growth-eclipsing-u-s-economy-set-to-be-best-in-decade-idINKBN1DE17N?il=0

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had conducted an in-depth review and provisionally concluded that Tesco’s purchase of Booker does not raise competition concerns.

Tesco’s move on Booker in January sparked further consolidation in Britain’s 185 billion pound grocery market as supermarkets seek additional sources of growth.

Analysts expect more M&A activity as supermarkets seek to utilize excess capacity within their supply chains.

“The wholesale trade in particular will be wondering why on earth it ever bothered engaging at all with the CMA, an organization that seemingly lives in a different universe,” said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.

“If Tesco and Booker can merge with unconditional approval, then the scope for further large-scale consolidation cannot be ruled out,” he said.

The provisional clearance will come as a big relief to Tesco. Most analysts had expected it would have to agree to store divestments or restrictions on operations to gain clearance.

Tesco and Booker have argued their deal will enhance competition in Britain and promote consumer interests. However, rival wholesalers, including Bestway, Spar, Bidfood and Sugro, reject that and have called for the deal to be blocked.

UNSHAKEABLE GRIP

They believe if the deal proceeds Tesco will have an unshakeable grip on the procurement of all grocery categories in Britain and that suppliers will find it even harder to resist Tesco’s demands.

Both Tesco and Booker, the country’s biggest grocery wholesaler, welcomed the CMA announcement. Tesco said it expected to complete the deal, which also requires shareholder approvals, in early 2018.

Shares in Tesco and Booker were both up 7 percent at 1422 GMT.

Rival grocers declined to comment on the record. But a source at one grocer described the CMA’s decision as “ridiculous”.

Though it is unusual for provisional findings to be reversed, rival wholesale and retail groups do have the chance to present further evidence and comment before the CMA’s final ruling due in December.

In consolidation moves already prompted by the deal, Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L), Britain’s No. 2 supermarket group, considered a bid for the Nisa convenience chain before the Co-operative Group (42TE.L) secured a 138 million pound deal. Morrisons (MRW.L), the No. 4, has signed a wholesale supply deal with the McColl’s (MCLSM.L) chain.

Some Tesco shareholders have criticized the Booker bid, saying Chief Executive Dave Lewis is overpaying and that it will distract from the company’s turnaround plan.

CALLS FOR HIGHER PRICE?

The approval could spur calls from Booker shareholders for Tesco to raise its bid.

One top 20 Booker investor said he believed Tesco should pay more “as Booker is Tesco’s last hope”. He said the investor would reiterate to Booker that it could extract a higher price.

Bernstein analysts said they expect some uncertainty to remain, with the focus shifting to whether investors will approve the deal.

Their analysis indicates that Tesco will achieve the required 50 percent shareholder approval and that the focus will be on Booker, where the threshold is 75 percent.

“With a higher shareholder hurdle and the Tesco share price below the level when the bid was made, Booker shareholders may argue for a higher share price,” the broker’s analysts said.

The Booker deal is Lewis’s boldest move yet, giving Tesco access to the faster growing “out of home” food market.

For each Booker share, Tesco is offering 0.861 new Tesco shares and 42.6 pence in cash.

The CMA said it found that Tesco as a retailer and Booker as a wholesaler supplying caterers and independent retailers Premier, Londis, Budgens and Family Shopper do not compete head-to-head in most of their activities.

In particular, it found that Tesco does not supply the catering sector that accounts for more than 30 percent of Booker’s sales.

“Our investigation has found that existing competition is sufficiently strong in both the wholesale and retail grocery sectors to ensure that the merger between Tesco and Booker will not lead to higher prices or a reduced service for supermarket and convenience shoppers,” said Simon Polito, chair of the CMA’s inquiry group.

Beverly Young Nelson said Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 16 and he was a prosecuting attorney in his 30s. At a New York news conference, the tearful Nelson said Moore groped her, tried to pull her shirt off and shove her head in his lap, then warned that “no one will believe you” if she told anyone.

“I was twisting and struggling and begging him to stop,” said Nelson, a waitress at an Alabama restaurant where Moore often ate when the incident occurred. “I had tears running down my face.”

Moore, a Christian conservative and former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, has refused to withdraw from the race. His campaign released a statement denying “any sexual misconduct with anyone” and saying the new allegations were part of a “witch hunt.”

At a news conference in Gallant, Alabama on Monday night, Moore told reporters that Nelson’s accusations are “absolutely false,” the Birmingham News reported.

“I never did what she said I did,” the newspaper quoted Moore as saying. “I don’t even know the woman. I don’t know anything about her.”

McConnell told reporters in his home state of Kentucky that party officials were considering whether a Republican write-in candidate could be found to challenge Moore in the Dec. 12 special election.

“I think he should step aside,” said McConnell, who previously said Moore should leave the race if the allegations were true. “I believe the women.”

Republican Senators Orrin Hatch, Susan Collins, Lindsey Graham, Todd Young and Cory Gardner joined McConnell in calling for Moore to drop out - a move that could open the door for Democrats to cut into Republicans’ narrow two-seat Senate majority.

Gardner, the head of the Senate Republican campaign arm, said Moore was unfit to serve in the Senate.

“If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate,” Gardner said in a statement.

Senator John Cornyn, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, withdrew his endorsement but said Alabama voters should make the final judgment on Moore.

Another prominent conservative who had endorsed Moore, Senator Ted Cruz, said Moore should either clearly refute the allegations or if they are true, drop out. “I am not able to urge the people of Alabama to support his candidacy so long as these allegations remain unrefuted,” Cruz told reporters in the Capitol.

Moore, 70, had been a heavy favorite to win the election against Democrat Doug Jones. He has denied the allegations first raised in a Washington Post story about his relationships with four women when they were teenagers, including a charge he initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s.

He said on Twitter that McConnell was the person who should step down.

“He has failed conservatives and must be replaced,” Moore said.

MANY SUPPORTERS STEADFAST

The state party and many other Alabama Republicans have not wavered in their support of Moore, who scored a decisive Republican primary victory in September over Luther Strange. Strange, who drew the support of President Donald Trump in the primary, had been appointed to fill the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he became U.S. attorney general earlier this year.

The growing furor over Moore sets up a confrontation between establishment Republicans and Moore’s supporters in the party’s populist movement led by former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.

A Democratic win in Alabama would be a blow to Trump’s agenda and shift the political outlook for next year’s congressional elections, giving Democrats a stronger shot at recapturing control of the Senate.

It is too late to remove Moore’s name from the ballot, but McConnell told reporters he was “looking at” potential write-in candidates who could mount a successful campaign. Asked if Strange might be a candidate again, he said: “We’ll see.”

But Strange told reporters it was “highly unlikely” he would mount a write-in campaign. “Now it’s going to really be up to the people of our state to sort this out,” he said.

A special-election victory had been a long shot for Democrats in Alabama, which has not elected a Democratic senator in a quarter century. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, was trailing by double digits in some opinion polls.

Moore, who is prone to incendiary comments on social and cultural issues, has survived controversy before. He was twice forced out of his position as chief justice, once for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the courthouse and once for defying the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage.

He threatened over the weekend to sue the Post and said the allegations were a smear campaign by his political opponents. Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.

While making the new allegations, Nelson showed reporters Moore’s signature in her high school yearbook. She said he had offered to give her a ride home one night, then pulled the car behind the restaurant and assaulted her.

“I was terrified,” she said. “I thought he was going to rape me.”

Nelson said she told her sister about the attack two years afterward, and eventually told her mother and husband. She said she backed Trump for president and was not coming forward because of politics but because she was inspired by the women who talked to the Post.",Senate Republicans ask Moore to withdraw as new accuser steps forward,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-moore/senate-republicans-ask-moore-to-withdraw-as-new-accuser-steps-forward-idUSKBN1DD21W?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Diabetics often have nerve damage that limits their ability to feel pain, so they don't notice developing ulcers. SOUNDBITE (English) ROBERT SIMPSON, SENIOR SCIENTIST FOR TEMPERATURE TEAM AT NATIONAL PHYSICAL LABORATORY (NPL), SAYING: ""If you have an amputation then unfortunately the outlook is up to 50 percent of those who have an amputation are dead within two years, and up to 80 percent are dead within five years. So any early indication, any warning, any better management of the diabetic foot for pediatrists and diabetologists and for the patient themselves is critical.""

No final de junho, no mesmo dia em que ofereceu a primeira denúncia contra Temer por corrupção passiva, Janot pediu a abertura de um novo inquérito contra o presidente e seu ex-assessor Rodrigo Rocha Loures para investigar a suspeita de pagamento de propina a ambos para edição do decreto dos portos que interessava à empresas Rodrimar.

In its monthly oil market report, the Paris-based IEA cut its oil demand forecast by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) for this year and next, to an estimated 1.5 million bpd in 2017 and 1.3 million bpd in 2018.

Geopolitical tension in the Middle East and intermittent supply outages in the likes of Nigeria and Iraq have pushed oil above $60 a barrel for the first time since 2015, while global inventories have fallen, prompting many market watchers to raise their price forecasts.

“Does it mean the market has found a ‘new normal’ where the accepted floor might have moved from $50/bbl to $60/bbl? This might be a tempting view, assuming supply disturbances will continue and tensions in the Middle East will not ease,” the IEA said.

“However, if these problems do prove to be temporary, a fresh look at the fundamentals confirms the view we expressed last month that the market balance in 2018 does not look as tight as some would like, and there is not in fact a ‘new normal’.”

The IEA noted that output by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was down by 830,000 bpd year-on-year in October, although demand for the group’s crude is expected to fall to 32.6 million bpd in the fourth quarter of this year and to 32.0 million bpd in the first quarter of 2018.

Compliance by the group with its joint 1.8-million-bpd output cut with 10 partners was 96 percent in October, the highest since the supply-reduction deal took effect in January.

The biggest threat to market balances, aside from a tempering in demand, is the growth in supply from non-OPEC nations.

“Even after some modest reductions to growth, non-OPEC production will follow this year’s 700,000-bpd growth with 1.4 million bpd of additional production in 2018 and next year’s demand growth will struggle to match this,” the IEA said.

“This is why, absent any geopolitical premium, we may not have seen a ‘new normal’ for oil prices.”

Oil inventories in the world’s richest nations fell by 40 million barrels in September, breaking below 3.0 billion barrels for the first time in two years, driven in part by Hurricane Harvey, which shuttered much U.S. refining capacity in August.

“Using a scenario whereby current levels of OPEC production are maintained, the oil market faces a difficult challenge in 1Q18 with supply expected to exceed demand by 600,000 bpd followed by another, smaller, surplus of 200,000 bpd in 2Q18,” the agency said.

Global oil demand growth is likely to have slowed to 1.3 million bpd in the third quarter of this year, in part because of the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma in August and September on U.S. consumption.

Growth is expected to accelerate to 1.4 million bpd in the last three months of this year, even though mild temperatures and rising prices will restrain demand, the IEA said.","Warmer weather, rising non-OPEC output threaten oil market balance",https://www.reuters.com/article/oil-iea/warmer-weather-rising-non-opec-output-threaten-oil-market-balance-idINKBN1DE15Q

Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee say they will grill Sessions about statements he made to the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which he denied knowing about meetings between campaign aides and Russians.

Sessions’ statements, made at his confirmation hearing in January and at a Senate Judiciary hearing in October, appear to have been contradicted when charges against former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos were unsealed in a probe into allegations of links between Russia and the Trump campaign.

“We intend to ask you about these inconsistencies,” the committee’s Democratic members said in a Nov. 7 letter to Sessions. “We are providing you notice in advance because we expect you to respond,” the Democrats said.

Sessions, a former U.S. Senator who was involved in Trump’s campaign, has denied misleading Congress, saying his prior statements under oath were all true.

U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. election to help then-Republican candidate Trump’s campaign.

The Kremlin has denied interfering in the election and Trump denies any collusion between his campaign and Russian officials.

FORMER AIDE

Sessions is likely to be pressed about Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser.

In court records, prosecutors say Papadopoulos told a March 2016 meeting of campaign officials that he had Russian connections and could help arrange a meeting with Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

A photograph posted on Trump’s Instagram account shows that Papadopoulos, Sessions and Trump were all seated at the same table in that meeting.

According to a source familiar with the matter, Sessions shut down Papadopoulos’ idea of engaging with Russia, and the Trump administration has played down Papadopoulos’ role in the campaign, saying he was nothing more than a low level volunteer.

But the court documents, and Papadopoulos’ guilty plea for lying to the FBI over his contacts with Russian officials, put new focus on Sessions’ earlier testimony.

Sessions said during January’s confirmation hearing that he was unaware of communications between the campaign and Russia.

After the hearing, news reports emerged showing that Sessions had himself met Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak at least twice in 2016.

Under pressure, Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation.

In another Senate hearing last month, Sessions testified he had no improper involvement with Russians and was not aware of anyone else from the campaign who did.

“Attorney General Sessions has misrepresented the truth ... time and time again,” Al Franken, a Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee member, said on the Senate floor on Monday.

Sessions is also likely to face tough questions over his decision to ask federal prosecutors to look into whether a special counsel should be appointed to probe any wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation over the sale of a uranium company to Russia.

Sessions asked for prosecutors to look at the matter in response to a letter from Representative Robert Goodlatte, the House Judiciary Committee chairman.

Im Anfang Oktober angelaufenen Geschäftsjahr 2017/18 werde der Umsatz erneut um rund neun Prozent steigen, kündigte Vorstandschef Reinhard Ploss am Dienstag in Neubiberg bei München an. Bei unverändertem Wechselkurs sind ihm zufolge mehr als zehn Prozent Plus möglich.

Eine zu große Abhängigkeit von der Autoindustrie, die für rund 40 Prozent des Umsatzes sorgt, sah Ploss dabei nicht. “Wir gründen unser Wachstum auf viele unterschiedliche Säulen.” Chips für E-Autos und Fahrerassistenzsysteme seien ebenso gefragt wie für automatisierte Produktionsmaschinen oder Schnellladegeräte für Tablets. In drei Jahren dürften seinen Worten zufolge rund 30 Milliarden Geräte zum sogenannten Internet der Dinge gehören; dafür braucht es Vernetzung. “Halbleiter sind die entscheidende Verbindung zwischen digitaler und realer Welt.”

INFINEON SIEHT SICH NICHT ALS ÜBERNAHMEZIEL

In der Autosparte basiere zudem nur noch ein kleiner Teil des Wachstums auf steigenden Absatzzahlen, führte der Vorstandschef aus. Wichtiger sei, dass mehr Halbleiter im Fahrzeug verbaut würden. Als Beispiele nannte er die Verringerung von Emissionen von Verbrennungsmotoren. “Fahrerassistenzsysteme werden auch in Autos der oberen und unteren Mittelklasse immer beliebter, nicht nur in der Premiumklasse.” Zwischen 80 und 90 Prozent der Innovationen im Auto komme mittlerweile aus der Elektronik, aus der Chipbranche, führte Ploss aus. Infineon will in seinem größten Geschäftsbereich zur weltweiten Nummer 1 aufsteigen und den Marktführer NXP überholen. Der Konzern aus den Niederlanden wird derzeit vom US-Rivalen Qualcomm übernommen; dieser wiederum zeigt gerade dem Kaufangebot des Rivalen Broadcom die kalte Schulter.

In der von Übernahmen und Zusammenschlüssen geprägten Halbleiterbranche wolle auch Infineon “ein aktiver Konsolidierer” sein, bekräftigte Ploss. Es müsse aber strategisch Sinn ergeben. Infineon selbst sah er dabei nicht als Übernahmeziel. “Wir werden auch in Zukunft weiter erfolgreich auf eigenen Beinen stehen.”

Im vergangenen Geschäftsjahr steigerten die Bayern den operativen Gewinn der Segmente um 23 Prozent auf gut 1,2 Milliarden Euro. Der Umsatz wuchs um neu Prozent auf mehr als sieben Milliarden Euro. Der schwache Dollar machte dem Unternehmen allerdings in den vergangenen Monaten verstärkt zu schaffen.

Hariri’s resignation while in Saudi Arabia pitched Lebanon into political crisis.

Top Lebanese government officials and senior politicians close to Hariri believe Saudi Arabia coerced him into quitting and has been holding him against his will ever since, though Hariri and Riyadh have denied this.

Hariri cited fear of assassination and accused Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world during his resignation speech.

Hariri gave his first public remarks on Sunday, saying in a televised interview in Riyadh he planned to return to Lebanon within days to affirm his resignation.

Lebanese President Michel Aoun, who has stated that he believes Riyadh is restricting Hariri’s freedom, has refused to his resignation until his return from Saudi Arabia.

At a summit in the Philippines, Donald Trump forged a “great relationship” with President Rodrigo Duterte, who only a year ago had cursed “son of a bitch” Barack Obama for decrying his administration’s bloody war on drug pushers and addicts.

And Trump flashed a thumbs-up as he shook hands with Cambodia’s authoritarian prime minister, Hun Sen, who praised the U.S. president as a kindred spirit for telling countries to put their own interests first.

“You are a great man to me,” Hun Sen said, addressing Trump at a meeting with other Southeast Asian leaders, and then referenced Trump’s ‘America First’ policy.

“I would like to inform you that if you follow your new policy in respect of the independence and sovereignty of other countries, the United States will have a lot of friends and you will be much respected and loved.”

For other leaders across Asia, however, Trump’s go-it-alone instincts must have represented a puzzling departure from his predecessors, who were - to varying degrees - standard bearers of multilateralism, democracy and human rights.

During a tour that took him to Japan, South Korea, China and Vietnam and the Philippines capital, Trump called for joint efforts to tighten the screws on North Korea and its development of nuclear weapons in defiance of U.N. sanctions.

But at an Asia-Pacific summit in Vietnam, he declared that redressing the uneven balance of trade between Asia and the United States was at the center of his “America First” policy, which he says will protect U.S. workers.

Trump’s vision has up-ended a consensus favoring multinational trade pacts whose regional champion is now China. On the sidelines of the Vietnam meeting, 11 countries kept alive a Trans Pacific trade deal that Trump walked away from last year in the name of protecting American jobs.

One cabinet member from a major ASEAN country told Reuters there was little enthusiasm in the region for Trump’s bilateral approach to deals.

“As Singapore Prime Minister Lee pointed out, the reason bilateral trade deals are so attractive for the USA, is precisely why no one will want to enter into one with the USA: because the USA could bully anyone on a bilateral basis,” said the Cabinet member who did not want to be named.

“Why would anyone sign up for that?”

THE ART OF THE DEALS

Trump told reporters before leaving that he had sealed deals of “at least $300 billion, possibly triple that figure”.

U.S. businesses signed around $250 billion dollars worth of deals during Trump’s Beijing visit, but many of those were nonbinding. Missing was any agreement on market access or reduction in technology-sharing agreements that American businesses have long complained about.

For Trump, dogged at home by low public approval ratings and investigations into Russian links to his election campaign, the deals will be an important prize to flaunt on his return.

“The multi-billion-dollar deals he struck in Beijing may not help the U.S. trade deficit,” said a former Japanese diplomat in Tokyo, who declined to be named. “But optically ... he can tell people that because he went to China with business leaders, he was able to come back with a gift.”

Although there were few weighty deliverables from Trump’s tour, for Asian nations looking nervously at China’s increasing assertiveness, it may be welcomed as a sign that his administration is still committed to the region.

“What regional countries wanted was for him to simply show up – to underscore that America remained at least notionally committed to Asia,” said Shahriman Lockman, a senior analyst at the Institute of Strategic & International Studies in Malaysia.

A senior official in South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s administration said Seoul had been worried he ”would come to South Korea and engage in unexpected behavior and language, but it turned out Trump was quite considerate.”

“South Korea was able to rest assured regarding its partnership with the United States,” the official said.

He also got good reviews at the start of his Asia tour in Japan, which has been currying favor with Trump since right after his election when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe jetted off to Trump Tower with an expensive golf club as a present.

“The most important deliverable is that we can send an almost identical message to the world that we share an identical strategy,” a Japanese government official said.

LAVISH RECEPTION

For Asian leaders, Trump’s off-the-cuff style, freewheeling tweets, and rhetorical hyperbole, must have been daunting. But one thing they seemed to learn was that he responds well to a lavish reception.

“They say in the history of people coming to China there has been nothing like that, and I believe it,” Trump told reporters after his visit to Beijing, where President Xi Jinping extended him the honor of a personal tour of the Forbidden City.

One measure of the Asian trip’s success, he said, was the “red carpet, like I think probably nobody has ever received.”

Diplomats say the bonhomie in Beijing probably stemmed in large part from Washington’s expectations Xi will lean more heavily on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Trump’s pronouncements on North Korea during the trip swung from embracing diplomacy to warnings of military intervention. “Do not underestimate us. And do not try us,” he said in a speech to South Korea’s National Assembly.

Days later, after Pyongyang dismissed the speech as “reckless remarks by an old lunatic,” Trump tweeted: “Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ‘old,’ when I would NEVER call him ‘short and fat?’”. And then he tacked back toward diplomacy. “Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!”

David Pressman, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President Obama, said Trump arrived in Asia without a North Korea strategy and left without one.

“Short and fat is not a nuclear strategy,” he said, adding that Washington’s approach to North Korea was fed by “whim, ego, and theatrical calculations of a fickle and uninformed president.”",Trump heads home with 'America First' ringing in Asian ears,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-trump-asia-strategy-analysis/trump-heads-home-with-america-first-ringing-in-asian-ears-idUKKBN1DE1LZ

A Reuters witness saw two other tanks parked beside the main road from Harare to Chinhoyi, about 20 km (14 miles) from the city. One, which was pointed in the direction of the capital, had come off its tracks. Soldiers at the scene refused to talk to Reuters.

Earlier on Tuesday the youth wing of Zimbabwe’s ruling party accused the military chief of subverting the constitution for threatening to intervene after President Robert Mugabe plunged the country into crisis by sacking Mnangagwa last week.

Mnangagwa, 75, a long-serving veteran of Zimbabwe’s 1970s liberation wars, had been viewed as a likely successor to Mugabe before the president fired him on Nov. 6.

His downfall appeared to pave the way for Mugabe’s wife Grace to succeed the 93-year-old president, the only leader Zimbabwe has known in 37 years of independence.

In an unprecedented step, the head of the armed forces, Constantino Chiwenga, openly threatened to intervene in politics on Monday if the purge of war veterans did not stop.

“We must remind those behind the current treacherous shenanigans that, when it comes to matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in,” Chiwenga said in a statement read to reporters at a news conference packed with top brass on Monday.

Grace Mugabe, 52, has developed a strong following in the powerful youth wing of the ruling ZANU-PF party. Her rise has brought her into conflict with the independence-era war veterans, who once enjoyed a privileged role in the ruling party under Mugabe, but who have increasingly been banished from senior government and party roles in recent years.",Tanks seen heading toward Zimbabwe capital: witnesses,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1DE1WB

The provision in the Senate’s tax reform plan, which appeared to catch the industry by surprise, involves the treatment of employee stock options. These options give the holder the right to purchase shares in the future at a set price and can be very valuable if a company does well and the share price increases.

Options are often a major portion of the compensation for startup employees and founders, who take lower salaries in anticipation of a big payout if their startup takes off. Options typically vest over a four-year period.

Senate Republicans have now proposed taxing those stock options as they vest and before startup employees have the opportunity to cash them in, resulting in annual tax bills that could easily climb into the tens of thousands of dollars, say startup founders and venture capitalists.

“If there were a single piece of legislation to adversely affect startups, it would be this,” said Venky Ganesan, managing director at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures. “Everyone is freaked out.”

Justin Field, vice president of government affairs at the National Venture Capital Association, said that the Senate’s proposed tax change would be “crippling” to the startup industry.

How far the provision gets remains to be seen. The National Venture Capital Association was successful in getting a similar proposal removed from the House tax bill, although it “didn’t fully appreciate” the Senate’s intention to add the tax provision, Field said. The association also helped to steer lawmakers away from a proposal discussed late last year to tax venture capitalists’ profits on investments at a higher rate.

Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a member of the Senate Committee on Finance, has filed an amendment to repeal the provision in the tax bill, according to his spokesman.

Under current tax code, employees are taxed only when they exercise their options. Options are exercised when the price they were granted at--known as the strike price--is lower than the share price, and some shares can then be sold to pay the taxes.

But the Senate proposal would require startup employees to pay regular income tax on the value gain of their stock options even before they are exercised. These options are illiquid assets, and cannot be spent or saved.

“What this would mean is every month, when your equity compensation vests a little bit, you will owe taxes on it even though you can’t do anything with that equity compensation,” Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist with Union Square Ventures, wrote on his blog Monday.

For instance, if a startup employee receives stock options at a dollar per share, and the shares increase in value by $1 every year during the four-year vesting period, the employee would have to pay income tax on $1 per share after the first year, pay again on the $1 increase in value after the second year, and so on.

When that employee owns hundreds of thousands and even millions of shares, that is a hefty bill to pay. And there is always the risk the startup will eventually fail.

“This reform will force the average employee to pay taxes on that bet well before they even know if it’s a winning ticket,” said Amanda Kahlow, founder and executive chairman of marketing data startup 6sense.

For startup founders in particular, such a tax bill could be ruinous.

“It would mean that I would have to sell the company,” said Shoaib Makani, founder and chief executive of long-haul trucking startup KeepTruckin. “I have zero net worth aside from the common stock I hold in the company. It would be impossible. I would be in default.”

Some executives in the startup industry, however, have pushed for companies to move toward bigger salaries so employees are not so dependent on options to buy a house or pay for other large expenses. And when startups suffer valuation cuts, employees can end up with worthless options.

The Senate’s proposal came as a revenue-generating measure to help offset tax breaks in the bill. A spokesman for Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, did not respond to requests for comment and other Republicans on the committee were not immediately available.

A spokeswoman for Senator Ron Wyden, the committee’s ranking member and a Democrat, said he was aware of concerns that the provision would limit startups’ ability to attract talent.",Silicon Valley blasts Senate proposal to tax startup options,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-options/silicon-valley-blasts-senate-proposal-to-tax-startup-options-idUSKBN1DE07S?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

O lucro ficou 37 por cento abaixo do registrado no mesmo período de 2016, mas a diferença deve-se a um forte impacto positivo da contabilização pela companhia no ano passado do direito a receber indenizações bilionárias do governo devido à renovação antecipada de contratos de concessão de linhas de transmissão em 2013.

No acumulado dos primeiros nove meses de 2017, o lucro líquido somou 2,27 bilhões de reais, 77 por cento abaixo de 2016, quando as indenizações levaram a estatal a um ganho de 9,77 bilhões de reais.

Trump partiu das Filipinas de volta para casa após um almoço com os outros líderes, já que as reuniões estavam ocorrendo com cerca de duas horas de atraso.

Ele disse a repórteres a bordo do Air Force One, o avião presidencial, que leu seu discurso preparado durante o almoço ao invés de apresentá-lo na reunião da cúpula. O secretário de Estado norte-americano, Rex Tillerson, compareceria à sessão plenária em seu lugar, disse uma autoridade de alto escalão da Casa Branca.

Trump afirmou que sua excursão resultou em ao menos 300 bilhões de dólares, possivelmente o triplo deste valor, em acordos sendo acertados, mas não deu detalhes.

“Explicamos que os Estados Unidos estão abertos para o comércio, mas que queremos um comércio recíproco, justo para os Estados Unidos”, disse.

O comércio e a preocupação com o possível protecionismo da agenda “América Primeiro” de Trump vieram à tona durante sua visita à região, que incluiu paradas no Japão, Coreia do Sul, China e Vietnã e terminou nas Filipinas.

Mais cedo nesta terça-feira, o primeiro-ministro do Canadá, Justin Trudeau, abordou o sofrimento dos refugiados rohingyas e as execuções extrajudiciais filipinas na cúpula, questões de direitos humanos delicadas que foram evitadas por quase todos os outros.

Trump não pressionou o presidente Rodrigo Duterte, nos bastidores da reunião de cúpula de segunda-feira, sobre a sangrenta guerra às drogas nas Filipinas.

Um comunicado conjunto emitido após a reunião informou que os dois lados “ressaltaram que os direitos humanos e a dignidade da vida humana são essenciais, e concordaram em continuar destacando a agenda dos direitos humanos em seus programas nacionais”.

Mas Trudeau disse que, durante a conversa com Duterte, “mencionou os direitos humanos, o Estado de Direito e especificamente as execuções extrajudiciais como sendo temaa que preocupam o Canadá”.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

It is yet another battle for May after scandals and gaffes that have brought questions about her leadership into the open. As many as 40 of her lawmakers would support a no-confidence motion against her, according to the Sunday Times newspaper.

But many sources in her governing Conservative Party say now is not the time to force her out because despite backing Britain remaining in the EU, even if reluctantly, they think she is still the best option to deliver Brexit.

That makes the debates over EU withdrawal bill all the more important as a test of her ability to steer through legislation she says is crucial to give companies confidence that the rules will not change when Britain leaves in March 2019.

With the power balanced in favor of lawmakers rather than the government after the Conservatives lost their majority in a June election, many - even within the party - will use the debate over coming weeks to put the pressure on.

“We have no intention of parliament being a bystander, we are a key participant in this process,” said Hilary Benn, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party who is chair of the Brexit parliamentary committee.

“In the end we are going to have to vote on the final deal, and the outcome of the election and the balance of votes in the House of Commons now really does bring that home,” he told the Institute for Government thinktank earlier this month.

‘COPY AND PASTE’

The public debate in parliament on Tuesday is the first of eight to discuss the bill before it goes on to other legislative stages. The schedule will be determined by the House of Commons over the course of the debates.

Lawmakers have proposed 186 pages of amendments to the bill, which largely ‘copy and paste’ EU rules and regulations into British law but also, critics say, hand the government wide-ranging powers and cut parliament out of some Brexit planning.

The bill is separate from negotiations going on in Brussels, but the EU will want to see how many and which amendments are passed and will regard the showdown as a test of May’s strength at home.

May is under pressure to make progress with the EU at a summit in December after growing European frustration over Britain’s refusal to say how much it thinks it should pay to leave.

The amendments include one to stop the government from adopting the so-called Henry VIII powers, named after the 16th century monarch who ruled by proclamation, which allow the government to amend laws being transposed from EU law.

Other amendments address criticism that parliament will not get a “meaningful vote” on the deal eventually agreed with the EU, and press the government to enshrine in law the EU protections Britons now enjoy such as workers rights and environmental protections.

May’s government has taken some of the fire out of the proposed challenges by signaling it is willing to bend on the Henry VIII powers, and on Monday, her Brexit minister David Davis said parliament would be offered a new vote on the final Brexit deal.

The first debate will cover the part of the bill that repeals the 1972 European Communities Act on the retention, conversion and interpretation of existing EU laws, and EU rights.

“Getting parliamentary scrutiny is a winner. The government will change position because it doesn’t want a defeat,” said one Conservative lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity.

But other issues, such as the push for a vote in parliament on the EU deal which could force the government back to the negotiating table, or even possibly overturn Brexit, present huge challenges.

The debate comes at a new low point for May since she was made prime minister after Britain voted for Brexit last June.

She has lost two ministers in a week, and her foreign minister, Boris Johnson, is under pressure from the opposition to resign over comments about a jailed aid worker in Iran, a case further complicated at the weekend by Gove, his ally.

On Monday, Keir Starmer, the Brexit spokesman for the Labour Party, launched a new bid to derail the withdrawal legislation, saying May’s policy to end the jurisdiction of the EU court - the European Court of Justice - was incompatible with her own policy for a smooth transition after Brexit.

“Over recent weeks, it has become increasingly clear that you alone do not have the authority to deliver a transitional deal with Europe and to take the necessary steps to protect jobs and the economy,” he wrote in an open letter to May.","Weaker than ever, May faces test in UK parliament over Brexit plans",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-bill/weaker-than-ever-may-faces-test-in-parliament-over-brexit-plans-idUKKBN1DD1WT

Representatives Frank Pallone and Elijah Cummings cited FCC decisions that benefited Sinclair, the largest U.S. television broadcast group, and a media report last year that the election campaign of President Donald Trump struck a deal with Sinclair for favorable coverage.

“All of these actions – when taken in context with reported meetings between the Trump administration, Sinclair, and Chairman Pai’s office – have raised serious concerns about whether Chairman Pai’s actions comply with the FCC’s mandate to be independent,” the pair wrote.

Advocacy group Free Press said in an FCC filing in August that Sinclair forces its stations to “air pro-Trump propaganda and then seeks favors from the Trump administration.”

A spokeswoman for Pai said the “request appears to be part of many Democrats’ attempt to target one particular company because of its perceived political views ... Any claim that Chairman Pai is modifying the rules now to benefit one particular company is completely baseless.”

Politico, citing unnamed sources, reported in December that Trump’s campaign made a deal with Sinclair to get favorable coverage in exchange for more access to Trump.

Sinclair did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.

FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, told a congressional committee last month, “All of our media policy decisions seem to be custom-built for this one company.”

Sinclair announced plans in May to acquire Tribune’s 42 TV stations in 33 markets as well as cable network WGN America, extending its reach to 72 percent of American households.

The FCC is set to vote Thursday on Pai’s plan to eliminate the ban on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV station in a major market and make it easier for media companies to buy additional TV stations in the same market. Approval would make it easier for Sinclair to acquire more TV stations.

The FCC will also vote Thursday on Pai’s proposal to allow broadcasters to use new technology to improve picture quality and allow better reception on mobile phones, but it could force consumers to eventually buy new equipment.

After pumping some $10 trillion into financial markets since the 2008 crisis -- driving them many markets to record highs -- the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan are now trying to wean investors off easy money without causing an upset.

To do this, words will be key, the heads of the four central banks told an ECB conference on communication. It is called forward guidance in banker-speak, essentially warning gently of what is coming.

“Forward guidance has become a full-fledged monetary policy instrument,” ECB President Mario Draghi said. “Why discard a monetary policy instrument that has proved to be effective?”

Draghi and his three counterparts are at very different stages in roll-back process.

The Fed is looking at its fifth rate increase and the BOE raised its own rate this month for the first time in 10 years. But the ECB is merely reducing the pace of its bond purchases, and the BOJ is still printing money at full speed, although it has signaled that no additional stimulus is likely.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen agreed with Draghi that guidance has been beneficial “on balance” but stressed it should always be viewed as depending on how the economy actually develops.

“All guidance should be conditional and related to the outlook for the economy,” she said.

Banks such as the ECB often say the envisage doing something but reserve the right to change their mind if circumstances change.

History shows that preparing the ground for a withdrawal of stimulus is not always easy.

Then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke famously sent global bond markets into a tailspin in May 2013 by suggesting that bond purchases could be reduced. In the event, the “taper tantrum” meant bond buys would not be reduced for another 10 months.

Draghi had his own mini-tantrum in June when he hinted that the ECB’s policy could be tweaked to reflect stronger growth. The market sell-off that followed was so big the eventual scaling back of purchases was relatively small and drawn out.

And Bank of England Governor Mark Carney’s guidance on the path for interest rates has repeatedly been knocked off course by surprises in the economy, prompting one lawmaker to call him an “unreliable boyfriend”.

KEEP IT SIMPLE

Hyun Song Shin of the Bank of International Settlements told the ECB conference such unreliability was not necessarily all bad. Too much “predictability and gradualism” could lead investors to take on too much risk.

“Predictability and gradualism may not be a virtue if market participants take them as a commitment not to pull the rug from under their feet while they build up leverage and risk-taking,” the BIS’s head of research said.

Speaking alongside Yellen and Draghi, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the best way to avoid misunderstandings was to keep the message simple.

“It should better be straightforward,” he said. “That’s the best way.”

His UK counterpart, Carney, stressed the importance of reaching the broader public, rather than just financial investors.

“We’re speaking to the people we serve first,” Carney said. “Three hundred thousand people read the Financial Times; there are 30 million Facebook users in the UK.”

Yellen noted that conflicting messages by different Fed policymakers risked confusing the public.

Fed governors talk on an almost daily basis, Kuroda speaks frequently and some of the ECB’s 25 rate-setters appear to live a life of their own, sometimes giving speeches at odds with the ECB’s main policy lines.

A survey by the Brookings Institute think tank found that two-thirds of Fed watchers wanted governors to speak less frequently and over half wanted Yellen to speak more instead, to streamline and focus the message.

Yellen will be replaced as Fed chair in March next year, Carney and Draghi’s terms are up in 2019, and only this week a senior aide to Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe recommended that Bank of Japan governor Kuroda not be reappointed.",Top central bankers vow to talk investors out of easy money,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-ecb-policy-forwardguidance/top-central-bankers-vow-to-talk-investors-out-of-easy-money-idUKKBN1DE183

Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte set the tone of cordiality ahead of the two days of summit meetings he will host, suggesting that despite their differences over claims to the South China Sea, the leaders should not discuss the issue.

“We have to be friends, the other hotheads would like us to confront China and the rest of the world on so many issues,” Duterte said at a business conference, as planes carrying heads of state and government attending the summit landed in quick succession in Manila.

“The South China Sea is better left untouched, nobody can afford to go to war. It can ill-afford a violent confrontation.”

Hours earlier, during a bilateral visit to Vietnam, Trump offered to mediate in the dispute over the South China Sea, where four Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan contest China’s sweeping claims to the busy waterway.

All the claimants will be at the summit, except for Taiwan.

Trump will join leaders of Southeast and East Asian nations in Manila over the next two days, the last leg of a tour that has taken him to Japan, South Korea and China as well as Vietnam.

The sheer length of the trip - the longest to Asia by a U.S. president in more than a quarter century - may reassure some that, despite Trump’s “America First” policy, Washington remains committed to a region China sees as its strategic domain.

GLITZY DINNER

Leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Russia, Japan, Canada, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand arrived one by one for a glitzy gala dinner where they were entertained by singers and dancers.

Each of the men sported a cream-colored barong, a traditional Philippines shirt made of fiber from the pineapple plant, embroidered and worn untucked.

They were served a four-course Filipino-Asian fusion meal curate and prepared by Chef Jessie Sincioco, who also designed the menu for Pope Francis when he visited the Philippines in 2015.

Police used water canon to prevent hundreds of protesters reaching the U.S. embassy in Manila ahead of Trump’s arrival.

Carrying placards declaring “Dump Trump” and “Down with U.S. Imperialism”, the left-wing protesters were blocked by police in riot gear with shields and batons, and then showered with jets of water from a fire engine.

The United States and its former colony, the Philippines, have been strategic allies since World War Two.

Trump is expected to try during the summit to shore up relations, which have been strained by the mercurial Duterte’s notorious anti-U.S. sentiment and his enthusiasm for better ties with Russia and China.

Duterte - sometimes described as the ‘Trump of the East’ because of his brash style - said last week he would tell the U.S. president to “lay off” if he raised the issue of human rights when they met.

More than 3,900 Filipinos have been killed in what the police call self-defense in a war on drugs declared by Duterte. Critics say executions are taking place with no accountability, allegations the police reject.

But Trump, who has been criticized at home for neglecting rights issues in dealings abroad, praised Duterte in May for doing an “unbelievable job on the drug problem”.

“INDO-PACIFIC”

Trump’s tour comes against a background of tensions on the Korean peninsula following exchanges of war-like threats and insults between North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un and Trump over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile development program.

China has been urged by both South Korea and the United States to take a more active role in curbing North Korea’s nuclear and missile ambitions.

During his tour, Trump and his team have repeatedly used the term “Indo-Pacific” instead of “Asia-Pacific” for the region, which some see as an effort to depict it as more than China-dominated.

Pacific Rim nation leaders agreed in Vietnam on Saturday to address “unfair trade practices” and “market distorting subsidies”, a statement that bore the imprint of Trump’s efforts to reshape the global trade landscape.

The summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries in Vietnam put on show the contrasting vision of the “America First” policy with the traditional consensus favoring multinational deals that China now seeks to champion.

Manila hosted the APEC summit two years ago, and at that meeting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a Twitter poll with the hashtag #APEChottie that asked people to vote for the most attractive leader there. Journalists swarmed the youthful leader and screamed in excitement.

On his latest visit, Trudeau visited an outlet of Jollibee, a chain that has become a byword for Filipino fast food, chatting and posing for selfies, charming the people of Manila again.

The Venice, California-based firm, whose March stock market debut was the hottest of any tech stock in years, reported revenue and user growth for the third quarter well below Wall Street expectations as it struggles to compete with Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) Instagram.

Snap’s shares tumbled as much as 20 percent in after-hours trading, before paring losses to trade at $12.57. Snap went public at a price of $17 a share.

Snap has disappointed investors each quarter of its brief existence as a public company.

User growth in the last three months was well below what investment analysts expected. Daily active users rose to 178 million in the third quarter from 173 million in the second quarter. Analysts had expected 181.8 million, according to research firm FactSet.

Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said the company was launching the redesign after hearing for years that Snapchat was difficult to understand or hard to use.

“We are going to make it easier to discover the vast quantity of content on our platform that goes undiscovered or unseen every day,” Spiegel told analysts on a conference call.

The 27-year-old CEO said there was a “strong likelihood” the redesign would be disruptive in the short term, but said Snap was willing to take the risk for long-term gain.

Such a radical change so soon after an IPO is unusual.

Snap is not the only social media company looking to revive growth by changing its look. Microblogging service Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) said on Tuesday it would roll out 280-character tweets to users across the world, double the length of its iconic 140-character tweets.

Asked on the analyst call what Snapchat’s redesign would look like, Spiegel said the company had been studying the evolution of mobile content feeds such as Twitter streams and the Facebook News Feed and saw room for a “personalized content service.”

Spiegel said the company next year would also build more tools for people to share with broad audiences beyond their friends, the type of public broadcasting common on Instagram and Twitter.

“It seems like a significant amount of change in a short period of time,” analyst Rich Greenfield of BTIG told Spiegel on the call. He asked what led to the shifts.

Spiegel said Snap needed to evolve rapidly. “We’re just not afraid to make changes in the long-term interest of the business,” he said.

REVENUE MISS

Snaps’s third-quarter revenue, the bulk of which comes from advertisements, rose to $207.9 million from $128.2 million. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $236.9 million.

Average revenue per user rose to $1.17 in the quarter, from 84 cents a year earlier, but missed analysts’ average estimate of $1.30.

Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan said revenue was affected by a shift toward a software-based auction system for selling ads - a method employed by Facebook and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google - which has driven down the average price.

The auction system hit revenue in the short term but “builds the foundation for long-term scalable revenue,” Khan said in written remarks. He said Snap more than tripled revenue from small- and medium-sized businesses in the third quarter compared with the first half of the year.

Snap is far behind Facebook and Google in making its ad system accessible to small businesses and should move faster, said Greg Portell, a consultant at A.T. Kearney.

“I think they spent a little too much time being different,” Portell said.

Snap recorded a $39.9 million charge in the quarter related to excess inventory of its “Spectacles,” sunglasses with a built-in camera.

Snap posted a net loss of $443.2 million, or 36 cents per share, compared with a loss of $124.2 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.

Wall Street had expected a loss of 32 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Snapchat, popular among millennials for the bunny faces and floral tiaras that can be added to pictures, allows users to chat through a series of disappearing photos and videos. Users can also post images and videos as “stories” - ephemeral posts that can be viewed in chronological order and disappear after 24 hours.

Before the quarterly release, Snap’s share price was already down 39 percent from its close on March 2, its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Facebook’s shares were up 32 percent over that time.

Facebook’s Instagram said in September that it had 500 million daily active users.

Last week Facebook said that Instagram Stories - a replica of Snapchat’s synonymous feature - had 300 million daily users.",Snapchat launches redesign as growth disappoints Wall Street,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-snap-results/snapchat-launches-redesign-as-growth-disappoints-wall-street-idUSKBN1D72YE

Representatives Frank Pallone and Elijah Cummings cited FCC decisions that benefited Sinclair, the largest U.S. television broadcast group, and a media report last year that the election campaign of President Donald Trump struck a deal with Sinclair for favorable coverage.

“All of these actions – when taken in context with reported meetings between the Trump administration, Sinclair, and Chairman Pai’s office – have raised serious concerns about whether Chairman Pai’s actions comply with the FCC’s mandate to be independent,” the pair wrote.

Advocacy group Free Press said in an FCC filing in August that Sinclair forces its stations to “air pro-Trump propaganda and then seeks favors from the Trump administration.”

A spokeswoman for Pai said the “request appears to be part of many Democrats’ attempt to target one particular company because of its perceived political views ... Any claim that Chairman Pai is modifying the rules now to benefit one particular company is completely baseless.”

Politico, citing unnamed sources, reported in December that Trump’s campaign made a deal with Sinclair to get favorable coverage in exchange for more access to Trump.

Sinclair did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.

FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, told a congressional committee last month, “All of our media policy decisions seem to be custom-built for this one company.”

Sinclair announced plans in May to acquire Tribune’s 42 TV stations in 33 markets as well as cable network WGN America, extending its reach to 72 percent of American households.

The FCC is set to vote Thursday on Pai’s plan to eliminate the ban on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV station in a major market and make it easier for media companies to buy additional TV stations in the same market. Approval would make it easier for Sinclair to acquire more TV stations.

The FCC will also vote Thursday on Pai’s proposal to allow broadcasters to use new technology to improve picture quality and allow better reception on mobile phones, but it could force consumers to eventually buy new equipment.

The shock resignation has thrust Lebanon back onto the front line of a power struggle between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Iran - a rivalry that has also buffeted Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain.

Hariri flew to Riyadh on Nov. 3, after meeting in Beirut Ali Akbar Velayati, the top foreign policy adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

“Hariri claims that in our meeting he asked Iran to stop interfering in the Lebanese affairs, but he did not say such a thing,” Velayati was quoted as saying by Iranian state television’s website on Tuesday.

“Our meeting was not tense or violent at all. These are all lies,” he said.

Velayati said Iran hoped Hariri would return to Lebanon, accusing Riyadh of fanning the flames of tension as it “could not tolerate the strategic friendship” between Tehran and Beirut.

Hariri denied Velayati’s account that the Lebanese leader had offered to mediate between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

“Prime Minister Hariri did not offer mediation between any countries,” a statement from his press office said.

“He presented to Velayati his point of view about the need to stop Iranian interventions in Yemen as a gateway and a precondition for any improvement in ties between (Iran) and the kingdom,” it said.

A long-time Saudi ally, Hariri had first mentioned the Velayati meeting in a television interview on Sunday night, his first public comments since quitting.

He warned Lebanon was at risk of Gulf Arab sanctions because of regional meddling by Shi‘ite Hezbollah and said he would return to Lebanon within days.

In his resignation speech in a broadcast from Saudi Arabia on Nov. 4, Hariri said he feared assassination and accused Iran along with Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world.

O executivo disse que o resultado da Eletrobras no terceiro trimestre, um lucro líquido de 550 milhões de reais, é “muito, muito bom”, principalmente se considerado que a companhia está “em recuperação” após anos de dificuldades financeiras.

O lucro ficou 37 por cento abaixo do registrado no mesmo período de 2016, mas a diferença deve-se a um forte impacto positivo da contabilização pela companhia no ano passado do direito a receber indenizações bilionárias do governo devido à renovação antecipada de contratos de concessão de linhas de transmissão em 2013.

No acumulado dos primeiros nove meses de 2017, o lucro líquido somou 2,27 bilhões de reais, 77 por cento abaixo de 2016, quando as indenizações levaram a estatal a um ganho de 9,77 bilhões de reais.

General Constantino Chiwenga, commander of Zimbabwe Defence Forces and a political ally of Mnangagwa who was also expelled from the ruling ZANU-PF, said instability in the party was causing anxiety in Zimbabwe.

Chiwenga’s statement, read out at a news conference packed with army top brass, comes at a time of a deepening rift within ZANU-PF over who will eventually lead the party after the 93-year-old Mugabe goes.

Mnangagwa’s removal provides a boost for Grace Mugabe, the wife of the president, who is supported by the largely youthful G40 faction of ZANU-PF to succeed her husband.

Chiwenga said ZANU-PF had been hijacked by people who did not fight in the 1970s liberation war, a clear shot at G40 wing and Grace Mugabe who is a vocal critic of Mnangagwa.

“We must remind those behind the current treacherous shenanigans that, when it comes to matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in,” Chiwenga said in a statement read to reporters at the news conference.

“The current purging ... targeting members of the party with a liberation background must stop forthwith,” he said.

Mugabe’s 37 years in power has been anchored by support from the military, which has always said it will not back anyone for president who did not fight in the liberation war. But the aging leader has been accusing the generals of taking sides in the succession race.

RARE MOVE

It is rare for the defense forces to publicly take sides in the affairs of ZANU-PF. When Joice Mujuru, a war veteran and Mugabe’s deputy of 10 years, was sacked from the ruling party in 2014, the military remained quiet.

Political analysts however say the military stayed quiet then because the beneficiary of Mujuru’s downfall was the 75-year-old Mnangagwa, a war veteran.

Grace, now poised to become a vice president, did not fight in the liberation war.

The party appears split over the succession with the G40 faction supporting Grace and another faction, that includes war veterans, rooting for the ousted Mnangagwa.

Chiwenga said ZANU-PF had since 2015 been rocked by infighting, which had afflicted the economy, causing serious cash shortages and soaring prices of basic commodities - rare criticism of those in government by the military.

Analysts said if Mugabe responded to Chiwenga’s statement, he would be compelled to choose sides between war veterans and the young turks rallying behind his wife.

“He is in a corner. He has to declare his allegiance. If he condemns that statement, then he is saying therefore I am for the young turks against the war veterans,” said Eldred Masunugure, a political science lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe.

“What we are witnessing is the military saying: ‘We are willing to intervene if the red line is crossed’. It is a warning that the political class in ZANU-PF is about to cross that red line.”","Zimbabwe's top general ready ""to step in"" to end purge of ousted VP supporters",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1DE0NV-OZATP

Novogratz said he expects major financial firms will soon start to offer bitcoin or similar products as an investment option, one that could be easily purchased over the phone.

A turning-point product from a big financial firm could arrive within six months, he said, though he declined to name a specific company.

“When it’s that easy, the price of bitcoin or ethereum is going to go much higher. And that is a lot closer than people think,” said Novogratz, who spoke at the Reuters Global 2018 Investment Outlook Summit in New York.

Novogratz is now chief executive of Galaxy Investment Partners, a firm that bets on cryptocurrencies and related businesses.

“The institutionalization of this space is coming. It’s coming pretty quick,” he said.

For the most part though, institutional investors have stayed away from bitcoin BTC=BTSP, the original and largest crypto-currency in terms of market capitalization, despite outperforming all the world's traditional currencies.

Traditional investors still view bitcoin as opaque and highly speculative with potential to collapse even though so far this year bitcoin has soared nearly 580 percent.

Bitcoin surged on Monday to $6,487, recovering more than $1,000 after losing almost a third of its value in less than four days as traders bought back into the volatile cryptocurrency.

It hit a record peak last week just shy of $8,000.

During the latest pullback over the weekend though, Novogratz said he bought $15 million to $20 million worth of bitcoins.

Early enthusiasts for the crypto-currency were drawn to its revolutionary ideals of transparency and a lack of central or official control. The risks of dealing in bitcoin were laid bare in 2013 when Tokyo-based exchange Mt Gox collapsed after admitting it had lost the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars of investor funds.

The currency’s earlier ties to gambling and criminal websites did not endear it to traditional investors.

But bitcoin has since overcome some of those challenges. “We’re past that,” he said.

BIGGEST REGRET FOR 2017

Novogratz’s biggest regret this year has been not buying more cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum, when prices fell, because he knew that they would keep going up.

Ethereum is another public blockchain, essentially a shared database, similar to that of bitcoin. Ethereum’s token is called ether.

He felt that he made a psychological mistake, comparing the original price he paid to ethereum’s value over the summer. “When it was time to buy it back, I didn’t buy enough back,” he said.

He sees bitcoin, for instance, hitting $10,000 by March.

The former Fortress executive recently created his own crypto-hedge fund, putting in about $100 million of his own money. He hopes to raise about $500 million, making it the largest fund of its kind.

Novogratz said Galaxy’s largest investment is in bitcoin. It has a “very big” holding of ethereum and about 30-35 different tokens and companies. He declined to give the percentages of each holding, citing competitive reasons.

One of those investments is in the token sale of Worldwide Asset Exchange, an online marketplace for so-called “skins,” which are essentially virtual accessories of video game characters. The total market for “skins” is $50 billion.

The skins don’t have much application except to change how a character or a weapon looks.

He is also an investor in FunFair, a decentralized gaming platform.

FORTRESS EXIT

Novogratz, a former Princeton University wrestler, U.S. Army helicopter pilot, and Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) partner, is best known as a swaggering “macro” investor in the mold of George Soros who made big wagers on global economic movements.

Novogratz worked at Fortress from 2002 to 2015, where he was a principal and ran its macro hedge funds. They grew to manage billions of dollars and made “Novo” a Wall Street star. But the funds were shut in 2015 following investment losses. Novogratz retired from the firm.

“Very few people have graceful exits from Wall Street. Mine wasn’t as graceful as I would have liked,” he told Reuters.

After Fortress, Novogratz planned to focus running his own money and avoid the complications of external investors. But he fell in love with the promise of blockchain technology after successfully investing in bitcoin, ethereum and other assets.

He has quickly become one of the most prominent advocates of blockchain and has been working to convince larger, more conservative asset managers to get involved.

“It’s potentially wildly disruptive and revolutionary,” Novogratz said.

Trump left for home from the Philippines after a lunch with the other leaders, as meetings were running about two hours behind schedule.

He told reporters on Air Force One that he had delivered his prepared remarks during the lunch instead of the summit meeting. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson would attend the plenary session in his place, a senior White House official said.

Trump said his trip had resulted in at least $300 billion, possibly triple that figure, of deals being agreed. He did not elaborate.

“We’ve explained that the United States is open for trade but we want reciprocal, we want fair trade for the United States,” he said.

Trade and concern about possible protectionism under Trump’s “America First” agenda have come up during his visit to the region, which included stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam before concluding in the Philippines.

Earlier in the day, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau raised the plight of Rohingya refugees and extra-judicial killings in the Philippines at the summit, sensitive human rights issues skirted by almost all the others.

There was no pressure from Trump over the Philippines’ bloody war on drugs during a meeting on Monday with President Rodrigo Duterte on the sidelines of the summit.

A joint statement after the meeting said the two sides “underscored that human rights and the dignity of human life are essential, and agreed to continue mainstreaming the human rights agenda in their national programs.”

However, Trudeau said that during his conversation with Duterte, he “mentioned human rights, rule of law and specifically extra-judicial killings as being an issue that Canada is concerned with.”

“The president was receptive to my comments and it was throughout a very cordial and positive exchange,” Trudeau told a news conference.

More than 3,900 pushers and users have been killed in the war on drugs that Duterte declared when he took office last year. His government says the police act in self-defense, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability.

Duterte cursed Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, last year for raising concerns about the war on drugs and he subsequently declared that he was breaking with the United States, a close ally of the Philippines since World War Two. Trump, by contrast, said on Monday he had a “great relationship” with Duterte.

ROHINGYA CRISIS

Slideshow (8 Images)

Trudeau said he also met Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and raised the plight of Rohingya refugees, although he did not mention the Muslim minority by name.

“This is a tremendous concern to Canada and to many, many countries around the world,” he said.

The government in mostly-Buddhist Myanmar regards the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and does not recognize the term.

Over 600,000 Rohingya have fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh since military clearance operations were launched in response to attacks by Rohingya militants on Aug. 25.

The plight of the Rohingya has brought outrage from around the world and there have been calls for democracy champion Suu Kyi to be stripped of the Nobel peace prize she won in 1991 because she has not condemned the military’s actions.

Some countries in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), particularly Muslim-majority Malaysia, have voiced strong concern over the issue recently.

However, in keeping with ASEAN’s principle of non-interference in each others’ internal affairs, it appeared to have been put aside at the summit, which brought Southeast Asian nations together with the United States, Japan, China, India, Australia and Canada.","Trump skips East Asia summit plenary, but says trip was a success",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1DE0J8

Josh Hawley, a Republican seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill in next year’s elections, announced at a press conference that he issued an investigative subpoena to Google. He expressed concern over the accuracy of the company’s privacy policy, allegations it misappropriated content from rivals and claims it demoted competitors’ websites in search results.

Google said it had not yet received the subpoena.

“However, we have strong privacy protections in place for our users and continue to operate in a highly competitive and dynamic environment,” spokesperson Andrea Faville said in a statement.

Google has come under growing scrutiny globally as it has become a top provider of online search, mobile software and advertising technology. But formal investigations have reached varying results in the last seven years.

Attorney generals of 37 states reached a $7 million settlement in 2013 over Google’s unauthorized collection of Wi-Fi data through its Street View digital-mapping cars. A Federal Trade Commission inquiry also prompted Google that year to agree to provide advertisers and patent licensees more flexible terms.

The FTC, though, did not bring the stronger antitrust charges that Google rivals such as Microsoft Corp and Yelp Inc sought. States including Ohio, Mississippi and Texas saw inquiries falter without substantive consequences.

Missouri’s Hawley said the FTC’s inaction created an opening.

“We are going to act to hold corporate giants accountable ... for the good of the people of Missouri,” Hawley said.

Asked at the press conference whether his senate candidacy played a role in opening the Google inquiry, Hawley said he acted upon his oath of office and desire “to get to the truth.”

He pointed to the European Union fining Google $2.7 billion in June for unfairly favoring links to its own shopping service over those from other e-commerce websites. Hawley said he was moved to act because of concern that Google is engaging in similar behavior domestically. Google is appealing the EU fine.

The other issue cited by Hawley may be tied to complaints from Yelp. The business reviews’ website wrote the FTC and the attorney generals of all 50 states in September that Google has copied images from its service without permission in violation of a commitment made to the U.S. antitrust regulator.",Google faces antitrust investigation in Missouri,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-antitrust/google-faces-antitrust-investigation-in-missouri-idUSKBN1DD2CE

Trump left for home from the Philippines after a lunch with the other leaders, as meetings were running about two hours behind schedule.

He told reporters on Air Force One that he had delivered his prepared remarks during the lunch instead of the summit meeting. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson would attend the plenary session in his place, a senior White House official said.

Trump said his trip had resulted in at least $300 billion, possibly triple that figure, of deals being agreed. He did not elaborate.

“We’ve explained that the United States is open for trade but we want reciprocal, we want fair trade for the United States,” he said.

Trade and concern about possible protectionism under Trump’s “America First” agenda have come up during his visit to the region, which included stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam before concluding in the Philippines.

Earlier in the day, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau raised the plight of Rohingya refugees and extra-judicial killings in the Philippines at the summit, sensitive human rights issues skirted by almost all the others.

There was no pressure from Trump over the Philippines’ bloody war on drugs during a meeting on Monday with President Rodrigo Duterte on the sidelines of the summit.

A joint statement after the meeting said the two sides “underscored that human rights and the dignity of human life are essential, and agreed to continue mainstreaming the human rights agenda in their national programs.”

However, Trudeau said that during his conversation with Duterte, he “mentioned human rights, rule of law and specifically extra-judicial killings as being an issue that Canada is concerned with.”

“The president was receptive to my comments and it was throughout a very cordial and positive exchange,” Trudeau told a news conference.

More than 3,900 pushers and users have been killed in the war on drugs that Duterte declared when he took office last year. His government says the police act in self-defense, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability.

Duterte cursed Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, last year for raising concerns about the war on drugs and he subsequently declared that he was breaking with the United States, a close ally of the Philippines since World War Two. Trump, by contrast, said on Monday he had a “great relationship” with Duterte.

ROHINGYA CRISIS

Trudeau said he also met Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and raised the plight of Rohingya refugees, although he did not mention the Muslim minority by name.

“This is a tremendous concern to Canada and to many, many countries around the world,” he said.

The government in mostly-Buddhist Myanmar regards the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and does not recognize the term.

Over 600,000 Rohingya have fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh since military clearance operations were launched in response to attacks by Rohingya militants on Aug. 25.

The plight of the Rohingya has brought outrage from around the world and there have been calls for democracy champion Suu Kyi to be stripped of the Nobel peace prize she won in 1991 because she has not condemned the military’s actions.

Some countries in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), particularly Muslim-majority Malaysia, have voiced strong concern over the issue recently.

However, in keeping with ASEAN’s principle of non-interference in each others’ internal affairs, it appeared to have been put aside at the summit, which brought Southeast Asian nations together with the United States, Japan, China, India, Australia and Canada.","Trump skips East Asia summit plenary, but says trip was a success",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-asean-summit/trump-skips-east-asia-summit-plenary-but-says-trip-was-a-success-idUSKBN1DE0JE?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

Massive asset buying programs and drastic interest rate cuts have stabilized the world’s economies following the global financial crisis but central bankers are starting to put their big policy guns away.

As they shepherd economies back to full health central bankers will instead need to choose their words carefully to manage expectations about future policy and avoid any damaging overreaction or misinterpretation by markets.

Communication is becoming such a policy focus that U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney are meeting in Frankfurt on Tuesday to discuss how central banks should speak.

“Once the asset purchase program is tapered the ECB will have to use its guidance on rates as the main policy instrument,” an ECB Governing Council member, who asked not to be named, said.

Part of the problem now is that central bankers just keep talking. Fed governors talk on an almost daily basis, Kuroda speaks frequently and some of the ECB’s 25 rate-setters appear to live a life of their own, sometimes giving speeches at odds with the European central bank’s main policy lines.

Last Thursday, eight European Central Bank policymakers, including five board members, spoke publicly but there was no major policy glitch that needed addressing specifically and few of the speeches carried any significant policy message.

In the United States, a survey by the Brookings Institute think-tank found that two-thirds of Fed watchers wanted governors to speak less frequently and over half wanted Yellen to speak more instead to streamline and focus the message.

‘UNRELIABLE BOYFRIEND’

Interest rates are expected to stay below historic averages for years, if not a decade, so the scope for actual rate changes has diminished and promises about future policy will play a bigger role in guiding markets, central bankers say.

The Fed estimates that neutral interest rates are 2.75 percent, down from 4.25 percent before the crisis, but current rates are still less then half this despite four rate rises by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) since the end of 2015.

“With a low neutral federal funds rate, there will typically be less scope for the FOMC to reduce short-term interest rates in response to an economic downturn, raising the possibility that we may need to resort again to enhanced forward rate guidance and asset purchases to provide needed accommodation,” Yellen said last month.

The ECB is in an even more precarious position. It may end its 2.55 trillion euro ($3 trillion) asset purchases next year but will still be far from raising interest rates.

That too will leave its “forward guidance” - a pledge to keep rates low until well after the bond buying ends - as the chief tool to guide long-term interest rates.

While central banks have often relied on guidance as a policy tool, communication flops during the post-crisis normalization process have been aplenty.

In 2013, the Fed’s suggestion that asset purchases might be coming to a close caused market mayhem. Analysts say the so-called taper tantrum probably ended up prolonging the U.S. bond buying program.

Draghi’s speech in Sintra this year, which suggested that tighter monetary policy might be on the cards, resulted in such a big market sell-off that the eventual policy change was considered relatively mild.

Carney has also had his run-ins with words as his guidance on the path for interest rates was repeatedly knocked off course by surprises in the economy, prompting one lawmaker to call him an “unreliable boyfriend”.

CREDIBILITY ISSUE

Slideshow (3 Images)

The challenge for central bankers now is to nuance their communication to chart a path for long-term rates in a very low interest rate environment - and also start to explain what a new policy framework would look like if another crisis emerges.

“That comes with a number of challenges that have not been fully addressed,” said Frederik Ducrozet, an economist at Pictet Wealth Management said. “Forward guidance to me is too short an answer.”

“What’s the new monetary style? Will there be a regime shift to some sort to some sort of nominal GDP (gross domestic product) targeting? Do they want to use the balance sheet as a normal tool?” Ducrozet said.

For now, the Bank of Japan is coming under pressure to start discussing how it will eventually end its prolonged period of ultra-easy monetary policy.

Kuroda has so far rejected that demand, even though he has recently suggested that the Bank of Japan could tweak monetary policy before achieving its inflation target.

The day of reckoning is also coming for the ECB. It has learned from the mistakes of others and kept markets calm by promising low rates until “well past” the end of its asset buying program.

But some investors say this time frame is too vague and needs to be refined.

Indeed, some argue that the ECB’s decision to extend it’s bond buying program by nine months to September 2018 was really designed to push back expectations of a rate rise, given the stimulus won’t be that significant.

The booing of the anthem, “The March of the Volunteers”, has become a fixture at football matches in the Chinese-ruled territory, with some parallels to protests in the United States where American football players have knelt during the national anthem, an act denounced by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Now the former British colony is preparing to introduce a law that will penalize people who boo the anthem, a measure that critics say undermines the city’s autonomy and freedoms guaranteed when it returned to China 20 years ago.

Details of the law, including jail terms and the scope of enforcement, have yet to be set. China extended the law to cover Hong Kong earlier this month.

Chinese President Xi Jinping in recent years has ushered in new legislation aimed at securing the country from threats both within and outside its borders, besides presiding over a sweeping crackdown on dissent and free speech.

Chinese officials have said the anthem law is necessary to safeguard the authority of the state.

Several hundred fans greeted the anthem before the match against Lebanon with jeers and boos, with some unfurling banners that said “Die for Hong Kong”, while others yelled “We are Hong Kong” in English, rather than the local Cantonese dialect.

Some security guards signaled to the supporters to behave.

“I‘m not scared even if it becomes law ... I will go to the toilet instead of sitting when the national anthem is on,” Hong Kong supporter Bendter Chong said when asked if he would continue to jeer the anthem when the law is enacted.

Tensions between Hong Kong and mainland China have increased in recent years amid calls for greater democracy. Mass street protests in 2014 paralyzed parts of the city although they failed to secure concessions on electoral reform from Beijing.

Most of the jeering was from youths, underscoring how the younger generation has become increasingly disaffected by political tension and economic hardship.

Security was tight at the Hong Kong Stadium, the venue for the city’s annual Rugby Sevens tournament, where about 10,000 gathered for the match. The stadium has capacity for 40,000.

The game ended Lebanon 1, Hong Kong 0.

“I’m not sure about the law, but for sure people will be more behaved,” said Hong Kong supporter Fai Chan. “But it is still a matter of whether it is worth our respect.”

Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” arrangement that guarantees a high degree of autonomy, including an independent judiciary and freedom of expression.

In 2015, Hong Kong football fans booed the Chinese anthem during a World Cup qualifier, prompting a fine for the Hong Kong Football Association from world body FIFA.

The association was warned by the Asian Football Confederation recently over the conduct of fans and said “a repeat violation may result in more severe punishment”.",Hong Kong soccer fans defy Beijing by booing Chinese national anthem,https://www.reuters.com/article/china-hongkong-anthem/hong-kong-soccer-fans-defy-beijing-by-booing-chinese-national-anthem-idINKBN1DE1QB

U.S. stock index futures pointed to a mixed opening for Wall Street, with worries about Republican tax plans and the economy’s ability to deal with more rises in interest rates preventing sharper gains.

The uplift to German and euro zone sentiment came after disappointing Chinese industrial and retail figures had subdued Asia, with investors also pondering whether a marked flattening in the U.S. yield curve might be a harbinger of a more global slowdown.

There was no sign of that in Germany where a 0.8 percent third-quarter growth reading beat forecasts and showed the economy expanding at annualized rates of more than 3 percent.

The euro jumped over $1.17 versus the dollar EUR=EBS on the figures and reached a one-year top against Sweden's crown EURSEK= after inflation figures there came in weaker than expected.

“It is not the dollar that is weak, it is the euro that is strong,” said John Hardy, Saxo Bank’s head of FX strategy. “The next couple of days will be important to see where the euro closes for the direction now in euro/dollar.”

Combined with signs of a move up again in European bond yields [GVD/EUR], this suggested some traders were back to pricing in an end to the European Central Bank’s stimulus, he said.

Also keeping traders busy were 13 central bank speakers, including the heads of the U.S., European, British and Japanese central banks.

The four were speaking together at an ECB conference in Frankfurt. They promised to keep openly guiding investors about future policy moves as they slowly withdraw the huge monetary stimulus rolled out during the financial crisis.

The mood in Asia hasn’t been nearly so bullish.

China’s retail sales rose 10 percent on the year in October, while industrial output grew 6.2 percent. But both were under market forecasts and briefly hit the Australian dollar, which is often used as a liquid proxy for China because of the country’s vast exports of raw materials to China.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS dipped 0.17 percent after two sessions of declines, while Australia fell 0.9 percent.

Japan's Nikkei .N225 managed to recoup 0.4 percent after four sessions of losses, but that was not enough to shift MSCI's 47-country world index out of the red until Europe opened.

Wall Street was set to open lower after being unsettled on Monday by a sharp drop in General Electric shares, though that had been offset by gains in high dividend-paying sectors including consumer staples and utilities. [.N]

With European shares back in the red for a fifth day in six, MSCI’s 47-country “All world” index was also flirting with its fourth down day, which would be its worst run since August.

Elsewhere, sterling dropped after slightly softer than forecast inflation and hit a three-week low. It was at

May’s blueprint for Britain’s departure from the European Union faces a test starting on Tuesday, when lawmakers try to win concessions on legislation to sever ties.

The dollar drifted back 0.1 percent at 113.48 yen JPY= after bouncing from 113.25 support overnight.

EYING THE YIELD CURVE

A rise in U.S. bond yields has generally made it more attractive to buy dollars with money borrowed in low-rate currencies like the yen and Swiss franc.

Figures on Monday from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed the net short position in the Japanese yen to be the largest since January 2014 and in the Swiss franc to the biggest since December 2016.

Yields on Treasury two-year notes US2YT=RR hit a fresh nine-year high of 1.6910 percent on Monday, shrinking the spread to 10-year debt to near its smallest since 2007. [/US]

The trend in part reflects market wagers that the Fed’s plans to raise rates in December and two or three times next year will slow down the U.S. economy.

Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, said history suggested a flatter, and particularly an inverted, yield curve was “compelling as an early warning sign” of recession.

But with the average amount of time it has taken the curve to go from flat to inverted being 18 months and another 18 months to go from inverted to recession, it suggests the expansion still has multiple years in it, said Porcelli.

In commodity markets, gold XAU= inched down to $1,272.50 an ounce. The metal has stayed broadly within $15 an ounce of its 100-day moving average, currently at $1,277 an ounce, for most of the last month.

Oil prices held in a tight range as support from Middle East tensions and record long bets by fund managers balanced rising U.S. production.

There is a risk the civil service could run out of money unless the British government passes the bill in Westminster before the end of the month, Britain’s minister for the region James Brokenshire told parliament.

“Without further action there are risks that the civil service would simply run out of resources,” he said. “No government could simply stand by and allow that to happen.”

Irish Nationalists Sinn Fein and the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have shared power in Northern Ireland for a decade under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement, which ended three decades of violence that killed 3,600 people.

But Sinn Fein pulled out in January, complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner.

The latest attempts to form a power-sharing government in Belfast collapsed earlier this month when Brokenshire said he had no choice but to set a budget, a step towards direct rule from London.

Many in the province fear direct rule would further destabilise a political balance between pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists that has already been upset by Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.

Derek Kan, who was previously an official at San Francisco-based ride services company Lyft Inc, won confirmation to be undersecretary of transportation for policy on a 90-7 vote.

Senate Republicans have said their Democratic rivals were stalling a number of nominees over a dispute over funding for the $24 billion “Gateway Program,” which includes building a new tunnel underneath New York’s Hudson River. At least eight other Transportation Department nominations are pending and other jobs vacant, including a top auto safety regulator.

In addition to confirming Kan, the Senate voted 50-47 on Monday to advance the nomination of Steven Bradbury, a Washington lawyer, to be general counsel at the Transportation Department.

During the administration of President George W. Bush, Bradbury was one of the principal authors of the legal justifications for “enhanced interrogation techniques” called the “torture memos” by critics. Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, said in June that Bradbury “lacked the judgment to stand up against (the Bush) administration’s use of torture.”

Bradbury defended his work in June, saying the “questions we addressed raised difficult issues about which reasonable people could disagree.”

In September, President Donald Trump met with top elected officials from New York and New Jersey over the fate of the Gateway Program deemed critical to northeast U.S. transportation, but Trump made no commitments to finance the project.

Republican Senator John Thune accused Democrats of holding nominations “hostage” while awaiting “assurances that the Trump administration will approve and fund” the Gateway project.

“While no one questions the importance of this corridor, there are many other important projects that also are awaiting approval and funding at the Department. No project should get to cut the line based on the machinations of a handful of our” colleagues, Thune said.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on Monday he opposed Kan because of administration roadblocks to the project. “Time is running out and we must quickly build new tunnels,” Schumer said.

A Senate Democratic aide confirmed, separately, that Democrats were holding up some nominations “because they want assurances from the Transportation Department the Gateway Project will quickly move forward after it’s funded.”

Luscious rosogolla, or sweet cheese balls dripping with sugar syrup, have long been a favorite dessert across the Indian subcontinent and among the diaspora.

But two eastern states, West Bengal and Odisha, have been arguing over the origins of rosogolla, which means a ball of sweet. They consulted historians and produced old documents to support their claims.

On Tuesday, the federal commerce and industry ministry ruled that the sweet originated from West Bengal, giving it the coveted “geographical indications” tag.

Options are often a major portion of the compensation for startup employees and founders, who take lower salaries in anticipation of a big payout if their startup takes off.

The provision in the Senate’s tax reform plan, which appeared to catch the industry by surprise, involves the treatment of employee stock options. These options give the holder the right to purchase shares in the future at a set price and can be very valuable if a company does well and the share price increases.

Options are often a major portion of the compensation for startup employees and founders, who take lower salaries in anticipation of a big payout if their startup takes off. Options typically vest over a four-year period.

Senate Republicans have now proposed taxing those stock options as they vest and before startup employees have the opportunity to cash them in, resulting in annual tax bills that could easily climb into the tens of thousands of dollars, say startup founders and venture capitalists.

“If there were a single piece of legislation to adversely affect startups, it would be this,” said Venky Ganesan, managing director at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures. “Everyone is freaked out.”

Justin Field, vice president of government affairs at the National Venture Capital Association, said that the Senate’s proposed tax change would be “crippling” to the startup industry.

How far the provision gets remains to be seen. The National Venture Capital Association was successful in getting a similar proposal removed from the House tax bill, although it “didn’t fully appreciate” the Senate’s intention to add the tax provision, Field said. The association also helped to steer lawmakers away from a proposal discussed late last year to tax venture capitalists’ profits on investments at a higher rate.

Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a member of the Senate Committee on Finance, has filed an amendment to repeal the provision in the tax bill, according to his spokesman.

Under current tax code, employees are taxed only when they exercise their options. Options are exercised when the price they were granted at--known as the strike price--is lower than the share price, and some shares can then be sold to pay the taxes.

But the Senate proposal would require startup employees to pay regular income tax on the value gain of their stock options even before they are exercised. These options are illiquid assets, and cannot be spent or saved.

“What this would mean is every month, when your equity compensation vests a little bit, you will owe taxes on it even though you can’t do anything with that equity compensation,” Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist with Union Square Ventures, wrote on his blog Monday.

For instance, if a startup employee receives stock options at a dollar per share, and the shares increase in value by $1 every year during the four-year vesting period, the employee would have to pay income tax on $1 per share after the first year, pay again on the $1 increase in value after the second year, and so on.

When that employee owns hundreds of thousands and even millions of shares, that is a hefty bill to pay. And there is always the risk the startup will eventually fail.

“This reform will force the average employee to pay taxes on that bet well before they even know if it’s a winning ticket,” said Amanda Kahlow, founder and executive chairman of marketing data startup 6sense.

For startup founders in particular, such a tax bill could be ruinous.

“It would mean that I would have to sell the company,” said Shoaib Makani, founder and chief executive of long-haul trucking startup KeepTruckin. “I have zero net worth aside from the common stock I hold in the company. It would be impossible. I would be in default.”

Some executives in the startup industry, however, have pushed for companies to move toward bigger salaries so employees are not so dependent on options to buy a house or pay for other large expenses. And when startups suffer valuation cuts, employees can end up with worthless options.

The Senate’s proposal came as a revenue-generating measure to help offset tax breaks in the bill. A spokesman for Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, did not respond to requests for comment and other Republicans on the committee were not immediately available.

A spokeswoman for Senator Ron Wyden, the committee’s ranking member and a Democrat, said he was aware of concerns that the provision would limit startups’ ability to attract talent.",Silicon Valley blasts Senate proposal to tax startup options,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-options/silicon-valley-blasts-senate-proposal-to-tax-startup-options-idUSKBN1DE07S

The European Commission’s move could impact other sports and become as important a milestone as the landmark 1995 court ruling involving Belgian soccer player Jean-Marc Bosman, which paved the way for the free movement of players in the EU.

The ruling could set a precedent that would make it easier for unofficial and ‘breakaway’ events and competitions set up without the approval of a sports’ governing body.

The Commission ruling, which is expected by the end of November or early December, is likely to order the International Skating Union (ISU) to amend its system of penalties, which include lifetime bans for competing in unauthorized events, the sources told Reuters.

The ISU found itself in the EU competition enforcer’s crosshairs two years ago after Dutch Olympic speed skaters Mark Tuitert and Niels Kerstholt raised grievances after being put off competing in lucrative Ice Derby events run by a South Korean company by threats of a lifetime ban.

“The eligibility rules reveal a manifest conflict of interest between the ISU’s regulatory and commercial functions,” said Ben Van Rompuy, the lawyer for the skaters and a lecturer in competition law at Leiden University in the Netherlands.

“We are eagerly awaiting the Commission’s decision and we are confident that it will set an important precedent to the benefit of European athletes in numerous sports,” he said.

Both the EU’s competition enforcer and the Lausanne-based ISU, which previously said such an approach could destroy the Olympic values underpinning sport, declined to comment on the matter.

In its 2016 charge sheet, the Commission said the ISU’s penalties, which range from five-year to lifetime bans, were anti-competitive because they were disproportionately punitive, restricted the athletes’ commercial freedom and prevented new entrant organizers.

In an indication of the wider potential impact of the ruling, International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach called in June for the protection of what he called the ‘European sports model’.

“Our concern stems from the fact that a purely market-based approach to sport organizations would ignore the social contribution of sport to help achieve objectives of common interest,” said Bach who argued that federations were investing in youth activities.

Bach called on the Commission to “safeguard the volunteer engagement and to protect the European Model of Sport, rather than destroying it by applying the same rules as it does for industries, like car manufacturing or steel production”.",Exclusive: EU set to rule in favor of speed skaters over ISU ban threat - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-isu-skating-antitrust/exclusive-eu-set-to-rule-in-favour-of-speed-skaters-over-isu-ban-threat-sources-idINKBN1DE1V7?il=0

Survivors, many left homeless by the 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck villages and towns in a mountainous area bordering Iraq, battled overnight temperatures just above freezing and faced another bleak day on Tuesday in need of food and water.

The death toll of 530, reported by state news agency IRNA, made it Iran’s deadliest earthquake in more than a decade. Thousands of people were injured and 30,000 homes damaged. Two whole villages were destroyed.

The quake struck on the Iran-Iraq border, causing most of its damage in Iran despite an epicenter on the Iraq side of the frontier. Iraqi officials said seven people were killed and 325 injured in Iraq, all in the northern Kurdish provinces.

Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani arrived in the morning in the stricken area in Kermanshah province and promised that the government would “use all its power to resolve the problems in the shortest time”.

Thousands of people huddled in makeshift camps while many others chose to spend a second night in the open, despite low temperatures, because they feared more tremors after some 193 aftershocks, state television said.

A homeless young woman in Sarpol-e Zahab, one of the hardest-hit towns, told state TV that her family was exposed to the night cold because of lack of tents.

“We need help. We need everything. The authorities should speed up their help,” she said.

Television showed rescue workers combing through the rubble of dozens of villages immediately after the quake. But by Tuesday morning Iranian officials said there was no longer any likelihood of finding survivors and called the rescue off.

“The rescue operations in Kermanshah province have ended,” Pir-Hossein Kolivand, head of Iran’s Emergency Medical Services, said.

Iran’s top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, offered his condolences on Monday to the victims and called on government agencies to do all they could to help.

The Iranian army, the elite Revolutionary Guards and forces of its affiliated Basij militia were dispatched to affected areas on Sunday night.

BITTER COLD

Hospitals in nearby provinces took in many of the injured, state television said, airing footage of survivors waiting to be treated. Hundreds of critically injured were dispatched to hospitals in Tehran.

Iran’s Red Crescent said emergency shelter had been provided for thousands of homeless people, but a lack of water and electricity as well as blocked roads in some areas hindered aid supply efforts.

“People in some villages are still in dire need of food, water and shelter,” said the governor of Qasr-e Shirin county in Kermanshah province, Faramarz Akbari.

The mayor of Ezgeleh, a city in Kermanshah, said 80 percent of its buildings had collapsed. Survivors desperately needed tents with elderly people and babies as young as one-year-old sleeping in the cold for two straight nights.

In an interview with state television, Nazar Barani asked people to send fuel, milk, water and food as emergency services were too slow and providing limited provisions.

“People are hungry and thirsty,” a local man told ISNA news agency. “There is no electricity. Last night I cried when I saw children with no food or shelter.”

Houses in Iranian villages are often made of concrete blocks or mudbrick that can crumble and collapse in a strong quake. Some people are angry that among the collapsed buildings were homes that the government has built in recent years under an affordable housing program.

Photographs posted on Iranian news websites showed rescue workers digging people out of collapsed buildings, cars smashed beneath rubble and rescue dogs trying to find signs of life under the twisted ruins.

“More people will die because of cold. My family lives in a village near Sarpol-e Zahab. I cannot even go there. I don’t know whether they are dead or alive,” Rojan Meshkat, 38, in the Kurdish city of Sanandaj told Reuters by telephone.

Iran is crisscrossed by major fault lines and has suffered several devastating earthquakes in recent years, including a 6.6 magnitude quake in 2003 that reduced the historic southeastern city of Bam to dust and killed some 31,000 people.","Iran ends quake rescue operations, hungry survivors battle cold",https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-quake/iran-ends-quake-rescue-operations-hungry-survivors-battle-cold-idINKBN1DD2SQ

In a bumper home season, which started in September 2016, India won 10 of 13 test matches, with their solitary defeat coming against Steve Smith’s Australia.

Even on home ground Sri Lanka have struggled against India, losing 9-0 across all three formats in July and August.

Under Kohli, the world’s top-ranked test side have won eight consecutive series dating back to 2015, and Sri Lanka look incapable of stopping them from winning a ninth to tie England and Australia for the record for most consecutive test series wins.

After being hammered at home by India, Sri Lanka then won a two-test series against Pakistan 2-0 in the United Arab Emirates but subsequently lost all eight limited-overs matches against the same opponents.

Their test record in India inspires little confidence as they have failed to record a single victory in 17 matches, the last of which was played eight years ago.

Former captain Angelo Mathews and spin spearhead Rangana Herath were the only two current squad members who played a part in that 2009 series and Sri Lanka will lean on them heavily once again.

Sri Lanka coach Nic Pothas hopes the players have learned from the recent home series whitewash but wants them to focus on their own strengths instead of the Indian threat.

“The mistake you can make here is come and be infatuated with the Indian side and concentrate too much on them,” Pothas said on the team’s arrival in India.

”We know they are a good side. We only played them a month ago. We have to concentrate on our strengths and jobs, and if we can execute them well it will be a challenging series.

“The series against India was a huge learner for us. I also mentioned that if we didn’t learn from a very good team then that would have been the biggest error.”

DUAL SPIN THREAT

While Sri Lanka’s bowling attack must find a way to stop the likes of Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara from scoring heavily, their batsmen will have to contend with India’s dual spin threat of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.

Most sides have found off-spinner Ashwin and left-armer Jadeja too hot to handle but Sri Lanka might be in for an even rougher ride with the pair likely keen to prove a point after being overlooked by selectors for India’s limited-overs sides.

While good news is in short supply for Sri Lanka they will at least be thankful for not having to face 24-year-old all-rounder Hardik Pandya, who is being rested having played non-stop from the Champions Trophy in June.

Pandya made his test debut in the series in Sri Lanka and made a big impact, hitting a maiden fifty and hundred while taking four wickets with his medium pace bowling.

Many have touted the series against Sri Lanka as a chance to prepare for a tough tour to South Africa at the end of the year but India wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha said the hosts were focused on only one team.

”It’s not like the Sri Lanka series is to prepare for South Africa,“ Saha told reporters. ”It’s a standalone series.

”Every test is a challenge, and we will take it match by match, as a team and as individuals.

“Once this gets over, we will worry about South Africa and the challenge it brings.”

Nadal, at 31 the oldest player to finish a year ranked number one, fought until the last point, saving four match points in a compelling Pete Sampras Group clash, before losing 7-6(5) 6-7(4) 6-4 in two hours and 37 minutes.

World number eight Goffin, the first player from Belgium to qualify for the year-ending tournament in its 48-year history, was a bundle of nerves at times but finally steadied himself to put Nadal out of his misery with his 14th ace.

Nadal could be seen grimacing as the match wore on, especially when he was forced wide or low, but he still managed to scrap his way back from 4-1 down in the decider, despite apparently playing on one leg.

Minutes after defeat, the 16-times grand slam champion told reporters that he was pulling out of the tournament.

“My season is finished. I had a commitment with the event, with the city, with myself. I tried hard. I did the thing that I had to do to try to be ready to play,” Nadal, whose right knee flared up at the recent Paris Masters, said.

The Mallorcan, whose career has been plagued by tendonitis, made a stunning comeback from a wrist injury this year when he reached the Australian Open final, then claimed a 10th French Open title after a three-year grand slam drought.

He then went on to win the U.S. Open and reclaim the world’s top ranking for the first time since 2014.

“I really believed that I don’t deserve after this great season to spend two more days on court with this terrible feeling, that’s all,” said Nadal, who will now try to recover for the start of next season.

Goffin completed a great day for first-time qualifiers after Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov prevailed in a superb tussle with Austrian Dominic Thiem at the 02 Arena.

It was a shame that his first win against a world number one was overshadowed by Nadal’s misfortune because the nimble Belgian thoroughly deserved his win, even if he nearly blew it.

“It’s the best win of my career,” Goffin, who will lead Belgium in the David Cup final against France, said. “It was tough even if he was not moving 100 percent.”

Goffin was the better player throughout. He broke Nadal’s serve twice in the first set, only to hand back the advantage on both occasions with lame double-faults.

A crunching forehand winner at 5-5 in the tiebreak earned him a set point and Nadal then dumped a backhand into the net.

Another clean winner gave him a 5-3 lead in the second set but again he double-faulted when serving for the match.

His first match point arrived in the next game but he missed a forehand. Goffin had three more when Nadal served at 5-6, 0-40 but the Spaniard produced two magical winners to stay alive before rolling through the tiebreak.

Goffin broke twice to take control of the decider and withstood Nadal’s last stand to claim victory.

The world number six served for the match at 5-4 in the decider but was broken to love before two consecutive double faults by Thiem gave him another chance to close it out.

Again Dimitrov wobbled, squandering two match points at 40-15 with a double-fault and a tight forehand error, but he finally bagged the win when Thiem looped a backhand long.","Goffin puts Nadal out of his misery, Dimitrov wins",https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFKBN1DE0S4-OZASP

Le groupe britannique a fait état d‘une hausse de 13% de son excédent brut d‘exploitation (Ebitda) au premier semestre, à 7,4 milliards d‘euros, à comparer à un consensus de 7,08 milliards.

Selon les analystes, la performance de l‘opérateur a progressé grâce à ses investissements sur ses réseaux fixe et mobile, en profitant aussi de mesures de réduction des coûts.

“Sur nos principaux marchés européens, les clients utilisent de plus en plus le réseau mobile plutôt que le Wifi compte tenu de l‘amélioration de la qualité de nos réseaux 4G et 4G-Plus et de notre forfait journalier plus généreux en données”, a expliqué le directeur général de Vodafone, Vittorio Colao.

Vodafone vise une hausse de ses parts de marché sur le marché du haut débit, ayant constaté que de plus en plus d‘utilisateurs veulent un seul abonnement pour les services fixes et mobiles.

Le groupe a récemment annoncé un investissement de deux milliards d‘euros dans son réseau de fibre optique en Allemagne et un partenariat stratégique avec CityFibre au Royaume-Uni pour renforcer sa position sur le marché de la téléphonie fixe.

Les analystes jugent toutefois qu‘un rapprochement avec le câblo-opérateur Liberty Global, qui s‘est déjà associé à Vodafone aux Pays-Bas, serait logique.

L‘action Vodafone avance de 5,3% vers 11h30 GMT à Londres, alors que son indice sectoriel européen prend 0,87%.

Le chiffre d‘affaires du groupe a baissé de 4,1% à 23,1 millions d‘euros, en raison principalement de la déconsolidation de la filiale néerlandaise et des effets de change.

Pour la première fois depuis longtemps, Vodafone a revu en hausse son objectif de résultat annuel et table sur une croissance de 10% de son Ebitda, au lieu de 4-8% précédemment.

Vodafone a précisé que le relèvement de son objectif, qui implique un Ebitda compris entre 14,75 et 14,95 milliards d‘euros pour l‘exercice à fin mars, reflète une croissance plus forte que prévu du chiffre d‘affaires en Europe et le report de l‘arrivée d‘un nouveau concurrent en Italie.

Le groupe a ajouté que son flux de trésorerie annuel atteindrait plus de cinq milliards d‘euros, après avoir été de 1,3 milliard au premier semestre, contre 100 millions un an plus tôt lorsqu‘il était engagé dans une concurrence féroce en Inde.

War veterans broke ranks with him in 2016 and have vowed to form a broad front with the opposition to challenge his long rule.","HARARE (Reuters) - The youth wing of Zimbabwe’s ruling party accused the military chief on Tuesday of subverting the constitution for threatening to intervene after President Robert Mugabe plunged the country into political crisis by sacking his vice president last week.

Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, 75, a long-serving veteran of Zimbabwe’s 1970s liberation wars, had been viewed as a likely successor to Mugabe before the president fired him on Nov. 6.

Mnangagwa’s downfall appears to pave the way for Mugabe’s wife Grace to succeed the 93-year-old president, the only leader Zimbabwe has known in 37 years of independence.

Grace Mugabe, 52, has developed a strong following in the powerful youth wing of the ruling ZANU-PF party. Her rise has brought her into conflict with the independence-era war veterans, who once enjoyed a privileged role in the ruling party under Mugabe, but who have increasingly been banished from senior government and party roles in recent years.

In an unprecedented step, the head of the armed forces, Constantino Chiwenga, openly threatened to intervene in politics on Monday if the purge of war veterans did not stop.

“We must remind those behind the current treacherous shenanigans that, when it comes to matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in,” Chiwenga said in a statement read to reporters at a news conference packed with top brass on Monday.

“The current purging ... targeting members of the party with a liberation background must stop forthwith,” he said.

Mugabe was chairing a weekly cabinet meeting in the capital on Tuesday. Neither the president nor his wife responded immediately to the general’s remarks, but a strong denunciation from the ruling party youth wing on Tuesday signalled that Grace Mugabe’s supporters were prepared to defend her.

“We will not fold out hands to allow a creature of the constitution to subvert the very constitution which establishes it,” said Kudzai Chipanga, who leads the ZANU-PF Youth League, said at the party’s headquarters in Harare.

PREPARED TO DIE FOR MUGABE

“Defending the revolution and our leader and president is an ideal we live for and if need be it is a principle we are prepared to die for,” Chipanga said.

The rising political tension in the southern African country comes at a time when it is struggling to pay for imports due to a dollar crunch, which has also caused acute cash shortages.

Zimbabwe’s state media refrained from publishing Chiwenga’s statement. The Herald newspaper, which had initially posted some of Chiwenga’s comments on its official Twitter page on Monday, deleted the posts without explanation.

While Mugabe’s rule has been anchored by support from the military, the ageing leader does not tolerate public challenges.

As Mugabe has systematically dismissed veterans of the liberation struggle from party posts, the top echelons of ZANU-PF are now stacked with officials who did not fight in the independence war.

Mugabe could for the first time go into next year’s elections without the active support of the military. War veterans broke ranks with him in 2016 and have vowed to form a broad front with the opposition to challenge his long rule.

Mnangagwa’s unexpected downfall last week followed months of sometimes vitriolic attacks by Grace Mugabe, who used national rallies organised by ZANU-PF youths to attack her party rivals.",Zimbabwe ruling party youth wing accuses army chief of subverting constitution,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1DE1OO-OZATP

Shares of Qualcomm were up 1.8 percent at $65.74 in early afternoon trading, while those of Broadcom were down 0.4 percent at $263.95.

Broadcom said it would seek to engage with Qualcomm’s board and management, adding that it had received positive feedback from key customers and stockholders.

“We continue to believe our proposal represents the most attractive, value-enhancing alternative available to Qualcomm stockholders and we are encouraged by their reaction,” the company said.

Both companies count Apple among their top customers. Analysts have said a deal between the two would help Qualcomm settle its legal battle with the iPhone maker as Broadcom has a closer relationship with Apple.

Broadcom made an unsolicited bid last week to buy Qualcomm in an effort to become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year.

Analysts said Broadcom can now raise its bid, go for a proxy fight or launch a hostile exchange offer.

“Qualcomm’s ‘thanks, but no thanks’ response to the unsolicited bid by Broadcom isn’t surprising and we would be surprised if at this point, Broadcom didn’t move forward with a proxy fight,” Loop Capital analyst Betsy Van Hees told Reuters.

If Broadcom makes a hostile bid, Qualcomm’s governance rules would allow the rival to submit its own slate for the entire 11-member board by the Dec. 8 nomination deadline.

The easiest option, however, would be to talk to Qualcomm’s board and agree on a higher price.

“We are well-advised and know what our options are, and we have not eliminated any of those options,” Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan told Reuters last week.

The right price for Qualcomm could be between $80 and $85 per share, and Broadcom could go up to $90, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland told Reuters.

Any deal would face scrutiny from the antitrust regulators as the combined company would own the high-end WiFi business globally, analysts said.

Regulators are already scrutinizing Qualcomm’s $38-billion acquisition of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV.

Broadcom has indicated it is willing to buy Qualcomm irrespective of whether it closes the NXP deal.

Writing on Twitter, Hariri urged Lebanese to remain calm and said his family would stay in Saudi Arabia, calling it “their country”.

Hariri’s resignation while in Saudi Arabia pitched Lebanon into political crisis.

Top Lebanese government officials and senior politicians close to Hariri believe Saudi Arabia coerced him into quitting and has been holding him against his will ever since, though Hariri and Riyadh have denied this.

Hariri cited fear of assassination and accused Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world during his resignation speech.

Hariri gave his first public remarks on Sunday, saying in a televised interview in Riyadh he planned to return to Lebanon within days to affirm his resignation.

Some are one-offs, and others won’t be. The company expects up to $75 million in additional expenses this quarter.

That may only be the tip of the iceberg.

It now faces 240 class-action lawsuits in North America, and investigations by a who’s who of watchdogs, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, and the attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states. Equifax says it cannot yet estimate damages and fines, but there are likely to be some of both.

Although group-wide revenue was up in the third quarter, sales in its biggest division, which handles U.S. consumer-credit reports, fell 3 percent. That was a sharp turnaround from a 7 percent growth pace in the first half considering that the breach was made public only on Sept. 7. To give that result, the unit’s revenue in the last three weeks of the quarter would have had to slump by about a third from what was expected, according to Breakingviews calculations. Executives expect group revenue to decline by 3 to 4 percent in the fourth quarter as customers defer more orders.

Investors have lopped off about a quarter of Equifax’s market capitalization since the breach. That’s consistent with a sustained drop in profit on the scale of the third quarter, but it doesn’t allow for an extended slide in revenue or big legal outlays. They may be too sanguine.",Breakingviews - Equifax hack damage is only the start,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-equifax-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-equifax-hack-damage-is-only-the-start-idUSKBN1DA2N0

Monday was the first time since 2007 a North Korean soldier had defected across the JSA.","SEOUL (Reuters) - A North Korean soldier is expected to survive critical wounds he received when his old comrades fired a hail of bullets at him as he made a defection dash to South Korea, the South’s government and military said on Tuesday.

The soldier had on Monday sped toward the border in a “peace village” in the heavily guarded demilitarized zone, in a four-wheel drive vehicle.

But when a wheel came loose, he fled on foot as four North Korean soldiers fired about 40 rounds at him, said Suh Wook, chief director of operations at South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, briefing lawmakers.

“Until this morning, we heard he had no consciousness and was unable to breathe on his own but his life can be saved,” Suh said.

Surgeons had removed five bullets from the soldier’s body, leaving two inside, Suh added, to murmurs from lawmakers who said the soldier’s escape was “right out of a movie”.

The soldier took cover behind a South Korean structure in a Joint Security Area (JSA) inside the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.

South Korean and U.S. soldiers, fearing more North Korean fire, later crawled to him to rescue him, the United Nations Command said in a separate statement.

North Korea has not said anything about the soldier. Its military had not given any indication of unusual movements on Tuesday, the South’s military said.

While on average more than 1,000 North Koreans defect to the South every year, most travel via China and it is unusual for a North Korean to cross the land border dividing the two Koreas, which have been in a technical state of war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

The U.N. Command, in place since the end of the war, said an investigation into the incident was being conducted.

South Korean Defence Minister Song Young-moo said it was the first time North Korean soldiers had fired toward the South’s side of the JSA, prompting complaints from some lawmakers that the South’s military should have returned fire.

Moon Sang-gyun, the South’s defense ministry spokesman, said military operations at the JSA were usually conducted under the orders of the U.N. Command, which is in turn under orders from the U.S. military.

INTESTINAL DAMAGE

The soldier, who was not armed, was flown in a U.N. Command helicopter to an operating theater where doctors began working to save him even before he was out of a uniform that indicated he held a lower rank, Suh said.

South Korean officials have yet to identify where the soldier came from or what his intentions were.

Lee Cook-jong, the surgeon in charge of the soldier’s care at the Ajou University Hospital, told reporters he was suffering from critical intestinal damage.

Hospital officials where under strict security agency orders not to talk to media and all updates on the soldier had to be through the military, workers there told Reuters.

Dr Lee had been “given a talking-to” after a brief exchange with the media, the hospital workers said.

The U.N. military armistice commission said it had informed the North Korean military that the soldier, who was found about 50 meters (150 feet) south of a Military Demarcation Line, was undergoing surgery for his wounds.

Suh said the South had also informed the North on Monday of the soldier and his treatment, via loudspeakers on the border.

North Korea has in the past complained that North Korean defectors had been abducted by South Korea, and it has demanded their release.

This month, the North demanded that South Korea return 12 waitresses it said had been kidnapped while working in China in 2016. South Korea said the 12 women, and one man, had chosen to defect to the South.

Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee say they will grill Sessions about statements he made to the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which he denied knowing about meetings between campaign aides and Russians.

Sessions’ statements, made at his confirmation hearing in January and at a Senate Judiciary hearing in October, appear to have been contradicted when charges against former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos were unsealed in a probe into allegations of links between Russia and the Trump campaign.

“We intend to ask you about these inconsistencies,” the committee’s Democratic members said in a Nov. 7 letter to Sessions. “We are providing you notice in advance because we expect you to respond,” the Democrats said.

Sessions, a former U.S. Senator who was involved in Trump’s campaign, has denied misleading Congress, saying his prior statements under oath were all true.

U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. election to help then-Republican candidate Trump’s campaign.

The Kremlin has denied interfering in the election and Trump denies any collusion between his campaign and Russian officials.

FORMER AIDE

Sessions is likely to be pressed about Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser.

In court records, prosecutors say Papadopoulos told a March 2016 meeting of campaign officials that he had Russian connections and could help arrange a meeting with Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

A photograph posted on Trump’s Instagram account shows that Papadopoulos, Sessions and Trump were all seated at the same table in that meeting.

According to a source familiar with the matter, Sessions shut down Papadopoulos’ idea of engaging with Russia, and the Trump administration has played down Papadopoulos’ role in the campaign, saying he was nothing more than a low level volunteer.

But the court documents, and Papadopoulos’ guilty plea for lying to the FBI over his contacts with Russian officials, put new focus on Sessions’ earlier testimony.

Sessions said during January’s confirmation hearing that he was unaware of communications between the campaign and Russia.

After the hearing, news reports emerged showing that Sessions had himself met Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak at least twice in 2016.

Under pressure, Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation.

In another Senate hearing last month, Sessions testified he had no improper involvement with Russians and was not aware of anyone else from the campaign who did.

“Attorney General Sessions has misrepresented the truth ... time and time again,” Al Franken, a Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee member, said on the Senate floor on Monday.

Sessions is also likely to face tough questions over his decision to ask federal prosecutors to look into whether a special counsel should be appointed to probe any wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation over the sale of a uranium company to Russia.

Sessions asked for prosecutors to look at the matter in response to a letter from Representative Robert Goodlatte, the House Judiciary Committee chairman.

The world’s largest automaker plans to spend more than 20 billion euros ($23.5 billion) on electric mobility by 2030, including costs to develop battery models and upgrade factories.

Until it admitted in 2015 to cheating on U.S. diesel emissions tests, Volkswagen (VW) had been slow to embrace zero-emission cars. Under its “roadmap E”, VW now aims to offer an electric version of each of its 300 group models by 2030.

With its nearly 9,000 workers, VW’s plant in Zwickau makes the Golf and Passat models. The combustion-engine vehicles could be shifted to the under-utilized factories at Wolfsburg and Emden to make room for electric-car production at the site in Saxony, three sources close to VW said on Tuesday.

“Things are moving in this direction,” one of them said.

A spokesman for VW’s operations in Saxony, which also include an engine plant in Chemnitz and a site in Dresden, said Zwickau has been earmarked to build an electric model but declined to elaborate.

A spokesman at VW’s Wolfsburg headquarters declined to comment.

VW’s supervisory board will meet on Friday to sign off on management’s capital and development spending targets for the next five years.

At the previous budget round a year ago, VW pledged to cut group spending on factories, equipment and technology to 6 percent of automotive sales by 2020 from 6.9 percent in 2015.

More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since late August, driven out by a counter-insurgency clearance operation in Rakhine State. A top U.N. official has called the Myanmar military’s operation a textbook case of “ethnic cleansing”.

Attending an East Asia summit in Manila on Tuesday, Tillerson met Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose less than two-year-old civilian administration shares power with the military and has no control over its generals.

He will meet Suu Kyi again in the Myanmar capital of Naypyitaw on Wednesday, and hold separate talks with the head of the armed forces, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.

Asked what approach Tillerson would take with Myanmar’s army chief, the State Department official told journalists in a briefing by teleconference, that the focus would be on restoring peace in Rakhine.

“We are focusing on trying to stabilize areas in northern Rakhine so that people can return there, stopping the violence, making sure that military would protect all populations in that area equally and that they conduct a credible investigation that leads to accountability,” said the official, who was with Tillerson in Manila, but declined to be identified.

The official said the consequences for the country, also known as Burma, if it failed to respond to the crisis with accountability could be part of the conversation with the military leader.

”Burma made a lot of progress and we would not want to see that progress reversed,” the official added.

U.S. senators in Washington are pressing for economic sanctions and travel restrictions targeting the military and its business interests.

“The secretary will reiterate support for Burma’s democratic transition and urge the Burmese government to protect local population and allow unhindered humanitarian and media access, (and) support for a credible investigation of abuses,” the official said.

Accusations of organised mass rape and other crimes against humanity were levelled at the Myanmar military on Sunday by another senior U.N. official, who had toured camps in Bangladesh where Rohingya refugees have taken shelter.

‘WHITEWASH’

Pramila Patten, the U.N. special representative of the secretary-general on sexual violence in conflict, said she would raise accusations against the Myanmar military with the International Criminal Court in the Hague.

The military, known as the Tatmadaw, has consistently protested its innocence, and on Monday it posted the findings of an internal investigation on the Facebook page of Min Aung Hlaing.

It said it had found no instances where its soldiers had shot and killed Rohingya villagers, raped women or tortured prisoners. It denied that security forces had torched Rohingya villages or used “excessive force”.

The military said that, while 376 “terrorists” were killed, there were no deaths of innocent people.

Human rights groups have poured scorn on the military’s investigation, branding it a “whitewash” and calling for U.N. and independent investigators to be allowed into the country.

Suu Kyi’s failure to speak out strongly over the plight of the Rohingya has widely damaged the Nobel peace prize winner’s reputation as a stateswoman.

Many diplomats, however, believe Myanmar’s fragile transition to democracy after 49 years of military rule would be jeopardised if she publicly criticised the armed forces.

“Both parts of the government will have to work together in order to solve this problem … Trying to get two of them to work together, to try to solve the problem, is certainly going to be very important,” the U.S. official said.

The official said Suu Kyi had been very open in her talks with Tillerson and other leaders during the regional summits in the past few days about the steps that needed to be taken to resolve the crisis.

“She has been very forthcoming about wanting to solve the problem, what kind of actions need to be taken to improve the situation,” the official said

U.S. District Judge William Walls sent the jurors home for the day and told them to resume their deliberations on Tuesday, Steven Sandberg, a representative for Menendez, said in an email.

A representative for the court clerk’s office and the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Menendez is on trial on charges that he accepted private flights, campaign contributions and other bribes from a wealthy patron, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, in exchange for official favors between 2006 and 2013.

Lawyers for Menendez and Melgen have told the jury in Newark, New Jersey, that they did nothing wrong and that their actions stemmed from a close, brother-like relationship.

If Menendez is convicted, Republicans will be presented with a chance to gain a seat in the closely divided U.S. Senate, as his replacement would be named by Republican Governor Chris Christie. Christie will remain in office until Jan. 16, when Democratic governor-elect Phil Murphy will take his place.

The jury, beginning its first day of deliberations with a new member after another panelist was allowed to leave for a previously scheduled vacation, sent the judge a note on Monday afternoon saying they were deadlocked and could not reach a verdict on any of the counts, the Newark Star-Ledger newspaper reported.

“Is there any additional guidance and what do we do now?” the jury asked the judge in their note, according to the newspaper.

The judge then heard from attorneys from both the prosecution, who argued that the jury had only begun their deliberations again three hours earlier that day, and Menendez’s attorney, who argued for the judge to declare a mistrial, the Star-Ledger said.

Walls concluded that it would be appropriate for the jury to continue their deliberations.

If found guilty of all charges, Menendez could face a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.",Jurors in U.S. Senator's bribery trial told to keep talking,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-jersey-menendez/jurors-in-u-s-senators-bribery-trial-told-to-keep-talking-idUSKBN1DD2MA

The Washington Post and New York Times cited a letter from the Justice Department to the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, Robert Goodlatte, responding to his request for the appointment of a special counsel to look into various matters.

The letter quoted Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd as saying that Sessions had ""directed senior federal prosecutors to evaluate certain issues raised in your letters,"" according to the Post, which first reported the story (wapo.st/2zEwN7a)

Those prosecutors would then make recommendations “as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources, or whether any matters merit the appointment of a Special Counsel,” the letter said.

Last month, Republican leaders of two House committees launched an investigation into an Obama-era deal in which a Russian company bought a Canadian firm that owned some 20 percent of U.S. uranium supplies.

Britain’s economy is expanding at half the rate of Germany, inflation is running at its highest since 2012, wages are being squeezed and the economic slowdown is expected to get worse as the country’s departure from the EU in March 2019 nears.

In what is likely to be his last full budget plan before the terms of Brexit are hammered out, Hammond is also expected to have less money to spend in the coming years than he thought only a few months ago.

Britain’s budget forecasters are poised to cut their economic growth outlook due to persistently weak productivity, eating into the cash that Hammond had hoped to keep in reserve for any Brexit turbulence ahead.

At the same time, May needs something eye-catching to shore up her leadership of a deeply divided Conservative Party when Hammond delivers his budget in parliament on Nov. 22.

May has made little headway in Britain’s high-stakes Brexit talks, and the resignation of two ministers this month has added to the sense of crisis in Westminster since she lost a parliamentary majority in a June election.

Hammond is also on thin ice. He was reportedly on the verge of being sacked by May before she was weakened by the election and he is in the sights of pro-Brexit Conservatives who say he is undermining Britain’s hand in negotiations with Brussels by not spending now for a possible “no-deal” Brexit.

The popular Sun newspaper accused him of “suffocating caution” in an editorial on Tuesday. “This is a time for courage and imagination, not miserly bean-counting,” it said.

But Hammond has almost no scope for big tax cuts or a big increase in investment, unless he tears up his budget rules under which he is aiming to turn the deficit into a surplus by the mid-2020s.

Ratings agency Moody’s cut Britain’s credit rating in September, saying plans to reduce its heavy debt load had been knocked off course by Hammond’s slower approach to fixing the deficit than that of his predecessor George Osborne. It also said Brexit was likely to weigh on the economy.

“If I were the chancellor, I would be announcing lots of strategies and reviews and probably trying to do as little as possible, given the limited room for manoeuvre,” Conservative lawmaker Nicky Morgan said.

“The politics of the budget are going to be as important or more important than what is said economically,” said Morgan, who heads a committee that scrutinises the work of the Treasury.

Many voters are tired of seven years of spending restraints imposed by former chancellor George Osborne following the financial crisis, and then by Hammond when he replaced him after the Brexit vote in June last year.

Households have suffered the worst income squeeze since the early 19th century, by some estimates, fuelling support for the left-wing opposition Labour Party and its big spending plans.

BOXED IN

But Hammond has flatly rejected proposals from a fellow minister to fund a major house-building drive to respond to the frustrations of many younger voters who feel priced out of the property boom that helped their parents.

Instead, he is reported to be considering a more modest plan to reduce a tax on home purchases for first-time buyers.

Similarly, Hammond is unlikely to inflict much pain on wealthier voters who are the main beneficiaries of a steadily rising threshold for paying income tax and who enjoy generous help from the tax man for their private pensions.

Protests from Conservative MPs forced Hammond into a U-turn in March when he dropped a plan to increase national insurance contributions for self-employed workers.

In a nod to the concerns of many businesses, Hammond is likely to reduce the pace of increases in a tax businesses pay on the property they use, newspapers have said.

But many economists say Hammond could make things easier for himself if he adopts Labour’s call to exclude borrowing for infrastructure investment from his budget deficit targets.

More investment in transport and digital networks, for example, could help improve Britain’s productivity problem and eventually bring the government more tax revenues.

“There is no reason at all why we need to stick with the fiscal rules as they are,” Matt Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation think-tank, said.

“Borrowing costs are so low at the moment that most if not all economists think we should be borrowing more to invest. The fact that we are not is really a missed trick.”

But investors say Hammond cannot afford to be complacent, given Britain’s large current account deficit which requires funding by foreign investors.

If Britain falls into another deep recession, or leaves the EU without a trade deal, investors might take fright, Robert Wood, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said.

“As long as the music is playing, the UK can keep dancing. The question is what happens if the music stops?” Wood said.",Hammond has limited options to help May with budget,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-budget/hammond-has-limited-options-to-help-may-with-budget-idUKKBN1DE1U1

Am 4. November teilte das Hotel Ritz Carlton in Riad seinen Gästen mit, dass der normale Hotelbetrieb wegen einer unvorhergesehenen Buchung der Behörden vorübergehend eingestellt werden müsse.

Zu diesem Zeitpunkt war die politische Säuberungsaktion schon in vollem Gange. Innerhalb weniger Stunden ergriffen die Sicherheitskräfte mehr als 200 Angehörige der Elite aus Politik und Wirtschaft, darunter elf Prinzen, Minister und schwerreiche Geschäftsleute. Sie alle fanden sich im Ritz Carlton wieder, das vorübergehend als Nobel-Gefängnis fungierte. Insider sprachen von einer gut vorbereiteten Aktion.

Befohlen wurde sie vom 32-jährigen Kronprinzen Saudi-Arabiens, Mohammed bin Salman. Offiziell ist er der Thronfolger seines Vaters, König Salman, faktisch regiert er bereits jetzt das Land, das er in einen modernen Staat umwandeln will. Um dies zu erreichen - und um die eigene Macht zu festigen - nahm er sich die saudische Elite vor und schonte auch die royale Verwandtschaft nicht. Sein Einsatz ist hoch. Ob er das Land unangefochten führen kann, hängt vom Erfolg seiner Säuberungsaktion ab. Auf dem Spiel steht die politische Stabilität des weltgrößten Ölproduzenten. Eine Alternative sieht der Kronprinz aber nicht, denn ohne grundlegende Veränderungen drohen Saudi-Arabien eine schwere Wirtschaftskrise und soziale Unruhen. Die Herrschaft der Königsfamilie wäre in Gefahr, und das Land würde gegenüber dem Hauptrivalen Iran verlieren.

KRONPRINZ MACHT AUCH VOR GROSSEN NAMEN NICHT HALT

Aus dem Umfeld des Kronprinzen verlautete, er habe sich zu dem Vorgehen gegen die königliche Familie entschieden, als er erkannt habe, dass mehr Mitglieder gegen seine Thronfolge seien, als er erwartet habe. “Die ganze Anti-Korruptionskampagne richtete sich gegen die Familie”, sagt ein Insider: “Der Rest ist nur Show.” In der offiziellen Darstellung wird eine politische Motivation dementiert.

Der Kronprinz machte dabei auch vor ganz großen Namen nicht halt. Unter des Verhafteten ist Prinz Miteb bin Abdullah, ein Cousin von Prinz Mohammed und Kommandeur der mächtigen Nationalgarde. Weitere sind Prinz Alwalid bin Talal, der Chef der internationalen Investmentfirma Kingdom Holding, sowie Prinz Turki bin Abdullah, der frühere Gouverneur der Provinz Riad und Sohn des verstorbenen Königs Abdullah.

MOHAMMEDS SCHNELLER WEG ZU MACHT

Prinz Mohammed hatte seine Kampagne in Interviews offen angekündigt. Sein Instrument wurde das von König Salman geschaffene und am 4. November verkündete Komitee zur Bekämpfung der Korruption, an dessen Spitze Mohammed selbst steht. Er verband damit eine im Volk populäre Aktion mit der Sicherung seines Anspruchs auf den Thron.

Als König Salman 2015 den Thron bestieg, wurde Prinz Mohammed Verteidigungsminister und im Juni dieses Jahres offiziell Thronfolger. Er übersprang damit seinen älteren Cousin Mohammed bin Nayef. Die königliche Familie nahm dies hin. Einige Gegner Mohammeds landeten im Gefängnis.

Die jüngsten Verhaftungen sollen dem Kronprinzen helfen, die von ihm geplanten Reformen umzusetzen, die dem Land die größten Veränderungen seit seiner Gründung in den 1930er Jahren bringen könnten. Seit damals basierte der Staat auf einem Übereinkommen zwischen der königlichen Familie und den wahhabitischen Religionsführern, die die erzkonservative Version des Islam in Saudi-Arabien verankerten. Das Königshaus versprach seinen Untertanen ein komfortables Leben und einen Anteil am Ölreichtum. Im Gegenzug dafür ordneten sie sich unter und akzeptierten die strengen Religions- und Gesellschaftsregeln. Entscheidungen des Königs wurden im Konsens mit einer Gruppe von Prinzen getroffen, die seine Führung nicht infrage stellten.

DIE REVOLUTION VON OBEN

Prinz Mohammed hat nun begonnen, diese Säulen des Herrschaftssystems einzureißen, die aufgrund des Bevölkerungswachstums und des sinkenden Ölpreises brüchig geworden sind. Den Konsens ersetzte er durch eine Alleinherrschaft, wie Kritiker sagen. Anders als frühere Herrscher hat Prinz Mohammed keine Familienmitglieder als Berater an seiner Seite. Zwar hat König Salman noch das letzte Wort, doch alle Machtpositionen sind bereits in der Hand Mohammeds. Seine Inthronisation wird für die nahe Zukunft erwartet. Nicht zuletzt ist das Alter des Prinzen bemerkenswert. Die letzten drei Könige waren 61, 80 und 79, als sie den Thron bestiegen. Prinz Mohammed ist 32 Jahre alt.

Seinem Volk bietet er einen neuen sozialen Kontrakt an: Ein Staat, der besser funktioniert, als die rigide Bürokratie der Vergangenheit, die Möglichkeit, Spaß zu haben, und eine Wirtschaft, die Jobs unabhängig vom Öl schafft. Im September strich er das Autofahrverbot für Frauen, und vor drei Wochen stellte er sein 500-Milliarden-Dollar-Projekt einer Zukunftsstadt am Roten Meer vor. Er will die Abhängigkeit des Landes vom Erdöl und die seiner Bewohner von Staatssubventionen verringern. Dem geplanten Börsengang des staatlichen Ölkonzerns Saudi Aramco kommt dabei eine zentrale Rolle zu.

EIN ERFOLG MOHAMMEDS IST ALLES ANDERE ALS SICHER

Der Erfolg seines Kurses ist gleichwohl nicht garantiert. Seine Herangehensweise, keinerlei Opposition zu dulden, könnte Investoren abschrecken, die Wert auf Rechtsstaatlichkeit legen. Und ohne die Unterstützung von Investoren dürfte es ihm schwerfallen, die hohen Erwartungen der saudiarabischen Jugend zu erfüllen. Auch der Krieg in Jemen, der Streit mit dem Emirat Katar und die zunehmenden Spannungen in den Beziehungen zu Iran beunruhigen Investoren.

Diese Klippen will der Kronprinz in enger Partnerschaft mit den USA umschiffen. Bei einem Besuch in Saudi-Arabien forderte US-Präsident Donald Trump im Mai, Saudi-Arabien solle eine Allianz gegen den Iran anführen und gegen dessen Versuche vorgehen, eine schiitische Achse Irak-Syrien-Libanon zu schmieden. Kurz darauf rief Saudi-Arabien eine Blockade Katars aus, dem es vorwarf, Iran und den Terrorismus zu unterstützen.

Tuesday’s report from the Labor Department also showed steady gains in underlying producer prices, which support expectations of a gradual increase in inflation and keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates in December.

The producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month after a similar gain in September. In the 12 months through October, the PPI jumped 2.8 percent, the largest increase since February 2012.

The PPI rose 2.6 percent year-on-year in September. Economists had forecast the PPI edging up 0.1 percent last month and increasing 2.4 percent from a year ago.

Prices for services advanced 0.5 percent last month after increasing 0.4 percent in September. A 24.9 percent surge in margins for fuels and lubricants retailing accounted for almost half of the increase in the cost of services last month.

That helped to offset a 4.6 percent drop in the cost of gasoline. Wholesale gasoline prices soared 10.9 percent in September in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas in late August and reduced refining capacity in the Gulf Coast area.

Gasoline prices are falling amid ample crude oil supplies. Last month’s rise in prices received by the nation’s farms, factories and refineries was also driven by rising costs for goods such as pharmaceutical preparations, fresh and dry vegetables, meat and tobacco.

The dollar pared losses against a basket of currencies after the data, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.

A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent last month. It has increased by the same margin for three straight months. The so-called core PPI increased 2.3 percent in the 12 months through October after advancing 2.1 percent in September.

A weakening dollar could gradually lift core PPI. The dollar has this year lost 5.4 percent of its value against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners.

Inflation has remained stubbornly low, despite the labor market nearing full employment. The main inflation measure tracked by the Fed has remained below the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target since mid-2012.

Despite moderate price pressures, the Fed is expected to raise interest rates next month. There is cautious optimism that tightening labor market conditions will spur faster wage growth next year.

The Fed has increased borrowing costs twice this year. October’s consumer inflation data scheduled for release on Wednesday could shed more light on the future course of monetary policy.

Last month, food prices rose 0.5 percent after being unchanged in September. Core goods increased 0.3 percent after a similar gain in the prior month. Prices for passenger cars were unchanged last month. The government introduced new motor vehicle pricing models into the survey in October.

The cost of healthcare services gained 0.3 percent after being unchanged in September.

A fifth round of negotiations to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement begins this week in Mexico City, weighed down by several contentious U.S. proposals that even some U.S. business leaders have labeled “poison pills” to the process.

From demands that the deal establish minimum U.S. limits in NAFTA auto content to scrapping a key dispute mechanism and adding an automatic expiry clause, the U.S. measures soured the mood in the previous round of talks in Virginia last month.

They have stirred fears that U.S. President Donald Trump could follow through on threats to dump NAFTA, creating a potential conflict with free trade proponents in the Republican Party whose support he wants for his planned tax cuts.

And with scant evidence that either side is prepared to give ground on the thorniest issues, narrowing differences on them this time is unlikely, Mexican and Canadian officials said.

“There’s been no movement on the tough stuff,” said Bosco de la Vega, head of Mexico’s National Agricultural Council (CNA), the main farming lobby, which is resisting another U.S. proposal that could restrict trade in seasonal foodstuffs.

However, there is still hope for progress on less divisive matters, officials said, pointing to signs of growing consensus on topics including telecommunications, e-commerce and small businesses, as well as some technical regulations.

Throughout, negotiators will be mindful of the debate in the U.S. Congress over the planned tax cuts, which have come under scrutiny for their potential impact on the federal deficit.

“All the political oxygen here has been absorbed by tax reform,” said Representative Frank Lucas of Oklahoma, a senior Republican on the House Agriculture Committee who is eager to keep NAFTA alive. “Everything is tax, 100 percent of the time.”

NAFTA working groups are due to begin meeting from Wednesday in Mexico to discuss issues ranging from textiles and services to labor and intellectual property. On Friday, talks will formally get underway through Nov. 21.

Should the U.S. side raise the so-called “poison pills,” Mexico and Canada do not intend to discuss them or propose compromises to dilute them, two officials from the countries said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the negotiations.

“We reject anything to do with national (auto) content,” said one Mexican official involved in the NAFTA discussions, calling the U.S. attitude to the process “short-sighted.”

U.S. business groups have spoken out against the national content proposal but many officials close to the talks believe that Trump is paying little heed to their concerns. That has fueled fears that whatever concessions Mexico and Canada might eventually make, it would “never be enough,” said one in Mexico.

Still, if Trump advances on the tax plan, it is more likely to help NAFTA talks than harm them, said the CNA’s de la Vega.

“What we know from our U.S. counterparts is that they’re saying, listen: we see that the future of (NAFTA talks) will depend on the success or failure of the tax reform. It will have a direct impact on NAFTA. How much? Who knows?” he said.

“Disaster”, “nightmare”, “humiliation”, were just a few of the words splashed across the front pages of Italy’s newspapers to describe the shock of the team’s elimination at the hands of a little-fancied Sweden on Monday.

“Apocalypse Azzurra,” said the headline of La Stampa newspaper, referring to the unofficial name of the team whose bright blue jerseys reflect the azure of the Mediterranean Sea.

Italy have played in the last 14 World Cup finals, winning two of them. In all, they have triumphed four times, a tally only exceeded by Brazil, who have won five times. Italy are the only former champions not to make it to next year’s finals.

“This is disgusting, the World Cup can’t exist without Italy. It just can’t exist,” said Francesco Macella, a fan who was in Milan’s San Siro stadium to watch as Italy failed to overcome Sweden in a tense 0-0 draw in the second leg of their European playoff, having lost the first leg 1-0 in Stockholm.

Every four years, Italy has come together over the World Cup, putting aside its historic city-state rivalries to become a united nation for a brief moment in time, cheering on all the players regardless if they came from Milan, Rome or Naples.

“We have failed and at a social level this could have been so important,” said Italy’s storied goalkeeper, Gigi Buffon, in a tearful interview minutes after the final whistle on Monday, recognising the broader significance of the national team.

POLITICAL FALLOUT

While newspapers laid the blame squarely on team coach Gian Piero Ventura and football federation chief Carlo Tavecchio, some fans thought the failure reflected wider problems.

“This match mirrors our country which is falling apart,” said a disappointed Stefano Martufello as he left the San Siro.

Italy is slowly recovering from a prolonged recession, but most people say they see no sign of the pick-up, with wages stagnant and unemployment stuck above 11 percent. On the political front, opinion polls predict that parliamentary elections due by next May will result in a deadlock.

Governments normally hope that the feel-good factor from sporting triumphs feeds over into the political sphere.

Slideshow (4 Images)

In the wake of Monday’s downfall, the normally busy Twitter feeds of ruling politicians were quiet, while some opposition leaders sought to score quick points.

“There are too many foreigners on (our) pitches, from youth teams to Serie A and this is the result,” said Matteo Salvini, head of the anti-immigrant Northern League, echoing criticism in far-right quarters over the space given in sport to outsiders.

“STOPTHEINVASION. Give more room to Italian lads,” he wrote, drawing hundreds of largely negative comments on his Twitter feed.

Italy last won the World Cup in 2006, but exited at the group stage in 2010 and 2014 after lacklustre displays. This latest setback showed how far the team have drifted from their peak, belying the widespread expectation that they would have eased past Sweden.

“For years I’ve had this feeling that Italian football is a little like Italy itself, which lives a lot in the past when the reality is that it finds itself dealing with things that are quite intense, even shocking,” said Matteo Maragnano, peeling oranges in a cafe near Milan’s gothic cathedral.

Grasping for silver linings, newspaper commentators recognised that the Italian team was weak and would not have got very far in Russia.

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Chief Executive Vittorio Colao lifted guidance for the first time in Vodafone’s recent history after reporting a 13 percent rise in first-half adjusted core earnings to 7.4 billion euros ($8.7 billion), comfortably ahead of market forecasts.

Analysts said Vodafone was benefiting from a combination of investment in its mobile and fixed line networks and cost cutting.

“In our major European markets, customers are increasingly using mobile networks rather than wifi given the improving quality of our 4G and 4G-plus networks and our more generous data allowances,” Colao said.

The usage of wifi versus cellular had declined for the first time - by around 4 percentage points - he said, driven by network improvements and bigger data allowances.

“The anxiety or worry of finishing data is gradually going away,” he added, referring to customers’ concerns about using up data allowances in their monthly plans.

Vodafone is targeting an increased share of the broadband market, as it sees more customers take converged fixed-line and mobile products from a single providers.

It has recently announced a 2 billion euro investment in fiber connections in Germany and a strategic partnership with CityFibre in Britain to improve its fixed-line position.

Analysts, however, speculate that a broader tie up with cable firm Liberty Global (LBTYA.O), which has already combined with Vodafone in the Netherlands, would make sense.

Shares in Vodafone were trading up 5 percent at 1005 GMT, having earlier hit a three month high of 227.50 pence.

UBS analysts, who rate the stock a “buy”, said earnings were benefiting from solid top-line trends and cost savings.

“Almost every geography was notably ahead versus consensus for second-quarter organic service revenue growth, particularly Germany ... and Spain,” they said.

Organic service revenue - which strips out the impact of acquisitions, disposals and currency moves - rose 1.7 percent in the six months to end-September, although the deconsolidation of Vodafone Netherlands and foreign exchange movements resulted in a 4.1 percent dip in total revenue to 23.1 billion euros.

Vodafone said its increased forecast, which implies core earnings of 14.75-14.95 billion euros, reflected stronger-than-expected underlying revenue growth in Europe and a later-than-anticipated launch of a new entrant in Italy.

It said free cash flow would come in above 5 billion euros, rather than its previous view of around 5 billion euros.

Free cash flow was 1.3 billion euros in the half against a 100 million euro outflow a year ago when the company was battling fierce competition in India.

Vodafone agreed in January to combining its Indian unit with Idea Cellular (IDEA.NS) to create a market leader to take on new entrant Reliance Jio Infocomm.

Vodafone said on Monday it would sell its mobile phone masts in India, owned separately from its Indus Towers joint venture, to American Tower Corp (AMT.N).

Colao said he was continuing to explore options for its 42 percent stake in Indus Towers.

REUTERS/Beawiharta (INDONESIA - Tags: BUSINESS) - GM1E95M1A6L01

Five years ago, Singaporean state investor Temasek tried to sell its controlling stake in Danamon to financial compatriot DBS. That sparked a backlash. Jakarta then stuck caps on bank ownership, killing the takeover in 2013, and sending an ugly message about its openness to foreign capital.

Now, however, Reuters says MUFG is talking to Temasek about buying a 40 percent stake in Indonesia’s fifth-largest lender for roughly 200 billion yen, or $1.8 billion.

MUFG needs to diversify away from its mature home market. Southeast Asia offers both proximity and growth potential, and an Indonesian outpost would complement existing interests in the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.

Danamon is also on the up; analysts reckon earnings will leap 48 percent this year and return on equity will hit a solid 10.6 percent. The Indonesian bank trades at just 1.4 times trailing book value, Eikon shows. That suggests a reasonable price, even if 68 percent owner Temasek demands a big premium for ceding control. DBS had been ready to pay 2.6 times, and in 2015 Taiwan’s Cathay Financial paid 3.2 times for a stake in the smaller Bank Mayapada Internasional.

The bigger question is around control. If MUFG has to abide by Indonesia’s 40 percent ownership ceiling, this would make any deal less attractive, because it would limit the buyer’s influence and because bank-capital rules penalise minority holdings. That’s partly why another lender that once harboured regional ambitions, Australia’s ANZ, has been selling off such stakes and retrenching.

That said, Jakarta can and does waive the cap - it did so for China Construction Bank last year. And a Japanese buyer is probably less controversial than one from neighbouring financial centre Singapore. Sometimes a little distance is an advantage.",Breakingviews - MUFG banks on an easy ride in Indonesia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-danamon-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-mufg-banks-on-an-easy-ride-in-indonesia-idUSKBN1DD07K

“I believe that it continues to develop its weapons,” Abe told a news conference in Manila after a series of meetings with other Asian leaders at a gathering of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and East Asia Forum.

“There is no point for talks for the sake of talks,” he said.

Abe’s insistence that tough sanctions, including restrictions on oil sales, are necessary to soften up the North Korean regime over the coming winter could put him at loggerheads with other countries such as South Korea that might agree to open talks if approached by the North.

After firing missiles at a pace of about two or three a month since April, North Korean missile launches paused in September, after it fired a rocket that passed over Japan’s northern Hokkaido island.

Abe said he would work closely with other countries in the region including China and Russia to persuade North Korea to halt missile development and give up its nuclear weapon ambitions.

Abe, in a meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping at an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam on Saturday, hailed a “fresh start” to the relationship between Asia’s two biggest economies and military powers, including cooperation on North Korea.

Abe on Tuesday said that he wanted to deepen cultural and economic ties with China.

More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since late August, driven out by a counter-insurgency clearance operation of Myanmar forces in Rakhine. A top U.N. official has called the operation a textbook case of “ethnic cleansing”.

Attending an East Asia summit in Manila on Tuesday, Tillerson met Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose less than two-year-old civilian administration shares power with the military and has no control over its generals.

He will meet Suu Kyi again in the Myanmar capital of Naypyitaw on Wednesday, and hold separate talks with the head of the armed forces, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.

Asked what approach Tillerson would take with Myanmar’s army chief, the State Department official told journalists in a briefing by teleconference that the emphasis would be on restoring peace in Rakhine.

“We are focusing on trying to stabilize areas in northern Rakhine so that people can return there, stopping the violence, making sure that the military would protect all populations in that area equally and that they conduct a credible investigation that leads to accountability for people who have perpetrated abuses,” said the official, who was with Tillerson in Manila and declined to be identified.

The official said the consequences for the country, also known as Burma, if it failed to respond to the crisis with accountability could be part of the conversation with the military leader.

“Burma made a lot of progress and we would not want to see that progress reversed,” the official added.

U.S. senators in Washington are pressing for economic sanctions and travel restrictions targeting the Myanmar military and its business interests.

“The secretary will reiterate support for Burma’s democratic transition and urge the Burmese government to protect the local population and allow unhindered humanitarian and media access, (and) support for a credible investigation of abuses,” the official added.

Accusations of organized mass rape and other crimes against humanity were leveled at the Myanmar military on Sunday by another senior U.N. official who had toured camps in Bangladesh where Rohingya refugees have taken shelter.

‘WHITEWASH’

Pramila Patten, special representative of the U.N. secretary-general on sexual violence in conflict, said she would raise accusations against the Myanmar military with the International Criminal Court in the Hague.

The military, known as the Tatmadaw, has consistently protested its innocence, and on Monday it posted the findings of an internal investigation on the Facebook page of Min Aung Hlaing.

It said it had found no instances where its soldiers had shot and killed Rohingya villagers, raped women or tortured prisoners. It denied that security forces had torched Rohingya villages or used “excessive force”.

The military said that, while 376 “terrorists” were killed, there were no deaths of innocent people.

Human rights groups poured scorn on the military’s investigation, branding it a “whitewash” and calling for U.N. and independent investigators to be allowed into Myanmar.

“The Burmese military’s absurd effort to absolve itself of mass atrocities underscores why an independent international investigation is needed to establish the facts and identify those responsible,” Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.

Amnesty International also dismissed the military’s internal investigation. “There is overwhelming evidence that the military has murdered and raped Rohingya and burned their villages to the ground,” the London-based rights group said.

The government in mostly Buddhist Myanmar regards the Muslim Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

And Suu Kyi’s failure to speak out strongly over their plight has widely damaged the Nobel Peace Prize winner’s international reputation as a stateswoman.

Many diplomats, however, believe Myanmar’s fragile transition to democracy after 49 years of military rule would be jeopardized if she publicly criticized the armed forces.

“Both parts of the government will have to work together in order to solve this problem...Trying to get two of them to work together, to try to solve the problem, is certainly going to be very important,” the U.S. official said.

The U.S. official said Suu Kyi had been forthcoming in her talks with Tillerson and others during the past few days about the steps that needed to be taken to improve the situation, including plans for the voluntary repatriation of Rohingya.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were among those she met in Manila to discuss the Rohingya crisis.

“This is a tremendous concern to Canada and to many, many countries around the world,” Trudeau told a news conference.

Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged up to 117 billion yen ($1 billion) of development aid to Myanmar in his meeting with Suu Kyi.

While world leaders wrung their hands, thousands of Rohingya remained stranded in Myanmar, on beaches around the mouth of the Naf river, hoping to find a boat to make the short, sometimes perilous crossing to Bangladesh.

“They’re still coming, risking their lives, driven by fears of starvation and violence,” Shariful Azam, a police official in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar, a narrow spit of land where the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis is unfolding.

Luscious rosogolla, or sweet cheese balls dripping with sugar syrup, have long been a favorite dessert across the Indian subcontinent and among the diaspora.

But two eastern states, West Bengal and Odisha, have been arguing over the origins of rosogolla, which means a ball of sweet. They consulted historians and produced old documents to support their claims.

On Tuesday, the federal commerce and industry ministry ruled that the sweet originated from West Bengal, giving it the coveted “geographical indications” tag.

Merchandise exports for October fell 1.12 percent from a year earlier to $23.1 billion, dropping for the first time since August 2016, dragged down by fall in gems, jewellery and textile exports.

A large number of exporters have been unable to meet their export orders despite a revival in global demand as billions of dollars were stuck under the new nationwide tax launched in July, exporters said.

FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed YouTube icon is seen in front of a displayed YouTube logo in this illustration taken October 25, 2017. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Ilustration/File Photo

The new policy affects videos that feature people and groups that have been designated as terrorist by the U.S. or British governments but lack the gory violence or hateful speech that were already barred by YouTube.

A YouTube spokesperson, who asked not be named for security reasons, confirmed the policy in response to questions. The company would not specify when the policy went into effect.

As YouTube terms already barred “terrorists” from using the service, the new policy keeps out videos uploaded by others that militants likely would try to distribute if they could have accounts, according to the spokesperson.

Hundreds of videos of slain al Qaeda recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki lecturing on the history of Islam, recorded long before he advocated violence against the United States, were among those removed under the new policy, the spokesperson said.

Governments and human rights groups have pressed YouTube for years to crack down on extremist videos. They argue that the propaganda radicalized viewers and contributed to deadly terror attacks.

British Home Secretary Amber Rudd amplified the pressure during visits with tech companies in Silicon Valley in July and a speech in Washington, D.C. last week. European Union and U.S. lawmakers this year have threatened consequences for tech companies if concerns are not addressed.

Legislation could resemble a German law approved in June to fine social media companies 50 million euros ($57 million) if hateful postings are not promptly removed.

YouTube said discussions with outside experts prompted the new policy, but it was unclear why the company decided to act only recently. In June, the company announced that “inflammatory religious or supremacist content” that did not violate its policies would be allowed with warning labels and a restriction making them ineligible for ad revenue.

At the time, Google General Counsel Kent Walker said in a blog post, “We think this strikes the right balance between free expression and access to information without promoting extremely offensive viewpoints.”

The latest step goes farther and was praised by critics such as Paul Barrett, deputy director of the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights.

“If the terrorist is in the business of recruiting and inciting people to make violent attacks, you’ve got to the draw the line” against any of their content, Barrett said.

The new policy does not affect news clips or educational videos about terrorism. But YouTube will not always have an easy time distinguishing, experts said, pointing to tactics such as overlaying extremist commentary on news footage to get around censors.

YouTube has resisted imposing more editorial control because it fears making it harder for important videos to get a wide audience, Juniper Downs, YouTube’s global director of public policy, told a San Francisco conference sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League on Monday.

“We will lose something very valuable if we completely transform the way these platforms work,” she said during a panel discussion.

Internet freedom advocates such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation have urged tech companies to be cautious and transparent in responding to government pressure.

YouTube is relying on government lists of terrorists and terrorist groups for enforcement. Content moderators check the listings and make removal decisions after fielding reports from an automated system, users or partner organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League and The Institute for Strategic Dialogue.

Al-Awlaki, whom the U.S. killed in a 2011 drone strike, was designated a terrorist by the U.S. Treasury the year prior.

At a summit in the Philippines, Donald Trump forged a “great relationship” with President Rodrigo Duterte, who only a year ago had cursed “son of a bitch” Barack Obama for decrying his administration’s bloody war on drug pushers and addicts.

And Trump flashed a thumbs-up as he shook hands with Cambodia’s authoritarian prime minister, Hun Sen, who praised the U.S. president as a kindred spirit for telling countries to put their own interests first.

“You are a great man to me,” Hun Sen said, addressing Trump at a meeting with other Southeast Asian leaders, and then referenced Trump’s ‘America First’ policy.

“I would like to inform you that if you follow your new policy in respect of the independence and sovereignty of other countries, the United States will have a lot of friends and you will be much respected and loved.”

For other leaders across Asia, however, Trump’s go-it-alone instincts must have represented a puzzling departure from his predecessors, who were - to varying degrees - standard bearers of multilateralism, democracy and human rights.

During a tour that took him to Japan, South Korea, China and Vietnam and the Philippines capital, Trump called for joint efforts to tighten the screws on North Korea and its development of nuclear weapons in defiance of U.N. sanctions.

But at an Asia-Pacific summit in Vietnam, he declared that redressing the uneven balance of trade between Asia and the United States was at the center of his “America First” policy, which he says will protect U.S. workers.

Trump’s vision has up-ended a consensus favoring multinational trade pacts whose regional champion is now China. On the sidelines of the Vietnam meeting, 11 countries kept alive a Trans Pacific trade deal that Trump walked away from last year in the name of protecting American jobs.

One cabinet member from a major ASEAN country told Reuters there was little enthusiasm in the region for Trump’s bilateral approach to deals.

“As Singapore Prime Minister Lee pointed out, the reason bilateral trade deals are so attractive for the USA, is precisely why no one will want to enter into one with the USA: because the USA could bully anyone on a bilateral basis,” said the Cabinet member who did not want to be named.

“Why would anyone sign up for that?”

THE ART OF THE DEALS

Trump told reporters before leaving that he had sealed deals of “at least $300 billion, possibly triple that figure”.

U.S. businesses signed around $250 billion dollars worth of deals during Trump’s Beijing visit, but many of those were nonbinding. Missing was any agreement on market access or reduction in technology-sharing agreements that American businesses have long complained about.

For Trump, dogged at home by low public approval ratings and investigations into Russian links to his election campaign, the deals will be an important prize to flaunt on his return.

“The multi-billion-dollar deals he struck in Beijing may not help the U.S. trade deficit,” said a former Japanese diplomat in Tokyo, who declined to be named. “But optically ... he can tell people that because he went to China with business leaders, he was able to come back with a gift.”

Although there were few weighty deliverables from Trump’s tour, for Asian nations looking nervously at China’s increasing assertiveness, it may be welcomed as a sign that his administration is still committed to the region.

“What regional countries wanted was for him to simply show up – to underscore that America remained at least notionally committed to Asia,” said Shahriman Lockman, a senior analyst at the Institute of Strategic & International Studies in Malaysia.

A senior official in South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s administration said Seoul had been worried he ”would come to South Korea and engage in unexpected behavior and language, but it turned out Trump was quite considerate.”

“South Korea was able to rest assured regarding its partnership with the United States,” the official said.

He also got good reviews at the start of his Asia tour in Japan, which has been currying favor with Trump since right after his election when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe jetted off to Trump Tower with an expensive golf club as a present.

“The most important deliverable is that we can send an almost identical message to the world that we share an identical strategy,” a Japanese government official said.

LAVISH RECEPTION

For Asian leaders, Trump’s off-the-cuff style, freewheeling tweets, and rhetorical hyperbole, must have been daunting. But one thing they seemed to learn was that he responds well to a lavish reception.

“They say in the history of people coming to China there has been nothing like that, and I believe it,” Trump told reporters after his visit to Beijing, where President Xi Jinping extended him the honor of a personal tour of the Forbidden City.

One measure of the Asian trip’s success, he said, was the “red carpet, like I think probably nobody has ever received.”

Diplomats say the bonhomie in Beijing probably stemmed in large part from Washington’s expectations Xi will lean more heavily on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Trump’s pronouncements on North Korea during the trip swung from embracing diplomacy to warnings of military intervention. “Do not underestimate us. And do not try us,” he said in a speech to South Korea’s National Assembly.

Days later, after Pyongyang dismissed the speech as “reckless remarks by an old lunatic,” Trump tweeted: “Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ‘old,’ when I would NEVER call him ‘short and fat?’”. And then he tacked back toward diplomacy. “Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!”

David Pressman, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President Obama, said Trump arrived in Asia without a North Korea strategy and left without one.

“Short and fat is not a nuclear strategy,” he said, adding that Washington’s approach to North Korea was fed by “whim, ego, and theatrical calculations of a fickle and uninformed president.”",Trump heads home with 'America First' ringing in Asian ears,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-asia-strategy-analysis/trump-heads-home-with-america-first-ringing-in-asian-ears-idUSKBN1DE1M1

First, he committed to addressing the shortcomings of the Iran nuclear deal, without terminating it. Second, he called for a comprehensive strategy to counter Iranian aggression throughout the Middle East. More sanctions, however, will not be enough to accomplish either of these goals.

Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, at a news conference in Tehran, May 22, 2017. TIMA via REUTERS

The president’s twin objectives of fixing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the nuclear deal is known, and confronting Iran’s destabilizing regional behavior are closely connected. Barack Obama overlooked Tehran’s military expansion into Iraq and Syria, among other actions, for the purpose of winning Iranian cooperation on the nuclear issue. The result was not just a disastrous deal, but a diminished U.S. ability to accomplish any of its strategic objectives in the region.

To defend our vital interests in the Middle East and potentially improve a deeply flawed nuclear deal, the United States must first rebuild leverage by countering Tehran’s growing aggression and influence in the region. That cannot be accomplished overnight. Nor can it be done solely through the use of sanctions or the threat of withdrawal from the agreement.

Along with more sanctions, and before trying to fix or abandon the deal, policymakers must develop a comprehensive strategy, utilizing every element of American power, to rebuild and apply counter-pressure against the full spectrum of Iran’s destabilizing behaviors.The Gemunder Center Iran Task Force at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), which we co-chair, recently detailed such a strategy, consisting of two elements.

U.S. President Donald Trump discusses the Iran nuclear deal in the White House, October 13, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque

First, restore credible U.S. military leverage against Iran. American officials should prepare – and make clear they are preparing – contingency plans to defend the United States and its allies from Iranian nuclear-capable missiles. The United States should be prepared to shoot down Iranian nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, including test launches, and respond forcefully to any Iranian harassment of U.S. naval vessels. To this end, it should deploy the Aegis missile defense system to the Persian Gulf (like we already do in Europe and East Asia).

It is also critical that the United States has a post-Islamic State strategy for Syria, including more assistance to our allies on the ground in holding territory hard-won from IS. This is necessary to prevent Iran, Hezbollah and their proxies from dictating that country’s future and consolidating a land bridge from Iran to Lebanon.

Second, Washington must take the lead in assembling a coherent regional coalition against Iran. This will require more concerted cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to develop robust missile defenses against Iran’s region-wide proliferation of advanced missiles.

The Trump administration and Congress must also augment the recent Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on defense aid to Israel by removing Obama-era caps on missile defense assistance. The MoU must be treated as the floor, not the ceiling, for bilateral cooperation against Iran’s and Hezbollah’s growing presence and capabilities on Israel’s northern borders. Similarly, we must ensure U.S. and Gulf air and maritime defenses can operate in close coordination as Iran’s military capabilities expand under the nuclear deal.

Trump is absolutely right to call the JCPOA “unacceptable” in its current form. By allowing restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic missile program, and conventional arms purchases to expire over the next 15 years, the JCPOA actively grants Iran the right to become a de facto ICBM-armed, militarily modernized nuclear power.

Electricity was cut off in several Iranian and Iraqi cities, and fears of aftershocks sent thousands of people in both countries out onto the streets and parks in cold weather. The Iranian seismological centre registered around 118 aftershocks and said more were expected. The head of Iranian Red Crescent said more than 70,000 people were in need of emergency shelter. On the Iraqi side, the most extensive damage was in the town of Darbandikhan, 75 km east of the city of Sulaimaniyah in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region.

Tuesday’s report from the Labor Department also showed steady gains in underlying producer prices, which support expectations of a gradual increase in inflation and keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates in December.

The producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month after a similar gain in September. In the 12 months through October, the PPI jumped 2.8 percent, the largest increase since February 2012.

The PPI rose 2.6 percent year-on-year in September. Economists had forecast the PPI edging up 0.1 percent last month and increasing 2.4 percent from a year ago.

Prices for services advanced 0.5 percent last month after increasing 0.4 percent in September. A 24.9 percent surge in margins for fuels and lubricants retailing accounted for almost half of the increase in the cost of services last month.

That helped to offset a 4.6 percent drop in the cost of gasoline. Wholesale gasoline prices soared 10.9 percent in September in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas in late August and reduced refining capacity in the Gulf Coast area.

Gasoline prices are falling amid ample crude oil supplies. Last month’s rise in prices received by the nation’s farms, factories and refineries was also driven by rising costs for goods such as pharmaceutical preparations, fresh and dry vegetables, meat and tobacco.

The dollar pared losses against a basket of currencies after the data, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.

A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent last month. It has increased by the same margin for three straight months. The so-called core PPI increased 2.3 percent in the 12 months through October after advancing 2.1 percent in September.

A weakening dollar could gradually lift core PPI. The dollar has this year lost 5.4 percent of its value against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners.

Inflation has remained stubbornly low, despite the labor market nearing full employment. The main inflation measure tracked by the Fed has remained below the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target since mid-2012.

Despite moderate price pressures, the Fed is expected to raise interest rates next month. There is cautious optimism that tightening labor market conditions will spur faster wage growth next year.

The Fed has increased borrowing costs twice this year. October’s consumer inflation data scheduled for release on Wednesday could shed more light on the future course of monetary policy.

Last month, food prices rose 0.5 percent after being unchanged in September. Core goods increased 0.3 percent after a similar gain in the prior month. Prices for passenger cars were unchanged last month. The government introduced new motor vehicle pricing models into the survey in October.

Britain’s economy is expanding at half the rate of Germany, inflation is running at its highest since 2012, wages are being squeezed and the economic slowdown is expected to get worse as the country’s departure from the EU in March 2019 nears.

In what is likely to be his last full budget plan before the terms of Brexit are hammered out, Hammond is also expected to have less money to spend in the coming years than he thought only a few months ago.

Britain’s budget forecasters are poised to cut their economic growth outlook due to persistently weak productivity, eating into the cash that Hammond had hoped to keep in reserve for any Brexit turbulence ahead.

At the same time, May needs something eye-catching to shore up her leadership of a deeply divided Conservative Party when Hammond delivers his budget in parliament on Nov. 22.

May has made little headway in Britain’s high-stakes Brexit talks, and the resignation of two ministers this month has added to the sense of crisis in Westminster since she lost a parliamentary majority in a June election.

Hammond is also on thin ice. He was reportedly on the verge of being sacked by May before she was weakened by the election and he is in the sights of pro-Brexit Conservatives who say he is undermining Britain’s hand in negotiations with Brussels by not spending now for a possible “no-deal” Brexit.

The popular Sun newspaper accused him of “suffocating caution” in an editorial on Tuesday. “This is a time for courage and imagination, not miserly bean-counting,” it said.

But Hammond has almost no scope for big tax cuts or a big increase in investment, unless he tears up his budget rules under which he is aiming to turn the deficit into a surplus by the mid-2020s.

Ratings agency Moody’s cut Britain’s credit rating in September, saying plans to reduce its heavy debt load had been knocked off course by Hammond’s slower approach to fixing the deficit than that of his predecessor George Osborne. It also said Brexit was likely to weigh on the economy.

“If I were the chancellor, I would be announcing lots of strategies and reviews and probably trying to do as little as possible, given the limited room for manoeuvre,” Conservative lawmaker Nicky Morgan said.

“The politics of the budget are going to be as important or more important than what is said economically,” said Morgan, who heads a committee that scrutinises the work of the Treasury.

Many voters are tired of seven years of spending restraints imposed by former chancellor George Osborne following the financial crisis, and then by Hammond when he replaced him after the Brexit vote in June last year.

Households have suffered the worst income squeeze since the early 19th century, by some estimates, fuelling support for the left-wing opposition Labour Party and its big spending plans.

BOXED IN

But Hammond has flatly rejected proposals from a fellow minister to fund a major house-building drive to respond to the frustrations of many younger voters who feel priced out of the property boom that helped their parents.

Instead, he is reported to be considering a more modest plan to reduce a tax on home purchases for first-time buyers.

Similarly, Hammond is unlikely to inflict much pain on wealthier voters who are the main beneficiaries of a steadily rising threshold for paying income tax and who enjoy generous help from the tax man for their private pensions.

Protests from Conservative MPs forced Hammond into a U-turn in March when he dropped a plan to increase national insurance contributions for self-employed workers.

In a nod to the concerns of many businesses, Hammond is likely to reduce the pace of increases in a tax businesses pay on the property they use, newspapers have said.

But many economists say Hammond could make things easier for himself if he adopts Labour’s call to exclude borrowing for infrastructure investment from his budget deficit targets.

More investment in transport and digital networks, for example, could help improve Britain’s productivity problem and eventually bring the government more tax revenues.

“There is no reason at all why we need to stick with the fiscal rules as they are,” Matt Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation think-tank, said.

“Borrowing costs are so low at the moment that most if not all economists think we should be borrowing more to invest. The fact that we are not is really a missed trick.”

But investors say Hammond cannot afford to be complacent, given Britain’s large current account deficit which requires funding by foreign investors.

If Britain falls into another deep recession, or leaves the EU without a trade deal, investors might take fright, Robert Wood, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said.

“As long as the music is playing, the UK can keep dancing. The question is what happens if the music stops?” Wood said.",Hammond has limited options to help May with budget,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-budget/hammond-has-limited-options-to-help-may-with-budget-idUKKBN1DE1U1

Altri numeri: 733.000 punti vendita convenzionati, 150 banche partner e 122 miliardi di asset under management.
L‘AD si è detto certo che, a breve, “ogni pagamento sarà digitale”.","MILANO, 10 novembre (Reuters) - Icbpi e CartaSì lasciano il posto a Nexi, nuova realtà che si pone l‘obiettivo di “costruire, in partnership con le banche, il futuro dei pagamenti digitali in Italia”.

Il nuovo brand del gruppo è stato presentato dal management nel corso di una conferenza stampa nell‘ambito della convention organizzata per presentare le strategie ai partner delle banche.

La storia recente di Icbpi-CartaSì è stata una corsa a perdifiato. Nel dicembre 2015 Mercury Italy -- veicolo partecipato dagli operatori di private equity Bain Capital, Advent International e Clessidra -- ha perfezionato l‘acquisto dell‘85,29% dell‘istituto bancario sulla base di una valutazione del 100% di 2,15 miliardi.

Nella primavera 2016 al gruppo si è aggiunta Setefi, ceduta da Intesa Sanpaolo per circa un miliardo.

A fine 2016 ha acquisito il 100% di Bassilichi per 230 milioni.

In febbraio è toccato alle attività legate al business merchant acquiring di Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena e di Deutsche Bank per 520 milioni.

Insomma, come ha sottolineato l‘AD Paolo Bertoluzzo, gli azionisti “hanno investito quasi 4 miliardi”. E il gruppo ha già annunciato investimenti in tecnologia per 1 miliardo nel quinquennio 2016-2021.

Ora il cambio di brand, con l‘abbandono di Icbpi (indolore, è stato detto più volte, dato il nome poco musicale...) e di CartaSì, marchio che generava nel pubblico “affettività, certo, ma legata al passato”, ha spiegato Bertoluzzo. Insomma, un gruppo focalizzato sul digitale non poteva continuare ad operare tramite un brand con il sostantivo “carta”. Da qui la scelta di varare Nexi, accompagnando il nuovo marchio con lo slogan “every day, every pay”.

La struttura societaria, conseguenza di buyout e successive acquisizioni, resta complessa: “Nel tempo la semplificheremo”, ha detto Bertoluzzo, “ma non è una priorità”.

Il gruppo attualmente gestisce 27 milioni di carte di pagamento, 2,7 miliardi di transazioni per 120 miliardi di euro (il mercato italiano ammonta a poco meno di 200 miliardi), 15.000 sportelli bancari automatici. Altri numeri: 733.000 punti vendita convenzionati, 150 banche partner e 122 miliardi di asset under management.

Ma lo spazio per crescere è enorme. “Per fortuna”, ha ironizzato Bertoluzzo, “il settore è in ritardo in Italia”. Qui, infatti, solo il 20% dei pagamenti è in forma digitale, contro il 40% della media europea, il 65% della Gran Bretagna e i picchi dell‘80% in Scandinavia. L‘AD si è detto certo che, a breve, “ogni pagamento sarà digitale”. Quando? “Un giorno... e questo giorno è oggi”, recita la campagna pubblicitaria di Nexi.

Bertoluzzo e due manager del gruppo (Roberto Catanzaro ed Erika Fattori) hanno spiegato nei dettagli i vantaggi delle transazioni digitali, i prodotti che verranno lanciati, l‘opera di informazione ed educazione nei confronti di commercianti e clienti, la campagna di comunicazione. Tra le novità, nella seconda parte del 2018 Nexi commercializzerà Poynt, un terminale per pagamenti che metterà a disposizione degli esercenti una sorta di app store, un menù completo di funzioni per semplificare le transazioni commerciali, con particolare focus sul contactless. L‘anno prossimo, del resto, è stato evidenziato, segnerà l‘avvento degli instant payments, le transazioni entro massimi dieci secondi, che “cambieranno radicalmente il sistema di pagamento”, ha concluso l‘AD.

The New South Wales state government announced the name for one of its six new ferries on Tuesday after a public vote, with Transport Minister Andrew Constance deeming it “one for the kids”.

Ferry McFerryface was actually the second choice in the Australian poll, behind Boaty McBoatface, the name also chosen by the British public in a 2016 vote to name a new polar research vessel.

The British government overturned that vote, instead naming the vessel after leading naturalist David Attenborough, but failed to stem an internet craze that led to temporary copycats like Trainy McTrainface and Firey McFireface.

The name Boaty McBoatface eventually went to a research vessel on board the David Attenborough.

Australian authorities said they planned to comply with the public vote, albeit passing on Boaty as the first choice, given the lack of originality.

“We asked Sydney to name their new ferries, and we have listened,” Constance said in a statement. “Ferry McFerryface will be the harbour’s newest icon, and I hope it brings a smile to the faces of visitors and locals alike.”

But the country’s Maritime Union, whose members staff the ferry fleet, failed to see the funny side.

Paul Garrett, a spokesman for the union, said workers were frustrated by the decision, noting that ferries have traditionally been named after Sydney’s beaches and successful Olympians.

“The transport minister is demonstrating here that he treats public transport as a joke,” Garrett told 2GB radio.

Three of the other five new ferries have already been given more traditional names in honour of luminaries including heart surgeon Victor Chang, ophthalmologist and humanitarian Fred Hollows and obstetrician and gynaecologist Catherine Hamlin.","Australia 'brings a smile' with Ferry McFerryface, but not everyone gets the joke",https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKBN1DE0HO

The U.S. dollar .DXY retreated against a basket of major currencies after strong German economic growth data drove the euro to a three-week high.

U.S., Canadian and Mexican negotiators hope to make modest progress in the next round of North American Free Trade Agreement talks in Mexico City this week.

NAFTA working groups are due to begin meeting from Wednesday. On Friday, talks will formally get underway through Nov. 21.

At 9:23 a.m. ET (1423 GMT), the Canadian dollar CAD=D4 was trading at C$1.2711 to the greenback, or 78.67 U.S. cents, up 0.2 percent.

The currency’s strongest level of the session was C$1.2701, while it touched its weakest since last Wednesday at C$1.2755.

The gain for the Canadian dollar came despite the third straight day of declining prices of oil, one of Canada’s major exports.

U.S. crude CLc1 prices were down 0.37 percent at $56.55 a barrel.

The Canadian dollar is unlikely to recapture its tight link with the price of oil even as the interest rate outlook settles, given that crude trades are far removed from levels needed to affect investment in Canada’s energy sector, economists and strategists say.

As of Nov. 7, Canadian dollar net long positions had slipped to 50,889 contracts from 57,839 a week earlier.

Canadian government bond prices were lower across much of the yield curve, with the two-year CA2YT=RR down 3.5 Canadian cents to yield 1.481 percent and the 10-year CA10YT=RR falling 11 Canadian cents to yield 1.983 percent.

Canada’s manufacturing sales data for September is due on Thursday and the October inflation report will be released on Friday.

Economists expect the annual inflation rate to have cooled to 1.4 percent in October, which could give the Bank of Canada room to take its time raising interest rates after two back-to-back hikes earlier this year.",Canadian dollar firms against weaker greenback as NAFTA talks loom,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1DE1ZC-OCABS

Beijing Sinnet Technology Co Ltd, Amazon’s China partner, said in a filing late on Monday that it would buy the U.S. firm’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud computing unit in China for up to 2 billion yuan ($301.2 million).

“In order to comply with Chinese law, AWS sold certain physical infrastructure assets to Sinnet,” an AWS spokesman said on Tuesday, adding AWS would still own the intellectual property for its services worldwide.

“‎We’re excited about the significant business we have in China and its growth potential.”

Chinese regulators are tightening rules on foreign data and cloud services, implementing new surveillance measures and increasing scrutiny of cross-border data transfers. Laws that came into effect in June require firms to store data locally.

“This move is mostly around regulatory compliance,” said Charlie Dai, Beijing-based analyst at Forrester Research. He added the move was necessary for AWS to build up its other business areas in the market.

AWS has a separate hardware venture in partnership with the Ningxia provincial government in China’s northwest. Amazon said on its website that its public cloud services in the country are exclusively managed by Sinnet.

Amazon’s cloud business in China already faced tougher rules due to China’s tight internet controls. In August, Sinnet told customers it would shut down VPNs and other services on its networks that allow users to circumvent China’s so-called Great Firewall system of censorship, citing direct instructions from the government.

The move casts a shadow over similar foreign ventures in the country. Microsoft Corp, Oracle Corp and IBM Corp are also facing tough new regulatory challenges in localizing their data storage units.

Global firms in China, including Apple Inc, have this year transferred data to Chinese ventures overseen by local authorities. Microsoft operates its Azure cloud services unit in partnership with China-based 21Vianet Group.

“We expect other foreign players, such as Oracle and IBM, will also ensure regulatory compliance as long as they want to provide public cloud services in China,” said Dai.

Microsoft, Oracle and IBM did not immediately respond to request for comment on Tuesday.

Cloud services have become a crowded and competitive field in China in recent years, with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s cloud unit opening over a dozen overseas data centers since 2016.

Chinese firms account for roughly 80 percent of total cloud services revenue in China, and roughly half of the data center market in 2017, according to Synergy Research Group.",Amazon sells off China cloud assets as tough new rules bite,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-amazon-cloud/amazon-sells-off-china-cloud-assets-as-tough-new-rules-bite-idUSKBN1DE0CL

“While I‘m still in a good deal of pain, I will be returning to work in the Senate today, ready to fight for liberty and help move forward with tax cuts in the coming days and weeks,” the Republican senator Paul said on a Twitter post.

The man accused of tackling Paul and breaking his ribs, Rene Boucher, 59, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to a misdemeanor assault charge, a court official said.

Boucher is charged with fourth-degree assault causing minor injury, for which he faces up to a year of imprisonment if convicted. A pretrial hearing was set for Nov. 30.

Boucher’s $7,500 bond requiring him to keep at least 1,000 feet (305 m) away from Paul remained in effect.

Paul, 54, told police that Boucher came on his property in a gated community near Bowling Green and tackled him from behind, the Bowling Green Daily News reported, citing an arrest warrant.

Paul previously said on Twitter he suffered the broken ribs from the Nov. 3 incident and that X-rays showed a pleural effusion, which is a buildup of fluid in the tissues that line the lungs and the chest.

Media reports have said Boucher, also a physician like Paul, had a long-running dispute with the senator.

But Paul, in a Washington Examiner interview published Monday, said he had no dispute with Boucher and had not spoken to his neighbor in a decade. He said he knew of no motive for the incident. Paul could not be reached by Reuters Monday.

“My first encounter was basically being hit in the back,” he said. “We’ve never had words over anything, we’ve never had a dispute or discussion or words.”

The Kentucky State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are investigating the incident, according to Warren County Attorney Amy Milliken.

Citing unnamed sources, Fox News reported on Thursday that Paul had been told federal charges were expected in the case.

“There is going to be a criminal prosecution,” Paul told the Examiner but did not elaborate on what he meant.

Un “plan de mobilisation générale”, fruit d‘une concertation entre l‘Etat, les collectivités locales et les acteurs du terrain, sera présenté d‘ici février et se concentrera sur une dizaine de quartiers “particulièrement en difficulté”.

“Ceux qui habitent les villes les plus pauvres sont des enfants de la République, ils ont droit à la même réussite que les autres”, a dit le chef de l‘Etat lors d‘un discours dans le quartier de la Bourgogne à Tourcoing. “Ils ne demandent pas de l‘aide, des subventions, des contrats de seconde zone, des dispositifs spécifiques”.

“Ils veulent qu‘on leur apporte la possibilité d‘accéder à la même chose que les autres”, a-t-il ajouté. Il s‘agit donc de “ramener le droit commun dans les quartiers afin que chacun ait accès aux mêmes services” et de “rétablir ce socle minimal qui a parfois été oublié”.

Quarante ans après le premier “plan banlieue” - qui a été suivi de dix autres aux succès mitigés -, les quelque 1.500 quartiers politique de la ville (QPV) continuent d‘afficher un taux de chômage près de trois fois supérieur au taux national et un taux de pauvreté de 40%.

Ces quartiers comptent par ailleurs toujours deux fois moins de médecins généralistes, près de cinq fois moins de crèches et de nombreux services publics ont au fil des ans disparu.

Pour y remédier, Emmanuel Macron propose notamment le dédoublement des classes de CP dans les zones REP+ - effectif depuis la rentrée -, la mise en place de la police de sécurité du quotidien - qui sera expérimentée sur certains territoires début 2018 - et le doublement des maisons de santé.

RELANCE DES CONTRATS FRANCS

Pour favoriser l‘accès de tous à l‘emploi, le chef de l‘Etat mise sur les “contrats francs” - un dispositif qui accorde une prime aux entreprises embauchant un habitant d‘un quartier populaire - dès 2018 via une phase d‘expérimentation avant une généralisation en 2020.

Expérimentés sous le quinquennat de François Hollande, ces contrats francs avaient finalement été abandonnés en raison de critères d‘éligibilité très limitatifs. Le public concerné a donc été élargi et recouvre désormais tous les demandeurs d‘emploi sans critère d‘âge; le montant d‘aide a été relevé afin d‘être plus incitatif.

Les entreprises bénéficieront d‘une aide de 5.000 euros par an sur trois ans pour une embauche en CDI et de 2.500 euros par an sur deux ans pour un CDD de plus de six mois. Une dizaine de territoires seront concernés au 1er janvier.

Le gouvernement entend dans le même temps intensifier les campagnes de “testing” lancées par le ministère du Travail sous le quinquennat précédent. A l‘heure actuelle, 17% des habitants de quartiers se déclarent victimes de discrimination en raison de leur origine.

Il faut “traquer les employeurs qui ne respectent pas ce qui est dans la loi qui interdit la discrimination à l‘embauche comme à la promotion” et “pénaliser les entreprises qui ont recours à ces pratiques”, a dit Emmanuel Macron, qui souhaite rendre public le nom des entreprises “les plus délinquantes”.

En matière de rénovation urbaine, pilier de la politique de la ville, l‘Agence nationale de la rénovation urbaine (Anru) va voir comme prévu son budget doublé jusqu‘à 10 milliards d‘euros.

Ce plan banlieue constitue un enjeu pour Emmanuel Macron, accusé depuis le début du quinquennat de favoriser les plus aisés, notamment par des élus locaux échaudés par la baisse des aides au logement et la diminution du nombre de contrats aidés.

“Je voudrais tordre le cou à une idée qui en ce moment fait fureur, c‘est qu‘il y aurait une politique économique ambitieuse pour les gens qui réussissent”, a dit Emmanuel Macron. “Je ne sais pas ce que ça veut dire avoir une politique pour les riches”.

“Je sais simplement que quand il n‘y a pas une économie qui tire tout le pays en avant, quand il n‘y a pas des entrepreneurs qui réussissent, des gens qui réinvestissent dans l‘économie, les quartiers les plus en difficulté ne s‘en sortent pas bien”.","Macron promet le ""retour de l'Etat"" dans les banlieues",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRKBN1DE1WT-OFRTP

The European Commission’s move could impact other sports and become as important a milestone as the landmark 1995 court ruling involving Belgian soccer player Jean-Marc Bosman, which paved the way for the free movement of players in the EU.

The ruling could set a precedent that would make it easier for unofficial and ‘breakaway’ events and competitions set up without the approval of a sports’ governing body.

The Commission ruling, which is expected by the end of November or early December, is likely to order the International Skating Union (ISU) to amend its system of penalties, which include lifetime bans for competing in unauthorized events, the sources told Reuters.

The ISU found itself in the EU competition enforcer’s crosshairs two years ago after Dutch Olympic speed skaters Mark Tuitert and Niels Kerstholt raised grievances after being put off competing in lucrative Ice Derby events run by a South Korean company by threats of a lifetime ban.

“The eligibility rules reveal a manifest conflict of interest between the ISU’s regulatory and commercial functions,” said Ben Van Rompuy, the lawyer for the skaters and a lecturer in competition law at Leiden University in the Netherlands.

“We are eagerly awaiting the Commission’s decision and we are confident that it will set an important precedent to the benefit of European athletes in numerous sports,” he said.

Both the EU’s competition enforcer and the Lausanne-based ISU, which previously said such an approach could destroy the Olympic values underpinning sport, declined to comment on the matter.

In its 2016 charge sheet, the Commission said the ISU’s penalties, which range from five-year to lifetime bans, were anti-competitive because they were disproportionately punitive, restricted the athletes’ commercial freedom and prevented new entrant organizers.

In an indication of the wider potential impact of the ruling, International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach called in June for the protection of what he called the ‘European sports model’.

“Our concern stems from the fact that a purely market-based approach to sport organizations would ignore the social contribution of sport to help achieve objectives of common interest,” said Bach who argued that federations were investing in youth activities.

Bach called on the Commission to “safeguard the volunteer engagement and to protect the European Model of Sport, rather than destroying it by applying the same rules as it does for industries, like car manufacturing or steel production”.",Exclusive: EU set to rule in favor of speed skaters over ISU ban threat - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1DE1OQ-OCASP

“While I‘m still in a good deal of pain, I will be returning to work in the Senate today, ready to fight for liberty and help move forward with tax cuts in the coming days and weeks,” the Republican senator Paul said on a Twitter post.

The man accused of tackling Paul and breaking his ribs, Rene Boucher, 59, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to a misdemeanor assault charge, a court official said.

Boucher is charged with fourth-degree assault causing minor injury, for which he faces up to a year of imprisonment if convicted. A pretrial hearing was set for Nov. 30.

Boucher’s $7,500 bond requiring him to keep at least 1,000 feet (305 m) away from Paul remained in effect.

Paul, 54, told police that Boucher came on his property in a gated community near Bowling Green and tackled him from behind, the Bowling Green Daily News reported, citing an arrest warrant.

Paul previously said on Twitter he suffered the broken ribs from the Nov. 3 incident and that X-rays showed a pleural effusion, which is a buildup of fluid in the tissues that line the lungs and the chest.

Media reports have said Boucher, also a physician like Paul, had a long-running dispute with the senator.

But Paul, in a Washington Examiner interview published Monday, said he had no dispute with Boucher and had not spoken to his neighbor in a decade. He said he knew of no motive for the incident. Paul could not be reached by Reuters Monday.

FILE PHOTO: A Tesco supermarket is seen, in west London on September 30, 2008. . REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had conducted an in-depth review and provisionally concluded that Tesco’s purchase of Booker does not raise competition concerns.

Tesco’s move on Booker in January sparked further consolidation in Britain’s 185 billion pound grocery market as supermarkets seek additional sources of growth.

Analysts expect more M&A activity as supermarkets seek to utilize excess capacity within their supply chains.

“The wholesale trade in particular will be wondering why on earth it ever bothered engaging at all with the CMA, an organization that seemingly lives in a different universe,” said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.

“If Tesco and Booker can merge with unconditional approval, then the scope for further large-scale consolidation cannot be ruled out,” he said.

The provisional clearance will come as a big relief to Tesco. Most analysts had expected it would have to agree to store divestments or restrictions on operations to gain clearance.

Tesco and Booker have argued their deal will enhance competition in Britain and promote consumer interests. However, rival wholesalers, including Bestway, Spar, Bidfood and Sugro, reject that and have called for the deal to be blocked.

UNSHAKEABLE GRIP

They believe if the deal proceeds Tesco will have an unshakeable grip on the procurement of all grocery categories in Britain and that suppliers will find it even harder to resist Tesco’s demands.

Both Tesco and Booker, the country’s biggest grocery wholesaler, welcomed the CMA announcement. Tesco said it expected to complete the deal, which also requires shareholder approvals, in early 2018.

Shares in Tesco and Booker were both up 7 percent at 1422 GMT.

Rival grocers declined to comment on the record. But a source at one grocer described the CMA’s decision as “ridiculous”.

Though it is unusual for provisional findings to be reversed, rival wholesale and retail groups do have the chance to present further evidence and comment before the CMA’s final ruling due in December.

In consolidation moves already prompted by the deal, Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L), Britain’s No. 2 supermarket group, considered a bid for the Nisa convenience chain before the Co-operative Group (42TE.L) secured a 138 million pound deal. Morrisons (MRW.L), the No. 4, has signed a wholesale supply deal with the McColl’s (MCLSM.L) chain.

Some Tesco shareholders have criticized the Booker bid, saying Chief Executive Dave Lewis is overpaying and that it will distract from the company’s turnaround plan.

CALLS FOR HIGHER PRICE?

The approval could spur calls from Booker shareholders for Tesco to raise its bid.

One top 20 Booker investor said he believed Tesco should pay more “as Booker is Tesco’s last hope”. He said the investor would reiterate to Booker that it could extract a higher price.

Bernstein analysts said they expect some uncertainty to remain, with the focus shifting to whether investors will approve the deal.

Their analysis indicates that Tesco will achieve the required 50 percent shareholder approval and that the focus will be on Booker, where the threshold is 75 percent.

“With a higher shareholder hurdle and the Tesco share price below the level when the bid was made, Booker shareholders may argue for a higher share price,” the broker’s analysts said.

The Booker deal is Lewis’s boldest move yet, giving Tesco access to the faster growing “out of home” food market.

For each Booker share, Tesco is offering 0.861 new Tesco shares and 42.6 pence in cash.

The CMA said it found that Tesco as a retailer and Booker as a wholesaler supplying caterers and independent retailers Premier, Londis, Budgens and Family Shopper do not compete head-to-head in most of their activities.

In particular, it found that Tesco does not supply the catering sector that accounts for more than 30 percent of Booker’s sales.

“Our investigation has found that existing competition is sufficiently strong in both the wholesale and retail grocery sectors to ensure that the merger between Tesco and Booker will not lead to higher prices or a reduced service for supermarket and convenience shoppers,” said Simon Polito, chair of the CMA’s inquiry group.

To most people, that label belongs to the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which leads opinion polls ahead of the vote due to be held by May. But looking at the main parties’ economic plans it is hard to judge who deserves it most.

The economy is growing at its fastest clip since 2010 but politicians of all stripes say they will use the extra resources to cut taxes and spend more, rather than pay down the biggest debt burden in the euro zone after Greece‘s.

Italy was at the heart of the euro zone debt crisis in 2011 and the election is seen the next source of potential instability in the currency bloc, especially if parties carry out the maverick policies they are proposing.

The vow to chop up to 50 billion euros ($60 billion) off income and corporate taxes and renege on Italy’s commitment to balance its budget comes from the leader of the ruling Democratic Party (PD), former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.

He wants to hike the deficit from a targeted 2.1 percent of gross domestic product this year to 3 percent and then hold it at that level, and said this month he would “bang his fists on the table” in Brussels to get his way.

The plan to print a “new lira” for domestic use while keeping the euro for international trade comes from centre-right leader and four-times prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who says the scheme will boost consumer spending and economic growth.

None of the main parties is campaigning on an economically orthodox platform of fiscal consolidation likely to please financial markets or the European Commission.

Populism is thriving in Italy mainly because fiscal rigour prescribed by the EU is widely blamed for a deep double dip recession between 2008 and 2013 from which the country is only gradually recovering.

A survey commissioned by the European Parliament last month showed only 39 percent of Italians felt their country had benefitted from EU membership, putting it bottom among the bloc’s 28 nations.

Policies considered responsible by Europe’s political and economic mainstream are seen as vote-losers in Italy, where 5-Star has often set the political agenda in recent years.

“IRRESPONSIBLE PROMISES”

Luca Ricolfi, a sociology professor at Turin University and prominent political commentator, said the election is likely to produce a hung parliament and this meant politicians felt free to make promises they would probably never have to honour.

“As there are no reasonable parties at this election, Renzi can make irresponsible promises to try to win votes because the centre-right and 5-Star are even more irresponsible,” he said.

Berlusconi himself has often been called populist since he entered politics in 1994 promising “lower taxes for everyone,” but now both he and Renzi are casting themselves as moderate leaders whose role is to halt the maverick 5-Star.

The 81-year-old media tycoon’s main coalition partner is Matteo Salvini, head of the anti-immigrant Northern League and an ally of French National Front leader Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders of the right-wing Freedom Party in the Netherlands.

The League has its own scheme for a parallel currency, which it calls mini-BOTs, named after Italy’s short-term Treasury bills, which it sees as a probable stepping-stone to exiting the euro.

As well as a parallel currency, Salvini wants to introduce a single tax rate of 15 percent for individuals and companies instead of the current five staggered income tax brackets of between 23 and 43 percent.

The party’s economic spokesman Claudio Borghi told Reuters the “flat tax” would reduce revenues by 40 billion euros (about 2.5 percent of GDP) but this would soon be offset by a reduction in tax evasion and a boost to growth.

He said the League planned to introduce this radical tax plan in its first budget, to obtain a “surprise effect”, and it was no problem if it pushed up the budget deficit and raised objections in Brussels.

“We have no intention of respecting current deficit targets,” he said. “We couldn’t care less about the opinions of others because we pay in to Europe more than we get back, so why should others have a say on our spending or our deficit?”

HUNG PARLIAMENT SEEN

5-Star has about 28 percent of the vote, according to opinion polls, followed by the PD on 25 percent and the centre-right allies the Northern League and Berlusconi’s Forza Italia (Go Italy!), each with around 15 percent.

Under the largely proportional electoral system, no party or coalition is expected to win a majority of seats in parliament.

Berlusconi also promises a “flat tax,” but he wants to set it at 23 percent instead of the League’s 15 percent, and to phase it in more gradually.

In addition, he has promised to raise minimum pensions to 1,000 euros per month from around 500 euros, abolish road tax on most cars and introduce a “dignity income” - a new welfare benefit to help the 15 million poorest Italians.

The dignity income was a response to 5-Star’s flagship policy the “citizens’ wage,” which would top up the income of 9 million poor Italians to 780 euros per month, just over half the average wage, at an annual cost of 17 billion euros.

5-Star has rowed back on a previous pledge to hold a referendum on Italy’s euro membership, but its 31-year-old leader, Luigi Di Maio, still wants to renegotiate the EU’s fiscal rules and raise the budget deficit.

“We have to increase public investments to help growth and the only way to do that is to increase the deficit above 3 percent of GDP,” he told Reuters.

At the same time, however, it’s also a sign of how stretched those forces have become.

Getting three carriers to the Pacific has been an intrinsic part of Washington’s strategy to intimidate North Korea. But to do so required pulling forces from a host of other potential conflict areas, including the Gulf.

The ever-increasing demand for military resources in a growing number of places is causing increased concern in the U.S. military. In June, a report by the U.S. Army War College described America’s military clout as “fraying” and bluntly concluded that the era of U.S. global military primacy that followed the fall of the Berlin wall was over. America’s armed forces have a variety of strategies to tackle that decline but the truth is that coming wars will look very different from the sort of military deployments taken for granted in the recent past.

The change from a decade or so ago could scarcely be starker. In the aftermath of 9/11, America’s conventional military capability was narrowly focused on a handful of locations, primarily Iraq and Afghanistan. The resources plowed into them were stupendous – $5.6 trillion so far, academics at Brown University estimated this month. That would imply a cost per individual U.S. taxpayer of more than $23,000, including future care for veterans.

At their height, those wars dominated U.S. military thinking, planning and workload in a way that is hard to overstate. Working from Pentagon figures, the Brown researchers estimate that some 2.7 million American service personnel passed through those two countries in that time, more than half of them deploying more than once. Officially, however, these conflicts were never seen as endless wars – the hope was always that one last surge of troops would win the day and allow a larger withdrawal.

That didn’t happen, and U.S. military planners now assume there will be a substantial presence in Iraq, Afghanistan and several other countries for years, if not decades, to come. Since the middle of the Obama administration, however, the Pentagon has quietly and comprehensively changed its approach to those wars, aiming for a much more sustainable “advise and assist” model working through local forces.

Speaking at the Association of the U.S. Army meeting in Washington in October, U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley made it clear he expected such missions to grow substantially in the years to come. The success of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria demonstrates such tactics can work. But there have also been substantial failures and wastage, not least in Afghanistan where local security forces continue to struggle despite absorbing $70 billion of U.S. funding since 2001.

Much of the burden of U.S. operations in the last 15 years has fallen on a handful of special operations units, whose budgets, personnel numbers and deployments have all risen dramatically. They are now dangerously overstretched, and the U.S. Army is now looking to create more mainstream units to take on unconventional deployments.

With much of the fighting left to local forces, U.S. casualties are substantially lower. But as the death of four U.S. Green Berets in Niger last month demonstrated, putting troops far forward with less backup than they could call on in Iraq and Afghanistan means that when things go wrong, they go bad fast.

The aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt leaves San Diego, California,October 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake

Another awkward truth: In the last year U.S. personnel have been more likely to die in accidents than action, the result of a series of incidents including the high profile collisions of destroyers USS Fitzgerald and McCain. That toll suggests that even the parts of the U.S. military that have not been fighting wars are perhaps dangerously overstretched.

That’s been particularly true in Asia, where both the Fitzgerald and McCain were based. Tensions with China and North Korea have kept those units on high alert. In Europe too, heightened tensions with Russia have resulted in a scale of U.S. military activity unseen since the Cold War. U.S. troops, planes, ships and submarines are now on almost continuous exercises to reassure allies and track Russia’s increasingly active forces as Moscow probes NATO air and sea borders.

The Pentagon budget – $825 billion this fiscal year – is rising, and continues to dwarf that of any other nation. But it is also spread much more widely. China and Russia – spending $146 billion and 70 billion respectively – lack America’s global reach, but are more aggressively focused on their own immediate neighborhoods. Both have aggressively plowed resources into techniques and tactics such as cyber warfare and missiles that U.S. tacticians worry might give them the edge in any local war.

Some of that was expected – the Obama administration began its “pivot” to Asia in 2012 because of the perceived growing China threat. Much, however, was not – not least the speed with which North Korea has raced towards being able to strike the U.S. with nuclear-tipped missiles.

Washington’s military capabilities still dwarf anyone else’s.

In the weeks since September’s failed Kurdish independence referendum, Iraq has agreed for the first time to divert crude from Kirkuk province, which it retook from the Kurds, to Iran, where it will supply a refinery in the city of Kermanshah.

Iran is locked in a proxy war with its regional rival and U.S. ally, Saudi Arabia. As well as Iraq, it has been extending its influence in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, raising increasing concerns in Washington and Riyadh.

Under the new arrangement, the first oil will be trucked across the border in the coming days. Initially Iran will receive 15,000 barrels per day worth nearly $1 million, rising gradually to 60,000 bpd, according to Iraqi officials and trading sources.

Baghdad and Tehran have also revived a project to build a pipeline to carry oil from Iraq’s Kirkuk fields to central Iran and onwards for export from the Gulf.

Hamid Hosseini, the Iranian secretary-general of the Iran-Iraq Chamber of Commerce, said Iran want to build a pipeline that can take as much as 650,000 bpd of Kurdish oil for its domestic refineries and for exports.

The pipeline would replace existing export routes for crude from northern Iraq via Turkey and the Mediterranean and would be a blow to Ankara’s hopes of becoming an energy hub for Europe.

It would also be evidence of a U.S. failure to prevent a rapprochement between its ally Iraq and one of its biggest political foes, Iran, which is rapidly regaining influence in the Middle East.

That is in part due to general Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Quds force, the international branch of the Revolutionary Guards, which is also taking a keen interest in Iran’s oil business in Iraq.

Soleimani visited Iraqi Kurdistan in September to warn the region against holding an independence vote. He was also involved in the Iraqi army’s recapture of Kirkuk.

“In Iraq, Iranian forces are working to sow discord as we recently saw in Kirkuk, where the presence of Quds force commander, Qassem Soleimani, exacerbated tensions among the Kurds and the government in Baghdad,” U.S. Senator John McCain said in Washington last week.

KURDISH DIVISION

“The Kurdish dream of being a big oil exporter is in tatters,” said a source close to the government in Erbil, who predicted that “Iran will be king of the game”.

The Kurds’ bid for independence angered Turkey and Iran, which both have large Kurdish populations and condemned the referendum as destabilizing the region. The United States also called on Kurdistan to scrap the vote.

But it was probably internal Kurdish divisions which doomed the referendum to failure, local political sources believe. Oil was at the heart of this dispute.

The Kirkuk fields were controlled by Iraq’s state oil firm SOMO before being taken over by Kurdish forces in 2014, when the Iraqi army retreated in the face of attacks by Islamic state.

The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan party (PUK), in Sulaimaniya, then accused the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) party of then President Massoud Barzani, based in the capital Erbil, of not sharing the oil wealth. The PUK wanted to export oil from Kirkuk to Iran.

“We tried to make Barzani accept joint management between Erbil and Sulaimaniya over the fields but he strongly opposed it,” said Sherzad Yaba, a political adviser close to the PUK.

“To put an end to the illegitimate control of the KDP over Kirkuk oil, senior members from the PUK contacted both Baghdad and Tehran and encouraged the Iranians to build a pipeline to export Kirkuk crude through Bandar Abbas port,” said Yaba.

The project lay dormant even though Iraqi oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi and his Iranian counterpart Bijal Zanganeh signed a memorandum on the project in February.

After the referendum, the KDP accused the PUK of striking a deal with Iran to withdraw from Kirkuk, which the PUK denies.

The recapture of Kirkuk was coordinated with Soleimani and left Iraqi government troops in control of half of all Kurdish oil output.

As Kurdish engineers fled the fields, output from Kirkuk was suspended and has remained shut for the past five weeks as Baghdad and Erbil argue over the revenue split.

With output of over 300,000 bpd suspended since mid-October, losses are approaching $1 billion, according to Kurdish industry sources.

To stop the losses, Iraq and the PUK resumed talks with Iran, according to Iraqi and Kurdish officials.

Officials from Iraq’s and Iran’s state oil firms, SOMO and NICO, met last month to iron out details of oil sales to the Kermanshah refinery, the acting chief of SOMO, Alaa al-Yasiri, said.

He also said active discussions were taking place about the pipeline project.

THE GUARDS RISING

Even though discussions between Baghdad and Tehran have been conducted between oil ministry officials and the Chamber of Commerce, the Revolutionary Guards are poised to step in.

“Any oil transaction between Iran and Iraq should be approved by the Revolutionary Guards, not the oil ministry.” said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in the energy equipment business in the Middle East.

Those dealings are overseen by the desk responsible for Iran’s investments in Iraq at the president’s office and are run by the Revolutionary Guards.

The pipeline project will be the Revolutionary Guards’ reward to the Kurds for helping with the recapture of Kirkuk, said Tabatabaei.",Oil seen as real prize of Iran's Kurdish adventure,https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-iraq-oil/insight-oil-seen-as-real-prize-of-irans-kurdish-adventure-idINKBN1DE1UT?il=0

Market stability is politically sensitive in South Africa because ratings agencies downgraded the country’s debt in April and S&P Global and Moody’s have warned that pressure on bank independence could spark a deeper cut.

Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane in June proposed changing the bank’s mandate to focus on promoting growth rather than currency and price stability.

The proposal sparked a plunge in the rand and attracted criticism from Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba. It was quashed by Pretoria High Court, which said the proposal lacked merit and was ill-considered because the bank’s mandate is fixed in the constitution.

The court then invited Mkhwebane, who is employed to ensure proper conduct in public office, to respond to its ruling and the hearing was expected to start on Dec. 5.

Mkhwebane requested to file her answering affidavit in Jan. 2018. In an affidavit last week, she said this would allow her new lawyers to acquaint themselves with the case since her previous lawyers withdrew in late September.

But in an affidavit the central bank said a postponement would adversely impact financial stability given the concerns of ratings agencies about bank independence.

“Ratings agencies regard the role of the Reserve Bank and its stability as a key indicator of stability in the market. The attack on the Reserve Bank in the report creates uncertainty,” the bank’s lawyers said, adding that Mkhwebane’s reason for a postponement was neither “candid nor adequate”.

While overseas at a leaders conference, Trump tweeted some tax bill suggestions early on Monday that were starkly different from the two Republican plans being considered in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.

He called on lawmakers to add a highly risky provision to their tax effort: repealing the individual mandate included in the 2010 Obamacare health insurance law that requires Americans to have health coverage or pay a tax to Washington.

Neither of the two Republican plans includes such a politically divisive measure. Efforts by Republicans to dismantle Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, collapsed dramatically months ago.

Trump has pushed hard for adding the mandate repeal to the tax-cut package. He tweeted the same suggestion on Nov. 3 just before he departed for his multi-nation Asian tour.

In his latest tweet, he also urged slashing the top tax rate for high earners to 35 percent from 39.6 percent, despite criticism from Democrats that the Republican tax bills are deficit-expanding giveaways to the rich and corporations.

The House retains the existing top tax rate in its bill, while the Senate proposes cutting it slightly to 38.5 percent.

Trump is set to return to Washington on Tuesday. A White House aide confirmed that the president would speak to House Republicans on Thursday ahead of their expected tax bill vote.

“I am proud of the Rep. House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.} We’re getting close!” Trump wrote in his Monday Twitter post.

“Now, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?” he added.

CLOCK IS TICKING

Since taking office in January, Trump has not scored a major legislative accomplishment, while frequently shifting positions and confusing lawmakers on Capitol Hill on various issues.

Many Republicans view a win on overhauling the tax code as crucial to avoiding having to go to the voters in 2018’s congressional elections with no achievements to show for a year in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress.

The clock is ticking for them. The House is expected to vote soon, perhaps on Thursday, on a tax bill approved last week at the committee level. House tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady said he was confident Republicans had the votes for passage.

Brady told reporters in a Capitol hallway that including a repeal of the Obamacare individual healthcare mandate in the tax bill “remains under consideration.”

The Senate tax committee will debate its tax plan all week before heading home for the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday.

When both chambers return near the end of November, they will have only 12 legislative days before the end of 2017.

In that time span, Republicans hope to iron out differences between the two tax plans over the deduction for state and local taxes, the timing of a corporate tax rate cut and the future of the estate tax on inheritances.

Each of the Republican tax plans would add about $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, another issue causing dissension among Republicans.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said he hoped to have a tax bill ready in the week after Thanksgiving. Between now and then, an army of lobbyists will be pressuring lawmakers to protect favored special-interest tax breaks.

On Dec. 8, a three-month extension of the spending authority for the federal government expires, requiring congressional action that could divert lawmakers from the tax overhaul.

A lengthy amendment introduced on Monday to the Senate tax plan by Republican Orrin Hatch, chairman of the tax panel, would remove a provision that lets working Americans over 50 make tax-free catch-up contributions to their retirement plans.

Democrats have kept up steady criticism of the Republican tax bills and how they were drafted. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate measure was developed in secret by a small group that held no public hearings and ignored Democrats.

“And the reason for such reckless haste is all too obvious: the product is a wretched one ... it is focused on the wealthy to the exclusion of the middle class,” he said in a statement.","Risks ahead for U.S. tax push as disputes linger, Trump returns",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/risks-ahead-for-u-s-tax-push-as-disputes-linger-trump-returns-idUSKBN1DD245?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

In its monthly oil market report, the Paris-based IEA cut its oil demand forecast by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) for this year and next, to an estimated 1.5 million bpd in 2017 and 1.3 million bpd in 2018.

Geopolitical tension in the Middle East and intermittent supply outages in the likes of Nigeria and Iraq have pushed oil above $60 a barrel for the first time since 2015, while global inventories have fallen, prompting many market watchers to raise their price forecasts.

“Does it mean the market has found a ‘new normal’ where the accepted floor might have moved from $50/bbl to $60/bbl? This might be a tempting view, assuming supply disturbances will continue and tensions in the Middle East will not ease,” the IEA said.

“However, if these problems do prove to be temporary, a fresh look at the fundamentals confirms the view we expressed last month that the market balance in 2018 does not look as tight as some would like, and there is not in fact a ‘new normal’.”

The IEA noted that output by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was down by 830,000 bpd year-on-year in October, although demand for the group’s crude is expected to fall to 32.6 million bpd in the fourth quarter of this year and to 32.0 million bpd in the first quarter of 2018.

Compliance by the group with its joint 1.8-million-bpd output cut with 10 partners was 96 percent in October, the highest since the supply-reduction deal took effect in January.

The biggest threat to market balances, aside from a tempering in demand, is the growth in supply from non-OPEC nations.

“Even after some modest reductions to growth, non-OPEC production will follow this year’s 700,000-bpd growth with 1.4 million bpd of additional production in 2018 and next year’s demand growth will struggle to match this,” the IEA said.

“This is why, absent any geopolitical premium, we may not have seen a ‘new normal’ for oil prices.”

Oil inventories in the world’s richest nations fell by 40 million barrels in September, breaking below 3.0 billion barrels for the first time in two years, driven in part by Hurricane Harvey, which shuttered much U.S. refining capacity in August.

“Using a scenario whereby current levels of OPEC production are maintained, the oil market faces a difficult challenge in 1Q18 with supply expected to exceed demand by 600,000 bpd followed by another, smaller, surplus of 200,000 bpd in 2Q18,” the agency said.

Global oil demand growth is likely to have slowed to 1.3 million bpd in the third quarter of this year, in part because of the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma in August and September on U.S. consumption.

Growth is expected to accelerate to 1.4 million bpd in the last three months of this year, even though mild temperatures and rising prices will restrain demand, the IEA said.","Warmer weather, rising non-OPEC output threaten oil market balance",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-iea/warmer-weather-rising-non-opec-output-threaten-oil-market-balance-idUSKBN1DE10F

More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since late August, driven out by a counter-insurgency clearance operation of Myanmar forces in Rakhine. A top U.N. official has called the operation a textbook case of “ethnic cleansing”.

Attending an East Asia summit in Manila on Tuesday, Tillerson met Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose less than two-year-old civilian administration shares power with the military and has no control over its generals.

He will meet Suu Kyi again in the Myanmar capital of Naypyitaw on Wednesday, and hold separate talks with the head of the armed forces, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.

Asked what approach Tillerson would take with Myanmar’s army chief, the State Department official told journalists in a briefing by teleconference that the emphasis would be on restoring peace in Rakhine.

“We are focusing on trying to stabilize areas in northern Rakhine so that people can return there, stopping the violence, making sure that the military would protect all populations in that area equally and that they conduct a credible investigation that leads to accountability for people who have perpetrated abuses,” said the official, who was with Tillerson in Manila and declined to be identified.

The official said the consequences for the country, also known as Burma, if it failed to respond to the crisis with accountability could be part of the conversation with the military leader.

“Burma made a lot of progress and we would not want to see that progress reversed,” the official added.

U.S. senators in Washington are pressing for economic sanctions and travel restrictions targeting the Myanmar military and its business interests.

“The secretary will reiterate support for Burma’s democratic transition and urge the Burmese government to protect the local population and allow unhindered humanitarian and media access, (and) support for a credible investigation of abuses,” the official added.

Accusations of organized mass rape and other crimes against humanity were leveled at the Myanmar military on Sunday by another senior U.N. official who had toured camps in Bangladesh where Rohingya refugees have taken shelter.

‘WHITEWASH’

Pramila Patten, special representative of the U.N. secretary-general on sexual violence in conflict, said she would raise accusations against the Myanmar military with the International Criminal Court in the Hague.

The military, known as the Tatmadaw, has consistently protested its innocence, and on Monday it posted the findings of an internal investigation on the Facebook page of Min Aung Hlaing.

It said it had found no instances where its soldiers had shot and killed Rohingya villagers, raped women or tortured prisoners. It denied that security forces had torched Rohingya villages or used “excessive force”.

The military said that, while 376 “terrorists” were killed, there were no deaths of innocent people.

Human rights groups poured scorn on the military’s investigation, branding it a “whitewash” and calling for U.N. and independent investigators to be allowed into Myanmar.

“The Burmese military’s absurd effort to absolve itself of mass atrocities underscores why an independent international investigation is needed to establish the facts and identify those responsible,” Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.

Amnesty International also dismissed the military’s internal investigation. “There is overwhelming evidence that the military has murdered and raped Rohingya and burned their villages to the ground,” the London-based rights group said.

The government in mostly Buddhist Myanmar regards the Muslim Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

And Suu Kyi’s failure to speak out strongly over their plight has widely damaged the Nobel Peace Prize winner’s international reputation as a stateswoman.

Many diplomats, however, believe Myanmar’s fragile transition to democracy after 49 years of military rule would be jeopardized if she publicly criticized the armed forces.

“Both parts of the government will have to work together in order to solve this problem...Trying to get two of them to work together, to try to solve the problem, is certainly going to be very important,” the U.S. official said.

The U.S. official said Suu Kyi had been forthcoming in her talks with Tillerson and others during the past few days about the steps that needed to be taken to improve the situation, including plans for the voluntary repatriation of Rohingya.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were among those she met in Manila to discuss the Rohingya crisis.

“This is a tremendous concern to Canada and to many, many countries around the world,” Trudeau told a news conference.

Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged up to 117 billion yen ($1 billion) of development aid to Myanmar in his meeting with Suu Kyi.

While world leaders wrung their hands, thousands of Rohingya remained stranded in Myanmar, on beaches around the mouth of the Naf river, hoping to find a boat to make the short, sometimes perilous crossing to Bangladesh.

“They’re still coming, risking their lives, driven by fears of starvation and violence,” Shariful Azam, a police official in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar, a narrow spit of land where the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis is unfolding.

Calls for secession have become increasingly loud in the last few months in parts of the southeast, where the president is deeply unpopular, prompting Buhari to say he will not allow Nigeria to be divided by separatist groups.

A million people died in a 1967-70 civil war over the short-lived Republic of Biafra. Buhari, a 74-year-old former military ruler who took office in May 2015, fought in the war as a young soldier on the government side.

The spokesman, Garba Shehu, said the president would, as part of his trip, visit the campaign run by his All Progressive Congress party in the state of Anambra ahead of gubernatorial elections in the next few days.

“Mr President will be visiting two southeast states of Ebonyi and Anambra,” said Shehu. He said Buhari would leave the capital, Abuja, on Tuesday morning and return the following day.

Tensions in the region rose following the release on bail of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the region’s best known secessionist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).

The government designated the group as a terrorist organization in September, and deployed troops to the region to crack down on secessionists.

Kanu, who was on bail after being charged with treason, has not been seen since Sept. 14, when IPOB says his home was raided by soldiers. The military has denied raiding Kanu’s home and has said it is not holding him.

“We are yet to know our leader’s whereabouts or that of his parents. (Buhari) is not the type of person any governor should be welcoming to their land,” said an IPOB spokesman in a statement that urged the president to “stay away”.

A Nigerian minister in September said secessionists in the southeast were sponsored by the government’s political opponents.

The government has repeatedly rejected the accusation that Buhari, a Muslim northerner, is opposed to the development of the mostly Christian southeast, where people are mainly from the Igbo ethnic group.

FILE PHOTO: A Tesco supermarket is seen, in west London on September 30, 2008. . REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had conducted an in-depth review and provisionally concluded that Tesco’s purchase of Booker does not raise competition concerns.

Tesco’s move on Booker in January sparked further consolidation in Britain’s 185 billion pound grocery market as supermarkets seek additional sources of growth.

Analysts expect more M&A activity as supermarkets seek to utilize excess capacity within their supply chains.

“The wholesale trade in particular will be wondering why on earth it ever bothered engaging at all with the CMA, an organization that seemingly lives in a different universe,” said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.

“If Tesco and Booker can merge with unconditional approval, then the scope for further large-scale consolidation cannot be ruled out,” he said.

The provisional clearance will come as a big relief to Tesco. Most analysts had expected it would have to agree to store divestments or restrictions on operations to gain clearance.

Tesco and Booker have argued their deal will enhance competition in Britain and promote consumer interests. However, rival wholesalers, including Bestway, Spar, Bidfood and Sugro, reject that and have called for the deal to be blocked.

UNSHAKEABLE GRIP

They believe if the deal proceeds Tesco will have an unshakeable grip on the procurement of all grocery categories in Britain and that suppliers will find it even harder to resist Tesco’s demands.

Both Tesco and Booker, the country’s biggest grocery wholesaler, welcomed the CMA announcement. Tesco said it expected to complete the deal, which also requires shareholder approvals, in early 2018.

Shares in Tesco and Booker were both up 7 percent at 1422 GMT.

Rival grocers declined to comment on the record. But a source at one grocer described the CMA’s decision as “ridiculous”.

Though it is unusual for provisional findings to be reversed, rival wholesale and retail groups do have the chance to present further evidence and comment before the CMA’s final ruling due in December.

In consolidation moves already prompted by the deal, Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L), Britain’s No. 2 supermarket group, considered a bid for the Nisa convenience chain before the Co-operative Group (42TE.L) secured a 138 million pound deal. Morrisons (MRW.L), the No. 4, has signed a wholesale supply deal with the McColl’s (MCLSM.L) chain.

Some Tesco shareholders have criticized the Booker bid, saying Chief Executive Dave Lewis is overpaying and that it will distract from the company’s turnaround plan.

CALLS FOR HIGHER PRICE?

The approval could spur calls from Booker shareholders for Tesco to raise its bid.

One top 20 Booker investor said he believed Tesco should pay more “as Booker is Tesco’s last hope”. He said the investor would reiterate to Booker that it could extract a higher price.

Bernstein analysts said they expect some uncertainty to remain, with the focus shifting to whether investors will approve the deal.

Their analysis indicates that Tesco will achieve the required 50 percent shareholder approval and that the focus will be on Booker, where the threshold is 75 percent.

“With a higher shareholder hurdle and the Tesco share price below the level when the bid was made, Booker shareholders may argue for a higher share price,” the broker’s analysts said.

The Booker deal is Lewis’s boldest move yet, giving Tesco access to the faster growing “out of home” food market.

For each Booker share, Tesco is offering 0.861 new Tesco shares and 42.6 pence in cash.

The CMA said it found that Tesco as a retailer and Booker as a wholesaler supplying caterers and independent retailers Premier, Londis, Budgens and Family Shopper do not compete head-to-head in most of their activities.

In particular, it found that Tesco does not supply the catering sector that accounts for more than 30 percent of Booker’s sales.

“Our investigation has found that existing competition is sufficiently strong in both the wholesale and retail grocery sectors to ensure that the merger between Tesco and Booker will not lead to higher prices or a reduced service for supermarket and convenience shoppers,” said Simon Polito, chair of the CMA’s inquiry group.

Losing the world’s biggest economy seriously reduces the overall impact of the trade pact, which Donald Trump jettisoned at the start of his presidency. For Japan, Australia, Canada and others, however, it is valuable anyway, and over time the framework could expand. Breakingviews looks at how and why TPP stuck around.

Delegates participate in the opening session of the Trans Pacific Partnership senior leaders meeting in Sydney, Australia August 28, 2017. REUTERS/Jason Reed - RC1B9B277800

Why is TPP still going?

For both political and economic reasons. The deal helps the group’s members reaffirm their commitment to free trade, even if the traditional champion of globalisation has radically changed its tune. TPP should also shore up the negotiating positions of the 11 countries involved when the Trump administration pushes for one-on-one deals aimed largely at cutting trade surpluses.

Without the United States, the benefits obviously will be reduced, but should nevertheless be material. And the participants have already laid much of the groundwork on domestic reforms, taking on powerful groups such as farmers. So they may as well reap the benefits. A final deal is not yet completed, but could be just months away, assuming the remaining objections of Ottawa and others can be smoothed over.

How has it changed?

Not all that much. The name is clunkier: it’s now officially the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. And without the United States, it now covers about 14 percent of the world by GDP, namely Brunei, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam in Asia; Australia and New Zealand in Oceania; and Canada, Chile, Mexico and Peru in the Americas.

Some clauses of the original deal have been set aside, due to opposition from Canada and others. Many of these relate to intellectual-property provisions. For example, the Asian Trade Centre notes that copyright will no longer be extended to 70 from 50 years. But the two core premises – slashing tariffs while enforcing high standards in areas like labour and the environment – are intact.

What are the economic benefits?

Significant, but smaller than they originally were. Estimates published in October by the Peterson Institute for International Economics suggested a so-called “TPP11” would lift global real income by 0.1 percent, or $147 billion in 2015 dollars, by 2030. That compares to the original $492 billion increase. The growth in exports would be 0.8 percent, down from the previous 3.1 percent.

Who are the biggest winners?

Uncle Sam’s closest neighbours. A separate study by the Canada West Foundation, a think tank in Calgary, suggests compared to the original deal, the biggest beneficiaries would be the four signatories in the Americas. This quartet keeps its existing access to U.S. markets and makes inroads across the Pacific, without having to share these benefits with U.S. companies.

Conversely, Japan and Mexico, who stood to benefit the most in America, will see the biggest reduction in gains. Meanwhile, the Peterson Institute says Washington’s absence would see it move from a $131 billion gain to a $2 billion loss of income in 2030, although this does not factor in the benefits from aggressively renegotiating elsewhere.

What does it mean politically?

It signals a shift in the balance of power. In resurrecting TPP, other governments, most notably Japan and Australia, are partly assuming the leadership role usually played by the United States in multilateral dealmaking. They are also stepping up when many assumed that China would naturally fill the vacuum left by the United States on regional diplomacy and trade.

It’s not exactly a rebuke to China, though. Any agreement would be a complement, rather than a rival, to the Beijing-endorsed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. That pact covers more countries but demands less of its members. It focuses on lowering tariffs, rather than also standardising rules in areas such as the digital economy, investment and services.

What could become of the TPP from here?

It could get bigger and more useful. Part of TPP’s appeal is that it is not a closed club, but one that others can apply to join. For example, Peterson Institute researchers say it could grow to encompass Indonesia, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand, all of whom have expressed interest. That “TPP16” would generate $449 billion of global income gains by 2030, closer to the sum envisioned when the United States was involved.

Some proponents are also hoping the United States will have a change of heart, even though the country’s 2016 election revealed suspicion about TPP from both political parties. Australia, for one, has stressed it is important to leave the door open to Washington. If it eventually returns, some suspended provisions on IP and other matters, many of which were pushed by U.S. negotiators, could be reinstated.

>> Reviving the beleaguered coal industry after years of plant closures and layoffs was one of Donald Trump's signature campaign promises, but a year after he was elected coal's long term prospects are is bleak as ever. Trump has rolled back Obama era environmental policies, to give coal a boost.

But a Reuters review of mining data shows only modest gains in jobs and production, most because of a temporary uptake in foreign demand not Trump's u-turn on policy. Tim Gardener is reporting the story.>> Even if Trump rolls back all the policies, the fact is low natural gas prices are more attractive for the utilities that are generating the power.

We talked to several of the major utilities, and they're investing billions of dollars in natural gas, and wind, and solar. But they're not building any new Coal plants. There are a few bright spots. Jobs in coal mining have risen about 4% this year. But overriding all these statistics, the utilities, the power utilities, are already saying, that they're gonna shut a whole bunch of power plants until 2025.

There's gonna be a drop of one-third of coal fired capacity, that doesn't spell good news for the industry.>> By the time Trump took office this year, the coal industry had already lost almost half its workforce in less than a decade.

“Disaster”, “nightmare”, “humiliation”, were just a few of the words splashed across the front pages of Italy’s newspapers to describe the shock of the team’s elimination at the hands of a little-fancied Sweden on Monday.

“Apocalypse Azzurra,” said the headline of La Stampa newspaper, referring to the unofficial name of the team whose bright blue jerseys reflect the azure of the Mediterranean Sea.

Italy have played in the last 14 World Cup finals, winning two of them. In all, they have triumphed four times, a tally only exceeded by Brazil, who have won five times. Italy are the only former champions not to make it to next year’s finals.

“This is disgusting, the World Cup can’t exist without Italy. It just can’t exist,” said Francesco Macella, a fan who was in Milan’s San Siro stadium to watch as Italy failed to overcome Sweden in a tense 0-0 draw in the second leg of their European playoff, having lost the first leg 1-0 in Stockholm.

Every four years, Italy has come together over the World Cup, putting aside its historic city-state rivalries to become a united nation for a brief moment in time, cheering on all the players regardless if they came from Milan, Rome or Naples.

“We have failed and at a social level this could have been so important,” said Italy’s storied goalkeeper, Gigi Buffon, in a tearful interview minutes after the final whistle on Monday, recognising the broader significance of the national team.

POLITICAL FALLOUT

While newspapers laid the blame squarely on team coach Gian Piero Ventura and soccer federation chief Carlo Tavecchio, some fans thought the failure reflected wider problems.

“This match mirrors our country which is falling apart,” said a disappointed Stefano Martufello as he left the San Siro.

Italy is slowly recovering from a prolonged recession, but most people say they see no sign of the pick-up, with wages stagnant and unemployment stuck above 11 percent. On the political front, opinion polls predict that parliamentary elections due by next May will result in a deadlock.

Governments normally hope that the feel-good factor from sporting triumphs feeds over into the political sphere.

In the wake of Monday’s downfall, the normally busy Twitter feeds of ruling politicians were quiet, while some opposition leaders sought to score quick points.

“There are too many foreigners on (our) pitches, from youth teams to Serie A and this is the result,” said Matteo Salvini, head of the anti-immigrant Northern League, echoing criticism in far-right quarters over the space given in sport to outsiders.

“STOPTHEINVASION. Give more room to Italian lads,” he wrote, drawing hundreds of largely negative comments on his Twitter feed.

Italy last won the World Cup in 2006, but exited at the group stage in 2010 and 2014 after lacklustre displays. This latest setback showed how far the team have drifted from their peak, belying the widespread expectation that they would have eased past Sweden.

“For years I’ve had this feeling that Italian football is a little like Italy itself, which lives a lot in the past when the reality is that it finds itself dealing with things that are quite intense, even shocking,” said Matteo Maragnano, peeling oranges in a cafe near Milan’s gothic cathedral.

Grasping for silver linings, newspaper commentators recognised that the Italian team was weak and would not have got very far in Russia.

(Reuters) - Connecticut’s highest court is set to hear arguments on Tuesday in a closely watched case brought by the families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting against the maker of the assault rifle used by the killer.

The families of nine of the victims and one survivor have said manufacturer Remington Arms Company Inc [REARM.UL], along with a gun wholesaler and local retailer, should be held responsible for the carnage at the Newtown, Connecticut, school because they marketed the weapon based on its militaristic appeal.

It is a somewhat novel legal argument the families hope will help them overcome a federal law enacted by U.S. Congress in 2005 to shield gun manufacturers from liability for how their products are used.

Remington did not respond to requests for comment. In court filings, the company has said the families’ claims, first filed in 2014, are barred by the 2005 law.

A lower court judge agreed with the gun maker and dismissed the families’ lawsuit in 2016. But the Connecticut Supreme Court agreed to hear the case a week after the families filed their first appeal.

Adam Lanza, 20, used a Remington AR-15 Bushmaster rifle, a semi-automatic civilian version of the U.S. military’s M-16, to kill 20 schoolchildren between the ages of 6 and 7, as well as six adult staff members.

The families claim Remington and the other defendants “extolled the militaristic and assaultive qualities” of the AR-15, advertising the rifle as “mission-adaptable” and “the ultimate combat weapons system” in a deliberate pitch to a demographic of young men fascinated by the military.

The families said Lanza was part of that demographic and cited media reports saying he previously expressed a desire to join the army. The rifle was bought by Lanza’s mother, whom he also killed, as a gift for him or for the two of them to share, the lawsuit claims.

The families’ argument is based on the legal doctrine of negligent entrustment, in which a product is carelessly sold or given to a person at high risk of using it in a harmful way. Negligent entrustment is specifically excepted from the 2005 gun maker shield laws.

The argument has historically been used where someone lends a car to a high-risk driver who goes on to cause an accident. It has met with some success in lawsuits against gun shop owners, but legal experts said it has never been used before to target a manufacturer.

David Studdert, a Stanford law professor, said he thought it was a tough argument for the families to make because negligent entrustment has traditionally involved someone having direct knowledge that another person poses a risk.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

>> Levels of lead.>> In the US war on lead poisoning, New York City has maintained one of the best reputations for aggressive lead contamination prevention.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

The booing of the anthem, “The March of the Volunteers”, has become a fixture at football matches in the Chinese-ruled territory, with some parallels to protests in the United States where American football players have knelt during the national anthem, an act denounced by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Now the former British colony is preparing to introduce a law that will penalize people who boo the anthem, a measure that critics say undermines the city’s autonomy and freedoms guaranteed when it returned to China 20 years ago.

Details of the law, including jail terms and the scope of enforcement, have yet to be set. China extended the law to cover Hong Kong earlier this month.

Chinese President Xi Jinping in recent years has ushered in new legislation aimed at securing the country from threats both within and outside its borders, besides presiding over a sweeping crackdown on dissent and free speech.

Chinese officials have said the anthem law is necessary to safeguard the authority of the state.

Several hundred fans greeted the anthem before the match against Lebanon with jeers and boos, with some unfurling banners that said “Die for Hong Kong”, while others yelled “We are Hong Kong” in English, rather than the local Cantonese dialect.

Some security guards signalled to the supporters to behave.

“I‘m not scared even if it becomes law ... I will go to the toilet instead of sitting when the national anthem is on,” Hong Kong supporter Bendter Chong said when asked if he would continue to jeer the anthem when the law is enacted.

Tensions between Hong Kong and mainland China have increased in recent years amid calls for greater democracy. Mass street protests in 2014 paralysed parts of the city although they failed to secure concessions on electoral reform from Beijing.

Most of the jeering was from youths, underscoring how the younger generation has become increasingly disaffected by political tension and economic hardship.

Security was tight at the Hong Kong Stadium, the venue for the city’s annual Rugby Sevens tournament, where about 10,000 gathered for the match. The stadium has capacity for 40,000.

The game ended Lebanon 1, Hong Kong 0.

“I’m not sure about the law, but for sure people will be more behaved,” said Hong Kong supporter Fai Chan. “But it is still a matter of whether it is worth our respect.”

Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” arrangement that guarantees a high degree of autonomy, including an independent judiciary and freedom of expression.

In 2015, Hong Kong football fans booed the Chinese anthem during a World Cup qualifier, prompting a fine for the Hong Kong Football Association from world body FIFA.

The association was warned by the Asian Football Confederation recently over the conduct of fans and said “a repeat violation may result in more severe punishment”.",Hong Kong soccer fans defy Beijing by booing Chinese national anthem,https://in.reuters.com/article/china-hongkong-anthem/hong-kong-soccer-fans-defy-beijing-by-booing-chinese-national-anthem-idINKBN1DE1QB

Reportedly paying about a quarter of a billion dollars for what may be its biggest and most expensive move yet.

To draw viewers and shoppers to its Amazon Prime membership platform. Reuters correspondent, Jeffrey Dastin.>> Video has become one of Amazon's biggest investments, at some $4.5 billion in 2017. And its spending is just going to increase. The company is getting into bidding wars with rivals Netflix and Hulu over top content, and as it shifts from comedies to dramas it can pay at least a 100 million or more for each season.

But Amazon this is all worth it. When people sign up for Prime to watch these videos, they end up spending more on the retail side as well.>> The price tag far eclipsing what CEO Jeff Bezos has spent on other original series, such as Transparent and Red Oaks.

And while those shows have found their critical niche, J.R.R Tolkien's epic fantasy brings mass appeal, much like HBO's Game of Thrones. Amazon's multi-season series will explore Middle Earth with new story lines that precede the trilogy's first installment, The Fellowship of the Ring.

Survivors, many left homeless by the 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck villages and towns in a mountainous area bordering Iraq, battled overnight temperatures just above freezing and faced another bleak day on Tuesday in need of food and water.

The death toll of 530, reported by state news agency IRNA, made it Iran’s deadliest earthquake in more than a decade. Thousands of people were injured and 30,000 homes damaged. Two whole villages were destroyed.

The quake struck on the Iran-Iraq border, causing most of its damage in Iran despite an epicenter on the Iraq side of the frontier. Iraqi officials said seven people were killed and 325 injured in Iraq, all in the northern Kurdish provinces.

Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani arrived in the morning in the stricken area in Kermanshah province and promised that the government would “use all its power to resolve the problems in the shortest time”.

Thousands of people huddled in makeshift camps while many others chose to spend a second night in the open, despite low temperatures, because they feared more tremors after some 193 aftershocks, state television said.

A homeless young woman in Sarpol-e Zahab, one of the hardest-hit towns, told state TV that her family was exposed to the night cold because of lack of tents.

“We need help. We need everything. The authorities should speed up their help,” she said.

Television showed rescue workers combing through the rubble of dozens of villages immediately after the quake. But by Tuesday morning Iranian officials said there was no longer any likelihood of finding survivors and called the rescue off.

“The rescue operations in Kermanshah province have ended,” Pir-Hossein Kolivand, head of Iran’s Emergency Medical Services, said.

Iran’s top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, offered his condolences on Monday to the victims and called on government agencies to do all they could to help.

The Iranian army, the elite Revolutionary Guards and forces of its affiliated Basij militia were dispatched to affected areas on Sunday night.

BITTER COLD

Hospitals in nearby provinces took in many of the injured, state television said, airing footage of survivors waiting to be treated. Hundreds of critically injured were dispatched to hospitals in Tehran.

Iran’s Red Crescent said emergency shelter had been provided for thousands of homeless people, but a lack of water and electricity as well as blocked roads in some areas hindered aid supply efforts.

“People in some villages are still in dire need of food, water and shelter,” said the governor of Qasr-e Shirin county in Kermanshah province, Faramarz Akbari.

The mayor of Ezgeleh, a city in Kermanshah, said 80 percent of its buildings had collapsed. Survivors desperately needed tents with elderly people and babies as young as one-year-old sleeping in the cold for two straight nights.

In an interview with state television, Nazar Barani asked people to send fuel, milk, water and food as emergency services were too slow and providing limited provisions.

“People are hungry and thirsty,” a local man told ISNA news agency. “There is no electricity. Last night I cried when I saw children with no food or shelter.”

Houses in Iranian villages are often made of concrete blocks or mudbrick that can crumble and collapse in a strong quake. Some people are angry that among the collapsed buildings were homes that the government has built in recent years under an affordable housing program.

Photographs posted on Iranian news websites showed rescue workers digging people out of collapsed buildings, cars smashed beneath rubble and rescue dogs trying to find signs of life under the twisted ruins.

“More people will die because of cold. My family lives in a village near Sarpol-e Zahab. I cannot even go there. I don’t know whether they are dead or alive,” Rojan Meshkat, 38, in the Kurdish city of Sanandaj told Reuters by telephone.

Iran is crisscrossed by major fault lines and has suffered several devastating earthquakes in recent years, including a 6.6 magnitude quake in 2003 that reduced the historic southeastern city of Bam to dust and killed some 31,000 people.","Iran ends quake rescue operations, hungry survivors battle cold",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1DC0WM

He says he is “looking for the soul of the company again.” Now, some 100 days into the job, Flannery has categorically exorcised the ghosts of false expectations past by halving its dividend, reducing earnings guidance and questioning entire swaths of the company’s portfolio of industrial assets. Next up is GE’s board of directors.

The ticker symbol for General Electric is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange July 20, 2015. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

That Flannery is asking “why do we exist?” is not entirely surprising. He is, after all, a man with many years ahead of him to make some hard decisions, fundamentally reshape the company Thomas Edison founded and rebase its share price for the hard restructuring ahead. By contrast, his predecessor Jeff “Two Jets” Immelt was fighting for time, struggling to justify what was already done and had been previously promised during his 16 years running the company.

But the about-face from Immelt to Flannery has outdone the usual kitchen-sinking that accompanies the passing from one chief executive to the next. It’s certainly a stark contrast from Immelt’s own handover from Jack Welch in 2001. And that has raised a key question for GE shareholders: How did the board allow Immelt to continue for so long without intervention? If it was so obvious to Flannery and many investors that GE was overspending on dividends, flubbing on acquisitions and committing to too many second-rate businesses, what were GE’s 18 directors thinking?

Flannery has already clarified that GE’s board is oversized, under-engaged and badly in need of a house cleaning. So perhaps the most encouraging development to be found in Flannery’s 57-page slideshow on Monday is a plan to put just 12 directors up for a vote next year, including three new ones. That means it is parting company with half the current lineup. GE will also create a new “finance and capital allocation committee” with increased oversight of the company’s acquisition and buyback strategy.

The composition of the new board will include, among others, a representative of Trian Partners, the activist fund manager led by Nelson Peltz. But he can’t be the only director willing to question the strategy, dig through the numbers and, where needed, prod Flannery to shift gears. The era of the all-powerful GE boss, with two jets at his disposal in case one breaks down, is over. That, beyond any numerical pledges, should be the most important statement to emerge on this investor day.

Security was tight outside the courtroom, which has been center stage for Kenyan politics since it nullified the results of August’s presidential election. That decision led to the re-run election on Oct. 26.

The court has not convened since the day before last month’s election, when it had been due to deliberate on a last-minute request to delay the vote. But that hearing was canceled because not enough judges showed up to make a quorum.

The judges had demanded more security after the bodyguard of the deputy chief justice was shot the day before the hearing and said they would refuse to attend hearings without it, a judicial source said. The government turned them down, the source said [L8N1N64ON].

The chief justice later denied the Reuters report on the security issue and said the police had “enhanced” the judges’ security [L4N1N83RU].

All six judges expected to be present showed up for Tuesday’s meeting. The seven-member bench is still missing one of its judges, who fell ill during the hearings related to the August election and has since been receiving treatment.

The judges are expected to announce when proceedings will begin and whether it will hear all three petitions filed - one by a former lawmaker and the other two by civil society organizations.

Kenyatta came to power in 2013 and won a second and final term in August, defeating opposition leader Raila Odinga by 1.4 million votes.

Odinga did not contest the repeat vote on Oct. 26, saying it would be unfair because the election commission had failed to implement reforms. Kenyatta won with 98 percent of the vote, though opposition supporters staged a boycott and prevented polls from opening in the west of the country.

Two of the petitions filed with the court argue the poll’s outcome is void because the election board did not hold fresh nominations after the Aug. 8 poll was invalidated.

The third petition, filed by a civil society organization, is a case against the opposition. It seeks to hold them liable for losses incurred because of their demonstrations.

None of the petitions focus on whether the election board was adequately prepared to hold the repeat poll - a central reason cited by the opposition for boycotting the vote.

The week before the vote, the head of the commission said he could not guarantee the vote would be free and fair, citing interference from politicians and threats of violence against his colleagues.

The court has until Nov. 20 to rule on the petitions. If the election result is upheld, Kenyatta will be sworn in on Nov. 28.

Kenya is a regional hub for trade, diplomacy and security and its prolonged election season has disrupted its economy. Human rights groups say at least 66 people have died in bloodshed surrounding the two elections.

The Supreme Court was created by a 2010 constitution that followed a violent political crisis three years earlier.

Home Depot’s shares, already up 23 percent this year, were largely unchanged at $165.30 in premarket trading.

“Home Depot’s recent comparable store sales performance and improved sales and earnings guidance is a good indicator that the home improvement sector continues to paint a better outlook as it sidesteps broader retail woes,” said Moody’s Vice President Bill Fahy.

The U.S. housing market recovery has been supported by steadily rising wages and low unemployment rates but supply constraints have been pushing up prices, encouraging homeowners to remodel homes and boosting sales at home improvement retailers.

Shares in Ultra Electronics fell by almost a fifth on Monday as the UK defence contractor warned of tight UK spending. Mid-market groups might face foreign invasions of their own.

Investors in defence companies tend to profit from geopolitical tensions. The year since U.S. President Donald Trump’s election has been no different: the Thomson Reuters Global Aerospace and Defense Index is up by almost a third since the truculent tycoon won the White House. Giants like Boeing and Lockheed Martin can thank North Korean missile tests, expectations of a more muscular United States and rising defence budgets in the Middle East and Asia, which are increasing spending on planes, arms and other equipment at a compound annual rate of 8 percent and 11 percent, respectively, according to Bernstein analysts.

As Ultra’s disappointing 2017 forecasts show, Britain is the outlier. The 1 billion pound group blamed “mounting pressures in the funding of UK defence” for the Ministry of Defence cancelling or delaying programmes. Revenue will be 770 million pounds this year, the company said after markets closed on Friday, compared with previous consensus forecasts of about 810 million pounds.

British defence spending has shrunk to 1.9 percent of gross domestic product from around 2.5 percent in 2010-11, according to data provider Statista. With Brexit likely to hurt output and potentially blow a hole in the public finances, mid-sized UK groups like Ultra and Cobham are unlikely to get much of a boost. They’re also hit harder than bigger peers, as more revenue comes from discretionary spending rather than long-term contracts. Their shares are down 33 percent and 37 percent, respectively, over the past two years.

The decline may make Ultra attractive to potential larger acquirers, which could cut costs and gain greater control over supply chains. After Monday’s drop, a buyer would have to shell out around 1.5 billion pounds for Ultra, including debt and a 30 percent equity premium. If the new owner could increase 2018 operating profit by about a 10th, the acquisition could deliver a decent 8 percent return, according to a Breakingviews calculation.

Survivors, many left homeless by the 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck villages and towns in a mountainous area bordering Iraq, battled overnight temperatures just above freezing and faced another bleak day on Tuesday in need of food and water.

The death toll of 530, reported by state news agency IRNA, made it Iran’s deadliest earthquake in more than a decade. Thousands of people were injured and 30,000 homes damaged. Two whole villages were destroyed.

The quake struck on the Iran-Iraq border, causing most of its damage in Iran despite an epicenter on the Iraq side of the frontier. Iraqi officials said seven people were killed and 325 injured in Iraq, all in the northern Kurdish provinces.

Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani arrived in the morning in the stricken area in Kermanshah province and promised that the government would “use all its power to resolve the problems in the shortest time”.

Thousands of people huddled in makeshift camps while many others chose to spend a second night in the open, despite low temperatures, because they feared more tremors after some 193 aftershocks, state television said.

A homeless young woman in Sarpol-e Zahab, one of the hardest-hit towns, told state TV that her family was exposed to the night cold because of lack of tents.

“We need help. We need everything. The authorities should speed up their help,” she said.

Television showed rescue workers combing through the rubble of dozens of villages immediately after the quake. But by Tuesday morning Iranian officials said there was no longer any likelihood of finding survivors and called the rescue off.

“The rescue operations in Kermanshah province have ended,” Pir-Hossein Kolivand, head of Iran’s Emergency Medical Services, said.

Iran’s top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, offered his condolences on Monday to the victims and called on government agencies to do all they could to help.

The Iranian army, the elite Revolutionary Guards and forces of its affiliated Basij militia were dispatched to affected areas on Sunday night.

BITTER COLD

Hospitals in nearby provinces took in many of the injured, state television said, airing footage of survivors waiting to be treated. Hundreds of critically injured were dispatched to hospitals in Tehran.

Iran’s Red Crescent said emergency shelter had been provided for thousands of homeless people, but a lack of water and electricity as well as blocked roads in some areas hindered aid supply efforts.

“People in some villages are still in dire need of food, water and shelter,” said the governor of Qasr-e Shirin county in Kermanshah province, Faramarz Akbari.

The mayor of Ezgeleh, a city in Kermanshah, said 80 percent of its buildings had collapsed. Survivors desperately needed tents with elderly people and babies as young as one-year-old sleeping in the cold for two straight nights.

In an interview with state television, Nazar Barani asked people to send fuel, milk, water and food as emergency services were too slow and providing limited provisions.

“People are hungry and thirsty,” a local man told ISNA news agency. “There is no electricity. Last night I cried when I saw children with no food or shelter.”

Houses in Iranian villages are often made of concrete blocks or mudbrick that can crumble and collapse in a strong quake. Some people are angry that among the collapsed buildings were homes that the government has built in recent years under an affordable housing program.

Photographs posted on Iranian news websites showed rescue workers digging people out of collapsed buildings, cars smashed beneath rubble and rescue dogs trying to find signs of life under the twisted ruins.

“More people will die because of cold. My family lives in a village near Sarpol-e Zahab. I cannot even go there. I don’t know whether they are dead or alive,” Rojan Meshkat, 38, in the Kurdish city of Sanandaj told Reuters by telephone.

Iran is crisscrossed by major fault lines and has suffered several devastating earthquakes in recent years, including a 6.6 magnitude quake in 2003 that reduced the historic southeastern city of Bam to dust and killed some 31,000 people.","Iran ends quake rescue operations, hungry survivors battle cold",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-quake/iran-ends-quake-rescue-operations-hungry-survivors-battle-cold-idUSKBN1DD2SO

Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte set the tone of cordiality ahead of the two days of summit meetings he will host, suggesting that despite their differences over claims to the South China Sea, the leaders should not discuss the issue.

“We have to be friends, the other hotheads would like us to confront China and the rest of the world on so many issues,” Duterte said at a business conference, as planes carrying heads of state and government attending the summit landed in quick succession in Manila.

“The South China Sea is better left untouched, nobody can afford to go to war. It can ill-afford a violent confrontation.”

Hours earlier, during a bilateral visit to Vietnam, Trump offered to mediate in the dispute over the South China Sea, where four Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan contest China’s sweeping claims to the busy waterway.

All the claimants will be at the summit, except for Taiwan.

Trump will join leaders of Southeast and East Asian nations in Manila over the next two days, the last leg of a tour that has taken him to Japan, South Korea and China as well as Vietnam.

The sheer length of the trip - the longest to Asia by a U.S. president in more than a quarter century - may reassure some that, despite Trump’s “America First” policy, Washington remains committed to a region China sees as its strategic domain.

GLITZY DINNER

Leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Russia, Japan, Canada, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand arrived one by one for a glitzy gala dinner where they were entertained by singers and dancers.

Each of the men sported a cream-colored barong, a traditional Philippines shirt made of fiber from the pineapple plant, embroidered and worn untucked.

They were served a four-course Filipino-Asian fusion meal curate and prepared by Chef Jessie Sincioco, who also designed the menu for Pope Francis when he visited the Philippines in 2015.

Police used water canon to prevent hundreds of protesters reaching the U.S. embassy in Manila ahead of Trump’s arrival.

Carrying placards declaring “Dump Trump” and “Down with U.S. Imperialism”, the left-wing protesters were blocked by police in riot gear with shields and batons, and then showered with jets of water from a fire engine.

The United States and its former colony, the Philippines, have been strategic allies since World War Two.

Trump is expected to try during the summit to shore up relations, which have been strained by the mercurial Duterte’s notorious anti-U.S. sentiment and his enthusiasm for better ties with Russia and China.

Duterte - sometimes described as the ‘Trump of the East’ because of his brash style - said last week he would tell the U.S. president to “lay off” if he raised the issue of human rights when they met.

More than 3,900 Filipinos have been killed in what the police call self-defense in a war on drugs declared by Duterte. Critics say executions are taking place with no accountability, allegations the police reject.

But Trump, who has been criticized at home for neglecting rights issues in dealings abroad, praised Duterte in May for doing an “unbelievable job on the drug problem”.

“INDO-PACIFIC”

Trump’s tour comes against a background of tensions on the Korean peninsula following exchanges of war-like threats and insults between North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un and Trump over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile development program.

China has been urged by both South Korea and the United States to take a more active role in curbing North Korea’s nuclear and missile ambitions.

During his tour, Trump and his team have repeatedly used the term “Indo-Pacific” instead of “Asia-Pacific” for the region, which some see as an effort to depict it as more than China-dominated.

Pacific Rim nation leaders agreed in Vietnam on Saturday to address “unfair trade practices” and “market distorting subsidies”, a statement that bore the imprint of Trump’s efforts to reshape the global trade landscape.

The summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries in Vietnam put on show the contrasting vision of the “America First” policy with the traditional consensus favoring multinational deals that China now seeks to champion.

Manila hosted the APEC summit two years ago, and at that meeting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a Twitter poll with the hashtag #APEChottie that asked people to vote for the most attractive leader there. Journalists swarmed the youthful leader and screamed in excitement.

On his latest visit, Trudeau visited an outlet of Jollibee, a chain that has become a byword for Filipino fast food, chatting and posing for selfies, charming the people of Manila again.

Writing on Twitter, Hariri urged Lebanese to remain calm and said his family would stay in Saudi Arabia, calling it “their country”.

Hariri’s resignation while in Saudi Arabia pitched Lebanon into political crisis.

Top Lebanese government officials and senior politicians close to Hariri believe Saudi Arabia coerced him into quitting and has been holding him against his will ever since, though Hariri and Riyadh have denied this.

Hariri cited fear of assassination and accused Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world during his resignation speech.

Hariri gave his first public remarks on Sunday, saying in a televised interview in Riyadh he planned to return to Lebanon within days to affirm his resignation.

A Reuters witness saw two other tanks parked beside the main road from Harare to Chinhoyi, about 20 km (14 miles) from the city. One, which was pointed in the direction of the capital, had come off its tracks. Soldiers at the scene refused to talk to Reuters.

Earlier on Tuesday the youth wing of Zimbabwe’s ruling party accused the military chief of subverting the constitution for threatening to intervene after President Robert Mugabe plunged the country into crisis by sacking Mnangagwa last week.

Mnangagwa, 75, a long-serving veteran of Zimbabwe’s 1970s liberation wars, had been viewed as a likely successor to Mugabe before the president fired him on Nov. 6.

His downfall appeared to pave the way for Mugabe’s wife Grace to succeed the 93-year-old president, the only leader Zimbabwe has known in 37 years of independence.

In an unprecedented step, the head of the armed forces, Constantino Chiwenga, openly threatened to intervene in politics on Monday if the purge of war veterans did not stop.

“We must remind those behind the current treacherous shenanigans that, when it comes to matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in,” Chiwenga said in a statement read to reporters at a news conference packed with top brass on Monday.

Grace Mugabe, 52, has developed a strong following in the powerful youth wing of the ruling ZANU-PF party.

Just 36 hours earlier, the city had been filled with nearly as many rival activists − this time waving uni-starred flags, yelling “Viva la República Catalana!” to show their support for the Catalan Republic, the new, sovereign country theoretically created when Catalonia’s autonomous provincial government Friday controversially declared itself free of Spain.

In the time between the two marches, Spain’s conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had dismissed Catalonia’s independence declaration as “null and void”; fired the Catalonia cabinet; dissolved Catalonia’s parliament; called new elections, and announced the central government was stepping in to oversee the regional authorities, which until Friday had held substantial powers of self-rule.

Rajoy’s action, declared Catalonia Vice President Oriol Junqueras, was a “coup d’état” directed by the “anti-democratic” prime minister in Madrid. “The president of the country is and will be Carles Puigdemont,” said Junqueras, referring to Catalonia’s regional president in a piece for the newspaper El Punt Avui. Junqueras is correct about one thing: a coup has indeed rattled this province. But the instigators aren't in Madrid. Despite appearing rigidly authoritarian, Rajoy has Spanish law, the courts, the national Senate, the king, and the 1978 constitution solidly backing his actions in lassoing runaway Catalonia back into Spain. It is not the Spanish government, but the separatists in Catalonia, where a July poll showed 41 percent wanted independence and 49 percent wanted to stay in Spain, who are undermining democracy in this land.

Junqueras, Puigdemont and their social media-savvy band of separatists, have leveraged historical grudges to create rancor and division, making a mockery of the very democracy they claim to desire by saying that it’s Spain, with elections, a healthy constitution, and a decentralized government, that is undemocratic.

Puigdemont, an avowed independence supporter and onetime-mayor of Girona, was an unelected appointee to the regional president’s seat in Jan. 2016, chosen by a parliamentary coalition that shared little but a desire for separatism. Dubbed “the accidental president,” he became the first leader of Catalonia to refuse to pledge loyalty to Spain’s constitution and king.

Filling their cabinet only with like-minded members, Puigdemont and Junqueras emphasized independence above all and promised a referendum on leaving Spain. However, Spain’s constitution, approved by 90 percent of Catalan voters in 1978, holds that the regions can only secede if all Spanish voters approve it. In spite of that, Puigdemont ignored Rajoy’s warnings and the Constitutional Court’s ruling that a vote on independence was unconstitutional and illegal.

For months, the separatist faction of the Barcelona-based government made misleading promises. An independent Catalonia would remain in the European Union, they said − even though the EU had said that declaring independence would effectively be resigning from the group. A report from the regional Ministry of Economy, headed by Junqueras, concluded that international investment would rise and wealthy Catalonia would remain economically viable despite warnings from major businesses that they’d move their headquarters, and perhaps relocate entirely if independence was declared.

Separatists riled up the populace with fervent rallies, where they claimed the national government in Madrid was robbing Catalonia, and depicting Catalans as victimized and oppressed. On Sept.7, the secessionist camp in parliament pushed through a bill on holding the referendum ignoring standard procedure, including discussion and advance notice it would be on the agenda. While 52 of the 135 parliamentarians left in disgust, the bill passed with 72 votes.

Puigdemont and Junqueras appeared to revel in the calls from Rajoy to drop the plebiscite scheduled for Oct. 1, perhaps realizing that any move from the national government would be seen as Goliath stomping on David. On that count, they were right. Instead of ignoring it, Madrid sent out national police to try to prevent the vote from taking place. The police were largely unsuccessful and their attempt short-lived, but the images of them battering doors, knocking down the elderly, dragging voters down stairs, pulling women by their hair and shooting at civilians with rubber bullets did more to alarm the world and rally support for the separatist call than any advertising campaign could have achieved. Later reports showed the number of injuries, initially thought to be over 800, had been exaggerated, as had some reports of victimization.

Missing in the dramatic imagery beamed worldwide was the fact that the disorganized vote was marred by more than violence: as Madrid tried to shut down voting stations, basic polling safeguards were overlooked and the Catalan government announced that regardless of registration, Catalans could cast ballots anywhere − creating the potential for repeat voting. Since voters had been warned by Madrid that the referendum was illegal, it was largely boycotted by those who wanted to stay in Spain; only some 2 million Catalans of 5 million-plus potential voters cast their ballots. Despite this low turnout and allegations of voter fraud, the Catalan government hailed the result as a 90 percent vote for independence.

After nearly four weeks of double-speak and canceled announcements about independence − during which over 1,000 businesses moved their headquarters outside Catalonia and tourism plummeted − Puigdemont referred the issue to the regional parliament, which held a secret ballot about it on Oct 27. Of the 135 parliamentarians, 70 wrote yes, 10 wrote no, and the rest stormed out. Many left Spanish flags on their empty chairs. Before the hour was out, Spain’s Senate in Madrid agreed to invoke the constitution’s never-before-used Article 155, giving Madrid the authority to suspend Catalonia’s government. Hours later, Rajoy announced that the central government was taking over.

Puigdemont, Junqueras and other Catalan cabinet members may now face charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Puigdemont slipped off to Brussels, where his Belgian lawyer says he will not return to Spain. Junqueras still wants to tackle the creation of his new republic, writing in a New York Times op-ed column published Wednesday that Catalonia would not retreat. “In a battle for self-determination and the recognition of rights, one does not win with the first punch,” he said.

It will be an uphill battle even in the unlikely event that the central government lets Junqueras stay in office. A new poll, just published in El Mundo, shows the number of Catalans supporting independence has dropped to 33 percent.

Outside the bloc, euro zone growth also exceeded that of Britain, the EU’s second-ranked economy which will leave the bloc in March 2019.","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone’s annual economic growth rate outstripped that of the United States in the third quarter setting up 2017 as the best year for the currency area since financial markets crashed a decade ago.

Germany was a major factor, but even some of the bloc’s laggards, such as Italy, showed signs of revival.

Eurostat, the European Union statistics office, confirmed a preliminary estimate that euro zone gross domestic product (GDP)grew 0.6 percent from July to September from the previous quarter and on a year on year basis was 2.5 percent higher.

This was higher than the 2.3 percent year-on-year rate for the U.S. economy, which had been growing faster than the euro zone. The U.S. quarterly numbers were slightly better than the euro zones at 0.7 percent, however.

“A robust labor market recovery, growing export markets, an accommodative monetary stance, improving lending conditions and modest inflation are but a few of the tailwinds that the euro zone economy is experiencing,” ING economist Bert Colijn said.

“Because of that, this could well be its strongest year for growth since 2007. The euro zone will likely outpace both the U.S. and UK in terms of GDP growth in 2017,” he said.

Euro zone GDP grew 3.0 percent in 2007, and reached 2.1 percent in 2010 and 2015.

The strong euro zone growth was powered by the biggest economy Germany, which shifted into an even higher gear in the third quarter, propelled by buoyant exports and rising company investments in equipment.

Seasonally adjusted German GDP rose 0.8 percent on the quarter, beating a consensus forecast of 0.6 percent, which was also the second-quarter growth rate.

Second biggest France grew 0.5 percent on the quarter and 2.2 percent in annual terms and the third biggest Italy beat expectations with a 0.5 percent quarterly, and 1.8 percent annual growth, supported by exports and domestic demand.

The Netherlands, the fifth biggest economy, grew an expected 0.4 percent on the quarter after a record jump of 1.5 percent in the previous three months, putting it on track for a 3.3 percent expansion this year, the strongest since 2007.

Outside the bloc, euro zone growth also exceeded that of Britain, the EU’s second-ranked economy which will leave the bloc in March 2019.

The British economy, affected by a drop in the pound against the euro since last year’s Brexit vote, expanded 0.4 percent on the quarter in sterling terms and just 1.5 percent annually.

Separately, Eurostat said euro zone industrial production fell by 0.6 percent month-on-month in September as expected by markets but rose 3.3 percent year-on-year, slightly beating economists’ average forecast of a 3.2 percent increase.

”The outlook for production in the fourth quarter remains strong,“ ING’s Colijn said. ”New orders for manufacturing surged in August and businesses are reporting large backlogs of work according to the PMI survey.

“That should result in continued strength in industry in the final quarter of the year, adding to the possibility that our estimate for GDP growth in 2017 of 2.3 percent could still be too low,” he said.

The stronger growth supports the European Central Bank’s decision last month to start weaning the euro zone off ultra-loose money by saying that from January it will halve the amount of bonds it buys every month to 30 billion euros ($35.1 billion). It nevertheless promised years of stimulus and left the door open to backtracking.","Euro zone growth, eclipsing U.S. economy, set to be best in decade",https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-economy-gdp/euro-zone-growth-eclipsing-u-s-economy-set-to-be-best-in-decade-idINKBN1DE1QN

The world’s largest automaker plans to spend more than 20 billion euros ($23.5 billion) on electric mobility by 2030, including costs to develop battery models and upgrade factories.

Until it admitted in 2015 to cheating on U.S. diesel emissions tests, Volkswagen (VW) had been slow to embrace zero-emission cars. Under its “roadmap E”, VW now aims to offer an electric version of each of its 300 group models by 2030.

With its nearly 9,000 workers, VW’s plant in Zwickau makes the Golf and Passat models. The combustion-engine vehicles could be shifted to the under-utilized factories at Wolfsburg and Emden to make room for electric-car production at the site in Saxony, three sources close to VW said on Tuesday.

“Things are moving in this direction,” one of them said.

A spokesman for VW’s operations in Saxony, which also include an engine plant in Chemnitz and a site in Dresden, said Zwickau has been earmarked to build an electric model but declined to elaborate.

A spokesman at VW’s Wolfsburg headquarters declined to comment.

VW’s supervisory board will meet on Friday to sign off on management’s capital and development spending targets for the next five years.

At the previous budget round a year ago, VW pledged to cut group spending on factories, equipment and technology to 6 percent of automotive sales by 2020 from 6.9 percent in 2015.

Hundreds of supporters of the Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan party have blocked a main road to Islamabad since Friday, threatening violence if their demand that the minister of law be sacked is not met.

The group blames the minister, Zahid Hamid, for changes to an electoral oath that it says amounts to blasphemy. The government puts the issue down to a clerical error.

Pakistan’s blasphemy law has become a lightning rod for Islamists, especially since 2011 when the liberal governor of Punjab province, Salman Taseer, was murdered by a bodyguard for questioning the law that mandates the death penalty for insulting Islam or the Prophet Mohammad.

A spokesman for the Punjab provincial government, Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan, told Reuters the protests were a “serious inconvenience for people and disturbing public life” in the province that surrounds Islamabad.

“The Punjab government has detained dozens of Tehreek-e-Labaik’s activists from various districts,” he said.

Labaik spokesman Ejaz Ashrafi said in a statement police arrested hundreds of its workers in a countrywide swoop, mainly in the party’s base in Punjab.

Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal late on Monday urged the protesters to call off the sit-in, saying he hoped the government “wouldn’t be forced to take extreme steps”.

One security source said the protesters detained several policemen, seized their weapons and mistreated them.

“The abduction of the police is a heinous crime,” Iqbal said in a statement.

Police have accused the protesters, who are occupying the main artery between the capital and the nearby city of Rawalpindi, of throwing stones at them.

Fearing violence, the government has blocked several roads with shipping containers to corral the protesters, but that has caused hours-long traffic jams.

Minister of state for interior affairs Talal Chaudhry said the government had refused to accept the demand to sack the minister, and instead had ordered police to block any more Labaik supporters or leaders from joining the protest.

In 2007, a confrontation between authorities and supporters of radical preachers at an Islamabad mosque led to the death of more than 100 people when commandos stormed the complex.

“We’re still trying to resolve this issue through dialogue but the situation is becoming intolerable,” Chaudhry, told reporters.

“If this cannot be resolved, the roads will have to be cleared.”",Pakistan police arrest dozens from Islamist party blocking entrance to capital,https://www.reuters.com/article/pakistan-protests/pakistan-police-arrest-dozens-from-islamist-party-blocking-entrance-to-capital-idINKBN1DE1N0

The British Prime Minister faces growing challenges to her leadership from her Conservative party’s pro- and anti-European Union factions. Political disarray increases the risks that quitting the bloc will inflict serious harm on the economy. A softer Brexit is becoming harder to deliver.

Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street in London, Britain November 9, 2017

A clear sign that investors are getting more nervous came on Monday when sterling shed a full cent against the U.S. dollar, falling below $1.31. The trigger was a Sunday Times report that 40 Conservative deputies had agreed to sign a letter of no confidence in May – eight short of the number needed to trigger a leadership contest. A sharp jump in options prices that reflect how much traders expect the pound to gyrate against the dollar in the next month underscores the market jitters.

Fair enough. May is struggling to convince other EU countries that Britain has made enough compromises on Brexit issues they want resolved before moving on to discussing trade. Ejecting her would require the Conservatives to spend weeks choosing a new leader. A general election might have to be called to confirm her replacement’s mandate, possibly leading to a change of government. This would delay negotiations about trading arrangements to allow continued tariff-free movement of goods between Britain and the rest of the EU. It would also make it harder to secure a transition period that would delay the impact of the new arrangements beyond the March 2019 Brexit date.

The longer the clock ticks without tangible progress on trading terms and conditions, the more likely businesses are to move jobs and investment out of the United Kingdom. Investors’ patience will run out even sooner. They have so far assumed that the prime concern of British politicians is to minimise economic damage: the Breakingviews Brexit indicator, which incorporates signals from currency, bond, stock, and credit default swap prices, has been relatively stable in recent months.

That's the core business, that's where they wanna see growth. Flannery also cut the dividend by 50%, he cut the earnings forecast for next year by the same amount.

And he said the company is going to take a bit hit on cash flow as well. And it will take two years to really restore the robust growth and earnings that investors expect.

Writing on Twitter, Hariri urged Lebanese to remain calm and said his family would stay in Saudi Arabia, calling it “their country”.

Hariri’s resignation while in Saudi Arabia pitched Lebanon into political crisis.

Top Lebanese government officials and senior politicians close to Hariri believe Saudi Arabia coerced him into quitting and has been holding him against his will ever since, though Hariri and Riyadh have denied this.

Hariri cited fear of assassination and accused Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world during his resignation speech.

Hariri gave his first public remarks on Sunday, saying in a televised interview in Riyadh he planned to return to Lebanon within days to affirm his resignation.

Lebanese President Michel Aoun, who has stated that he believes Riyadh is restricting Hariri’s freedom, has refused to his resignation until his return from Saudi Arabia.

The Russian leadership has told major companies to supply it with news stories that put its stewardship of the country in a positive light, according to documents seen by Reuters.

A seven-page document spelled out the kind of articles required, with a focus on new jobs, scientific achievements and new infrastructure, especially those involving state support. It also detailed how the stories should be presented, and gave a weekly deadline for submissions.

The instructions were sent last month by the energy ministry to 45 companies in Russia’s energy and utilities sector including Rosneft, Lukoil and Novatek, according to a second document, a list of recipients.

The drive coincides with the run-up to a presidential election in March next year when President Vladimir Putin needs a strong mandate with high turnout to maintain his firm grip on power after dominating Russian politics for two decades.

“Life for the majority of people has become calmer, more comfortable, more attractive. But many such examples often escape the media’s attention,” said the first document.

“Our task, through a creative and painstaking approach, is to select such topics and subjects and offer them to the media.”

That document, which did not mention the election, said the news items to be supplied were to feed a “positive news wire” and should correspond to two themes: “Life is getting better” and “How things were; how they are now”.

Both documents were attached to an invitation, dated Oct. 9, sent by the energy ministry to senior executives in the public relations and government relations departments of the firms, of which 17 are state-controlled and 28 privately-held. The invitation requested they send representatives to an Oct. 12 meeting at the ministry in Moscow to discuss how to help the government’s PR effort.

Reuters saw a copy of the invitation and spoke to three executives who received it. According to the invitation, the news initiative was requested by Sergei Kiriyenko, the first deputy chief of staff in the presidential administration.

A spokesman for Kiriyenko did not respond to a request for comment. The energy ministry also did not respond, nor did Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

Reuters sent requests for comment to the biggest five companies out of the 45, by market value - state-owned oil major Rosneft, state-owned gas giant Gazprom, private oil companies Lukoil and Surgutneftegaz, and private gas firm Novatek. No responses were received.

NINE-POINT LIST

Oil and gas provide Russia’s biggest source of revenue and energy firms are among the most powerful companies and biggest employers. Reuters has not found evidence that similar instructions were sent to companies in other sectors.

The Oct. 12 meeting was chaired by Deputy Energy Minister Anton Inyutsyn, and an official from the presidential administration was also present, according to one of the sources who attended. The two officials went through and explained the instructions laid out in the seven-page document, said the source, who added that the election was not mentioned.

Reuters reported in February that the ministry had enlisted energy companies to give it advance notice about developments that could influence public opinion.

The meeting last month and the guidelines circulated in preparation for it show that, since then, the initiative has stepped up into a higher gear, with companies being handed highly specific instructions on how they are expected to help.

It was not clear if the companies had acted on the instructions.

The news guidelines document said the government wanted to highlight “victories and achievements”.

It included a nine-point list of the kind of news that companies should supply. It asked, for example, for stories about business units “where it’s possible to say that state support helped lift them out of crisis, restored modern production, and re-equipped them with new equipment and gave work to local residents”.

Examples given of the kind of events of interest to the government from elsewhere in the corporate world included state lender Sberbank hiring 700 people in the Volga river city of Togliatti, a festival funded by a company in Kaliningrad region for young people with hearing difficulties and a sports center being opened in Cherkessk, southern Russia.

The document also held up the case of Yevgeny Kosmin as an example of a positive news story, a miner in western Siberia whose team extracted 1.6 million tonnes of coal in July this year, a monthly record.

That carried echoes of Alexey Stakhanov, a miner who in 1935 extracted almost 15 times more coal during a shift than his quota required. Communist propaganda held Stakhanov up as a symbol of Soviet industrial prowess.

MONDAY DEADLINE

The instructions stipulated that companies should submit positive news stories every week - on the Monday, or Tuesday morning at the latest.

They said the companies should present their items in the format of a table, with new additions highlighted in a colored font, and accompanied by a press release that could be passed on to journalists with minimal editing from government officials.

The document also required each company to provide a contact person who could provide extra information to journalists, tell TV news crews how to reach the venue to report on an event, and organize access for news crews to the company’s sites.

Reuters was not able to establish if the Kremlin had made similarly specific demands of companies in the past.

Putin has not yet declared his intention to seek re-election. Most Kremlin observers say he will. Opinion polls show he will win comfortably, with many voters crediting him with restoring national pride.

The Kremlin’s biggest headache with the election, scheduled for next March, is ensuring a strong turnout, say many political analysts.

With the economy weak and many people viewing the result as a foregone conclusion, voters may be tempted to stay away from polling stations. A low turnout could undermine Putin’s legitimacy in his next term, the analysts say.",Exclusive: Kremlin tells companies to deliver good news,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-kremlin-pr/exclusive-kremlin-tells-companies-to-deliver-good-news-idUSKBN1DE0MP?il=0

More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since late August, driven out by a counter-insurgency clearance operation of Myanmar forces in Rakhine. A top U.N. official has called the operation a textbook case of “ethnic cleansing”.

Attending an East Asia summit in Manila on Tuesday, Tillerson met Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose less than two-year-old civilian administration shares power with the military and has no control over its generals.

He will meet Suu Kyi again in the Myanmar capital of Naypyitaw on Wednesday, and hold separate talks with the head of the armed forces, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.

Asked what approach Tillerson would take with Myanmar’s army chief, the State Department official told journalists in a briefing by teleconference that the emphasis would be on restoring peace in Rakhine.

“We are focusing on trying to stabilize areas in northern Rakhine so that people can return there, stopping the violence, making sure that the military would protect all populations in that area equally and that they conduct a credible investigation that leads to accountability for people who have perpetrated abuses,” said the official, who was with Tillerson in Manila and declined to be identified.

The official said the consequences for the country, also known as Burma, if it failed to respond to the crisis with accountability could be part of the conversation with the military leader.

“Burma made a lot of progress and we would not want to see that progress reversed,” the official added.

U.S. senators in Washington are pressing for economic sanctions and travel restrictions targeting the Myanmar military and its business interests.

“The secretary will reiterate support for Burma’s democratic transition and urge the Burmese government to protect the local population and allow unhindered humanitarian and media access, (and) support for a credible investigation of abuses,” the official added.

Accusations of organized mass rape and other crimes against humanity were leveled at the Myanmar military on Sunday by another senior U.N. official who had toured camps in Bangladesh where Rohingya refugees have taken shelter.

‘WHITEWASH’

Pramila Patten, special representative of the U.N. secretary-general on sexual violence in conflict, said she would raise accusations against the Myanmar military with the International Criminal Court in the Hague.

The military, known as the Tatmadaw, has consistently protested its innocence, and on Monday it posted the findings of an internal investigation on the Facebook page of Min Aung Hlaing.

It said it had found no instances where its soldiers had shot and killed Rohingya villagers, raped women or tortured prisoners. It denied that security forces had torched Rohingya villages or used “excessive force”.

The military said that, while 376 “terrorists” were killed, there were no deaths of innocent people.

Human rights groups poured scorn on the military’s investigation, branding it a “whitewash” and calling for U.N. and independent investigators to be allowed into Myanmar.

“The Burmese military’s absurd effort to absolve itself of mass atrocities underscores why an independent international investigation is needed to establish the facts and identify those responsible,” Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.

Amnesty International also dismissed the military’s internal investigation. “There is overwhelming evidence that the military has murdered and raped Rohingya and burned their villages to the ground,” the London-based rights group said.

The government in mostly Buddhist Myanmar regards the Muslim Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

And Suu Kyi’s failure to speak out strongly over their plight has widely damaged the Nobel Peace Prize winner’s international reputation as a stateswoman.

Many diplomats, however, believe Myanmar’s fragile transition to democracy after 49 years of military rule would be jeopardized if she publicly criticized the armed forces.

“Both parts of the government will have to work together in order to solve this problem...Trying to get two of them to work together, to try to solve the problem, is certainly going to be very important,” the U.S. official said.

The U.S. official said Suu Kyi had been forthcoming in her talks with Tillerson and others during the past few days about the steps that needed to be taken to improve the situation, including plans for the voluntary repatriation of Rohingya.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were among those she met in Manila to discuss the Rohingya crisis.

“This is a tremendous concern to Canada and to many, many countries around the world,” Trudeau told a news conference.

Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged up to 117 billion yen ($1 billion) of development aid to Myanmar in his meeting with Suu Kyi.

While world leaders wrung their hands, thousands of Rohingya remained stranded in Myanmar, on beaches around the mouth of the Naf river, hoping to find a boat to make the short, sometimes perilous crossing to Bangladesh.

“They’re still coming, risking their lives, driven by fears of starvation and violence,” Shariful Azam, a police official in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar, a narrow spit of land where the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis is unfolding.

Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Their meeting on Monday during a summit of Asian leaders in Manila was arguably the most anticipated of the three-day event and went off well, with Duterte’s aides talking up the rapport the two had, and Trump boasting of his “great relationship” with the similarly mercurial Philippines leader.

It came a little over a year after Duterte announced his “separation” from the United States and sought new alliances with China and Russia. Angered by Barack Obama’s criticism of his war on drugs, he told the then-U.S. president to “go to hell”, shocking American businesses and a Philippine military heavily reliant on the help of the Pentagon.

Central to the rapprochement this week was Duterte holding his tongue, and Trump not expressing concern about Duterte’s centerpiece policy - the crackdown on drugs that has killed thousands of Filipinos.

“Tensions and damage inflicted during the Obama administration has somehow been repaired, looking at the executive relationship, it has essentially been normalized,” said Richard Javad Heydarian, an author and a political science professor at Manila’s De La Salle University.

“The modus operandi is, Trump doesn’t openly criticize Duterte’s war on drugs and Duterte tones down his direct attacks on the U.S.”

Even with Trump in the White House, Duterte had repeatedly railed at the “hypocrisy” of his country’s former colonial ruler. He has accused Washington of treating the Philippines like a dog and said he would not visit the United States, because it was “lousy”.

But there was none of Duterte’s trademark hostility this week and some indications that both countries had taken a calibrated approach to ensure the two leaders hit it off.

Contrary to traditional seating protocol for a summit of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the two were seated next to each other at Sunday’s gala dinner.

Duterte sang a hit Filipino love song at that event, and joked it was “on the orders of the U.S. commander-in-chief”.

SUPERFICIAL DAMAGE

Although Duterte’s fallout with Obama was acrimonious, the fissures between the two long-term allies did not run deep, with joint programs across various sectors largely intact.

That included dozens of annual joint military exercises over the past year. This year, the Philippines military relied on U.S. technical support in its biggest-ever urban battle, ending a five-month occupation of a southern city by rebels loyal to Islamic State.

There were no signs of an exodus of American business under Duterte either, with $353 million of investments from the United States recorded in the first eight months of this year, compared to $90 million in the same period in 2016, according to the Philippines central bank.

There were conflicting accounts of what was discussed between Trump and Duterte on Monday, however.

A White House spokeswoman said human rights was talked about, in the context of the drugs war. Duterte’s spokesman, Harry Roque, said that was not the case, although Duterte had explained his anti-drugs campaign to Trump, who nodded and “seemed to be in agreement”.

“The relationship appears to be very warm and very friendly, getting very candid,” Roque said. “They have similar feelings toward former U.S. President Barack Obama.”

Duterte had said last week he would tell Trump to “lay off” if he talked about human rights.

But according to a senior White House official, Duterte raised the issue himself.

“He had an explanation and he pre-emptively brought it up,” the official said, estimating Duterte did 90 percent of the talking.

The two leaders agreed to further strengthen the decades-old defense alliance between them, one that Duterte had previously threatened to abort.

Heydarian, the professor, however said that even with improved ties, Trump would be powerless to stop moves by Duterte to diversify foreign relations beyond the United States to include China and Russia, and tap them for anything from loans and infrastructure to rifles and jeeps.

“I don’t think that the Trump-Duterte convivial hobnob will ever be enough to change Duterte’s strategic orientation,” he said.

“We have stopped the hemorrhaging of the alliance, but it will never go back to being special and sacred as it was before Duterte came to power.”","U.S., Philippines ties back on track as Trump, Duterte make up and bond",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-asia-philippines/u-s-philippines-ties-back-on-track-as-trump-duterte-make-up-and-bond-idUSKBN1DE16K

The warrant comes at an awkward time for Pakistan, which wants to raise in excess of $1 billion on international debt markets through a Sukuk and a Eurobond in coming months and has been trying to woo international investors.

Dar, who has been charged with amassing wealth beyond his known sources of income, has missed three weeks of court hearings conducted by the anti-graft agency the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).

Judge Mohammad Bashir issued the warrant on the grounds of “continued absence” from the court, according to a court statement.

Dar, who has pleaded not guilty, is receiving medical treatment in London and now faces arrest upon his return to Pakistan.

The case has been adjourned until Nov. 21.

The charges against Dar followed an investigation into the finances of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was ousted in July after the Supreme Court disqualified him for not declaring a small salary from his son’s off-shore company.

The finance minister is one of Sharif’s closest political allies and Dar’s son has married Sharif’s daughter. Both men deny any wrongdoing.

Dar has rejected growing calls to resign amid his legal woes and a worsening economic outlook for Pakistan, which is battling to stave off a balance of payments crisis due to dwindling foreign currency reserve and a widening current account deficit.

Dar was initially lauded for steering Pakistan out of a balance of payments crisis in 2013 and returning the nuclear-armed country toward a higher growth trajectory.

But over the past year he has faced criticism for his refusal to allow the rupee to weaken to ease macroeconomic pressures.

Hariri, a Saudi ally, resigned abruptly on Nov. 4 in a move Lebanese political leaders ascribed to pressure from Riyadh. Hariri said his resignation had been prompted by an assassination plot and accused Iran and Hezbollah of sowing strife in the region. He denies there are any constraints on his movement.

Patriarch Bechara al-Rai met Hariri as well as King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as part of a trip that was planned well before the Lebanese political crisis brought on by Hariri’s resignation.

“Hariri is returning as fast as possible and I support the reasons for his resignation,” Rai was quoted as saying by Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television.

Hariri said he was fine and would return to Lebanon in the next two days. On Twitter, he urged Lebanese to remain calm and said his family would stay in Saudi Arabia, calling it “their country”.

The events have thrust Lebanon back to the forefront of the conflict between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Iran.

Rai’s trip has come under heightened scrutiny in light of Hariri’s resignation, but an official visit to Saudi Arabia by such a senior non-Muslim cleric is significant as a rare act of religious openness by the conservative Muslim country.

The kingdom hosts the holiest sites in Islam and bans the practice of other religions, forcing Christians to risk arrest by praying in private homes.

Prince Mohammed says he wants Saudi Arabia to open up more to the world. In addition to imposing radical economic reforms, the 32-year-old heir-apparent has pledged to relax strict social norms and revive a “middle-of-the-road, moderate Islam open to the world and all religions, traditions and people”.

RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE

Rai heads the Maronite church, which has a presence in Lebanon, Syria and Cyprus and follows an Eastern rite of the Roman Catholic Church.

Flanked by Catholic clerics wearing vestments and gold crosses, Rai discussed religious tolerance and combating extremism with the king and his son, the Saudi state news agency said.

Prince Mohammed has taken a harder line on Iran since taking on wide-ranging authorities two years ago including as defence minister, with the kingdom waging a two-year-old war in Yemen against Houthi fighters aligned with Iran.

He has also pushed for more social freedoms in a country where authority has rested for decades on an enduring accommodation between the royal family and clerics who control the hardline Wahhabi strain of Islam that originated in Saudi Arabia.

The powers of the Saudi religious police have been curbed, enforcement of gender segregation has been relaxed and women have been granted some more freedoms, including the right to drive cars starting next year.

Rai is the second Christian patriarch to visit the country, after another such trip in 1975. He said the original invitation had been extended in 2013 by the late King Abdullah.","Lebanese patriarch, in Saudi, says supports reasons Hariri quit",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-lebanon-patriarch/lebanese-patriarch-in-saudi-says-supports-reasons-hariri-quit-idUKKBN1DE1Y8?il=0

The 44-year old former left back, who helped Brazil win the 2002 World Cup as well as Copa America titles in 1997 and 1999, also believed that the country has recovered from a humiliating 7-1 semi-final defeat by Germany as the 2014 tournament’s hosts.

“The team has been reorganised since the debacle against Germany and we also have a new coach in Tite, hence I am confident the situation has vastly improved,” he told a news conference in Serbia’s capital.

”We have world class players and team leaders in Neymar, Willian and Thiago Silva. They are experienced and I am confident that Brazil have it in them to win the World Cup.

“As a Brazilian, naturally I want Brazil to win the World Cup. But (world champions) Germany, Spain and Argentina will also be among the top favourites and it will take a lot of hard work to capture the title.”

Carlos, an ambassador for La Liga’s Real Madrid, said that Neymar was right to move from Barcelona to Paris St Germain during the close season and believed the talented forward would shine in Russia next year.

“I expect Neymar to become the world’s best player very soon,” he said.

”There is a lot of debate going on whether he should have moved to Paris St Germain from Barcelona and I think he did the right thing.

”It was his personal decision and I think it will be easier for him to flourish at PSG, whereas that was more complicated with Lionel Messi at Barcelona or would have been at Real Madrid with Cristiano Ronaldo. At PSG, he is the benchmark.

“He is a great person too, I am in touch with him regularly and I am also convinced he will have an outstanding World Cup.”

Carlos, who spent a single season at Inter Milan in 1995-96 before moving to Real where he won four La Liga titles and three Champions League trophies, said Italy needed to “start from scratch” after failing to qualify for the World Cup.

The Italians, beaten by Sweden 1-0 on aggregate after Monday’s 0-0 draw in Milan, will miss out on the finals for the first time since 1958.

“That’s football and it only shows that many teams have improved and caught up with those at the top level,” he said.

“Italy have to reorganise and go back to the drawing board. It’s easy to pile the criticism on them now but I don’t think that’s the right course of action.”","Neymar can lead Brazil to World Cup glory, says Roberto Carlos",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-worldcup-bra-carlos/neymar-can-lead-brazil-to-world-cup-glory-says-roberto-carlos-idUKKBN1DE1YV

The new policy affects videos that feature people and groups that have been designated as terrorist by the U.S. or British governments but lack the gory violence or hateful speech that were already barred by YouTube.

A YouTube spokesperson, who asked not be named for security reasons, confirmed the policy in response to questions. The company would not specify when the policy went into effect.

As YouTube terms already barred “terrorists” from using the service, the new policy keeps out videos uploaded by others that militants likely would try to distribute if they could have accounts, according to the spokesperson.

Hundreds of videos of slain al Qaeda recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki lecturing on the history of Islam, recorded long before he advocated violence against the United States, were among those removed under the new policy, the spokesperson said.

Governments and human rights groups have pressed YouTube for years to crack down on extremist videos. They argue that the propaganda radicalized viewers and contributed to deadly terror attacks.

British Home Secretary Amber Rudd amplified the pressure during visits with tech companies in Silicon Valley in July and a speech in Washington, D.C. last week. European Union and U.S. lawmakers this year have threatened consequences for tech companies if concerns are not addressed.

Legislation could resemble a German law approved in June to fine social media companies 50 million euros ($57 million) if hateful postings are not promptly removed.

YouTube said discussions with outside experts prompted the new policy, but it was unclear why the company decided to act only recently. In June, the company announced that “inflammatory religious or supremacist content” that did not violate its policies would be allowed with warning labels and a restriction making them ineligible for ad revenue.

At the time, Google General Counsel Kent Walker said in a blog post, “We think this strikes the right balance between free expression and access to information without promoting extremely offensive viewpoints.”

The latest step goes farther and was praised by critics such as Paul Barrett, deputy director of the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights.

“If the terrorist is in the business of recruiting and inciting people to make violent attacks, you’ve got to the draw the line” against any of their content, Barrett said.

The new policy does not affect news clips or educational videos about terrorism. But YouTube will not always have an easy time distinguishing, experts said, pointing to tactics such as overlaying extremist commentary on news footage to get around censors.

YouTube has resisted imposing more editorial control because it fears making it harder for important videos to get a wide audience, Juniper Downs, YouTube’s global director of public policy, told a San Francisco conference sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League on Monday.

“We will lose something very valuable if we completely transform the way these platforms work,” she said during a panel discussion.

Internet freedom advocates such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation have urged tech companies to be cautious and transparent in responding to government pressure.

YouTube is relying on government lists of terrorists and terrorist groups for enforcement. Content moderators check the listings and make removal decisions after fielding reports from an automated system, users or partner organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League and The Institute for Strategic Dialogue.

Al-Awlaki, whom the U.S. killed in a 2011 drone strike, was designated a terrorist by the U.S. Treasury the year prior.

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

It is yet another battle for May after scandals and gaffes that have brought questions about her leadership into the open. As many as 40 of her MPs would support a no-confidence motion against her, according to the Sunday Times newspaper.

But many sources in her governing Conservative Party say now is not the time to force her out because despite backing Britain remaining in the EU, even if reluctantly, they think she is still the best option to deliver Brexit.

That makes the debates over EU withdrawal bill all the more important as a test of her ability to steer through legislation she says is crucial to give companies confidence that the rules will not change when Britain leaves in March 2019.

With the power balanced in favour of MPs rather than the government after the Conservatives lost their majority in a June election, many - even within the party - will use the debate over coming weeks to put the pressure on.

“We have no intention of parliament being a bystander, we are a key participant in this process,” said Hilary Benn, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party who is chair of the Brexit parliamentary committee.

“In the end we are going to have to vote on the final deal, and the outcome of the election and the balance of votes in the House of Commons now really does bring that home,” he told the Institute for Government thinktank earlier this month.

‘COPY AND PASTE’

The public debate in parliament on Tuesday is the first of eight to discuss the bill before it goes on to other legislative stages. The schedule will be determined by the House of Commons over the course of the debates.

MPs have proposed 186 pages of amendments to the bill, which largely ‘copy and paste’ EU rules and regulations into British law but also, critics say, hand the government wide-ranging powers and cut parliament out of some Brexit planning.

The bill is separate from negotiations going on in Brussels, but the EU will want to see how many and which amendments are passed and will regard the showdown as a test of May’s strength at home.

May is under pressure to make progress with the EU at a summit in December after growing European frustration over Britain’s refusal to say how much it thinks it should pay to leave.

The amendments include one to stop the government from adopting the so-called Henry VIII powers, named after the 16th century monarch who ruled by proclamation, which allow the government to amend laws being transposed from EU law.

Other amendments address criticism that parliament will not get a “meaningful vote” on the deal eventually agreed with the EU, and press the government to enshrine in law the EU protections Britons now enjoy such as workers rights and environmental protections.

May’s government has taken some of the fire out of the proposed challenges by signalling it is willing to bend on the Henry VIII powers, and on Monday, her Brexit minister David Davis said parliament would be offered a new vote on the final Brexit deal.

The first debate will cover the part of the bill that repeals the 1972 European Communities Act on the retention, conversion and interpretation of existing EU laws, and EU rights.

“Getting parliamentary scrutiny is a winner. The government will change position because it doesn’t want a defeat,” said one Conservative lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity.

But other issues, such as the push for a vote in parliament on the EU deal which could force the government back to the negotiating table, or even possibly overturn Brexit, present huge challenges.

The debate comes at a new low point for May since she was made prime minister after Britain voted for Brexit last June.

She has lost two ministers in a week, and her foreign minister, Boris Johnson, is under pressure from the opposition to resign over comments about a jailed aid worker in Iran, a case further complicated at the weekend by Gove, his ally.

On Monday, Keir Starmer, the Brexit spokesman for the Labour Party, launched a new bid to derail the withdrawal legislation, saying May’s policy to end the jurisdiction of the EU court - the European Court of Justice - was incompatible with her own policy for a smooth transition after Brexit.

“Over recent weeks, it has become increasingly clear that you alone do not have the authority to deliver a transitional deal with Europe and to take the necessary steps to protect jobs and the economy,” he wrote in an open letter to May.","Weaker than ever, May faces test in parliament over Brexit plans",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-bill/weaker-than-ever-may-faces-test-in-parliament-over-brexit-plans-idUKKBN1DD1WT

Tel Aviv-based Corephotonics Ltd filed its patent infringement case against Apple in federal court in San Jose, California, on Monday.

Corephotonics, which has raised $50 million from several high-profile venture capital firms and other investors, said its patented dual camera technology for mobile devices was incorporated by Apple in the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus without its authorization.

According to the lawsuit, Corephotonics Chief Executive David Mendlovic approached Apple about a partnership. Apple praised the start-up’s technology but refused to license it, Corephotonics said, even suggesting it could infringe the latter’s patents with little consequence.

According to the complaint, “Apple’s lead negotiator expressed contempt for Corephotonics’ patents, telling Dr. Mendlovic and others that even if Apple infringed, it would take years and millions of dollars in litigation before Apple might have to pay something.”

An Apple spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment.

Many high-end smartphones include dual camera systems that can zoom in without losing image quality. Apple has its own patents on dual camera technology.

Through its latest funding round in January, Corephotonics raised $15 million from investors that included Samsung Ventures, electronics manufacturer Foxconn and chipmaker MediaTek Inc.

Foxconn is one of Apple’s contract manufacturers. Apple is considering MediaTek as a chip supplier, according to the Wall Street Journal.

La semana pasada, Shakira había pospuesto sus presentaciones en Alemania, Francia, Bélgica y Holanda por recomendación médica y en ese momento dijo que esperaba poder comenzar su gira “El Dorado” en los siguientes días.

Pero el martes explicó en un comunicado publicado en sus cuentas de redes sociales y su sitio web (www.shakira.com) que le sería imposible realizar la gira hasta dentro de varias semanas mientras trabaja en su recuperación.

“A finales de octubre, en la recta final de mis ensayos, sentí una ronquera inusual que me impedía cantar. Los médicos detectaron que se había producido una hemorragia en mi cuerda vocal derecha”, dijo la cantante nacida en Barranquilla.

“Desde entonces me entregué plenamente al reposo de la voz tal y como me lo habían recomendado los especialistas (...) Desafortunadamente la hemorragia parece no haberse reabsorbido aún y mi pesadilla continúa. Y actualmente me encuentro en una batalla muy dura por mi recuperación”, añadió.

Las nuevas fechas europeas pospuestas incluyen presentaciones programadas hasta diciembre en varias ciudades de Francia, España, Portugal, Alemania, Suiza, Italia y Luxemburgo.

Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer -

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

A map of Qatar is seen in this picture illustration June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Market researcher Kantar Worldpanel said grocery inflation was 3.4 percent in the 12 weeks to Nov. 5, with prices rising fastest in products such as butter, fish and cola and falling in only a few products, including crisps and fresh poultry.

It said that over the course of a year, this could add 143.7 pounds to a typical family’s grocery bill.

Official data released on Tuesday showed overall British consumer price inflation held at an annual rate of 3.0 percent in October, its highest level in five-and-a-half years.

Kantar Worldpanel said overall UK grocery sales increased in value by 3.2 percent year on year in the 12-week period.

“Volume sales have increased by less than 1 percent, meaning it’s price rises keeping supermarket performance buoyant,” Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel.

Of Britain’s big four grocers, Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L), the No. 2 player, was the best performer for the first time since April 2016, with a sales rise of 2.6 percent.

Sales at market leader Tesco (TSCO.L) increased 2.3 percent. Morrisons (MRW.L) and Asda (WMT.N) followed with rises of 2.1 percent and 1.5 percent respectively.

However, all of the big four still lost market share to German discounters Aldi and Lidl, which continue to open lots of new space.

Lidl was Britain’s fastest growing supermarket for the fifth straight period with sales up 15.1 percent.

After pumping some $10 trillion into financial markets since the 2008 crisis -- driving them many markets to record highs -- the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan are now trying to wean investors off easy money without causing an upset.

To do this, words will be key, the heads of the four central banks told an ECB conference on communication. It is called forward guidance in banker-speak, essentially warning gently of what is coming.

“Forward guidance has become a full-fledged monetary policy instrument,” ECB President Mario Draghi said. “Why discard a monetary policy instrument that has proved to be effective?”

Draghi and his three counterparts are at very different stages in roll-back process.

The Fed is looking at its fifth rate increase and the BOE raised its own rate this month for the first time in 10 years. But the ECB is merely reducing the pace of its bond purchases, and the BOJ is still printing money at full speed, although it has signaled that no additional stimulus is likely.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen agreed with Draghi that guidance has been beneficial “on balance” but stressed it should always be viewed as depending on how the economy actually develops.

“All guidance should be conditional and related to the outlook for the economy,” she said.

Banks such as the ECB often say the envisage doing something but reserve the right to change their mind if circumstances change.

History shows that preparing the ground for a withdrawal of stimulus is not always easy.

Then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke famously sent global bond markets into a tailspin in May 2013 by suggesting that bond purchases could be reduced. In the event, the “taper tantrum” meant bond buys would not be reduced for another 10 months.

Draghi had his own mini-tantrum in June when he hinted that the ECB’s policy could be tweaked to reflect stronger growth. The market sell-off that followed was so big the eventual scaling back of purchases was relatively small and drawn out.

And Bank of England Governor Mark Carney’s guidance on the path for interest rates has repeatedly been knocked off course by surprises in the economy, prompting one lawmaker to call him an “unreliable boyfriend”.

KEEP IT SIMPLE

Hyun Song Shin of the Bank of International Settlements told the ECB conference such unreliability was not necessarily all bad. Too much “predictability and gradualism” could lead investors to take on too much risk.

“Predictability and gradualism may not be a virtue if market participants take them as a commitment not to pull the rug from under their feet while they build up leverage and risk-taking,” the BIS’s head of research said.

Slideshow (3 Images)

Speaking alongside Yellen and Draghi, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the best way to avoid misunderstandings was to keep the message simple.

“It should better be straightforward,” he said. “That’s the best way.”

His UK counterpart, Carney, stressed the importance of reaching the broader public, rather than just financial investors.

“We’re speaking to the people we serve first,” Carney said. “Three hundred thousand people read the Financial Times; there are 30 million Facebook users in the UK.”

Yellen noted that conflicting messages by different Fed policymakers risked confusing the public.

Fed governors talk on an almost daily basis, Kuroda speaks frequently and some of the ECB’s 25 rate-setters appear to live a life of their own, sometimes giving speeches at odds with the ECB’s main policy lines.

A survey by the Brookings Institute think tank found that two-thirds of Fed watchers wanted governors to speak less frequently and over half wanted Yellen to speak more instead, to streamline and focus the message.

Yellen will be replaced as Fed chair in March next year, Carney and Draghi’s terms are up in 2019, and only this week a senior aide to Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe recommended that Bank of Japan governor Kuroda not be reappointed.",Top central bankers vow to talk investors out of easy money,https://www.reuters.com/article/ecb-policy-forwardguidance/top-central-bankers-vow-to-talk-investors-out-of-easy-money-idINKBN1DE1AN

Dax und EuroStoxx50 konnten ihre anfänglichen Gewinne nicht halten und notierten knapp ein halbes Prozent tiefer bei 13.140 und 3596 Punkten. “Die Berichtssaison hat die Laune der Anleger deutlich getrübt”, sagte Portfoliomanager Thomas Altmann vom Vermögensverwalter QC Partners. Viele Unternehmen hätten mit ihren Quartalszahlen enttäuscht oder gerade so die Erwartungen erfüllt, weshalb Anleger nun lieber Gewinne einsteckten, fügte ein Händler hinzu. Bereits am Donnerstag hatte der deutsche Leitindex 1,5 Prozent eingebüßt.

Der Dax war seit Ende Oktober von einem Rekord zum anderen geeilt und hatte am Dienstag mit 13.525 Punkten seinen vorläufigen Höchststand erreicht. Auch die Börsen in Japan und den USA waren wegen der Hoffnung von Anlegern auf einen globalen Wirtschaftsboom heißgelaufen. “Gewinnt die Abwärtsbewegung an Fahrt, könnte sogar die psychologische Marke bei 13.000 Zähler in den Fokus der Bären gelangen”, warnte Marktanalyst Christian Henke vom Brokerhaus IG. An der Börse ist der Bär das Symbol für fallende Kurse, der Bulle steht für steigende Kurse.

Stimmungsbremser war auch die anhaltende Sorge von Anlegern über Verzögerungen bei den von US-Präsident Donald Trump angekündigten Steuererleichterungen. Seine Republikaner im US-Kongress liegen bei den Plänen für die umfangreichste Steuerreform seit den 1980er Jahren noch weit auseinander. Vor allem über die Senkung der Unternehmenssteuern gibt es Streit. “Wenn sich die Pläne tatsächlich um ein Jahr verschieben, wird das Investoren enttäuschen”, sagte Investmentstratege Hirokazu Kabeya vom Broker Daiwa Securities.

Trump left for home from the Philippines after a lunch with the other leaders, as meetings were running about two hours behind schedule.

He told reporters on Air Force One that he had delivered his prepared remarks during the lunch instead of the summit meeting. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson would attend the plenary session in his place, a senior White House official said.

Trump said his trip had resulted in at least $300 billion, possibly triple that figure, of deals being agreed. He did not elaborate.

“We’ve explained that the United States is open for trade but we want reciprocal, we want fair trade for the United States,” he said.

Trade and concern about possible protectionism under Trump’s “America First” agenda have come up during his visit to the region, which included stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam before concluding in the Philippines.

Earlier in the day, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau raised the plight of Rohingya refugees and extra-judicial killings in the Philippines at the summit, sensitive human rights issues skirted by almost all the others.

There was no pressure from Trump over the Philippines’ bloody war on drugs during a meeting on Monday with President Rodrigo Duterte on the sidelines of the summit.

A joint statement after the meeting said the two sides “underscored that human rights and the dignity of human life are essential, and agreed to continue mainstreaming the human rights agenda in their national programs.”

However, Trudeau said that during his conversation with Duterte, he “mentioned human rights, rule of law and specifically extra-judicial killings as being an issue that Canada is concerned with.”

“The president was receptive to my comments and it was throughout a very cordial and positive exchange,” Trudeau told a news conference.

More than 3,900 pushers and users have been killed in the war on drugs that Duterte declared when he took office last year. His government says the police act in self-defense, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability.

Duterte cursed Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, last year for raising concerns about the war on drugs and he subsequently declared that he was breaking with the United States, a close ally of the Philippines since World War Two. Trump, by contrast, said on Monday he had a “great relationship” with Duterte.

ROHINGYA CRISIS

Trudeau said he also met Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and raised the plight of Rohingya refugees, although he did not mention the Muslim minority by name.

“This is a tremendous concern to Canada and to many, many countries around the world,” he said.

The government in mostly-Buddhist Myanmar regards the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and does not recognize the term.

Over 600,000 Rohingya have fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh since military clearance operations were launched in response to attacks by Rohingya militants on Aug. 25.

The plight of the Rohingya has brought outrage from around the world and there have been calls for democracy champion Suu Kyi to be stripped of the Nobel peace prize she won in 1991 because she has not condemned the military’s actions.

Some countries in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), particularly Muslim-majority Malaysia, have voiced strong concern over the issue recently.

However, in keeping with ASEAN’s principle of non-interference in each others’ internal affairs, it appeared to have been put aside at the summit, which brought Southeast Asian nations together with the United States, Japan, China, India, Australia and Canada.","Trump skips East Asia summit plenary, but says trip was a success",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asean-summit/trump-skips-east-asia-summit-plenary-but-says-trip-was-a-success-idUSKBN1DE0JE

Amazon said it will produce a multi-season series that explores new storylines preceding author J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Fellowship of the Ring,” the first installment in the famed fantasy trilogy.

Three movies made of the trilogy in the early 2000s, filmed in New Zealand by director Peter Jackson, garnered nearly $3 billion at the box office and 17 Academy Awards.

Amazon acquired the rights from the Tolkien Estate and Trust but did not say how much it paid for them. The estate, HarperCollins and the films’ distributor New Line Cinema will help Amazon produce the television series.

The project underscores a shift in Amazon’s video programming. Its studio started in 2010 with a focus on unique shows beloved by critics, such as “Transparent,” about a father coming out as transgender to his family.

That was a winning formula for attracting Hollywood talent, awards and buzz, though not Prime subscribers around the world.

Now, Amazon is looking for a dramatic show that could be a hit globally, much like HBO’s popular fantasy series “Game of Thrones.” It is going head to head with Netflix Inc, Hulu and others to bid for top content.

This puts Amazon in uncharted territory, with higher production costs expected.

Amazon justifies its spending on programming as a way to draw new sign-ups to Prime, whose members buy more goods more often from the world’s largest online retailer.

“Amazon Prime heads to Middle Earth,” Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in a Twitter post.

Although “The Lord of the Rings” is the most famous work to emerge from Tolkien’s pen, he wrote much else, including prequel “The Hobbit” - also made into a movie trilogy by Jackson - and the denser “The Silmarillion”. The Amazon series will delve into some of Tolkien’s work that the movies did not explore.

“Amazon is committed to producing super high quality, recognized, branded entertainment,” said Wedbush Securities industry analyst Michael Pachter. “That’s a departure from shows like ”Transparent“ and ”Catastrophe.“”

Tuesday’s report from the Labor Department also showed steady gains in underlying producer prices, which support expectations of a gradual increase in inflation and keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates in December.

The producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month after a similar gain in September. In the 12 months through October, the PPI jumped 2.8 percent, the largest increase since February 2012.

The PPI rose 2.6 percent year-on-year in September. Economists had forecast the PPI edging up 0.1 percent last month and increasing 2.4 percent from a year ago.

Prices for services advanced 0.5 percent last month after increasing 0.4 percent in September. A 24.9 percent surge in margins for fuels and lubricants retailing accounted for almost half of the increase in the cost of services last month.

That helped to offset a 4.6 percent drop in the cost of gasoline. Wholesale gasoline prices soared 10.9 percent in September in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas in late August and reduced refining capacity in the Gulf Coast area.

Gasoline prices are falling amid ample crude oil supplies. Last month’s rise in prices received by the nation’s farms, factories and refineries was also driven by rising costs for goods such as pharmaceutical preparations, fresh and dry vegetables, meat and tobacco.

The dollar pared losses against a basket of currencies after the data, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.

A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent last month. It has increased by the same margin for three straight months. The so-called core PPI increased 2.3 percent in the 12 months through October after advancing 2.1 percent in September.

A weakening dollar could gradually lift core PPI. The dollar has this year lost 5.4 percent of its value against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners.

Inflation has remained stubbornly low, despite the labor market nearing full employment. The main inflation measure tracked by the Fed has remained below the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target since mid-2012.

Despite moderate price pressures, the Fed is expected to raise interest rates next month. There is cautious optimism that tightening labor market conditions will spur faster wage growth next year.

The Fed has increased borrowing costs twice this year. October’s consumer inflation data scheduled for release on Wednesday could shed more light on the future course of monetary policy.

Last month, food prices rose 0.5 percent after being unchanged in September. Core goods increased 0.3 percent after a similar gain in the prior month. Prices for passenger cars were unchanged last month. The government introduced new motor vehicle pricing models into the survey in October.

A Reuters witness saw two other tanks parked beside the main road from Harare to Chinhoyi, about 20 km (14 miles) from the city. One, which was pointed in the direction of the capital, had come off its tracks. Soldiers at the scene refused to talk to Reuters.

Earlier on Tuesday the youth wing of Zimbabwe’s ruling party accused the military chief of subverting the constitution for threatening to intervene after President Robert Mugabe plunged the country into crisis by sacking Mnangagwa last week.

Mnangagwa, 75, a long-serving veteran of Zimbabwe’s 1970s liberation wars, had been viewed as a likely successor to Mugabe before the president fired him on Nov. 6.

His downfall appeared to pave the way for Mugabe’s wife Grace to succeed the 93-year-old president, the only leader Zimbabwe has known in 37 years of independence.

In an unprecedented step, the head of the armed forces, Constantino Chiwenga, openly threatened to intervene in politics on Monday if the purge of war veterans did not stop.

“We must remind those behind the current treacherous shenanigans that, when it comes to matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in,” Chiwenga said in a statement read to reporters at a news conference packed with top brass on Monday.

Grace Mugabe, 52, has developed a strong following in the powerful youth wing of the ruling ZANU-PF party.

However, he declined to register a user ID and the mask on the phone from scratch because, he said, the iPhone and mask need to be placed at very specific angles, and the mask to be refined, a process he said could take up to nine hours.

Apple declined to comment, referring journalists to a page on its website that explains how Face ID works.

That page says the probability of a random person unlocking another user’s phone with their face was approximately 1-in-a-million, compared to 1-in-50,000 for the previously used fingerprint scanner. It also says Face ID allows only five unsuccessful match attempts before a passcode is required.

Anh acknowledged that preparing the mask wasn’t easy, but he said he believed the demonstration showed facial recognition as a way to authenticate users would be risky for some.

“It’s not easy for normal people to do what we do here, but it’s a concern for people in the security sector and important people like politicians or heads of corporations,” he said.

“(These) important people should absolutely not lend their iPhone X to anyone if they have activated the Face ID function.”

It’s the first reported case of researchers apparently being able to fool the Face ID software.

Cybersecurity experts said the issue was not so much whether Face ID could be hacked, but how much effort a hack required.

“Nothing is 100 percent secure,” wrote Terry Ray, chief technology officer at U.S.-based cybersecurity company Imperva, in a note. “Where there’s a will, there’s a way. The questions are: How much trouble would someone go to, and how much would they spend, to get your data?”

Bkav’s Anh said the research took about a week, and included numerous failures. The mask frame was made of plastic, covered with paper tape to resemble skin, with a silicone nose and paper for eyes and mouth.

As far back as 2009, Bkav researchers highlighted what they said were problems with using facial recognition as a way to authenticate users. They said then that they had hacked three laptop manufacturers which used webcams to authenticate users.",Vietnamese researcher shows iPhone X face ID 'hack',https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-apple-vietnam-hack/vietnamese-researcher-shows-iphone-x-face-id-hack-idUKKBN1DE1TC

Consumer price inflation was unchanged from September’s five-and-a-half-year high of 3.0 percent, official data showed on Tuesday.

When the BoE raised benchmark borrowing costs for the first time in a decade in early November, it said it expected inflation would hit 3.2 percent in October before starting to fall slowly.

Sterling fell against the dollar after the data and British government bond prices rose, as markets lengthened the odds on the BoE following up this month’s hike with another one in the foreseeable future.

“Red faces all round as UK inflation fails to rise as widely expected, not least by the Bank of England,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at financial data company IHS Markit.

“Today’s numbers will dampen expectations on whether we will see further rate hikes any time soon.”

British inflation has surged from just 0.5 percent at the time of the June 2016 vote to leave the European Union as the fall in the pound pushed up the cost of imported goods.

Tuesday’s data spared BoE’s governor Mark Carney the embarrassment of having to write to finance minister Philip Hammond to explain how the BoE missed its 2 percent inflation target by more than a percentage point.

But the figures will add to criticisms from many economists who said this month’s rate rise was unnecessary against a backdrop of a slowing domestic economy and weak productivity and wage growth.

With the worst of the Brexit impact on prices now past, the critics of the BoE decision saw little need to raise rates at a time when Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU remains highly uncertain.

DATA DILEMMA

The Bank argues that leaving the EU will damage Britain’s ability to grow as fast as before without generating excess inflation, and that the lowest unemployment rate since 1975 makes labor shortages and a rebound in wage growth a risk.

It has said it still expects inflation to be slightly above target in three years’ time.

Paul Diggle, a senior economist at Aberdeen Asset Management, said inflation would pick up again due to rising oil prices and residual effects of the weaker pound.

“The Bank of England is stuck between a rock and a hard place. On balance, we think (it) will have to hike interest rates at least once more next year.”

A measure of retail price inflation, used to calculate payments on government bonds and many commercial contracts, hit a near six-year high of 4.0 percent, providing bad news for Hammond who is due to announce a budget plan on Nov. 22.

But other data showed that some underlying price pressures are easing.

Costs of manufacturers’ raw materials - much of them imported - were 4.6 percent higher than in October 2016, down from an increase of 8.1 percent in September.

It’s an awesome display of U.S. military power and reach, a reminder of Washington’s unparalleled ability to project global force. At the same time, however, it’s also a sign of how stretched those forces have become.

Getting three carriers to the Pacific has been an intrinsic part of Washington’s strategy to intimidate North Korea. But to do so required pulling forces from a host of other potential conflict areas, including the Gulf.

The ever-increasing demand for military resources in a growing number of places is causing increased concern in the U.S. military. In June, a report by the U.S. Army War College described America’s military clout as “fraying” and bluntly concluded that the era of U.S. global military primacy that followed the fall of the Berlin wall was over. America’s armed forces have a variety of strategies to tackle that decline but the truth is that coming wars will look very different from the sort of military deployments taken for granted in the recent past.

The change from a decade or so ago could scarcely be starker. In the aftermath of 9/11, America’s conventional military capability was narrowly focused on a handful of locations, primarily Iraq and Afghanistan. The resources plowed into them were stupendous – $5.6 trillion so far, academics at Brown University estimated this month. That would imply a cost per individual U.S. taxpayer of more than $23,000, including future care for veterans.

At their height, those wars dominated U.S. military thinking, planning and workload in a way that is hard to overstate. Working from Pentagon figures, the Brown researchers estimate that some 2.7 million American service personnel passed through those two countries in that time, more than half of them deploying more than once. Officially, however, these conflicts were never seen as endless wars – the hope was always that one last surge of troops would win the day and allow a larger withdrawal.

That didn’t happen, and U.S. military planners now assume there will be a substantial presence in Iraq, Afghanistan and several other countries for years, if not decades, to come. Since the middle of the Obama administration, however, the Pentagon has quietly and comprehensively changed its approach to those wars, aiming for a much more sustainable “advise and assist” model working through local forces.

Speaking at the Association of the U.S. Army meeting in Washington in October, U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley made it clear he expected such missions to grow substantially in the years to come. The success of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria demonstrates such tactics can work. But there have also been substantial failures and wastage, not least in Afghanistan where local security forces continue to struggle despite absorbing $70 billion of U.S. funding since 2001.

Much of the burden of U.S. operations in the last 15 years has fallen on a handful of special operations units, whose budgets, personnel numbers and deployments have all risen dramatically. They are now dangerously overstretched, and the U.S. Army is now looking to create more mainstream units to take on unconventional deployments.

With much of the fighting left to local forces, U.S. casualties are substantially lower. But as the death of four U.S. Green Berets in Niger last month demonstrated, putting troops far forward with less backup than they could call on in Iraq and Afghanistan means that when things go wrong, they go bad fast.

The aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt leaves San Diego, California,October 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake

Another awkward truth: In the last year U.S. personnel have been more likely to die in accidents than action, the result of a series of incidents including the high profile collisions of destroyers USS Fitzgerald and McCain. That toll suggests that even the parts of the U.S. military that have not been fighting wars are perhaps dangerously overstretched.

That’s been particularly true in Asia, where both the Fitzgerald and McCain were based. Tensions with China and North Korea have kept those units on high alert. In Europe too, heightened tensions with Russia have resulted in a scale of U.S. military activity unseen since the Cold War. U.S. troops, planes, ships and submarines are now on almost continuous exercises to reassure allies and track Russia’s increasingly active forces as Moscow probes NATO air and sea borders.

The Pentagon budget – $825 billion this fiscal year – is rising, and continues to dwarf that of any other nation. But it is also spread much more widely. China and Russia – spending $146 billion and 70 billion respectively – lack America’s global reach, but are more aggressively focused on their own immediate neighborhoods. Both have aggressively plowed resources into techniques and tactics such as cyber warfare and missiles that U.S. tacticians worry might give them the edge in any local war.

Some of that was expected – the Obama administration began its “pivot” to Asia in 2012 because of the perceived growing China threat. Much, however, was not – not least the speed with which North Korea has raced towards being able to strike the U.S. with nuclear-tipped missiles.

Washington’s military capabilities still dwarf anyone else’s. But it now faces a very real danger that its foes may be able to bleed it to death without ever confronting it in battle.",Commentary: The truth behind the U.S. show of force in Asia,https://in.reuters.com/article/us-apps-military-commentary/commentary-the-truth-behind-the-u-s-show-of-force-in-asia-idINKBN1DD20A

A desperate 0-0 draw at home to a defiant, belligerent and technically inferior Sweden ended the four-time world champions’ hopes of reaching next year’s finals in Russia and with it the international careers of several of Italy’s biggest names.

The Swedes, whose starting lineup included only four players based with teams in Europe’s so-called big five leagues, will take their place after qualifying for the first time since 2006.

The Italians have only failed to qualify for the tournament once before - missing out on the 1958 finals in Sweden - after not entering the first World Cup in 1930.

The players sank to their knees as the final whistle went, the starkest possible contrast to the Swedish joy, knowing that the match will leave an indelible stain on their careers.

It was also the tear-jerking end to the career of their 39-year-old goalkeeper and captain Gianluigi Buffon who made his Italy debut 20 years ago against Russia - on the last occasion that Italy had to face a playoff for a World Cup place.

LAST GAME

“It’s upsetting that my last Italy game coincides with our elimination for the World Cup,” said Buffon, a World Cup winner in 2006. “That’s my only regret, because time goes by and its cruel but that’s how it is.”

“Sport teaches you to lose and win as a group and share joy and pain. The coach has the same degree of blame as us.”

Daniele De Rossi, Italy’s fearsome bearded midfielder who was surprisingly left on the bench on Monday, also announced his international retirement at 34 after 117 appearances.

Defenders Giorgio Chiellini and Andrea Barzagli are almost certain to follow suit.

However, Gian Piero Ventura, at 69 the oldest coach Italy has ever had, refused to confirm that he would step down, saying he needed to talk to the federation first.

Ventura made four changes to the team which lost 1-0 in Stockholm on Friday in the first leg and which was fiercely criticized for its lack of flair in attack.

Brazilian-born midfielder Jorginho was thrust into his first competitive international while Napoli’s flamboyant winger Lorenzo Insigne was once again on the bench.

POOR FINISHING

After a scrappy opening 20 minutes, Italy took control and pressed forward in waves.

They had penalty appeals turned down and were repeatedly denied by outstanding Sweden goalkeeper Robin Olsen but were also let down by some desperately poor finishing and final passes, possibly born of desperation.

As the game wore on, Italy’s moves became more rushed and their passing increasingly sloppy and the clear-cut chances dried up.

There is likely to be some long and deep soul-searching once the dust has settled as Italians wonder how it all came to this.

“I absolutely apologize for the result but not for the effort we put in or our desire to win,” said Ventura, whose deadpan style could not be further removed from the high-energy approach of his predecessor Antonio Conte.

His opposite number Jan Andersson admitted his side had to cling on to their first-leg lead.

“We had no weapons left. We just had to sit there and hope that we could hang on,” he said. “We couldn’t do it in any other way, they are so skilful.”",Stunned Italy fail to reach World Cup as Sweden qualify,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFKBN1DE0RH-OZASP

The measures -- which freeze the assets of the officials and bar them from visiting Canada -- were enacted through a new law giving the government the right to penalize those it says are guilty of human rights violations, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Among those targeted are Alexander Bastrykin, Russia’s top investigator and a close aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The United States blacklisted him in January 2017, citing Magnitsky’s death.

“Today’s announcement sends a clear message that Canada will take action against individuals who have profited from acts of significant corruption or who have been involved in gross violations of human rights,” said Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland.

Moscow said last month it would retaliate if Canada banned individuals under the new law.

The Russian embassy in Ottawa later issued a statement denouncing the sanctions as “absolutely pointless and reprehensible”.

Canada has repeatedly condemned Moscow over Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and imposed sanctions along with other Western nations.

High-risk binary options allow people to place bets on whether the value of securities such as shares, commodities, indices and currencies will rise or fall over periods that can be as short as 30 seconds or five minutes.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it would take over regulating firms that offer binary options, that can lure investors by advertising on social media under an illusion of respectability, from the Gambling Commission on Jan. 3.

The move comes after nearly 700 people reported losing a total of more than 18 million pounds on binary options scams in the first six months of this year, prompting police to raid 20 London offices last month as part of a broader crackdown on investment frauds.

The FCA warned investors that fraudsters were linking binary options adverts to websites that appear professional, promising higher-than-average returns for bets that are never placed, manipulating software to distort prices and payouts and often refusing to pay winnings before disappearing.

From next January, victims will be able to seek redress at the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, a safety net for investors in regulated businesses.

Countries such as Israel and Belgium have banned binary options trading, while the United States requires them to be traded on regulated markets.

The FCA also issued a warning to investors about the risks of putting money into speculative cryptocurrency contracts for differences (CFDs).

Cryptocurrency CFDs allow investors to speculate on a change in price of a virtual currency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which have proved volatile. The CFDs can have little price transparency, come with high charges and with leverage that can multiply losses.

The FCA said it did regulate CFDs, but warned such bets should only be placed by experienced investors with sophisticated knowledge of financial markets.",FCA takes on binary options scams,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-investments-warnings/fca-takes-on-binary-options-scams-idUKKBN1DE1K8?il=0

An announcement on Friday by Bkav, a Vietnamese cybersecurity firm, that it had cracked Apple’s Face ID, and a subsequent video apparently showing an iPhone being unlocked when pointed at a mask, were greeted with some skepticism.

Ngo Tuan Anh, Bkav’s vice president, gave Reuters several demonstrations, first unlocking the phone with his face and then by using the mask. It appeared to work each time.

However, he declined to register a user ID and the mask on the phone from scratch because, he said, the iPhone and mask need to be placed at very specific angles, and the mask to be refined, a process he said could take up to nine hours.

Apple declined to comment, referring journalists to a page on its website that explains how Face ID works.

That page says the probability of a random person unlocking another user’s phone with their face was approximately 1-in-a-million, compared to 1-in-50,000 for the previously used fingerprint scanner. It also says Face ID allows only five unsuccessful match attempts before a passcode is required.

Anh acknowledged that preparing the mask wasn’t easy, but he said he believed the demonstration showed facial recognition as a way to authenticate users would be risky for some.

“It’s not easy for normal people to do what we do here, but it’s a concern for people in the security sector and important people like politicians or heads of corporations,” he said.

“(These) important people should absolutely not lend their iPhone X to anyone if they have activated the Face ID function.”

It’s the first reported case of researchers apparently being able to fool the Face ID software.

Cybersecurity experts said the issue was not so much whether Face ID could be hacked, but how much effort a hack required.

“Nothing is 100 percent secure,” wrote Terry Ray, chief technology officer at U.S.-based cybersecurity company Imperva, in a note. “Where there’s a will, there’s a way. The questions are: How much trouble would someone go to, and how much would they spend, to get your data?”

Bkav’s Anh said the research took about a week, and included numerous failures. The mask frame was made of plastic, covered with paper tape to resemble skin, with a silicone nose and paper for eyes and mouth.

As far back as 2009, Bkav researchers highlighted what they said were problems with using facial recognition as a way to authenticate users. They said then that they had hacked three laptop manufacturers which used webcams to authenticate users.",Vietnamese researcher shows iPhone X face ID 'hack',https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-vietnam-hack/vietnamese-researcher-shows-iphone-x-face-id-hack-idUKKBN1DE1TH?il=0

The warrant comes at an awkward time for Pakistan, which wants to raise in excess of $1 billion on international debt markets through a Sukuk and a Eurobond in coming months and has been trying to woo international investors.

Dar, who has been charged with amassing wealth beyond his known sources of income, has missed three weeks of court hearings conducted by the anti-graft agency the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).

Judge Mohammad Bashir issued the warrant on the grounds of “continued absence” from the court, according to a court statement.

Dar, who has pleaded not guilty, is receiving medical treatment in London and now faces arrest upon his return to Pakistan.

The case has been adjourned until Nov. 21.

The charges against Dar followed an investigation into the finances of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was ousted in July after the Supreme Court disqualified him for not declaring a small salary from his son’s off-shore company.

The finance minister is one of Sharif’s closest political allies and Dar’s son has married Sharif’s daughter. Both men deny any wrongdoing.

Dar has rejected growing calls to resign amid his legal woes and a worsening economic outlook for Pakistan, which is battling to stave off a balance of payments crisis due to dwindling foreign currency reserve and a widening current account deficit.

Dar was initially lauded for steering Pakistan out of a balance of payments crisis in 2013 and returning the nuclear-armed country toward a higher growth trajectory.

But over the past year he has faced criticism for his refusal to allow the rupee to weaken to ease macroeconomic pressures. He has also been accused of eroding the central bank’s independence.",Pakistan court issues arrest warrant for finance minister,https://www.reuters.com/article/pakistan-minister/pakistan-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-finance-minister-idINKBN1DE15I?il=0

Survivors, many left homeless by the 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck villages and towns in a mountainous area bordering Iraq, battled overnight temperatures just above freezing and faced another bleak day on Tuesday in need of food and water.

The death toll of 530, reported by state news agency IRNA, made it Iran’s deadliest earthquake in more than a decade. Thousands of people were injured and 30,000 homes damaged. Two whole villages were destroyed.

The quake struck on the Iran-Iraq border, causing most of its damage in Iran despite an epicenter on the Iraq side of the frontier. Iraqi officials said seven people were killed and 325 injured in Iraq, all in the northern Kurdish provinces.

Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani arrived in the morning in the stricken area in Kermanshah province and promised that the government would “use all its power to resolve the problems in the shortest time”.

Thousands of people huddled in makeshift camps while many others chose to spend a second night in the open, despite low temperatures, because they feared more tremors after some 193 aftershocks, state television said.

A homeless young woman in Sarpol-e Zahab, one of the hardest-hit towns, told state TV that her family was exposed to the night cold because of lack of tents.

“We need help. We need everything. The authorities should speed up their help,” she said.

Television showed rescue workers combing through the rubble of dozens of villages immediately after the quake. But by Tuesday morning Iranian officials said there was no longer any likelihood of finding survivors and called the rescue off.

“The rescue operations in Kermanshah province have ended,” Pir-Hossein Kolivand, head of Iran’s Emergency Medical Services, said.

Iran’s top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, offered his condolences on Monday to the victims and called on government agencies to do all they could to help.

The Iranian army, the elite Revolutionary Guards and forces of its affiliated Basij militia were dispatched to affected areas on Sunday night.

BITTER COLD

Hospitals in nearby provinces took in many of the injured, state television said, airing footage of survivors waiting to be treated. Hundreds of critically injured were dispatched to hospitals in Tehran.

Iran’s Red Crescent said emergency shelter had been provided for thousands of homeless people, but a lack of water and electricity as well as blocked roads in some areas hindered aid supply efforts.

“People in some villages are still in dire need of food, water and shelter,” said the governor of Qasr-e Shirin county in Kermanshah province, Faramarz Akbari.

The mayor of Ezgeleh, a city in Kermanshah, said 80 percent of its buildings had collapsed. Survivors desperately needed tents with elderly people and babies as young as one-year-old sleeping in the cold for two straight nights.

In an interview with state television, Nazar Barani asked people to send fuel, milk, water and food as emergency services were too slow and providing limited provisions.

“People are hungry and thirsty,” a local man told ISNA news agency. “There is no electricity. Last night I cried when I saw children with no food or shelter.”

Houses in Iranian villages are often made of concrete blocks or mudbrick that can crumble and collapse in a strong quake. Some people are angry that among the collapsed buildings were homes that the government has built in recent years under an affordable housing program.

Photographs posted on Iranian news websites showed rescue workers digging people out of collapsed buildings, cars smashed beneath rubble and rescue dogs trying to find signs of life under the twisted ruins.

“More people will die because of cold. My family lives in a village near Sarpol-e Zahab. I cannot even go there. I don’t know whether they are dead or alive,” Rojan Meshkat, 38, in the Kurdish city of Sanandaj told Reuters by telephone.

Iran is crisscrossed by major fault lines and has suffered several devastating earthquakes in recent years, including a 6.6 magnitude quake in 2003 that reduced the historic southeastern city of Bam to dust and killed some 31,000 people.","Iran ends quake rescue operations, hungry survivors battle cold",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1DD2SO-OCATP

Tuesday’s report from the Labor Department also showed steady gains in underlying producer prices, which support expectations of a gradual increase in inflation and keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates in December.

The producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month after a similar gain in September. In the 12 months through October, the PPI jumped 2.8 percent, the largest increase since February 2012.

The PPI rose 2.6 percent year-on-year in September. Economists had forecast the PPI edging up 0.1 percent last month and increasing 2.4 percent from a year ago.

Prices for services advanced 0.5 percent last month after increasing 0.4 percent in September. A 24.9 percent surge in margins for fuels and lubricants retailing accounted for almost half of the increase in the cost of services last month.

That helped to offset a 4.6 percent drop in the cost of gasoline. Wholesale gasoline prices soared 10.9 percent in September in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas in late August and reduced refining capacity in the Gulf Coast area.

Gasoline prices are falling amid ample crude oil supplies. Last month’s rise in prices received by the nation’s farms, factories and refineries was also driven by rising costs for goods such as pharmaceutical preparations, fresh and dry vegetables, meat and tobacco.

The dollar pared losses against a basket of currencies after the data, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.

A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent last month. It has increased by the same margin for three straight months. The so-called core PPI increased 2.3 percent in the 12 months through October after advancing 2.1 percent in September.

A weakening dollar could gradually lift core PPI. The dollar has this year lost 5.4 percent of its value against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners.

Inflation has remained stubbornly low, despite the labor market nearing full employment. The main inflation measure tracked by the Fed has remained below the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target since mid-2012.

Despite moderate price pressures, the Fed is expected to raise interest rates next month. There is cautious optimism that tightening labor market conditions will spur faster wage growth next year.

The Fed has increased borrowing costs twice this year. October’s consumer inflation data scheduled for release on Wednesday could shed more light on the future course of monetary policy.

Last month, food prices rose 0.5 percent after being unchanged in September. Core goods increased 0.3 percent after a similar gain in the prior month. Prices for passenger cars were unchanged last month. The government introduced new motor vehicle pricing models into the survey in October.

The cost of healthcare services gained 0.3 percent after being unchanged in September.

Bombardier Commercial Aircraft President Fred Cromer could not say whether EgyptAir would be the first Middle East airline to operate the CSeries.

No Middle East customer has said when it would take delivery of CSeries jets.

A U.S. trade commission will decide in early 2018 on whether to impose duties of nearly 300 percent on the CSeries, after Boeing complained the planes had been subsidised and sold below cost in the United States.

Airbus agreed in October to take a majority stake in Bombardier’s CSeries jetliner program, and has said any CSeries jets intended for the U.S. market would be built at its production facility in Alabama, potentially allowing the planes to avoid punitive duties.

Cromer said EgyptAir’s CSeries jets would be built in Canada, if the Middle East carrier confirms its order.

The LOI also includes purchasing options for a further 12 CSeries which if exercised would increase the total value of the deal to nearly $2.2 billion.",EgyptAir signs $1.1 billion preliminary deal for 12 Bombardier CSeries jets,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1DE1HW-OCADN

The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

“It is nice that I get to have someone like David Einhorn and other members of the investment team pick apart their ideas,” he said.",Scooters instead of boardroom 'kabuki': how one fund manager picks winners,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedgefunds-greenlightmasters/scooters-instead-of-boardroom-kabuki-how-one-fund-manager-picks-winners-idUSKBN1930DA

After pumping some $10 trillion into financial markets since the 2008 crisis -- driving them many markets to record highs -- the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan are now trying to wean investors off easy money without causing an upset.

To do this, words will be key, the heads of the four central banks told an ECB conference on communication. It is called forward guidance in banker-speak, essentially warning gently of what is coming.

“Forward guidance has become a full-fledged monetary policy instrument,” ECB President Mario Draghi said. “Why discard a monetary policy instrument that has proved to be effective?”

Draghi and his three counterparts are at very different stages in roll-back process.

The Fed is looking at its fifth rate increase and the BOE raised its own rate this month for the first time in 10 years. But the ECB is merely reducing the pace of its bond purchases, and the BOJ is still printing money at full speed, although it has signaled that no additional stimulus is likely.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen agreed with Draghi that guidance has been beneficial “on balance” but stressed it should always be viewed as depending on how the economy actually develops.

“All guidance should be conditional and related to the outlook for the economy,” she said.

Banks such as the ECB often say the envisage doing something but reserve the right to change their mind if circumstances change.

History shows that preparing the ground for a withdrawal of stimulus is not always easy.

Then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke famously sent global bond markets into a tailspin in May 2013 by suggesting that bond purchases could be reduced. In the event, the “taper tantrum” meant bond buys would not be reduced for another 10 months.

Draghi had his own mini-tantrum in June when he hinted that the ECB’s policy could be tweaked to reflect stronger growth. The market sell-off that followed was so big the eventual scaling back of purchases was relatively small and drawn out.

And Bank of England Governor Mark Carney’s guidance on the path for interest rates has repeatedly been knocked off course by surprises in the economy, prompting one lawmaker to call him an “unreliable boyfriend”.

KEEP IT SIMPLE

Hyun Song Shin of the Bank of International Settlements told the ECB conference such unreliability was not necessarily all bad. Too much “predictability and gradualism” could lead investors to take on too much risk.

“Predictability and gradualism may not be a virtue if market participants take them as a commitment not to pull the rug from under their feet while they build up leverage and risk-taking,” the BIS’s head of research said.

Speaking alongside Yellen and Draghi, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the best way to avoid misunderstandings was to keep the message simple.

“It should better be straightforward,” he said. “That’s the best way.”

His UK counterpart, Carney, stressed the importance of reaching the broader public, rather than just financial investors.

“We’re speaking to the people we serve first,” Carney said. “Three hundred thousand people read the Financial Times; there are 30 million Facebook users in the UK.”

Yellen noted that conflicting messages by different Fed policymakers risked confusing the public.

Fed governors talk on an almost daily basis, Kuroda speaks frequently and some of the ECB’s 25 rate-setters appear to live a life of their own, sometimes giving speeches at odds with the ECB’s main policy lines.

A survey by the Brookings Institute think tank found that two-thirds of Fed watchers wanted governors to speak less frequently and over half wanted Yellen to speak more instead, to streamline and focus the message.

Yellen will be replaced as Fed chair in March next year, Carney and Draghi’s terms are up in 2019, and only this week a senior aide to Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe recommended that Bank of Japan governor Kuroda not be reappointed.",Top central bankers vow to talk investors out of easy money,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecb-policy-forwardguidance/top-central-bankers-vow-to-talk-investors-out-of-easy-money-idUSKBN1DE18E

A Suécia havia acabado de obter uma vitória no agregado de 1 x 0 sobre a Itália com um elenco sem grandes nomes, um time que roubou o segundo lugar do Grupo A da Holanda nas eliminatórias e derrotou a França em casa antes de eliminar os italianos -- tudo isso sem Zlatan.

Where British journalism fails to convey the dimensions of the mess, foreign journalists oblige. Steven Erlanger of the New York Times told his Sunday readers in early November that the country is “heading to nowhere, while on deck, fire has broken out and the captain — poor Theresa May — is lashed to the mast, without the authority to decide whether to turn to port or to starboard.” The Irish writer Fintan O’Toole writes in the New York Review of Books that “Brexit is fueled by fantasies of “Empire 2.0,” a reconstructed global trading empire in which the old colonies will be reconnected to the mother country.”

The first of these, if finely phrased, is overblown; the second is absurd. No-one but a real fantasist believes the empire can be reconstituted, or wishes it to be. But schadenfreude is too attractive an emotion to pass up, an occasion to pay the U.K. back for its haughtiness to other countries it deems less well governed than itself.

The real question here is whether the May government can survive. And what happens if it can’t?

The current mess is the result of the workings of democracy, which decreed opening the gates to the barbarians. Barbarians are the forces which mainstream politicians try to keep outside the walls; now, they have forced an entry. In the United States, the invasion is led by Donald Trump: his barbarians are those who take seriously his calls to “drain the swamp” (of Washington) and “put America first” (by de-linking it from much of what is understood by globalization).

Britain’s barbarians have breached the walls of both major parties. Labour is now led by a group of far leftists, gathered round the figure of Jeremy Corbyn, a man who believes in the socialization of much of the economy, has supported and praised the IRA, Hamas and Hezbollah and favors a call for the former Labour leader, Tony Blair, to be tried for war crimes. Corbyn and his fellow radical members of parliament were barely tolerated by the rest of their parliamentary colleagues, yet when he ran for Labour’s leadership in 2015, a sudden swell of support from mainly young party members propelled him, astonished, to the leadership. The barbarians had flooded in; the party’s unexpectedly good showing in the general election this summer confirmed they were inside the walls to stay.

The Conservative barbarians are those who hate Britain’s membership of the European Union. The parliamentary barbarian group – a minority – plagued the leadership: John Major, prime minister from 1991-1997, called them, unaware of an open microphone, “bastards”. Their strength forced David Cameron, prime minister from 2010-2016, into the fateful decision to put the issue of EU membership to a referendum. He lost, and so the victorious barbarians inherited the party.

It was not, however, one of their number who became prime minister. That was “poor Theresa May”, an unenthusiastic European Union remainer, who won the party leadership over two Brexiteer challengers, but who fully accepted that the people had spoken and Britain’s exit from the EU would be pursued.

In that pursuit, a sea of troubles has washed about her, and about the country. Many in her cabinet are not Brexiteers; they believe that exit is folly, and seek to extend the period of leaving the Union in order to give British business and finance more time to prepare for the new conditions. The three cabinet members most concerned with Brexit include Boris Johnson, the unpredictable Foreign Secretary, who differed sharply with the cautious chancellor, Philip Hammond, a Remainer, on the timetable for leaving. David Davis, the main negotiator with the EU on the terms of Brexit, was called stupid, lazy and “vain as Narcissus” by the former campaign director of the Vote Leave campaign, a supposed ally. The upper reaches of the governing party are murderous.

Negotiations are, in any case, going badly. The EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, has insisted on a rigid timetable which doesn’t suit the UK, while issues like the amount the U.K. must pay before leaving remains a block on progress.

The sea has been made much rougher by a growing sexual harassment scandal that led to the resignation of defense minister Michael Fallon. Damian Green, effectively the deputy prime minister, is fighting allegations of harassment and “extreme pornography” said to have been found on his parliamentary computer.

The scandals multiply, usually displayed at the top of TV bulletins and on front pages. A careless remark by Foreign Secretary Johnson may have prolonged the prison sentence of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British citizen jailed in Iran on spying charges by wrongly claiming she had been training journalists there. Lord Ashcroft, a major Conservative donor, was revealed in the “Paradise Papers” leak to have sheltered a large part of his wealth offshore.

He was not alone: both the Queen and her son, Prince Charles, were revealed by the leak as having benefitted from tax-free shelters.

In the same week, International Development Secretary Priti Patel was forced to resign when she was found to have concealed a series of meetings with Israeli ministers without the knowledge of either the Foreign Office or the prime minister. Patel’s replacement – Penny Mordaunt – had to be, like her, a keen Brexiteer; May does not have the freedom to choose on the basis of competence, only on the basis of alignment.

The prime minister is clearly weak, and has been since nearly losing the election to Labour. The enormity of the task – of unpicking hundreds of regulations, laws and agreements while forging new trading links, staunching a retreat of the finance sector from the City of London, attracting new and keeping established investment and combating the Scots nationalists who continue to threaten another referendum on independence – calls for strength and confidence.

Neither is much in evidence. The assumption of weakness is such that speculation on who could follow May as prime minister is a daily game. Most bets are on Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary and former journalist – clever, agile and a keen Brexiteer, but inheriting the same gnawing problems with which May has been forced to grapple. Were the Conservatives to lose their thin majority in the Commons on a confidence vote, a new election would be ordered – with the far-left-led Labour Party, on present poll figures, favorite. The country would then be even more deeply divided than before.

This is barbarian rule, otherwise known as democracy. Tens of millions in the democratic world experience insecurity, stagnant incomes or fear of mass immigration – sometimes all of these. They have chosen to vote for barbarians because the civilized people were not, they thought, caring, or at least not responding. Deeply uncomfortable, even dangerous, as the effects are, the rules by which states which offer political choice live must respect these votes. And hope for civilization to win, even among the barbarians.",Commentary: Britain’s mess extends beyond Brexit,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-brexit-commentary/commentary-britains-mess-extends-beyond-brexit-idUSKBN1DA2ON

Tuesday’s report from the Labor Department also showed steady gains in underlying producer prices, which support expectations of a gradual increase in inflation and keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates in December.

The producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month after a similar gain in September. In the 12 months through October, the PPI jumped 2.8 percent, the largest increase since February 2012.

The PPI rose 2.6 percent year-on-year in September. Economists had forecast the PPI edging up 0.1 percent last month and increasing 2.4 percent from a year ago.

Prices for services advanced 0.5 percent last month after increasing 0.4 percent in September. A 24.9 percent surge in margins for fuels and lubricants retailing accounted for almost half of the increase in the cost of services last month.

That helped to offset a 4.6 percent drop in the cost of gasoline. Wholesale gasoline prices soared 10.9 percent in September in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas in late August and reduced refining capacity in the Gulf Coast area.

Gasoline prices are falling amid ample crude oil supplies. Last month’s rise in prices received by the nation’s farms, factories and refineries was also driven by rising costs for goods such as pharmaceutical preparations, fresh and dry vegetables, meat and tobacco.

The dollar pared losses against a basket of currencies after the data, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.

A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent last month. It has increased by the same margin for three straight months. The so-called core PPI increased 2.3 percent in the 12 months through October after advancing 2.1 percent in September.

A weakening dollar could gradually lift core PPI. The dollar has this year lost 5.4 percent of its value against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners.

Inflation has remained stubbornly low, despite the labor market nearing full employment. The main inflation measure tracked by the Fed has remained below the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target since mid-2012.

Despite moderate price pressures, the Fed is expected to raise interest rates next month. There is cautious optimism that tightening labor market conditions will spur faster wage growth next year.

The Fed has increased borrowing costs twice this year. October’s consumer inflation data scheduled for release on Wednesday could shed more light on the future course of monetary policy.

Last month, food prices rose 0.5 percent after being unchanged in September. Core goods increased 0.3 percent after a similar gain in the prior month. Prices for passenger cars were unchanged last month. The government introduced new motor vehicle pricing models into the survey in October.

The cost of healthcare services gained 0.3 percent after being unchanged in September.

A fifth round of negotiations to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement begins this week in Mexico City, weighed down by several contentious U.S. proposals that even some U.S. business leaders have labeled “poison pills” to the process.

From demands that the deal establish minimum U.S. limits in NAFTA auto content to scrapping a key dispute mechanism and adding an automatic expiry clause, the U.S. measures soured the mood in the previous round of talks in Virginia last month.

They have stirred fears that U.S. President Donald Trump could follow through on threats to dump NAFTA, creating a potential conflict with free trade proponents in the Republican Party whose support he wants for his planned tax cuts.

And with scant evidence that either side is prepared to give ground on the thorniest issues, narrowing differences on them this time is unlikely, Mexican and Canadian officials said.

“There’s been no movement on the tough stuff,” said Bosco de la Vega, head of Mexico’s National Agricultural Council (CNA), the main farming lobby, which is resisting another U.S. proposal that could restrict trade in seasonal foodstuffs.

However, there is still hope for progress on less divisive matters, officials said, pointing to signs of growing consensus on topics including telecommunications, e-commerce and small businesses, as well as some technical regulations.

Throughout, negotiators will be mindful of the debate in the U.S. Congress over the planned tax cuts, which have come under scrutiny for their potential impact on the federal deficit.

“All the political oxygen here has been absorbed by tax reform,” said Representative Frank Lucas of Oklahoma, a senior Republican on the House Agriculture Committee who is eager to keep NAFTA alive. “Everything is tax, 100 percent of the time.”

NAFTA working groups are due to begin meeting from Wednesday in Mexico to discuss issues ranging from textiles and services to labor and intellectual property. On Friday, talks will formally get underway through Nov. 21.

Should the U.S. side raise the so-called “poison pills,” Mexico and Canada do not intend to discuss them or propose compromises to dilute them, two officials from the countries said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the negotiations.

“We reject anything to do with national (auto) content,” said one Mexican official involved in the NAFTA discussions, calling the U.S. attitude to the process “short-sighted.”

U.S. business groups have spoken out against the national content proposal but many officials close to the talks believe that Trump is paying little heed to their concerns. That has fueled fears that whatever concessions Mexico and Canada might eventually make, it would “never be enough,” said one in Mexico.

Still, if Trump advances on the tax plan, it is more likely to help NAFTA talks than harm them, said the CNA’s de la Vega.

“What we know from our U.S. counterparts is that they’re saying, listen: we see that the future of (NAFTA talks) will depend on the success or failure of the tax reform. It will have a direct impact on NAFTA. How much? Who knows?” he said.

The 58 billion pound mobile operator and cable group Liberty Global ended talks over a tie-up in 2015. The possibility of a deal hasn’t gone away. But an improving outlook and fibre-broadband growth plans in Germany and Britain make a combination with John Malone’s group – or anyone else – less urgent.

Boss Vittorio Colao upped his EBITDA growth forecast for the financial year ending in March 2018 to 10 percent excluding currency movements, deals, joint ventures and one-offs. The previous forecast of between 4 percent and 8 percent was outstripped by improved cost cutting, price increases and new customers added in the six months to the end of September.

Long-running problems such as a near-stagnant top line in Europe, which accounts for about three-quarters of revenue from ongoing services, are still evident in Tuesday’s half-year report. Vodafone’s European service revenue grew by a modest 0.8 percent in organic terms compared with the same period last year. Colao has little room to increase mobile revenue in places like Germany, Italy, Britain and Spain given an already-high market share and the threat from low-price competitors like Iliad in Italy. Vodafone also lacks the expansive fixed-line internet infrastructure inherited by former monopolies BT, Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia that allows them to cross-sell fixed and mobile services.

Teaming up with Liberty Global, which has fixed-line networks in Germany and Britain, once seemed almost the only solution. No longer. Vodafone’s adjusted EBITDA is increasing in both markets, despite sluggishly growing or shrinking sales. Colao has announced plans to spend 2 billion euros building ultra-fast broadband in Germany, and a partnership with UK network builder CityFibre that could reach as many as 5 million households and businesses.

That means Vodafone can sell more internet connections to its big base of mobile customers. Berenberg analysts reckon the group had a 40 percent share of new broadband additions in Germany in the 12 months to October, compared with an overall market share of around 19 percent. A marriage with Malone’s assets might still be nice to have, but it no longer looks a necessity.",Breakingviews - Vodafone is doing just fine without Liberty,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vodafone-group-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-vodafone-is-doing-just-fine-without-liberty-idUSKBN1DE1FY

When a resident organized a beach clean-up that collected 33 tons of rubbish in a single summer, British-Ethiopian safari organizer Ben Morrison decided he couldn’t stand by while his beloved island was ruined.

So the tall, bearded 42-year-old decided to try to design a traditional dhow, or sailing boat, from recycled plastic, offering a market to recyclers and persuading locals to conserve shrinking woodland.

“It is getting harder and harder for boat builders to find wood. I hope that this project will allow the ancient skills of boat building to live on, by shifting from ever-scarce wood to plastic,” Morrison told Reuters.

Plastic pollution is a growing global problem, with patches of sea larger than some countries covered in plastic soup that strangles or poisons wildlife. The U.N. says by 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish unless drastic action is taken.

In August, Kenya introduced one of the world’s toughest bans on plastic bags mandating four years in prison or a fine of $40,000 for even using one.

The East African country is now contemplating measures to control plastic bottles, said John Konchellah, chairman of the National Environment Management Authority.

“We want to see plastic bottles out of circulation,” he told Reuters. “We want to borrow some technology from the region like PETCO in South Africa, where major manufacturers came together with a body that recycles plastic bottles.”

Petco is a company formed by the South African plastics industry to recycle some types of plastic.

Morrison, working with eight expert Kenyan boat builders, is using plastic planks from the fledgling local recycling industry to build his boat, which he hopes to sail to Cape Town in South Africa.

“We struggle to produce a consistent material out of the recycled plastic,” he said. “It’s not easy. Sometimes we receive plastic planks from the factory that are full of air bubbles. We can’t build with them and so we have to start from the beginning again.”

Ali Skanda, a 44-year-old master boat builder, said in his childhood there was no litter on Lamu’s sandy golden beaches - just fishermen, dhows and donkeys. Now many donkeys are dying from eating plastic, he said - and so are turtles, cows and other animals.

“At the beginning I thought it was a crazy idea. How could I build a boat out of plastic?” he asked. “Some people have been asking what we can do about this problem. There is so much plastic scattered. This is something we can do.”",Kenya craftsmen to build boat out of plastic waste,https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKBN1DA237

E’ quanto ha detto l‘AD, Massimiliano Bianco, nel corso della presentazione del piano industriale al 2022. Il numero uno di Iren non vede inoltre impatti particolari sulla governance dalle diverse maggioranze politiche che governano i principali comuni azionisti della utility, Genova, Torino, Reggio Emilia, Piacenza e Parma.

“La nostra presenza è marginale negli atem, dove pensiamo di andare a competere perché abbiamo qualche possibilità di vittoria sia per l‘assenza di un incumbent chiaro sia per la frammentazione di operatori medi o medio piccoli”, ha detto Bianco.

Quanto alla politica di M&A “restiamo molto concentrati nel consolidamento territoriale. Il nostro target è nel nostro perimetro di riferimento: Piemonte, Liguria occidentale ed Emilia. Abbiamo fiducia che il target dei 100 milioni di Ebitda addizionale possa essere mantenuto e rafforzato e non include Acam La Spezia”, ha spiegato il manager.

Bianco ha ricordato che per l‘utility Acam, che svolge servizio idrico e smaltimento rifiuti nella provincia di La Spezia, “Iren ha presentato un‘offerta vincolante per il 100% della società e confidiamo che ci sia chiarezza entro il 2017 se l‘operazione si farà o meno. La procedura si è conclusa posivamente, non solo perche eravamo gli unici, ma anche perché eravamo in linea con i requisiti richiesti. Adesso c‘è il passaggio tecnico nei consigli comunali che riteniamo possa darci visibilità entro l‘anno”.

Acam ha un‘Ebitda potenziale di 30 milioni che si andrebbero ad aggiungere all‘obiettivo di 100 milioni da acquisizioni, ha una posizione debitoria di circa 140 milioni a fronte di un‘offerta Iren da 60 milioni. “E’ opzionale la possibilità da parte dei comuni di prendere il cash fino alla metà dell‘importo, ma l‘operazione prevede anche un ingresso dei comuni azionisti di Acam in Iren”.

Nel caso in cui i comuni dovessero accettare azioni Iren, potrebbero entrare nel capitale della multiutility con una quota fra l‘1,5-2% del capitale.

E sempre relativamente ai comuni azionisti di Iren, alla luce dei recenti cambi di maggioranza a Genova, passata dal centrosinistra al centrodestra e, più indietro, a Torino passata ai 5Stelle, Bianco rileva che “allo stato si procede in continuità e ovviamente l‘interesse è legato a un‘azienda che va molto bene, che fa servizi di alta qualità e i sindaci spingono affinché l‘azienda faccia sempre meglio sul territorio”.

“Disaster”, “nightmare”, “humiliation”, were just a few of the words splashed across the front pages of Italy’s newspapers to describe the shock of the team’s elimination at the hands of a little-fancied Sweden on Monday.

“Apocalypse Azzurra,” said the headline of La Stampa newspaper, referring to the unofficial name of the team whose bright blue jerseys reflect the azure of the Mediterranean Sea.

Italy have played in the last 14 World Cup finals, winning two of them. In all, they have triumphed four times, a tally only exceeded by Brazil, who have won five times. Italy are the only former champions not to make it to next year’s finals.

“This is disgusting, the World Cup can’t exist without Italy. It just can’t exist,” said Francesco Macella, a fan who was in Milan’s San Siro stadium to watch as Italy failed to overcome Sweden in a tense 0-0 draw in the second leg of their European playoff, having lost the first leg 1-0 in Stockholm.

Every four years, Italy has come together over the World Cup, putting aside its historic city-state rivalries to become a united nation for a brief moment in time, cheering on all the players regardless if they came from Milan, Rome or Naples.

“We have failed and at a social level this could have been so important,” said Italy’s storied goalkeeper, Gigi Buffon, in a tearful interview minutes after the final whistle on Monday, recognising the broader significance of the national team.

POLITICAL FALLOUT

While newspapers laid the blame squarely on team coach Gian Piero Ventura and football federation chief Carlo Tavecchio, some fans thought the failure reflected wider problems.

“This match mirrors our country which is falling apart,” said a disappointed Stefano Martufello as he left the San Siro.

Italy is slowly recovering from a prolonged recession, but most people say they see no sign of the pick-up, with wages stagnant and unemployment stuck above 11 percent. On the political front, opinion polls predict that parliamentary elections due by next May will result in a deadlock.

Governments normally hope that the feel-good factor from sporting triumphs feeds over into the political sphere.

In the wake of Monday’s downfall, the normally busy Twitter feeds of ruling politicians were quiet, while some opposition leaders sought to score quick points.

“There are too many foreigners on (our) pitches, from youth teams to Serie A and this is the result,” said Matteo Salvini, head of the anti-immigrant Northern League, echoing criticism in far-right quarters over the space given in sport to outsiders.

“STOPTHEINVASION. Give more room to Italian lads,” he wrote, drawing hundreds of largely negative comments on his Twitter feed.

Italy last won the World Cup in 2006, but exited at the group stage in 2010 and 2014 after lacklustre displays. This latest setback showed how far the team have drifted from their peak, belying the widespread expectation that they would have eased past Sweden.

“For years I’ve had this feeling that Italian football is a little like Italy itself, which lives a lot in the past when the reality is that it finds itself dealing with things that are quite intense, even shocking,” said Matteo Maragnano, peeling oranges in a cafe near Milan’s gothic cathedral.

Grasping for silver linings, newspaper commentators recognised that the Italian team was weak and would not have got very far in Russia.

Sculpted after artist Duane Hanson’s son, the lifelike artwork, titled “Baby in a Carriage, 1983,” is valued at about $80,000 to $120,000, according to director of American art at Heritage Auctions in Manhattan.

“It’s the greatest. If you could watch our footage of this baby in the window, it would crack you up because truly all day, people, women, children, mothers, grandfathers, cops will stop and look at it and wonder truly for a second, or more than a second, is that really a baby?”, Director of American art at Heritage Auctions, Aviva Lehmann, told Reuters, adding that this “is exactly what Hanson wanted you to think.”

The polyvinyl piece of a sleeping toddler wearing a lightlue sweatshirt and matching sweatpants, is topped off with a head of blonde human hair, furthering its authenticity.

“That’s art?” a stunned Rachel Leeds said with a laugh. “I thought that was a real baby.”

The baby’s shirt carries the bible verse, ”He that is without sin among you, let him first cast the first stone,” from the Gospel of John 8:7.

Hanson, a Minnesota native, is often depicted as a “hyper realist” artist.

“He’s been grouped with the pop artists, but he’s just all about capturing middle America, whether it’s a cop or a security guard or a tourist sitting on a bench in the sun,” Lehmann said.

As the afternoon wound down, the scuplture continued to confuse midtown Manhattan.

“I passed by it a few minutes ago on my way to a store and then on my way back I took a better look at it,” said onlooker Sarah Conforti as she snapped a photo of the sculpture. “The baby doesn’t look very happy.”

Passerby Rahmel Dantzler expressed having a similar reaction to the sculpture.

Beijing Sinnet Technology Co Ltd, Amazon’s China partner, said in a filing late on Monday that it would buy the U.S. firm’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud computing unit in China for up to 2 billion yuan ($301.2 million).

“In order to comply with Chinese law, AWS sold certain physical infrastructure assets to Sinnet,” an AWS spokesman said on Tuesday, adding AWS would still own the intellectual property for its services worldwide.

“‎We’re excited about the significant business we have in China and its growth potential.”

Chinese regulators are tightening rules on foreign data and cloud services, implementing new surveillance measures and increasing scrutiny of cross-border data transfers. Laws that came into effect in June require firms to store data locally.

“This move is mostly around regulatory compliance,” said Charlie Dai, Beijing-based analyst at Forrester Research. He added the move was necessary for AWS to build up its other business areas in the market.

AWS has a separate hardware venture in partnership with the Ningxia provincial government in China’s northwest. Amazon said on its website that its public cloud services in the country are exclusively managed by Sinnet.

Amazon’s cloud business in China already faced tougher rules due to China’s tight internet controls. In August, Sinnet told customers it would shut down VPNs and other services on its networks that allow users to circumvent China’s so-called Great Firewall system of censorship, citing direct instructions from the government.

The move casts a shadow over similar foreign ventures in the country. Microsoft Corp, Oracle Corp and IBM Corp are also facing tough new regulatory challenges in localizing their data storage units.

Global firms in China, including Apple Inc, have this year transferred data to Chinese ventures overseen by local authorities. Microsoft operates its Azure cloud services unit in partnership with China-based 21Vianet Group.

“We expect other foreign players, such as Oracle and IBM, will also ensure regulatory compliance as long as they want to provide public cloud services in China,” said Dai.

Microsoft, Oracle and IBM did not immediately respond to request for comment on Tuesday.

Cloud services have become a crowded and competitive field in China in recent years, with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s cloud unit opening over a dozen overseas data centers since 2016.

Chinese firms account for roughly 80 percent of total cloud services revenue in China, and roughly half of the data center market in 2017, according to Synergy Research Group.",Amazon sells off China cloud assets as tough new rules bite,https://www.reuters.com/article/china-amazon-cloud/amazon-sells-off-china-cloud-assets-as-tough-new-rules-bite-idINKBN1DE0CR

Analysts said Vodafone was benefiting from a combination of investment in its mobile and fixed line networks and cost cutting.

It said free cash flow would come in above 5 billion euros, rather than its previous view of around 5 billion euros.","LONDON (Reuters) - Vodafone (VOD.L), the world’s second-largest mobile operator, raised its full-year earnings growth forecast to 10 percent on Tuesday as its customers used more mobile data on their smartphones rather than looking for wifi.

Chief Executive Vittorio Colao lifted guidance for the first time in Vodafone’s recent history after reporting a 13 percent rise in first-half adjusted core earnings to 7.4 billion euros ($8.7 billion), comfortably ahead of market forecasts.

Analysts said Vodafone was benefiting from a combination of investment in its mobile and fixed line networks and cost cutting.

“In our major European markets, customers are increasingly using mobile networks rather than wifi given the improving quality of our 4G and 4G-plus networks and our more generous data allowances,” Colao said.

The usage of wifi versus cellular had declined for the first time - by around 4 percentage points - he said, driven by network improvements and bigger data allowances.

“The anxiety or worry of finishing data is gradually going away,” he added, referring to customers’ concerns about using up data allowances in their monthly plans.

Vodafone is targeting an increased share of the broadband market, as it sees more customers take converged fixed-line and mobile products from a single providers.

It has recently announced a 2 billion euro investment in fiber connections in Germany and a strategic partnership with CityFibre in Britain to improve its fixed-line position.

Analysts, however, speculate that a broader tie up with cable firm Liberty Global (LBTYA.O), which has already combined with Vodafone in the Netherlands, would make sense.

Shares in Vodafone were trading up 5 percent at 1005 GMT, having earlier hit a three month high of 227.50 pence.

UBS analysts, who rate the stock a “buy”, said earnings were benefiting from solid top-line trends and cost savings.

“Almost every geography was notably ahead versus consensus for second-quarter organic service revenue growth, particularly Germany ... and Spain,” they said.

Organic service revenue - which strips out the impact of acquisitions, disposals and currency moves - rose 1.7 percent in the six months to end-September, although the deconsolidation of Vodafone Netherlands and foreign exchange movements resulted in a 4.1 percent dip in total revenue to 23.1 billion euros.

Vodafone said its increased forecast, which implies core earnings of 14.75-14.95 billion euros, reflected stronger-than-expected underlying revenue growth in Europe and a later-than-anticipated launch of a new entrant in Italy.

It said free cash flow would come in above 5 billion euros, rather than its previous view of around 5 billion euros.

Free cash flow was 1.3 billion euros in the half against a 100 million euro outflow a year ago when the company was battling fierce competition in India.

Vodafone agreed in January to combining its Indian unit with Idea Cellular (IDEA.NS) to create a market leader to take on new entrant Reliance Jio Infocomm.

Vodafone said on Monday it would sell its mobile phone masts in India, owned separately from its Indus Towers joint venture, to American Tower Corp (AMT.N).

Colao said he was continuing to explore options for its 42 percent stake in Indus Towers.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

A Reuters witness saw two other tanks parked beside the main road from Harare to Chinhoyi, about 20 km (14 miles) from the city. One, which was pointed in the direction of the capital, had come off its tracks. Soldiers at the scene refused to talk to Reuters.

Earlier on Tuesday the youth wing of Zimbabwe’s ruling party accused the military chief of subverting the constitution for threatening to intervene after President Robert Mugabe plunged the country into crisis by sacking Mnangagwa last week.

Mnangagwa, 75, a long-serving veteran of Zimbabwe’s 1970s liberation wars, had been viewed as a likely successor to Mugabe before the president fired him on Nov. 6.

His downfall appeared to pave the way for Mugabe’s wife Grace to succeed the 93-year-old president, the only leader Zimbabwe has known in 37 years of independence.

In an unprecedented step, the head of the armed forces, Constantino Chiwenga, openly threatened to intervene in politics on Monday if the purge of war veterans did not stop.

“We must remind those behind the current treacherous shenanigans that, when it comes to matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in,” Chiwenga said in a statement read to reporters at a news conference packed with top brass on Monday.

Grace Mugabe, 52, has developed a strong following in the powerful youth wing of the ruling ZANU-PF party. Her rise has brought her into conflict with the independence-era war veterans, who once enjoyed a privileged role in the ruling party under Mugabe, but who have increasingly been banished from senior government and party roles in recent years.",Tanks seen heading toward Zimbabwe capital: witnesses,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-zimbabwe-politics/tanks-seen-heading-toward-zimbabwe-capital-witnesses-idUSKBN1DE1NG

Survivors, many left homeless by the 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck villages and towns in a mountainous area bordering Iraq, battled overnight temperatures just above freezing and faced another bleak day on Tuesday in need of food and water.

The death toll of 530, reported by state news agency IRNA, made it Iran’s deadliest earthquake in more than a decade. Thousands of people were injured and 30,000 homes damaged. Two whole villages were destroyed.

The quake struck on the Iran-Iraq border, causing most of its damage in Iran despite an epicenter on the Iraq side of the frontier. Iraqi officials said seven people were killed and 325 injured in Iraq, all in the northern Kurdish provinces.

Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani arrived in the morning in the stricken area in Kermanshah province and promised that the government would “use all its power to resolve the problems in the shortest time”.

Thousands of people huddled in makeshift camps while many others chose to spend a second night in the open, despite low temperatures, because they feared more tremors after some 193 aftershocks, state television said.

A homeless young woman in Sarpol-e Zahab, one of the hardest-hit towns, told state TV that her family was exposed to the night cold because of lack of tents.

“We need help. We need everything. The authorities should speed up their help,” she said.

Television showed rescue workers combing through the rubble of dozens of villages immediately after the quake. But by Tuesday morning Iranian officials said there was no longer any likelihood of finding survivors and called the rescue off.

“The rescue operations in Kermanshah province have ended,” Pir-Hossein Kolivand, head of Iran’s Emergency Medical Services, said.

Iran’s top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, offered his condolences on Monday to the victims and called on government agencies to do all they could to help.

The Iranian army, the elite Revolutionary Guards and forces of its affiliated Basij militia were dispatched to affected areas on Sunday night.

BITTER COLD

Hospitals in nearby provinces took in many of the injured, state television said, airing footage of survivors waiting to be treated. Hundreds of critically injured were dispatched to hospitals in Tehran.

Iran’s Red Crescent said emergency shelter had been provided for thousands of homeless people, but a lack of water and electricity as well as blocked roads in some areas hindered aid supply efforts.

“People in some villages are still in dire need of food, water and shelter,” said the governor of Qasr-e Shirin county in Kermanshah province, Faramarz Akbari.

The mayor of Ezgeleh, a city in Kermanshah, said 80 percent of its buildings had collapsed. Survivors desperately needed tents with elderly people and babies as young as one-year-old sleeping in the cold for two straight nights.

In an interview with state television, Nazar Barani asked people to send fuel, milk, water and food as emergency services were too slow and providing limited provisions.

“People are hungry and thirsty,” a local man told ISNA news agency. “There is no electricity. Last night I cried when I saw children with no food or shelter.”

Houses in Iranian villages are often made of concrete blocks or mudbrick that can crumble and collapse in a strong quake. Some people are angry that among the collapsed buildings were homes that the government has built in recent years under an affordable housing program.

Photographs posted on Iranian news websites showed rescue workers digging people out of collapsed buildings, cars smashed beneath rubble and rescue dogs trying to find signs of life under the twisted ruins.

“More people will die because of cold. My family lives in a village near Sarpol-e Zahab. I cannot even go there. I don’t know whether they are dead or alive,” Rojan Meshkat, 38, in the Kurdish city of Sanandaj told Reuters by telephone.

Iran is crisscrossed by major fault lines and has suffered several devastating earthquakes in recent years, including a 6.6 magnitude quake in 2003 that reduced the historic southeastern city of Bam to dust and killed some 31,000 people.","Iran ends quake rescue operations, hungry survivors battle cold",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-iraq-quake/iran-ends-quake-rescue-operations-hungry-survivors-battle-cold-idUKKBN1DC0WM

Sweden had just secured a 1-0 aggregate victory over Italy with a squad short on big names, a team that snatched second place in European qualifying Group A from the Dutch and beaten France at home before knocking out Italy, all without Zlatan.

“This is incredible. The player has just stopped to play one-and-a-half years ago and we are still here talking about him,” Sweden boss Andersson told reporters when asked if Ibrahimovic was set to return.

The 36-year-old walked departed the national team after a disappointing group stage exit at Euro 2016, ending an international career that saw him score 62 goals, many of them spectacular, in 116 matches for his country.

Shortly after the game Zlatan posted a picture on social media with the caption “We are Zweden”. By Tuesday, it had over a million likes on Instagram, but Andersson didn’t seem entirely positive about a possible return.

“Zlatan is, as I expressed it, our greatest player of all time, a fantastic athlete in every way, but he has chosen not to take part,” he told a news conference in Milan on Tuesday.

“These guys who did take part and have performed fantastically. It’s sad to sit and talk about someone who hasn’t been here. I have a gang that has done fantastic, we can talk about them instead.”

The Manchester United striker, who is currently recovering from a serious knee injury, has always been something of a divisive figure in his native country, adored for his skills but often perceived as arrogant and selfish.

After his departure and that of former manager Erik Hamren, the Swedes went back to their traditional style of being a tightly-knit collective where no individual is more important than the team - a return for Zlatan now could upset that delicate balance.

Andersson’s players were not in the mood to discuss a possible return either.

“First and foremost he must open up the possibility himself. Otherwise I don’t think one should have this discussion,” defender Ludwig Augustinsson said after the Italy game.

Ibrahimovic’s agent Mino Raiola was a lot more positive towards a comeback for his client.

“If it’s up to me, I’ll deliver him myself,” he told Sweden’s SportExpressen.",International return for Zlatan gets Sweden talking,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-worldcup-swe-zlatan/international-return-for-zlatan-gets-sweden-talking-idUKKBN1DE1FU

Sessions is due to testify before the House Judiciary Committee for a routine oversight hearing, but Democrats on the panel will grill him about a series of statements he made to the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which he denied knowing about meetings between campaign aides and Russians.

“We intend to ask you about these inconsistencies,” the committee’s Democratic members said in a Nov. 7 letter to Sessions, who has recused himself from investigations into the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. election to help then-Republican candidate Donald Trump’s campaign. “We are providing you notice in advance because we expect you to respond.”

Sessions, a former U.S. Senator who was involved in Trump’s campaign, has repeatedly denied misleading Congress, saying his prior statements under oath were all true.

His testimony at his confirmation hearing in January and at a Senate Judiciary hearing in October was questioned after a special counsel last month unsealed charges against former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos in the Russia-Trump probe.

The Kremlin has repeatedly denied allegations of interfering in the U.S. election and Trump denies any collusion between his campaign and Russian officials.

In court records, prosecutors said Papadopoulos told a March 31, 2016 meeting of campaign officials that he had Russian connections and could help arrange a meeting with Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

A photograph posted on Trump’s Instagram account shows that Papadopoulos, Sessions and Trump were all seated at the same table in that meeting.

According to a source familiar with the matter, Sessions shut down Papadopoulos’ idea of engaging with Russia, and the Trump administration has played down Papadopoulos’ role in the campaign, saying he was nothing more than a low level volunteer.

But the court documents, and Papadopoulos’ guilty plea for lying to the FBI over his contacts with Russian officials, put new focus on Sessions’ earlier testimony.

Sessions said during January’s confirmation hearing that he was unaware of communications between the campaign and Russia.

After the hearing, news reports emerged showing that Sessions had himself met with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak at least twice in 2016.

Under pressure, Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation, a decision that later helped pave the way for the appointment of former FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead the investigation.

In another Senate hearing last month, Sessions testified he had no improper involvement with Russians and was not aware of anyone else from the campaign who did.

North Korea is under heavy international pressure to end its weapons programs, pursued in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. But it has vowed never to give up its nuclear arsenal.

Speaking to reporters in the Philippines, Moon said that if North Korea agreed to hold talks, negotiations could be held with all options open.

“If talks begin to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue, I feel it will be realistically difficult for North Korea to completely destroy its nuclear capabilities when their nuclear and missile arsenal are at a developed stage,” Moon said in a briefing.

“If so, North Korea’s nuclear program should be suspended, and negotiations could go on to pursue complete denuclearization.”

Moon’s remarks were made available by the presidential Blue House.

Last week, the North said it did not oppose dialogue, but would “never put the issue related to the supreme interests of the DPRK and security of its people on the bargaining table”.

“We are not interested in such dialogue and negotiations in the least,” the North’s official news agency said, referring to the country by its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

The North defends the programs as a necessary defense against U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention.

U.S. President Donald Trump has traded insults and threats with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as North Korea races toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States.

Trump threatened in his maiden U.N. address to “totally destroy” North Korea if the United States was threatened and has said the time for talking, the policy of previous U.S. administrations, is over.

Moon reiterated his stance that now was the time to increase pressure on North Korea so that it would come to talks.

He said differences in understanding between South Korea and China, North Korea’s lone major ally, regarding the deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system on South Koran soil had not been resolved.

“China has not said it has changed its stance to agree to THAAD and still says THAAD infringes on its security. We have, in turn, explained THAAD is not aimed at China but only toward curbing North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations,” he said.

Last month, South Korea and China agreed to end a year-long standoff over THAAD which had seen South Korean companies doing business in China suffer from retaliation against the system’s deployment.","North Korea nuclear arsenal too developed to destroy quickly, says Moon",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-southkorea/north-korea-nuclear-arsenal-too-developed-to-destroy-quickly-says-moon-idUSKBN1DE1BY

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

FILE PHOTO: A general view shows the Bank of England in the City of London, Britain April 19, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

“There is no point for talks for the sake of talks,” he said.

Abe’s insistence that tough sanctions, including restrictions on oil sales, are necessary to soften up the North Korean regime over the coming winter could put him at loggerheads with other countries such as South Korea that might agree to open talks if approached by the North.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had conducted an in-depth review and provisionally concluded that Tesco’s purchase of Booker does not raise competition concerns.

Tesco’s move on Booker in January sparked further consolidation in Britain’s 185 billion pound grocery market as supermarkets seek additional sources of growth.

Analysts expect more M&A activity as supermarkets seek to utilize excess capacity within their supply chains.

“The wholesale trade in particular will be wondering why on earth it ever bothered engaging at all with the CMA, an organization that seemingly lives in a different universe,” said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.

“If Tesco and Booker can merge with unconditional approval, then the scope for further large-scale consolidation cannot be ruled out,” he said.

The provisional clearance will come as a big relief to Tesco. Most analysts had expected it would have to agree to store divestments or restrictions on operations to gain clearance.

Tesco and Booker have argued their deal will enhance competition in Britain and promote consumer interests. However, rival wholesalers, including Bestway, Spar, Bidfood and Sugro, reject that and have called for the deal to be blocked.

UNSHAKEABLE GRIP

They believe if the deal proceeds Tesco will have an unshakeable grip on the procurement of all grocery categories in Britain and that suppliers will find it even harder to resist Tesco’s demands.

Both Tesco and Booker, the country’s biggest grocery wholesaler, welcomed the CMA announcement. Tesco said it expected to complete the deal, which also requires shareholder approvals, in early 2018.

Shares in Tesco and Booker were both up 7 percent at 1422 GMT.

Rival grocers declined to comment on the record. But a source at one grocer described the CMA’s decision as “ridiculous”.

Though it is unusual for provisional findings to be reversed, rival wholesale and retail groups do have the chance to present further evidence and comment before the CMA’s final ruling due in December.

In consolidation moves already prompted by the deal, Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L), Britain’s No. 2 supermarket group, considered a bid for the Nisa convenience chain before the Co-operative Group (42TE.L) secured a 138 million pound deal. Morrisons (MRW.L), the No. 4, has signed a wholesale supply deal with the McColl’s (MCLSM.L) chain.

Some Tesco shareholders have criticized the Booker bid, saying Chief Executive Dave Lewis is overpaying and that it will distract from the company’s turnaround plan.

CALLS FOR HIGHER PRICE?

The approval could spur calls from Booker shareholders for Tesco to raise its bid.

One top 20 Booker investor said he believed Tesco should pay more “as Booker is Tesco’s last hope”. He said the investor would reiterate to Booker that it could extract a higher price.

Bernstein analysts said they expect some uncertainty to remain, with the focus shifting to whether investors will approve the deal.

Their analysis indicates that Tesco will achieve the required 50 percent shareholder approval and that the focus will be on Booker, where the threshold is 75 percent.

“With a higher shareholder hurdle and the Tesco share price below the level when the bid was made, Booker shareholders may argue for a higher share price,” the broker’s analysts said.

The Booker deal is Lewis’s boldest move yet, giving Tesco access to the faster growing “out of home” food market.

For each Booker share, Tesco is offering 0.861 new Tesco shares and 42.6 pence in cash.

The CMA said it found that Tesco as a retailer and Booker as a wholesaler supplying caterers and independent retailers Premier, Londis, Budgens and Family Shopper do not compete head-to-head in most of their activities.

In particular, it found that Tesco does not supply the catering sector that accounts for more than 30 percent of Booker’s sales.

“Our investigation has found that existing competition is sufficiently strong in both the wholesale and retail grocery sectors to ensure that the merger between Tesco and Booker will not lead to higher prices or a reduced service for supermarket and convenience shoppers,” said Simon Polito, chair of the CMA’s inquiry group.

In the weeks since September’s failed Kurdish independence referendum, Iraq has agreed for the first time to divert crude from Kirkuk province, which it retook from the Kurds, to Iran, where it will supply a refinery in the city of Kermanshah.

Iran is locked in a proxy war with its regional rival and U.S. ally, Saudi Arabia. As well as Iraq, it has been extending its influence in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, raising increasing concerns in Washington and Riyadh.

Under the new arrangement, the first oil will be trucked across the border in the coming days. Initially Iran will receive 15,000 barrels per day worth nearly $1 million, rising gradually to 60,000 bpd, according to Iraqi officials and trading sources.

Baghdad and Tehran have also revived a project to build a pipeline to carry oil from Iraq’s Kirkuk fields to central Iran and onwards for export from the Gulf.

Hamid Hosseini, the Iranian secretary-general of the Iran-Iraq Chamber of Commerce, said Iran want to build a pipeline that can take as much as 650,000 bpd of Kurdish oil for its domestic refineries and for exports.

The pipeline would replace existing export routes for crude from northern Iraq via Turkey and the Mediterranean and would be a blow to Ankara’s hopes of becoming an energy hub for Europe.

It would also be evidence of a U.S. failure to prevent a rapprochement between its ally Iraq and one of its biggest political foes, Iran, which is rapidly regaining influence in the Middle East.

That is in part due to general Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Quds force, the international branch of the Revolutionary Guards, which is also taking a keen interest in Iran’s oil business in Iraq.

Soleimani visited Iraqi Kurdistan in September to warn the region against holding an independence vote. He was also involved in the Iraqi army’s recapture of Kirkuk.

“In Iraq, Iranian forces are working to sow discord as we recently saw in Kirkuk, where the presence of Quds force commander, Qassem Soleimani, exacerbated tensions among the Kurds and the government in Baghdad,” U.S. Senator John McCain said in Washington last week.

KURDISH DIVISION

“The Kurdish dream of being a big oil exporter is in tatters,” said a source close to the government in Erbil, who predicted that “Iran will be king of the game”.

The Kurds’ bid for independence angered Turkey and Iran, which both have large Kurdish populations and condemned the referendum as destabilizing the region. The United States also called on Kurdistan to scrap the vote.

But it was probably internal Kurdish divisions which doomed the referendum to failure, local political sources believe. Oil was at the heart of this dispute.

The Kirkuk fields were controlled by Iraq’s state oil firm SOMO before being taken over by Kurdish forces in 2014, when the Iraqi army retreated in the face of attacks by Islamic state.

The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan party (PUK), in Sulaimaniya, then accused the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) party of then President Massoud Barzani, based in the capital Erbil, of not sharing the oil wealth. The PUK wanted to export oil from Kirkuk to Iran.

“We tried to make Barzani accept joint management between Erbil and Sulaimaniya over the fields but he strongly opposed it,” said Sherzad Yaba, a political adviser close to the PUK.

“To put an end to the illegitimate control of the KDP over Kirkuk oil, senior members from the PUK contacted both Baghdad and Tehran and encouraged the Iranians to build a pipeline to export Kirkuk crude through Bandar Abbas port,” said Yaba.

The project lay dormant even though Iraqi oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi and his Iranian counterpart Bijal Zanganeh signed a memorandum on the project in February.

After the referendum, the KDP accused the PUK of striking a deal with Iran to withdraw from Kirkuk, which the PUK denies.

The recapture of Kirkuk was coordinated with Soleimani and left Iraqi government troops in control of half of all Kurdish oil output.

As Kurdish engineers fled the fields, output from Kirkuk was suspended and has remained shut for the past five weeks as Baghdad and Erbil argue over the revenue split.

With output of over 300,000 bpd suspended since mid-October, losses are approaching $1 billion, according to Kurdish industry sources.

To stop the losses, Iraq and the PUK resumed talks with Iran, according to Iraqi and Kurdish officials.

Officials from Iraq’s and Iran’s state oil firms, SOMO and NICO, met last month to iron out details of oil sales to the Kermanshah refinery, the acting chief of SOMO, Alaa al-Yasiri, said.

He also said active discussions were taking place about the pipeline project.

THE GUARDS RISING

Even though discussions between Baghdad and Tehran have been conducted between oil ministry officials and the Chamber of Commerce, the Revolutionary Guards are poised to step in.

“Any oil transaction between Iran and Iraq should be approved by the Revolutionary Guards, not the oil ministry.” said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in the energy equipment business in the Middle East.

Those dealings are overseen by the desk responsible for Iran’s investments in Iraq at the president’s office and are run by the Revolutionary Guards.

The pipeline project will be the Revolutionary Guards’ reward to the Kurds for helping with the recapture of Kirkuk, said Tabatabaei.",Oil seen as real prize of Iran's Kurdish adventure,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-oil-insight/oil-seen-as-real-prize-of-irans-kurdish-adventure-idUSKBN1DE1UY?il=0

China’s Communist Party has decided to insert his view of the world – “Xi Jinping Thought for the New Era of Socialism With Chinese Special Characteristics” – into the constitution. He will be only the second leader after Mao Zedong to be so honored during his lifetime. Xi stands supreme. Yet that very accumulation of authority carries a large threat, both to his power and to his state.

Xi’s central goals are to strengthen China’s economy and military power and to lead a sometimes-ferocious campaign against corruption, bolstering these aims with a steady determination to bring the news media back under the tightest control. Inserting both his thoughts and his name in the constitution will further delegitimize critical commentary and unflattering revelations by making anything that contradicts Xi’s official line an attack on the constitution. Xi wants to render independent journalism impossible and choke off China’s liveliest medium of criticism – social media. Blocking these arteries could be his largest mistake yet.

Xi’s desire to curb the media is not new. In 2013, the then-new leader gave a speech to the National Propaganda and Ideology Work Conference in Beijing, in which he argued that workers in propaganda and ideology – broadly speaking, journalists and their minders – had become so undisciplined that some bordered on committing treason. His subsequent actions have been consistent with this belief.

In a book published earlier this year, I wrote, “one phrase in his speech was particularly telling. Xi said that ‘we must unwaveringly persist in the principle that the Party manages the media, persist in politicians running newspapers periodicals, TV stations and news websites.’”

The words “politicians running newspapers” were telling because they were a direct quotation from Mao, the founder of communist rule, still venerated in spite of his murderous policies that condemned millions. The phrase enshrined the dogma that politicians – the Party – is the final judge of what journalism can say. Journalism was far too important to be left to journalists.

In the past five years, those newspapers and TV programs which had enjoyed some autonomy – granted by Deng Xiaoping who was in charge of economic and social reform from the late 1970s to the late 1980s – have lost nearly all of their latitude. Journalists no longer can undertake any investigation not expressly permitted by the all-powerful Publicity (formerly Propaganda) Department. Usually that only allowed for investigating the affairs of one whom the Party wished to destroy.

The most adventurous newspapers – such as the Southern Metropolitan Daily and Southern Weekend of Guangzhou – were muzzled in 2013. Xiao Shu, a former editorialist on the Southern Weekend, wrote that the appointment of a new, severe head of Party propaganda in Guangdong, the region in which Guangzhou is the capital, meant that “the press in Guangdong retreated into its darkest period since the start of Deng Xiaoping’s 'reform and opening up' policies in the late 1970s.”

That was just the start. The monopoly broadcaster, CCTV, dropped or toned down all its investigative and analytical programs. Journalists, who had previously suffered only dismissal if they were deemed to have gone too far, were again imprisoned. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 38 journalists were in prison in China in 2016, putting it second behind Turkey for number of reporters jailed. Writers for foreign news media find it harder to get visas and harder to do investigative reporting.

Yet for Xi and his senior colleagues, the largest threat is the social media – which have become more popular as approved journalism becomes again controlled. The online postings are often critical; an anonymous author wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this month that “even a cursory glance at China’s new social media revealed that officials were seen as skinning the people, not serving them.” These public comments could not be allowed in China. This autumn, the authorities began investigating the most popular messaging services – Weibo, Wechat and Baidu - and found that the services were exchanging “terror-related content… rumors… and pornography.”

Yet as this repression continued and deepened, the pushback from society grows, and determined journalists and film makers continue to catalogue the darker sides of China. In 2012, a film called “High Tech, Low Life” followed bloggers on bicycles examining government censorship and the harsh and yawning divisions in Chinese society.

Suppression of forbidden information and commentary is much harder now. The sinologist Perry Link said in 2014, “internally it’s getting more hard to handle, because complaints and demands from below are increasing and are better organized than before.” The middle class now numbers in the hundreds of millions: in five more years – within Xi’s presidential term - McKinsey reckons that 75 percent of China’s urban middle class will enjoy a standard of living approaching that of Italy.

This more independent, and often independent-minded, youngish cohort is rapidly growing, as is their use of social media. The meeting of these two forces is unlikely to favor an attitude of resigned obedience, the more so since many will have been abroad, and many more will read foreign material online.

The result is likely to foster a more inquiring and critical citizenry, tending to question why a political monopoly that once caused the deaths of millions and now chooses for its population what they should read, see and text to each other should rule unchallenged.

The gamble Xi is making, by hugging all power to him, is that he and the forces he controls can limit any such developments. But that will not last. Corruption, pollution, inequality, interfering bureaucracy and controlled media will become prompts for protest. Xi’s choice to strengthen authoritarian rule rather than loosen it will prove to be a large error, for himself, his country and beyond these, the world in which China is such a crucial actor.",Commentary: China's media crackdown won't work,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-china/commentary-chinas-media-crackdown-wont-work-idUSKBN1CW2JW

Six months after party leader Marine Le Pen suffered a crushing defeat against centrist Emmanuel Macron in the presidential election run-off, the poll is part of the 45-year-old National Front’s (FN) efforts to relaunch itself.

“We need to ask ourselves why we didn’t win the presidential election and how we can improve our political offer,” said FN lawmaker Sebastien Chenu. “We want to win elections, we owe it to our members.”

The FN’s 81,000 cardholders - which includes those up to a year late on party dues - are asked to say what type of job they have and where they get their news from.

More crucially, they are asked if they want to ditch the euro and hold a referendum on France’s membership of the European Union and if they think the party should focus less on immigration.

Opposition to the euro and immigration have long been at the heart of the party’s policies, but in the six months since her defeat, Le Pen has progressively watered down her anti-EU stance, which is unpopular and widely considered to be one of the reasons why the FN does not win major elections.

Party officials will use the results of the questionnaire to help prepare a party congress to be held in mid-March.

Members are also asked if they want to change the party’s name. While the FN is a well-known brand throughout France, it is largely associated with Le Pen’s father Jean-Marie, the party founder, who was several times convicted for incitement to racial hatred.

While the FN got more votes than ever in the presidential election, the lower-than-expected second round score as well as the parliamentary election that followed were a huge disappointment for the party and its cardholders.

Statistics Canada on Friday reported a net gain of 35,300 jobs - all of them due to a boost in full-time positions - but added the jobless rate had edged up to 6.3 percent as more people sought work.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 15,000 extra jobs and predicted the unemployment rate would stay at 6.2 percent.

The Bank of Canada, citing the need to remove monetary stimulus as the economy strengthened, raised interest rates in July and September and said it would closely review data before deciding whether to hike again.

Average hourly wages were up 2.4 percent from a year earlier, the strongest year-over-year increase since April 2016.

“Most importantly, we saw a little bit more acceleration in wages ... the labor data does support tighter (monetary) policy at some point next year and perhaps sooner than later,” said Andrew Kelvin, a senior rates strategist at TD Securities.

The Bank of Canada said last week various measures of wage growth remained below their historical averages.

The Canadian dollar quickly rose to C$1.2728 against the greenback, or 78.57 U.S. cents, up from C$1.2829, or 77.95 U.S. cents before the report was released.

Statscan said full-time employment jumped by 88,700 jobs while part-time positions dipped by 53,400.

On a year-over-year basis, employment rose by 308,100, or 1.7 percent, while the six-month average for employment growth was 29,700 jobs, up from 24,300 in September.

Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the Bank of Canada would be “mildly encouraged” by the increase in year-over-year wage growth.

“But I think they need to see more evidence before they can consider raising rates again,” he said in a phone interview.

Statscan said the trade deficit remained at C$3.18 billion ($2.50 billion) as imports and exports dropped for a fourth consecutive month.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

The booing of the anthem, “The March of the Volunteers”, has become a fixture at football matches in the Chinese-ruled territory, with some parallels to protests in the United States where American football players have knelt during the national anthem, an act denounced by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Now the former British colony is preparing to introduce a law that will penalize people who boo the anthem, a measure that critics say undermines the city’s autonomy and freedoms guaranteed when it returned to China 20 years ago.

Details of the law, including jail terms and the scope of enforcement, have yet to be set. China extended the law to cover Hong Kong earlier this month.

Chinese President Xi Jinping in recent years has ushered in new legislation aimed at securing the country from threats both within and outside its borders, besides presiding over a sweeping crackdown on dissent and free speech.

Chinese officials have said the anthem law is necessary to safeguard the authority of the state.

Several hundred fans greeted the anthem before the match against Lebanon with jeers and boos, with some unfurling banners that said “Die for Hong Kong”, while others yelled “We are Hong Kong” in English, rather than the local Cantonese dialect.

Some security guards signaled to the supporters to behave.

“I‘m not scared even if it becomes law ... I will go to the toilet instead of sitting when the national anthem is on,” Hong Kong supporter Bendter Chong said when asked if he would continue to jeer the anthem when the law is enacted.

Tensions between Hong Kong and mainland China have increased in recent years amid calls for greater democracy. Mass street protests in 2014 paralyzed parts of the city although they failed to secure concessions on electoral reform from Beijing.

Most of the jeering was from youths, underscoring how the younger generation has become increasingly disaffected by political tension and economic hardship.

Security was tight at the Hong Kong Stadium, the venue for the city’s annual Rugby Sevens tournament, where about 10,000 gathered for the match. The stadium has capacity for 40,000.

The game ended Lebanon 1, Hong Kong 0.

“I’m not sure about the law, but for sure people will be more behaved,” said Hong Kong supporter Fai Chan. “But it is still a matter of whether it is worth our respect.”

Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” arrangement that guarantees a high degree of autonomy, including an independent judiciary and freedom of expression.

In 2015, Hong Kong football fans booed the Chinese anthem during a World Cup qualifier, prompting a fine for the Hong Kong Football Association from world body FIFA.

The association was warned by the Asian Football Confederation recently over the conduct of fans and said “a repeat violation may result in more severe punishment”.",Hong Kong soccer fans defy Beijing by booing Chinese national anthem,https://www.reuters.com/article/china-hongkong-anthem/hong-kong-soccer-fans-defy-beijing-by-booing-chinese-national-anthem-idINKBN1DE1QB?il=0

ROMA/MILANO, 14 novembre (Reuters) - L‘obiettivo del governo Gentiloni di crescita economica 2017 a 1,5% è ormai al sicuro dopo che nel periodo luglio-settembre il Pil è cresciuto dello 0,5% rispetto al trimeste precedente.

Possibili variazioni, dicono gli economisti, sono a questo punto al rialzo.

“Il dato di oggi è coerente con un valore destagionalizzato in media d‘anno dell‘1,5-1,6% e con un dato grezzo annuo a 1,5%” sintetizza Fedele De Novellis, economista di Ref.

La crescita del 2017 si avvia quindi a raggiungere il più alto livello dal 2010. E sempre dal 2010 (quarto trimestre) non si vedeva in Italia una crescita trimestrale di mezzo punto percentaule come quella vista nel primo e nel terzo trimestre 2017, ricorda l‘economista Lorenzo Codogno.

A trascinare la congiuntura italiana è in primo luogo il buon andamento del commercio internazionale che negli scorsi mesi ha spinto al rialzo le stime di crescita di gran parte dei Paesi.

Nelle scarne notazioni che accompagnano il dato preliminare pubblicato oggi Istat segnala che alla crescita dello 0,5% su trimestre e dell‘1,8% su anno ha contribuito positivamente la componente estera (esportazioni al netto dellle importazioni).

“Si tratta di un buon risultato anticipato dalle indicazioni sui dati della produzione industriale, che avevano mostrato come l‘industria poteva aver contribuito in modo significativo alla crescita del Pil del terzo trimestre, e unito a una buona performance del settore dei servizi” commeta Loredana Federico di Unicredit.

La variazione acquisita per l‘anno in corso raggiunge così l‘1,5%, dice Istat nel comunicato.

Rimane il tema della sottoperformance rispetto agli altri Paesi europei.

I dati Eurostat relativi al terzo trimestre indicano per la zona euro una crescita dello 0,6% su trimestre e del 2,5% su anno. E anche le stime della Commissione europea indicano nell‘Italia il fanalino di coda in tema di crescita 2017.

“Sebbene il gap con gli altri Paesi dell’eurozona rimanga (nel terzo trimestre la Germania è cresciuta dello 0,8%, cosi come la Spagna, mentre la Francia dello 0,5%) questp gap di crescita è diminuito negli ultimi anni” commenta Nicola Nobile di Oxford Economics.

MIGLIORI PROSPETTIVE PER 2018

Con il terzo trimestre consecutivo di discreta congiuntura migliora il quadro per la parte finale del 2017 e per i primi mesi del prossimo anno.

“Ci aspettiamo una crescita resiliente anche nei prossimi trimestri” commenta Fabio Fois che vede un rialzo dello 0,4% nel quarto trimestre seguito da una crescita del‘1,4% nel 2018.

Mentre Codogno sottolinea che, con la sua stima di +0,3% nel quarto trimestre, a un Pil destagionalizzato 2017 a +1,6% si accompagnerebbe un effetto di trascinamento nel 2018 pari allo 0,7%. “Questo è come dire che servirebbe soltanto una crescita trimestrale al ritmo dello 0,3% per raggiungere l‘1,5% per l‘intero 2018”.

La stima del governo per il 2018 è dell‘1,5%.

Earlier on Tuesday the youth wing of Zimbabwe’s ruling party accused the military chief of subverting the constitution for threatening to intervene after President Robert Mugabe plunged the country into crisis by sacking Mnangagwa last week.

Mnangagwa, 75, a long-serving veteran of Zimbabwe’s 1970s liberation wars, had been viewed as a likely successor to Mugabe before the president fired him on Nov. 6.

His downfall appeared to pave the way for Mugabe’s wife Grace to succeed the 93-year-old president, the only leader Zimbabwe has known in 37 years of independence.

In an unprecedented step, the head of the armed forces, Constantino Chiwenga, openly threatened to intervene in politics on Monday if the purge of war veterans did not stop.

“We must remind those behind the current treacherous shenanigans that, when it comes to matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in,” Chiwenga said in a statement read to reporters at a news conference packed with top brass on Monday.

Grace Mugabe, 52, has developed a strong following in the powerful youth wing of the ruling ZANU-PF party.

True, the Democrats did well, picking up state legislative seats from Georgia to New Hampshire, including a massive swing of at least 15 seats in Virginia, as well as the governorships in Virginia and New Jersey.

But politics can change quickly: Democrats lost the governors’ races in New Jersey and Virginia in 2009 and took heavy losses in the 2010 congressional midterms, yet Barack Obama won reelection in 2012. Yesterday’s wins may portend Democratic gains in Congress in 2018. But maybe they won’t.

The true implication of the 2017 elections is what they mean for redistricting and electoral reforms in the years to come.

Far more important to future election cycles than any help in prognosticating the public mood one or three years from now is what the results mean for the next round of redistricting that begins in 2021. Although the next redistricting process will not occur for another four years, what happened in elections throughout the country this week will have a significant impact. The governors, state legislators, mayors, and city council members elected this year will play a major role in drawing district lines – and thus setting the course for American democracy.

Under the U.S. Constitution, once a decade states must redraw their legislative lines for Congress, state legislatures, and even local governments like city councils. That task falls in most states to state legislatures and the state’s governor. The legislature will take the data it receives from the 2020 Census and draw district lines for congressional seats and the legislature itself, and the governor will decide whether to approve or veto those maps. City councils often use similar processes for their own lines.

It matters, then, who is charged with the task of drawing those maps. Politicians of both parties engage in extreme partisan gerrymandering, where they draw the lines to help their own political parties and their own electoral interests. The politicians essentially pick their constituents, instead of the other way around.

During the 2011 redistricting, Republicans controlled the majority of statehouses and governor’s mansions. They used that power to entrench their control. That is why, for example, Republicans won 60 of Wisconsin’s 99 state legislative seats in the 2012 election with only 48 percent of the vote. Similar tactics created disproportionately Republican state legislatures and congressional delegations across the country. In Pennsylvania, another swing state, Republicans gerrymandered their way into winning 13 of the state’s 18 congressional seats with only half of the votes cast in 2012. In Southern states such as North Carolina and Texas, Republicans drew districts that limit Democratic seats by minimizing the representation of minorities such as Latinos and African-Americans, which courts have ruled violates the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.

Although it tends not to disempower under-represented minorities, Democrats frequently engage in gerrymandering too: Democrats in Maryland passed a pro-Democratic map that plaintiffs challenged as an unlawful partisan gerrymander. The litigation is still ongoing. City Councils are also not immune from the problem, often drawing the lines for their own elections that favor the incumbents or the party in control.

What yesterday’s elections mean, then, is that Democrats can greatly influence the redistricting process, at least in Virginia. (New Jersey uses an independent redistricting commission.) Democrats can, if they want, draw maps that will favor their side through 2030. Even if the Supreme Court overturns Wisconsin’s gerrymander in a highly-watched case this term, there still will be wiggle room for partisans to skew the maps toward their favor.

Fifty-nine of the nation’s 100 largest cities also held elections in 2017, mostly for mayor and city council. These smaller governmental entities will also engage in redistricting in 2021. Given that many of these positions have four-year terms, those elected this week will still be in office when the actual redistricting process begins.

And it is not just redistricting at stake. State legislatures have the power to enact numerous rules that affect the voting process, such as voter ID requirements or early voting periods. In 2016, Virginia’s Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe restored the voting rights of thousands of felons. This year’s Republican gubernatorial candidate in Virginia, Ed Gillespie, probably would not have done the same had he been in office. Gillespie also supports a strict voter ID requirement, which tends to reduce turnout among groups of voters who skew Democratic such as non-whites and young people. That kind of shaping of the electorate could have a significant impact on who wins Virginia – a key swing state − in the 2020 presidential election.

In New Jersey, Republican Governor Chris Christie vetoed a bill to implement automatic voter registration, in which the government would place eligible voters on the registration rolls, allowing them to opt-out instead of requiring them to opt-in. Automatic voter registration, which began in Oregon and is now sweeping the country, increases turnout. Democrat Phil Murphy’s win in New Jersey means that automatic voter registration will now likely become law – again impacting future elections. Automatic voter registration also might come to Washington state because a Democratic candidate is leading in the vote count from Tuesday in a race that will determine majority control of the state senate.

Of course, deciding who may vote should not be a partisan issue. Independent commissions or other nonpartisan approaches should determine redistricting. It should be easy and convenient for every eligible voter to participate. But that is not the current reality of American politics.

The best way to think about the 2017 elections is to consider them not for what they mean for Donald Trump but how they will determine the rules of elections for a decade or more.

Trump and Duterte were among 19 leaders at a glittering gala in the Philippines capital on Sunday ahead of an annual summit, and at one point Duterte took the microphone to sing “Ikaw” (You), in a duet with local pop diva Pilita Corrales.

One of the song’s verses, translated from Filipino, begins: “You are the light in my world, a half of this heart of mine”.

“Ladies and gentlemen, I sang uninvited, upon the orders of the commander-in-chief of the United States,” Duterte said later, according to the ABS-CBN news channel.

Duterte, who is sometimes described as the ‘Trump of the East’ because of his brash style, is due to meet the U.S. president on the sidelines of the summit on Monday.

The United States and its former colony, the Philippines, have been strategic allies since World War Two. But their relations have been strained by anti-U.S. outbursts from Duterte and his enthusiasm for better ties with Russia and China.

More than 3,900 Filipinos have been killed in a war on drugs that Duterte declared when he took office last year. His government says the police act in self defense, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability.

Duterte said last week he would tell the U.S. president to “lay off” if he raised the issue of human rights when they met.

But Trump, who has been criticized at home for neglecting rights issues in dealings abroad, praised Duterte in May for doing an “unbelievable job on the drug problem”.

Trump and leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China, Russia, Japan, Canada, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand were entertained by singers and dancers at the dinner.

Each of the men sported a cream-colored barong, a traditional Philippines shirt made of fiber from the pineapple plant, hand-embroidered and worn untucked.

They were served a four-course Filipino-Asian fusion meal curate and prepared by Chef Jessie Sincioco, who also designed the menu for Pope Francis when he visited the Philippines in 2015.","""You are the light"" - Philippines' Duterte croons at Trump's request",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-asean-summit-song/you-are-the-light-philippines-duterte-croons-at-trumps-request-idUKKBN1DD04V?il=0

Top Lebanese government officials and senior politicians close to Hariri believe Saudi Arabia coerced him into quitting and has been holding him against his will ever since, though Hariri and Riyadh have denied this.

Hariri cited fear of assassination and accused Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world during his resignation speech.

Hariri gave his first public remarks on Sunday, saying in a televised interview in Riyadh he planned to return to Lebanon within days to affirm his resignation.

Lebanese President Michel Aoun, who has stated that he believes Riyadh is restricting Hariri’s freedom, has refused to his resignation until his return from Saudi Arabia.

A JBS divulgou na noite da véspera queda de 64 por cento no lucro líquido do terceiro trimestre sobre o mesmo período do ano passado, em resultado impactado por adesão a programa de refinanciamento de dívidas e queda de desempenho no Brasil.

The 10-year bond yield went up as much as 7.07 percent, the highest since Sept. 15, 2016 and up 10 basis points so far from its previous close of 6.97 percent on Monday.

India’s annual wholesale price inflation picked up in October to a six-month high, driven by faster rises in prices of food and fuel products. Retail inflation in the same month also climbed to 3.58 percent from a year earlier, a seven-month high.

Adding to the bearish sentiment was the Reserve Bank of India’s recent open market bond sale announcement for 100 billion rupees ($1.53 billion) scheduled on Nov. 23.

“At a time when inflation is rising, market is already bearish, the OMO (open market operation) sale announcement shows that the RBI is completely fine with higher bond yields,” said a trader at a foreign bank.

“When the regulator wants the government’s borrowing cost to go up then who will have the courage to buy in this market where there is so much supply?”

In addition to the OMO sale, the government will also sell 150 billion rupees of bonds this Friday.

Traders expect yields to rise further as state-run banks, the usual buyers in the secondary market, sit on heavy losses.

The 10-year debt yield has risen by 56 basis points since the start of July as concerns over global rate tightening and upside risks to inflation at home surfaced.

State-run banks stayed away from the market on Tuesday.

“Why should we go and support the market when some segments in the market are spreading so much of negativity and making all the money and we are having to bear the losses,?” said a senior trader at a state-run bank.

“We will not buy now. We will wait and see how far the RBI and the government are willing to allow this pain to go on.”

Concerns that the RBI is unlikely to tone down its hawkish tone at its policy review next month were heightened following renewed worries over fuel and food prices.

Uncertainty over the impact of a goods and services tax that went into effect in July on economic growth was also adding to traders’ expectations the RBI will stay hawkish given the tightening bias of global central banks.

Consumer price inflation was unchanged from September’s five-and-a-half-year high of 3.0 percent, official data showed on Tuesday.

When the BoE raised benchmark borrowing costs for the first time in a decade in early November, it said it expected inflation would hit 3.2 percent in October before starting to fall slowly.

Sterling fell against the dollar after the data and British government bond prices rose, as markets lengthened the odds on the BoE following up this month’s hike with another one in the foreseeable future.

“Red faces all round as UK inflation fails to rise as widely expected, not least by the Bank of England,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at financial data company IHS Markit.

“Today’s numbers will dampen expectations on whether we will see further rate hikes any time soon.”

British inflation has surged from just 0.5 percent at the time of the June 2016 vote to leave the European Union as the fall in the pound pushed up the cost of imported goods.

Tuesday’s data spared BoE’s governor Mark Carney the embarrassment of having to write to Chancellor Philip Hammond to explain how the Bank missed its 2 percent inflation target by more than a percentage point.

But the figures will add to criticisms from many economists who said this month’s rate rise was unnecessary against a backdrop of a slowing domestic economy and weak productivity and wage growth.

With the worst of the Brexit impact on prices now past, the critics of the BoE decision saw little need to raise rates at a time when Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU remains highly uncertain.

DATA DILEMMA

The Bank argues that leaving the EU will damage Britain’s ability to grow as fast as before without generating excess inflation, and that the lowest unemployment rate since 1975 makes labour shortages and a rebound in wage growth a risk.

It has said it still expects inflation to be slightly above target in three years’ time.

Paul Diggle, a senior economist at Aberdeen Asset Management, said inflation would pick up again due to rising oil prices and residual effects of the weaker pound.

“The Bank of England is stuck between a rock and a hard place. On balance, we think (it) will have to hike interest rates at least once more next year.”

A measure of retail price inflation, used to calculate payments on government bonds and many commercial contracts, hit a near six-year high of 4.0 percent, providing bad news for Hammond who is due to announce a budget plan on Nov. 22.

But other data showed that some underlying price pressures are easing.

Costs of manufacturers’ raw materials - much of them imported - were 4.6 percent higher than in October 2016, down from an increase of 8.1 percent in September.

Arop Malueth, secretary for the steering committee for Judges and the Justice Union, told Reuters that two more judges from the lower courts had also resigned.

“Many of us feel that the judiciary is not independent as it should be,” Malueth said, adding that some judges had been dismissed unconstitutionally, at the behest of the executive.

EX-ARMY CHIEF

Separately, the government said on Tuesday the former chief of the army, General Paul Malong, would be allowed to leave the country, six months after placing him under house arrest in the capital following a falling out with President Kiir.

Kiir’s spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny told UN radio in South Sudan that Malong was free to go to any country for medical treatment “on grounds of humanity”.

Malong led the army’s war effort against rebels from 2014 but Kiir sacked him in May and placed him under house arrest.

Earlier this month, Kiir sent troops to disarm Malong’s bodyguards at his house in Juba, but they refused. Kiir’s troops then surrounded Malong’s house, sparking fears of clashes, before withdrawing a week later.

More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since late August, driven out by a counter-insurgency clearance operation of Myanmar forces in Rakhine. A top U.N. official has called the operation a textbook case of “ethnic cleansing”.

Attending an East Asia summit in Manila on Tuesday, Tillerson met Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose less than two-year-old civilian administration shares power with the military and has no control over its generals.

He will meet Suu Kyi again in the Myanmar capital of Naypyitaw on Wednesday, and hold separate talks with the head of the armed forces, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.

Asked what approach Tillerson would take with Myanmar’s army chief, the State Department official told journalists in a briefing by teleconference that the emphasis would be on restoring peace in Rakhine.

“We are focusing on trying to stabilize areas in northern Rakhine so that people can return there, stopping the violence, making sure that the military would protect all populations in that area equally and that they conduct a credible investigation that leads to accountability for people who have perpetrated abuses,” said the official, who was with Tillerson in Manila and declined to be identified.

The official said the consequences for the country, also known as Burma, if it failed to respond to the crisis with accountability could be part of the conversation with the military leader.

“Burma made a lot of progress and we would not want to see that progress reversed,” the official added.

U.S. senators in Washington are pressing for economic sanctions and travel restrictions targeting the Myanmar military and its business interests.

“The secretary will reiterate support for Burma’s democratic transition and urge the Burmese government to protect the local population and allow unhindered humanitarian and media access, (and) support for a credible investigation of abuses,” the official added.

Accusations of organized mass rape and other crimes against humanity were leveled at the Myanmar military on Sunday by another senior U.N. official who had toured camps in Bangladesh where Rohingya refugees have taken shelter.

‘WHITEWASH’

Pramila Patten, special representative of the U.N. secretary-general on sexual violence in conflict, said she would raise accusations against the Myanmar military with the International Criminal Court in the Hague.

The military, known as the Tatmadaw, has consistently protested its innocence, and on Monday it posted the findings of an internal investigation on the Facebook page of Min Aung Hlaing.

It said it had found no instances where its soldiers had shot and killed Rohingya villagers, raped women or tortured prisoners. It denied that security forces had torched Rohingya villages or used “excessive force”.

The military said that, while 376 “terrorists” were killed, there were no deaths of innocent people.

Human rights groups poured scorn on the military’s investigation, branding it a “whitewash” and calling for U.N. and independent investigators to be allowed into Myanmar.

“The Burmese military’s absurd effort to absolve itself of mass atrocities underscores why an independent international investigation is needed to establish the facts and identify those responsible,” Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.

Amnesty International also dismissed the military’s internal investigation. “There is overwhelming evidence that the military has murdered and raped Rohingya and burned their villages to the ground,” the London-based rights group said.

The government in mostly Buddhist Myanmar regards the Muslim Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

And Suu Kyi’s failure to speak out strongly over their plight has widely damaged the Nobel Peace Prize winner’s international reputation as a stateswoman.

Many diplomats, however, believe Myanmar’s fragile transition to democracy after 49 years of military rule would be jeopardized if she publicly criticized the armed forces.

“Both parts of the government will have to work together in order to solve this problem...Trying to get two of them to work together, to try to solve the problem, is certainly going to be very important,” the U.S. official said.

The U.S. official said Suu Kyi had been forthcoming in her talks with Tillerson and others during the past few days about the steps that needed to be taken to improve the situation, including plans for the voluntary repatriation of Rohingya.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were among those she met in Manila to discuss the Rohingya crisis.

“This is a tremendous concern to Canada and to many, many countries around the world,” Trudeau told a news conference.

Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged up to 117 billion yen ($1 billion) of development aid to Myanmar in his meeting with Suu Kyi.

While world leaders wrung their hands, thousands of Rohingya remained stranded in Myanmar, on beaches around the mouth of the Naf river, hoping to find a boat to make the short, sometimes perilous crossing to Bangladesh.

“They’re still coming, risking their lives, driven by fears of starvation and violence,” Shariful Azam, a police official in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar, a narrow spit of land where the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis is unfolding.

To most people, that label belongs to the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which leads opinion polls ahead of the vote due to be held by May. But looking at the main parties’ economic plans it is hard to judge who deserves it most.

The economy is growing at its fastest clip since 2010 but politicians of all stripes say they will use the extra resources to cut taxes and spend more, rather than pay down the biggest debt burden in the euro zone after Greece‘s.

Italy was at the heart of the euro zone debt crisis in 2011 and the election is seen the next source of potential instability in the currency bloc, especially if parties carry out the maverick policies they are proposing.

The vow to chop up to 50 billion euros ($60 billion) off income and corporate taxes and renege on Italy’s commitment to balance its budget comes from the leader of the ruling Democratic Party (PD), former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.

He wants to hike the deficit from a targeted 2.1 percent of gross domestic product this year to 3 percent and then hold it at that level, and said this month he would “bang his fists on the table” in Brussels to get his way.

The plan to print a “new lira” for domestic use while keeping the euro for international trade comes from centre-right leader and four-times prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who says the scheme will boost consumer spending and economic growth.

None of the main parties is campaigning on an economically orthodox platform of fiscal consolidation likely to please financial markets or the European Commission.

Populism is thriving in Italy mainly because fiscal rigour prescribed by the EU is widely blamed for a deep double dip recession between 2008 and 2013 from which the country is only gradually recovering.

A survey commissioned by the European Parliament last month showed only 39 percent of Italians felt their country had benefitted from EU membership, putting it bottom among the bloc’s 28 nations.

Policies considered responsible by Europe’s political and economic mainstream are seen as vote-losers in Italy, where 5-Star has often set the political agenda in recent years.

“IRRESPONSIBLE PROMISES”

Luca Ricolfi, a sociology professor at Turin University and prominent political commentator, said the election is likely to produce a hung parliament and this meant politicians felt free to make promises they would probably never have to honour.

“As there are no reasonable parties at this election, Renzi can make irresponsible promises to try to win votes because the centre-right and 5-Star are even more irresponsible,” he said.

Berlusconi himself has often been called populist since he entered politics in 1994 promising “lower taxes for everyone,” but now both he and Renzi are casting themselves as moderate leaders whose role is to halt the maverick 5-Star.

The 81-year-old media tycoon’s main coalition partner is Matteo Salvini, head of the anti-immigrant Northern League and an ally of French National Front leader Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders of the right-wing Freedom Party in the Netherlands.

The League has its own scheme for a parallel currency, which it calls mini-BOTs, named after Italy’s short-term Treasury bills, which it sees as a probable stepping-stone to exiting the euro.

As well as a parallel currency, Salvini wants to introduce a single tax rate of 15 percent for individuals and companies instead of the current five staggered income tax brackets of between 23 and 43 percent.

The party’s economic spokesman Claudio Borghi told Reuters the “flat tax” would reduce revenues by 40 billion euros (about 2.5 percent of GDP) but this would soon be offset by a reduction in tax evasion and a boost to growth.

He said the League planned to introduce this radical tax plan in its first budget, to obtain a “surprise effect”, and it was no problem if it pushed up the budget deficit and raised objections in Brussels.

“We have no intention of respecting current deficit targets,” he said. “We couldn’t care less about the opinions of others because we pay in to Europe more than we get back, so why should others have a say on our spending or our deficit?”

HUNG PARLIAMENT SEEN

5-Star has about 28 percent of the vote, according to opinion polls, followed by the PD on 25 percent and the centre-right allies the Northern League and Berlusconi’s Forza Italia (Go Italy!), each with around 15 percent.

Under the largely proportional electoral system, no party or coalition is expected to win a majority of seats in parliament.

Berlusconi also promises a “flat tax,” but he wants to set it at 23 percent instead of the League’s 15 percent, and to phase it in more gradually.

In addition, he has promised to raise minimum pensions to 1,000 euros per month from around 500 euros, abolish road tax on most cars and introduce a “dignity income” - a new welfare benefit to help the 15 million poorest Italians.

The dignity income was a response to 5-Star’s flagship policy the “citizens’ wage,” which would top up the income of 9 million poor Italians to 780 euros per month, just over half the average wage, at an annual cost of 17 billion euros.

5-Star has rowed back on a previous pledge to hold a referendum on Italy’s euro membership, but its 31-year-old leader, Luigi Di Maio, still wants to renegotiate the EU’s fiscal rules and raise the budget deficit.

“We have to increase public investments to help growth and the only way to do that is to increase the deficit above 3 percent of GDP,” he told Reuters.

An announcement on Friday by Bkav, a Vietnamese cybersecurity firm, that it had cracked Apple’s Face ID, and a subsequent video apparently showing an iPhone being unlocked when pointed at a mask, were greeted with some skepticism.

Ngo Tuan Anh, Bkav’s vice president, gave Reuters several demonstrations, first unlocking the phone with his face and then by using the mask. It appeared to work each time.

However, he declined to register a user ID and the mask on the phone from scratch because, he said, the iPhone and mask need to be placed at very specific angles, and the mask to be refined, a process he said could take up to nine hours.

Apple declined to comment, referring journalists to a page on its website that explains how Face ID works.

That page says the probability of a random person unlocking another user’s phone with their face was approximately 1-in-a-million, compared to 1-in-50,000 for the previously used fingerprint scanner. It also says Face ID allows only five unsuccessful match attempts before a passcode is required.

Anh acknowledged that preparing the mask wasn’t easy, but he said he believed the demonstration showed facial recognition as a way to authenticate users would be risky for some.

“(These) important people should absolutely not lend their iPhone X to anyone if they have activated the Face ID function.”

It’s the first reported case of researchers apparently being able to fool the Face ID software.

Cybersecurity experts said the issue was not so much whether Face ID could be hacked, but how much effort a hack required.

“Nothing is 100 percent secure,” wrote Terry Ray, chief technology officer at U.S.-based cybersecurity company Imperva, in a note. “Where there’s a will, there’s a way. The questions are: How much trouble would someone go to, and how much would they spend, to get your data?”

Bkav’s Anh said the research took about a week, and included numerous failures. The mask frame was made of plastic, covered with paper tape to resemble skin, with a silicone nose and paper for eyes and mouth.

As far back as 2009, Bkav researchers highlighted what they said were problems with using facial recognition as a way to authenticate users.

“I believe that it continues to develop its weapons,” Abe told a news conference in Manila after a series of meetings with other Asian leaders at a gathering of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and East Asia Forum.

“There is no point for talks for the sake of talks,” he said.

Abe’s insistence that tough sanctions, including restrictions on oil sales, are necessary to soften up the North Korean regime over the coming winter could put him at loggerheads with other countries such as South Korea that might agree to open talks if approached by the North.

The shock resignation has thrust Lebanon back onto the front line of a power struggle between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Iran - a rivalry that has also buffeted Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain.

Hariri flew to Riyadh on Nov. 3, after meeting in Beirut Ali Akbar Velayati, the top foreign policy adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

“Hariri claims that in our meeting he asked Iran to stop interfering in the Lebanese affairs, but he did not say such a thing,” Velayati was quoted as saying by Iranian state television’s website on Tuesday.

“Our meeting was not tense or violent at all. These are all lies,” he said.

Velayati said Iran hoped Hariri would return to Lebanon, accusing Riyadh of fanning the flames of tension as it “could not tolerate the strategic friendship” between Tehran and Beirut.

Hariri denied Velayati’s account that the Lebanese leader had offered to mediate between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

“Prime Minister Hariri did not offer mediation between any countries,” a statement from his press office said.

“He presented to Velayati his point of view about the need to stop Iranian interventions in Yemen as a gateway and a precondition for any improvement in ties between (Iran) and the kingdom,” it said.

A long-time Saudi ally, Hariri had first mentioned the Velayati meeting in a television interview on Sunday night, his first public comments since quitting.

He warned Lebanon was at risk of Gulf Arab sanctions because of regional meddling by Shi‘ite Hezbollah and said he would return to Lebanon within days.

In his resignation speech in a broadcast from Saudi Arabia on Nov. 4, Hariri said he feared assassination and accused Iran along with Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world.

A Reuters witness saw two other tanks parked beside the main road from Harare to Chinhoyi, about 20 km (14 miles) from the city. One, which was pointed in the direction of the capital, had come off its tracks. Soldiers at the scene refused to talk to Reuters.

Earlier on Tuesday the youth wing of Zimbabwe’s ruling party accused the military chief of subverting the constitution for threatening to intervene after President Robert Mugabe plunged the country into crisis by sacking Mnangagwa last week.

Mnangagwa, 75, a long-serving veteran of Zimbabwe’s 1970s liberation wars, had been viewed as a likely successor to Mugabe before the president fired him on Nov. 6.

His downfall appeared to pave the way for Mugabe’s wife Grace to succeed the 93-year-old president, the only leader Zimbabwe has known in 37 years of independence.

In an unprecedented step, the head of the armed forces, Constantino Chiwenga, openly threatened to intervene in politics on Monday if the purge of war veterans did not stop.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

“Disaster”, “nightmare”, “humiliation”, were just a few of the words splashed across the front pages of Italy’s newspapers to describe the shock of the team’s elimination at the hands of a little-fancied Sweden on Monday.

“Apocalypse Azzurra,” said the headline of La Stampa newspaper, referring to the unofficial name of the team whose bright blue jerseys reflect the azure of the Mediterranean Sea.

Italy have played in the last 14 World Cup finals, winning two of them. In all, they have triumphed four times, a tally only exceeded by Brazil, who have won five times. Italy are the only former champions not to make it to next year’s finals.

“This is disgusting, the World Cup can’t exist without Italy. It just can’t exist,” said Francesco Macella, a fan who was in Milan’s San Siro stadium to watch as Italy failed to overcome Sweden in a tense 0-0 draw in the second leg of their European playoff, having lost the first leg 1-0 in Stockholm.

Every four years, Italy has come together over the World Cup, putting aside its historic city-state rivalries to become a united nation for a brief moment in time, cheering on all the players regardless if they came from Milan, Rome or Naples.

“We have failed and at a social level this could have been so important,” said Italy’s storied goalkeeper, Gigi Buffon, in a tearful interview minutes after the final whistle on Monday, recognising the broader significance of the national team.

POLITICAL FALLOUT

While newspapers laid the blame squarely on team coach Gian Piero Ventura and soccer federation chief Carlo Tavecchio, some fans thought the failure reflected wider problems.

“This match mirrors our country which is falling apart,” said a disappointed Stefano Martufello as he left the San Siro.

Italy is slowly recovering from a prolonged recession, but most people say they see no sign of the pick-up, with wages stagnant and unemployment stuck above 11 percent. On the political front, opinion polls predict that parliamentary elections due by next May will result in a deadlock.

Governments normally hope that the feel-good factor from sporting triumphs feeds over into the political sphere.

In the wake of Monday’s downfall, the normally busy Twitter feeds of ruling politicians were quiet, while some opposition leaders sought to score quick points.

“There are too many foreigners on (our) pitches, from youth teams to Serie A and this is the result,” said Matteo Salvini, head of the anti-immigrant Northern League, echoing criticism in far-right quarters over the space given in sport to outsiders.

“STOPTHEINVASION. Give more room to Italian lads,” he wrote, drawing hundreds of largely negative comments on his Twitter feed.

Italy last won the World Cup in 2006, but exited at the group stage in 2010 and 2014 after lacklustre displays. This latest setback showed how far the team have drifted from their peak, belying the widespread expectation that they would have eased past Sweden.

“For years I’ve had this feeling that Italian football is a little like Italy itself, which lives a lot in the past when the reality is that it finds itself dealing with things that are quite intense, even shocking,” said Matteo Maragnano, peeling oranges in a cafe near Milan’s gothic cathedral.

Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee say they will grill Sessions about statements he made to the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which he denied knowing about meetings between campaign aides and Russians.

Sessions’ statements, made at his confirmation hearing in January and at a Senate Judiciary hearing in October, appear to have been contradicted when charges against former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos were unsealed in a probe into allegations of links between Russia and the Trump campaign.

“We intend to ask you about these inconsistencies,” the committee’s Democratic members said in a Nov. 7 letter to Sessions. “We are providing you notice in advance because we expect you to respond,” the Democrats said.

Sessions, a former U.S. Senator who was involved in Trump’s campaign, has denied misleading Congress, saying his prior statements under oath were all true.

U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. election to help then-Republican candidate Trump’s campaign.

The Kremlin has denied interfering in the election and Trump denies any collusion between his campaign and Russian officials.

FORMER AIDE

Sessions is likely to be pressed about Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser.

In court records, prosecutors say Papadopoulos told a March 2016 meeting of campaign officials that he had Russian connections and could help arrange a meeting with Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

A photograph posted on Trump’s Instagram account shows that Papadopoulos, Sessions and Trump were all seated at the same table in that meeting.

According to a source familiar with the matter, Sessions shut down Papadopoulos’ idea of engaging with Russia, and the Trump administration has played down Papadopoulos’ role in the campaign, saying he was nothing more than a low level volunteer.

But the court documents, and Papadopoulos’ guilty plea for lying to the FBI over his contacts with Russian officials, put new focus on Sessions’ earlier testimony.

Sessions said during January’s confirmation hearing that he was unaware of communications between the campaign and Russia.

After the hearing, news reports emerged showing that Sessions had himself met Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak at least twice in 2016.

Under pressure, Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation.

In another Senate hearing last month, Sessions testified he had no improper involvement with Russians and was not aware of anyone else from the campaign who did.

“Attorney General Sessions has misrepresented the truth ... time and time again,” Al Franken, a Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee member, said on the Senate floor on Monday.

Sessions is also likely to face tough questions over his decision to ask federal prosecutors to look into whether a special counsel should be appointed to probe any wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation over the sale of a uranium company to Russia.

Sessions asked for prosecutors to look at the matter in response to a letter from Representative Robert Goodlatte, the House Judiciary Committee chairman.

As mudanças via MP na reforma, que entrou em vigor no sábado, faz parte de um compromisso fechado pelo governo com os senadores para aprovar o texto em julho a fim de encaminhá-lo diretamente à sanção do presidente Michel Temer e evitar que a matéria retornasse à Câmara dos Deputados.

Na véspera, o presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), criticou duramente o eventual envio das mudanças por MP e disse considerar que o instrumento seria inconstitucional e enfraqueceria o espírito da lei.

Para Eunício, se dependesse dele, o governo encaminharia a MP “ainda hoje” ao Congresso por ter força de lei e passar a vigorar imediatamente após ser editada.

A fifth round of negotiations to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement begins this week in Mexico City, weighed down by several contentious U.S. proposals that even some U.S. business leaders have labeled “poison pills” to the process.

From demands that the deal establish minimum U.S. limits in NAFTA auto content to scrapping a key dispute mechanism and adding an automatic expiry clause, the U.S. measures soured the mood in the previous round of talks in Virginia last month.

They have stirred fears that U.S. President Donald Trump could follow through on threats to dump NAFTA, creating a potential conflict with free trade proponents in the Republican Party whose support he wants for his planned tax cuts.

And with scant evidence that either side is prepared to give ground on the thorniest issues, narrowing differences on them this time is unlikely, Mexican and Canadian officials said.

“There’s been no movement on the tough stuff,” said Bosco de la Vega, head of Mexico’s National Agricultural Council (CNA), the main farming lobby, which is resisting another U.S. proposal that could restrict trade in seasonal foodstuffs.

However, there is still hope for progress on less divisive matters, officials said, pointing to signs of growing consensus on topics including telecommunications, e-commerce and small businesses, as well as some technical regulations.

Throughout, negotiators will be mindful of the debate in the U.S. Congress over the planned tax cuts, which have come under scrutiny for their potential impact on the federal deficit.

“All the political oxygen here has been absorbed by tax reform,” said Representative Frank Lucas of Oklahoma, a senior Republican on the House Agriculture Committee who is eager to keep NAFTA alive. “Everything is tax, 100 percent of the time.”

NAFTA working groups are due to begin meeting from Wednesday in Mexico to discuss issues ranging from textiles and services to labor and intellectual property. On Friday, talks will formally get underway through Nov. 21.

Should the U.S. side raise the so-called “poison pills,” Mexico and Canada do not intend to discuss them or propose compromises to dilute them, two officials from the countries said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the negotiations.

“We reject anything to do with national (auto) content,” said one Mexican official involved in the NAFTA discussions, calling the U.S. attitude to the process “short-sighted.”

U.S. business groups have spoken out against the national content proposal but many officials close to the talks believe that Trump is paying little heed to their concerns. That has fueled fears that whatever concessions Mexico and Canada might eventually make, it would “never be enough,” said one in Mexico.

Still, if Trump advances on the tax plan, it is more likely to help NAFTA talks than harm them, said the CNA’s de la Vega.

The new policy affects videos that feature people and groups that have been designated as terrorist by the U.S. or British governments but lack the gory violence or hateful speech that were already barred by YouTube.

A YouTube spokesperson, who asked not be named for security reasons, confirmed the policy in response to questions. The company would not specify when the policy went into effect.

As YouTube terms already barred “terrorists” from using the service, the new policy keeps out videos uploaded by others that militants likely would try to distribute if they could have accounts, according to the spokesperson.

Hundreds of videos of slain al Qaeda recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki lecturing on the history of Islam, recorded long before he advocated violence against the United States, were among those removed under the new policy, the spokesperson said.

Governments and human rights groups have pressed YouTube for years to crack down on extremist videos. They argue that the propaganda radicalized viewers and contributed to deadly terror attacks.

British Home Secretary Amber Rudd amplified the pressure during visits with tech companies in Silicon Valley in July and a speech in Washington, D.C. last week. European Union and U.S. lawmakers this year have threatened consequences for tech companies if concerns are not addressed.

Legislation could resemble a German law approved in June to fine social media companies 50 million euros ($57 million) if hateful postings are not promptly removed.

YouTube said discussions with outside experts prompted the new policy, but it was unclear why the company decided to act only recently. In June, the company announced that “inflammatory religious or supremacist content” that did not violate its policies would be allowed with warning labels and a restriction making them ineligible for ad revenue.

At the time, Google General Counsel Kent Walker said in a blog post, “We think this strikes the right balance between free expression and access to information without promoting extremely offensive viewpoints.”

The latest step goes farther and was praised by critics such as Paul Barrett, deputy director of the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights.

“If the terrorist is in the business of recruiting and inciting people to make violent attacks, you’ve got to the draw the line” against any of their content, Barrett said.

The new policy does not affect news clips or educational videos about terrorism. But YouTube will not always have an easy time distinguishing, experts said, pointing to tactics such as overlaying extremist commentary on news footage to get around censors.

YouTube has resisted imposing more editorial control because it fears making it harder for important videos to get a wide audience, Juniper Downs, YouTube’s global director of public policy, told a San Francisco conference sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League on Monday.

“We will lose something very valuable if we completely transform the way these platforms work,” she said during a panel discussion.

Internet freedom advocates such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation have urged tech companies to be cautious and transparent in responding to government pressure.

YouTube is relying on government lists of terrorists and terrorist groups for enforcement. Content moderators check the listings and make removal decisions after fielding reports from an automated system, users or partner organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League and The Institute for Strategic Dialogue.

Al-Awlaki, whom the U.S. killed in a 2011 drone strike, was designated a terrorist by the U.S. Treasury the year prior.

Writing on Twitter, Hariri urged Lebanese to remain calm and said his family would stay in Saudi Arabia, calling it “their country”.

Hariri’s resignation while in Saudi Arabia pitched Lebanon into political crisis.

Top Lebanese government officials and senior politicians close to Hariri believe Saudi Arabia coerced him into quitting and has been holding him against his will ever since, though Hariri and Riyadh have denied this.

Hariri cited fear of assassination and accused Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world during his resignation speech.

Hariri gave his first public remarks on Sunday, saying in a televised interview in Riyadh he planned to return to Lebanon within days to affirm his resignation.

Lebanese President Michel Aoun, who has stated that he believes Riyadh is restricting Hariri’s freedom, has refused to his resignation until his return from Saudi Arabia.

“Desastre”, “pesadelo”, “humilhação” foram só algumas das palavras estampadas nas manchetes dos jornais da Itália para descrever o choque da eliminação do time nas mãos da pouco falada Suécia na segunda-feira.

“Apocalipse Azzurra”, disse a primeira página do jornal La Stampa, referindo-se ao nome extraoficial da seleção, cuja camisa azul brilhante reflete a cor do mar Mediterrâneo.

A Itália disputou os últimos 14 mundiais e venceu dois deles. No total o time triunfou quatro vezes, uma façanha só superada pelo pentacampeão Brasil, e é o único ex-campeão mundial a ficar fora do torneio do ano que vem.

“Isto é um desgosto, a Copa do Mundo não pode existir sem a Itália. Simplesmente não pode existir”, disse Francesco Macella, torcedor que estava no estádio San Siro do Milan e viu sua seleção se mostrar incapaz de superar os suecos na tensa partida de volta sem gols de seu playoff europeu depois de perder o jogo de ida por 1 x 0 em Estocolmo.

A cada quatro anos a Itália se une por causa da Copa do Mundo, pondo de lado as rivalidades para se tornar uma nação unida por um breve período de tempo e torcendo por todos os jogadores, independentemente de terem vindo de Milão, Roma ou Nápoles.

“Fracassamos, e em nível social isto poderia ter sido muito importante”, disse o lendário goleiro Gianluigi Buffon em uma entrevista que deu aos prantos, minutos depois do apito final de segunda-feira, reconhecendo o significado mais abrangente da seleção.

Embora os jornais tenham atribuído a culpa exclusivamente ao técnico Gian Piero Ventura e ao presidente da Federação de Futebol da Itália (FIGC, na sigla em italiano), Carlo Tavecchio, alguns torcedores acharam que o fiasco refletiu problemas mais amplos.

“Esta partida espelha nosso país, que está desmoronando”, disse Stefano Martufello, decepcionado, ao sair de San Siro.

A Itália está se recuperando lentamente de uma recessão prolongada, mas a maioria das pessoas diz não ver sinais de recuperação –os salários estão estagnados e o desemprego está acima dos 11 por cento.

No fronte político, pesquisas de opinião preveem que as eleições parlamentares marcadas para maio próximo resultarão em um impasse.

The booing of the anthem, “The March of the Volunteers”, has become a fixture at football matches in the Chinese-ruled territory, with some parallels to protests in the United States where American football players have knelt during the national anthem, an act denounced by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Now the former British colony is preparing to introduce a law that will penalize people who boo the anthem, a measure that critics say undermines the city’s autonomy and freedoms guaranteed when it returned to China 20 years ago.

Details of the law, including jail terms and the scope of enforcement, have yet to be set. China extended the law to cover Hong Kong earlier this month.

Chinese President Xi Jinping in recent years has ushered in new legislation aimed at securing the country from threats both within and outside its borders, besides presiding over a sweeping crackdown on dissent and free speech.

Chinese officials have said the anthem law is necessary to safeguard the authority of the state.

Several hundred fans greeted the anthem before the match against Lebanon with jeers and boos, with some unfurling banners that said “Die for Hong Kong”, while others yelled “We are Hong Kong” in English, rather than the local Cantonese dialect.

Some security guards signaled to the supporters to behave.

“I‘m not scared even if it becomes law ... I will go to the toilet instead of sitting when the national anthem is on,” Hong Kong supporter Bendter Chong said when asked if he would continue to jeer the anthem when the law is enacted.

Tensions between Hong Kong and mainland China have increased in recent years amid calls for greater democracy. Mass street protests in 2014 paralyzed parts of the city although they failed to secure concessions on electoral reform from Beijing.

Most of the jeering was from youths, underscoring how the younger generation has become increasingly disaffected by political tension and economic hardship.

Security was tight at the Hong Kong Stadium, the venue for the city’s annual Rugby Sevens tournament, where about 10,000 gathered for the match. The stadium has capacity for 40,000.

The game ended Lebanon 1, Hong Kong 0.

“I’m not sure about the law, but for sure people will be more behaved,” said Hong Kong supporter Fai Chan. “But it is still a matter of whether it is worth our respect.”

Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” arrangement that guarantees a high degree of autonomy, including an independent judiciary and freedom of expression.

In 2015, Hong Kong football fans booed the Chinese anthem during a World Cup qualifier, prompting a fine for the Hong Kong Football Association from world body FIFA.

The association was warned by the Asian Football Confederation recently over the conduct of fans and said “a repeat violation may result in more severe punishment”.",Hong Kong soccer fans defy Beijing by booing Chinese national anthem,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-hongkong-anthem/hong-kong-soccer-fans-defy-beijing-by-booing-chinese-national-anthem-idUSKBN1DE1PE?il=0

Consumer price inflation was unchanged from September’s five-and-a-half-year high of 3.0 percent, official data showed on Tuesday.

When the BoE raised benchmark borrowing costs for the first time in a decade in early November, it said it expected inflation would hit 3.2 percent in October before starting to fall slowly.

Sterling fell against the dollar after the data and British government bond prices rose, as markets lengthened the odds on the BoE following up this month’s hike with another one in the foreseeable future.

“Red faces all round as UK inflation fails to rise as widely expected, not least by the Bank of England,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at financial data company IHS Markit.

“Today’s numbers will dampen expectations on whether we will see further rate hikes any time soon.”

British inflation has surged from just 0.5 percent at the time of the June 2016 vote to leave the European Union as the fall in the pound pushed up the cost of imported goods.

Tuesday’s data spared BoE’s governor Mark Carney the embarrassment of having to write to finance minister Philip Hammond to explain how the BoE missed its 2 percent inflation target by more than a percentage point.

But the figures will add to criticisms from many economists who said this month’s rate rise was unnecessary against a backdrop of a slowing domestic economy and weak productivity and wage growth.

Prices are displayed on a store window in London, Britain May 16, 2017. REUTERS/Neil Hall

With the worst of the Brexit impact on prices now past, the critics of the BoE decision saw little need to raise rates at a time when Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU remains highly uncertain.

DATA DILEMMA

The Bank argues that leaving the EU will damage Britain’s ability to grow as fast as before without generating excess inflation, and that the lowest unemployment rate since 1975 makes labor shortages and a rebound in wage growth a risk.

It has said it still expects inflation to be slightly above target in three years’ time.

Paul Diggle, a senior economist at Aberdeen Asset Management, said inflation would pick up again due to rising oil prices and residual effects of the weaker pound.

“The Bank of England is stuck between a rock and a hard place. On balance, we think (it) will have to hike interest rates at least once more next year.”

A measure of retail price inflation, used to calculate payments on government bonds and many commercial contracts, hit a near six-year high of 4.0 percent, providing bad news for Hammond who is due to announce a budget plan on Nov. 22.

But other data showed that some underlying price pressures are easing.

Costs of manufacturers’ raw materials - much of them imported - were 4.6 percent higher than in October 2016, down from an increase of 8.1 percent in September. This was the lowest rate of producer input price inflation since July 2016, a month after the Brexit vote.",Steady UK inflation leaves question mark over BoE rates action,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy-inflation/steady-uk-inflation-leaves-question-mark-over-boe-rates-action-idINKBN1DE139?il=0

At a summit in the Philippines, Donald Trump forged a “great relationship” with President Rodrigo Duterte, who only a year ago had cursed “son of a bitch” Barack Obama for decrying his administration’s bloody war on drug pushers and addicts.

And Trump flashed a thumbs-up as he shook hands with Cambodia’s authoritarian prime minister, Hun Sen, who praised the U.S. president as a kindred spirit for telling countries to put their own interests first.

“You are a great man to me,” Hun Sen said, addressing Trump at a meeting with other Southeast Asian leaders, and then referenced Trump’s ‘America First’ policy.

“I would like to inform you that if you follow your new policy in respect of the independence and sovereignty of other countries, the United States will have a lot of friends and you will be much respected and loved.”

For other leaders across Asia, however, Trump’s go-it-alone instincts must have represented a puzzling departure from his predecessors, who were - to varying degrees - standard bearers of multilateralism, democracy and human rights.

During a tour that took him to Japan, South Korea, China and Vietnam and the Philippines capital, Trump called for joint efforts to tighten the screws on North Korea and its development of nuclear weapons in defiance of U.N. sanctions.

But at an Asia-Pacific summit in Vietnam, he declared that redressing the uneven balance of trade between Asia and the United States was at the center of his “America First” policy, which he says will protect U.S. workers.

Trump’s vision has up-ended a consensus favoring multinational trade pacts whose regional champion is now China. On the sidelines of the Vietnam meeting, 11 countries kept alive a Trans Pacific trade deal that Trump walked away from last year in the name of protecting American jobs.

One cabinet member from a major ASEAN country told Reuters there was little enthusiasm in the region for Trump’s bilateral approach to deals.

“As Singapore Prime Minister Lee pointed out, the reason bilateral trade deals are so attractive for the USA, is precisely why no one will want to enter into one with the USA: because the USA could bully anyone on a bilateral basis,” said the Cabinet member who did not want to be named.

“Why would anyone sign up for that?”

THE ART OF THE DEALS

Trump told reporters before leaving that he had sealed deals of “at least $300 billion, possibly triple that figure”.

U.S. businesses signed around $250 billion dollars worth of deals during Trump’s Beijing visit, but many of those were nonbinding. Missing was any agreement on market access or reduction in technology-sharing agreements that American businesses have long complained about.

For Trump, dogged at home by low public approval ratings and investigations into Russian links to his election campaign, the deals will be an important prize to flaunt on his return.

“The multi-billion-dollar deals he struck in Beijing may not help the U.S. trade deficit,” said a former Japanese diplomat in Tokyo, who declined to be named. “But optically ... he can tell people that because he went to China with business leaders, he was able to come back with a gift.”

Although there were few weighty deliverables from Trump’s tour, for Asian nations looking nervously at China’s increasing assertiveness, it may be welcomed as a sign that his administration is still committed to the region.

“What regional countries wanted was for him to simply show up – to underscore that America remained at least notionally committed to Asia,” said Shahriman Lockman, a senior analyst at the Institute of Strategic & International Studies in Malaysia.

A senior official in South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s administration said Seoul had been worried he ”would come to South Korea and engage in unexpected behavior and language, but it turned out Trump was quite considerate.”

“South Korea was able to rest assured regarding its partnership with the United States,” the official said.

He also got good reviews at the start of his Asia tour in Japan, which has been currying favor with Trump since right after his election when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe jetted off to Trump Tower with an expensive golf club as a present.

“The most important deliverable is that we can send an almost identical message to the world that we share an identical strategy,” a Japanese government official said.

LAVISH RECEPTION

For Asian leaders, Trump’s off-the-cuff style, freewheeling tweets, and rhetorical hyperbole, must have been daunting. But one thing they seemed to learn was that he responds well to a lavish reception.

“They say in the history of people coming to China there has been nothing like that, and I believe it,” Trump told reporters after his visit to Beijing, where President Xi Jinping extended him the honor of a personal tour of the Forbidden City.

One measure of the Asian trip’s success, he said, was the “red carpet, like I think probably nobody has ever received.”

Diplomats say the bonhomie in Beijing probably stemmed in large part from Washington’s expectations Xi will lean more heavily on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Trump’s pronouncements on North Korea during the trip swung from embracing diplomacy to warnings of military intervention. “Do not underestimate us. And do not try us,” he said in a speech to South Korea’s National Assembly.

Days later, after Pyongyang dismissed the speech as “reckless remarks by an old lunatic,” Trump tweeted: “Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ‘old,’ when I would NEVER call him ‘short and fat?’”. And then he tacked back toward diplomacy. “Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!”

David Pressman, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President Obama, said Trump arrived in Asia without a North Korea strategy and left without one.

“Short and fat is not a nuclear strategy,” he said, adding that Washington’s approach to North Korea was fed by “whim, ego, and theatrical calculations of a fickle and uninformed president.”",Trump heads home with 'America First' ringing in Asian ears,https://www.reuters.com/article/trump-asia-strategy/analysis-trump-heads-home-with-america-first-ringing-in-asian-ears-idINKBN1DE1LX

Six months after party leader Marine Le Pen suffered a crushing defeat against centrist Emmanuel Macron in the presidential election run-off, the poll is part of the 45-year-old National Front’s (FN) efforts to relaunch itself.

“We need to ask ourselves why we didn’t win the presidential election and how we can improve our political offer,” said FN lawmaker Sebastien Chenu. “We want to win elections, we owe it to our members.”

The FN’s 81,000 cardholders - which includes those up to a year late on party dues - are asked to say what type of job they have and where they get their news from.

More crucially, they are asked if they want to ditch the euro and hold a referendum on France’s membership of the European Union and if they think the party should focus less on immigration.

Opposition to the euro and immigration have long been at the heart of the party’s policies, but in the six months since her defeat, Le Pen has progressively watered down her anti-EU stance, which is unpopular and widely considered to be one of the reasons why the FN does not win major elections.

Party officials will use the results of the questionnaire to help prepare a party congress to be held in mid-March.

Members are also asked if they want to change the party’s name. While the FN is a well-known brand throughout France, it is largely associated with Le Pen’s father Jean-Marie, the party founder, who was several times convicted for incitement to racial hatred.

While the FN got more votes than ever in the presidential election, the lower-than-expected second round score as well as the parliamentary election that followed were a huge disappointment for the party and its cardholders.

Opinion polls over the past months have shown Le Pen’s popularity has taken a hit even among party members and it is the far-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed), not the FN, that voters see as Macron’s strongest opponent.

Le Pen said the party needed to learn from its errors and rebrand itself. Her willingness to water down her opposition to the euro lead to the eviction of Florian Philippot, who had been her closest aide since she took over the party in 2011 and an architect of her policy plans.",Soul-searching at France's FN - far-right party polls activists,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-france-politics-fn/soul-searching-at-frances-fn-far-right-party-polls-activists-idUKKBN1DE1V8

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

But they’re not typical Chinese deliverymen.

Bright red, gray and black, they are the robot postmen of the future, and are controlled from a command center 40 kms (25 miles) away by e-commerce giant JD.com.

The robots are among technologies revolutionizing China’s vast delivery industry, which is struggling to keep pace with 50 percent annual growth in parcel volumes amid staff shortages, tight competition and declining margins.

China’s top delivery firms such as S.F. Express, BEST Inc and ZTO Express have begun testing robots and automated sorting lines ahead of China’s Singles Day on Saturday - an annual online discount shopping extravaganza which could see 1.5 billion packages shipped around the country.

“Wages are going up and the technology cost is actually going down,” said Bao Yan, director of strategy at JD Logistics, which manages parent JD.com’s logistics network. “We own the full process... we want to have automation throughout, from the fulfillment center to transportation and for last-mile delivery.”

To be sure, the robot revolution isn’t unique to China. U.S. online retailer Amazon has staffed warehouses with thousands of robots since 2014, helping cut operating costs and delivery times.

However, Chinese industry executives say they are leapfrogging Amazon as they make use of and develop these technologies at a faster pace, with many investing proceeds from stock market listings last year.

“The adoption rate among Chinese firms is extremely fast. The economy develops so fast so everyone’s rushing to compete, to keep up,” said Johnny Chou, chairman and founder of BEST.

ROBOTS GALORE

The experiments taking place across China are wide-ranging.

BEST, and Kaola, an e-commerce unit of video games publisher NetEase Inc, are using robots that can shift goods weighing up to 1,000 kgs (1 tonne) across warehouse floors to help human packers.

Online retailers Alibaba, JD.com and S.F. Express are investing in drone programs they hope will one day perform so-called last-mile deliveries, especially in hard to reach rural areas.

Others, like ZTO Express, have rolled out automated sorting lines that can self-scan and tip parcels into bags earmarked for different destinations lined up on either side of the belt.

ZTO‘S Chief Financial Officer James Guo said automated lines, which cost about 4 million yuan ($602,419) apiece, can sort up to 25,000 parcels an hour with 40 workers, versus a manually-operated line that can sort 4,000 parcels with 120 workers. ZTO has 44 of these automated lines.

“By saving the annual salaries of 70-80 workers, I can easily get back my investment in one line,” Guo said.

Other executives said wages in the industry, which has about 3 million workers, were rising by double-digit percentages annually, outpacing China’s economic growth.

RIPPLE EFFECT

The shift is rippling down through the broader industry, logistics suppliers say, driving orders for and research into new technologies and placing new demands on warehouse landlords.

At one end of the chain are robotics and technology firms such as Qingdao Kengic Automation Equipment Co Ltd and Hikvision, which say they are partnering with logistics companies to develop new systems.

“We achieved 100 percent (revenue) growth last year,” said Xu Ke, deputy general manager of Kengic, a unit of rubber machinery maker Mesnac Co Ltd, which says its automated sorting belts are used by JD.com and online discount retailer Vipshop Holdings.

That kind of growth, he says, is attracting over a hundred new competitors into a sector that only five years ago had just a few dozen firms. “The price competition is becoming extremely harsh as everyone tries to grab market share.”

Warehouse owner Global Logistics Properties said customers who want to install robotics were asking for larger floorplates, reliable power supply and higher ceilings.

GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

China’s government has been both boon and bane to the speed of the shift, other executives said.

Beijing has encouraged the fragmented logistics industry to modernize and become more efficient. The “Made in China 2025” initiative to upgrade the country’s manufacturing base has also spurred growth in robots.

But the government maintains tight control of its airspace, holding back the widespread introduction of drones, which many firms see as a potential last-mile delivery solution. Few firms have been granted drone licenses by the aviation regulator.

Still, industry executives confidently predict more parts of the supply chain will see machines replace human workers.

“We may not even need 10 years to achieve completely unmanned warehouses and unmanned distribution,” said BEST’s Chou. “Developments are happening just too quickly.”

Amazon said it will produce a multi-season series that explores new storylines preceding author J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Fellowship of the Ring,” the first installment in the famed fantasy trilogy.

Three movies made of the trilogy in the early 2000s, filmed in New Zealand by director Peter Jackson, garnered nearly $3 billion at the box office and 17 Academy Awards.

Amazon acquired the rights from the Tolkien Estate and Trust but did not say how much it paid for them. The estate, HarperCollins and the films’ distributor New Line Cinema will help Amazon produce the television series.

The project underscores a shift in Amazon’s video programming. Its studio started in 2010 with a focus on unique shows beloved by critics, such as “Transparent,” about a father coming out as transgender to his family.

That was a winning formula for attracting Hollywood talent, awards and buzz, though not Prime subscribers around the world.

Now, Amazon is looking for a dramatic show that could be a hit globally, much like HBO’s popular fantasy series “Game of Thrones.” It is going head to head with Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Hulu and others to bid for top content.

This puts Amazon in uncharted territory, with higher production costs expected.

Amazon justifies its spending on programming as a way to draw new sign-ups to Prime, whose members buy more goods more often from the world’s largest online retailer.

“Amazon Prime heads to Middle Earth,” Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in a Twitter post.

Although “The Lord of the Rings” is the most famous work to emerge from Tolkien’s pen, he wrote much else, including prequel “The Hobbit” - also made into a movie trilogy by Jackson - and the denser “The Silmarillion”. The Amazon series will delve into some of Tolkien’s work that the movies did not explore.

“Amazon is committed to producing super high quality, recognised, branded entertainment,” said Wedbush Securities industry analyst Michael Pachter. “That’s a departure from shows like ”Transparent“ and ”Catastrophe.“”

North Korea is under heavy international pressure to end its weapons programs, pursued in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. But it has vowed never to give up its nuclear arsenal.

Speaking to reporters in the Philippines, Moon said that if North Korea agreed to hold talks, negotiations could be held with all options open.

“If talks begin to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue, I feel it will be realistically difficult for North Korea to completely destroy its nuclear capabilities when their nuclear and missile arsenal are at a developed stage,” Moon said in a briefing.

“If so, North Korea’s nuclear program should be suspended, and negotiations could go on to pursue complete denuclearization.”

Moon’s remarks were made available by the presidential Blue House.

Last week, the North said it did not oppose dialogue, but would “never put the issue related to the supreme interests of the DPRK and security of its people on the bargaining table”.

“We are not interested in such dialogue and negotiations in the least,” the North’s official news agency said, referring to the country by its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

The North defends the programs as a necessary defense against U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention.

U.S. President Donald Trump has traded insults and threats with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as North Korea races toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States.

Trump threatened in his maiden U.N. address to “totally destroy” North Korea if the United States was threatened and has said the time for talking, the policy of previous U.S. administrations, is over.

Moon reiterated his stance that now was the time to increase pressure on North Korea so that it would come to talks.

He said differences in understanding between South Korea and China, North Korea’s lone major ally, regarding the deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system on South Koran soil had not been resolved.

“China has not said it has changed its stance to agree to THAAD and still says THAAD infringes on its security. We have, in turn, explained THAAD is not aimed at China but only toward curbing North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations,” he said.

Last month, South Korea and China agreed to end a year-long standoff over THAAD which had seen South Korean companies doing business in China suffer from retaliation against the system’s deployment.","North Korea nuclear arsenal too developed to destroy quickly, says Moon",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-southkorea/north-korea-nuclear-arsenal-too-developed-to-destroy-quickly-says-moon-idUSKBN1DE1BY

“The gist of the note was that the Islamic State would endure forever,” John Miller, New York’s deputy police commissioner, said at news conference on Wednesday. “He appears to have followed almost exactly the instructions that ISIS has put out on its social media channels to its followers.”

Inspired by Islamic State’s detailed propaganda, these lone wolf assailants have turned trucks and other vehicles into highly effective killing machines.

U.S. officials say Saipov appears to have followed instructions distributed by Islamic State in one of its magazines, Rumiyah (Arabic for “Rome”), which in November 2016 called on sympathizers to carry out truck attacks against Western targets. It also urged followers to leave behind notes declaring support for the group and its leaders.

With the fall of Mosul and Raqqa, the last urban centers under Islamic State’s control in Syria and Iraq, the group has now lost most of the territory it once dominated. It’s tempting to assume that the group has been defeated. But it poses a new threat: as a militant organization that can still exploit social media and recruit sympathizers around the world to kill in its name. Islamic State will now invest more of its resources in a “leaderless jihad” that does not need a physical state.

The severe loss of territory in Iraq and Syria means that routes for foreign jihadists to reach the self-declared caliphate have evaporated. But the group still has the capability to attract recruits, raise funds, secure weapons and inspire sympathizers to carry out attacks around the world.

While Islamic State has organized assaults that required months of training and planning -- such as the November 2015 attacks in central Paris, which killed 130 people -- it has moved steadily toward inspiring loosely coordinated and sometimes haphazard attacks by self-radicalized perpetrators.

The latest wave of attacks fits into appeals by Islamic State’s leaders for their supporters to carry out self-directed assaults that use any means necessary -- including trucks, cars, knives and axes -- to kill civilians, especially in the West.

These lone wolf attacks are the result of an organized, decade-old movement within Islamic jihadism to decentralize attacks and make them more diffuse. This trend predated the emergence of Islamic State, and it can be traced back to al Qaeda after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Some of al Qaeda’s leaders were worried that the U.S.-led war after Sept. 11 would hamper their ability to carry out centrally planned attacks, so they sought ways for sympathizers to act on their own.

Islamic State expanded that strategy far beyond al Qaeda’s original conception. In relying on lone wolf attacks by individuals who are self-radicalized and have only a tangential understanding of jihadist ideology, Islamic State is able to project a greater reach than it actually has.

In September 2014, Abu Muhammed al-Adnani, at the time the Islamic State’s top spokesman, issued an audiotaped appeal that explained these new tactics. Adnani, who was killed two years later in a U.S. air strike in Syria, urged the group’s sympathizers to use whatever means at their disposal to attack American and French citizens, and virtually any other Western civilians. “If you are not able to find an IED or a bullet, single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman, or any of their allies,” he said. “Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him.”

Since Adnani’s statement, it became clear that Islamic State would adopt the “leaderless jihad” strategy. For two years, the group has inspired lone attackers to act in its name, especially in the West. These attacks allowed Islamic State’s leaders to create an illusion of strength to make up for their battlefield losses.

In recent months, Islamic State has quickly claimed responsibility for a spate of attacks on civilians in Europe -- especially in Britain and France -- and in the Middle East. In March, a driver mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London, killing five people before being shot by security forces as he tried to break into Parliament. In May, a suicide bomber killed 22 in an attack on a concert arena in Manchester.

In June, three assailants sped across London Bridge in a van, killing eight by ramming into pedestrians and stabbing people with hunting knives. And in August, suicide attackers stormed a Shi’ite mosque in Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, killing at least 30 worshipers and wounding dozens.

The threat extends beyond the West and the Middle East. Islamic State fighters from Southeast Asia -- including some who recently battled Philippine security forces in the city of Marawi during a five-month siege -- are starting to return home, especially to Malaysia and Indonesia. These militants would pose a threat because of their battlefield experience, guerrilla warfare training and networks they established while fighting in Iraq and Syria.

To combat this more complex range of threats posed by Islamic State and its sympathizers, governments throughout the world will need to do more than simply continue military strikes against targets in Iraq and Syria. It will also mean greater vigilance in monitoring clandestine networks set up by Islamic State operatives -- and adjusting to a new enemy that is constantly adapting its methods.",Commentary: NY truck attack part of Islamic State’s ‘leaderless jihad’,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bazzi-afterislamicstate-commentary/commentary-ny-truck-attack-part-of-islamic-states-leaderless-jihad-idUSKBN1D162G

“Disaster”, “nightmare”, “humiliation”, were just a few of the words splashed across the front pages of Italy’s newspapers to describe the shock of the team’s elimination at the hands of a little-fancied Sweden on Monday.

“Apocalypse Azzurra,” said the headline of La Stampa newspaper, referring to the unofficial name of the team whose bright blue jerseys reflect the azure of the Mediterranean Sea.

Italy have played in the last 14 World Cup finals, winning two of them. In all, they have triumphed four times, a tally only exceeded by Brazil, who have won five times. Italy are the only former champions not to make it to next year’s finals.

“This is disgusting, the World Cup can’t exist without Italy. It just can’t exist,” said Francesco Macella, a fan who was in Milan’s San Siro stadium to watch as Italy failed to overcome Sweden in a tense 0-0 draw in the second leg of their European playoff, having lost the first leg 1-0 in Stockholm.

Every four years, Italy has come together over the World Cup, putting aside its historic city-state rivalries to become a united nation for a brief moment in time, cheering on all the players regardless if they came from Milan, Rome or Naples.

“We have failed and at a social level this could have been so important,” said Italy’s storied goalkeeper, Gigi Buffon, in a tearful interview minutes after the final whistle on Monday, recognising the broader significance of the national team.

POLITICAL FALLOUT

While newspapers laid the blame squarely on team coach Gian Piero Ventura and soccer federation chief Carlo Tavecchio, some fans thought the failure reflected wider problems.

“This match mirrors our country which is falling apart,” said a disappointed Stefano Martufello as he left the San Siro.

Italy is slowly recovering from a prolonged recession, but most people say they see no sign of the pick-up, with wages stagnant and unemployment stuck above 11 percent. On the political front, opinion polls predict that parliamentary elections due by next May will result in a deadlock.

Governments normally hope that the feel-good factor from sporting triumphs feeds over into the political sphere.

In the wake of Monday’s downfall, the normally busy Twitter feeds of ruling politicians were quiet, while some opposition leaders sought to score quick points.

“There are too many foreigners on (our) pitches, from youth teams to Serie A and this is the result,” said Matteo Salvini, head of the anti-immigrant Northern League, echoing criticism in far-right quarters over the space given in sport to outsiders.

“STOPTHEINVASION. Give more room to Italian lads,” he wrote, drawing hundreds of largely negative comments on his Twitter feed.

Italy last won the World Cup in 2006, but exited at the group stage in 2010 and 2014 after lacklustre displays. This latest setback showed how far the team have drifted from their peak, belying the widespread expectation that they would have eased past Sweden.

“For years I’ve had this feeling that Italian football is a little like Italy itself, which lives a lot in the past when the reality is that it finds itself dealing with things that are quite intense, even shocking,” said Matteo Maragnano, peeling oranges in a cafe near Milan’s gothic cathedral.

Grasping for silver linings, newspaper commentators recognised that the Italian team was weak and would not have got very far in Russia.
