Alva Campbell, 69, a death row prisoner who has argued he was too ill for lethal injection is slated to die by injection Wednesday.

Campbell has severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder as the result of a decades-long two-pack-a-day smoking habit.

Campbell’s attorneys say he uses a walker, relies on a colostomy bag, requires four breathing treatments a day and may have lung cancer. They have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop Wednesday's execution, because of his poor health, a motion opposed by the state.

The attorneys warned Campbell’s death could become a “spectacle” if guards are unable to find suitable veins in the sick inmate’s arms.

Dr. James McWeeney noted there were no objective findings such as increased pulse rate or breathing to corroborate Campbell’s anxiety. However, he recommended allowing Campbell to lie “in a semi-recumbent position” during the execution.

Earlier this month, Campbell lost a bid to be executed by firing squad after a federal judge questioned whether lawmakers would enact the bill needed to allow the method.

Prison department spokeswoman JoEllen Smith said Monday that Campbell's ""medical condition and history are being assessed and considered in order to identify any necessary accommodations or contingencies for his execution.""

OHIO GAS STATION CASHIER PUMMELS WOULD-BE ROBBER, OFFICIALS SAY

Meanwhile, prosecutors say Campbell’s health claims were ironic -- given he faked paralysis to escape court custody the day he killed a teenager during a carjacking.

Campbell, who has a lengthy arrest record, first went to jail in 1967, when he was 19 years old, for shooting a state trooper, Dayton Daily News reported. The ill inmate was paroled in 1992 after serving 20 years for killing a man in a Cleveland bar.

In 1997, Campbell, who was shot during a robbery, faked being paralyzed as he was driven by a Franklin County sheriff’s deputy to a court hearing on several armed robbery charges. While in a wheelchair, Campbell overpowered the deputy and fled.

Campbell took the deputy’s gun, carjacked Charles Dials’ car and drove around with him for several hours. Dials, 18, while crouched in the footwell of his own truck, was shot twice in the head by Campbell, court records showed.

Campbell fled, carjacked another vehicle and tried to kidnap two more people before he was found by deputies hiding in a tree, Dayton Daily News reported.

Campbell’s attorney’s argued he was regularly beaten, sexually abused and tortured as a child.

Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich rejected clemency for Campbell last week.

On Tuesday, the state said it was starting final preparations for Campbell’s execution. If the execution happens, Campbell would be the third inmate to be executed in the state this year.

Veterans Day, which falls on Saturday this year, is set aside to reflect on military service to our country. Every American should take a moment to appreciate and honor the service and sacrifice of all who have served in the U.S. military. We owe them more than we can repay.

Throughout American history, approximately 45 million Americans have served in our armed forces during times of war, along with additional millions who served in peacetime. Since 1775 close to 1.4 million members of the military have died in our wars and military actions.

The arrival and departure times airlines share with their customers often don’t match how long an aircraft actually needs to spend in the air. Airlines exaggerate how long a trip will take so that even when there’s a delay, the plane still arrives “on time,"" a strategy known as “schedule padding.”

The Telegraph reported that between 1996 and 2015, the allotted time for a flight from London’s Heathrow airport to Scotland’s Edinburgh has increased significantly, despite improvements in technology, almost entirely due to schedule padding. An AirTran Airways pilot confessed to Reader’s Digest that “airlines really have adjusted their flight arrival times so they can have a better record of on-time arrivals, so they might say a flight takes two hours when it really takes an hour and 45 minutes.”

To make matters worse, the definition of “on-time arrival” isn’t all that it’s cut out to be. Flightstats.com, a site that issues awards for on-time performance (OTP), counts every flight that lands within 15 minutes of its stated arrival time. Even with that generous definition of on-time, airlines try to account for everything that could possibly go wrong.

“We regularly review our flight plans and timings to ensure that we can meet our published departure and arrival times and customers can plan their journeys accordingly,” a British Airways spokesperson told the Telegraph. “The weather, type of aircraft, air traffic control restrictions, airport infrastructure and geopolitical considerations will all play a part in the decisions we take about whether to increase or decrease each route’s published flight time in our schedule.”

While there’s still room for improvement when it comes to the way airlines manage their flight schedules, 15 minutes really isn't that big of a deal, all things considered — just don’t be too impressed next time your flight arrives on schedule.

Well, it turns out you don’t need an evil twin because Apple’s Face ID can be hacked using a mask, according to IT security researchers at Bkav.

The researchers didn’t use any special software or hacks to bypass Face ID, instead using a 3D printed frame, makeup, a silicone nose and 2D images, along with special processing on the cheeks and around the face where there are large areas of skin.

The security experts said they were able to bypass the system because they had understood how Apple’s artificial intelligence worked.

“Everything went much more easily than you expect. You can try it out with your own iPhone X, the phone shall recognise you even when you cover a half of your face,” the hackers explained.

“It means the recognition mechanism is not as strict as you think, Apple seems to rely too much on Face ID’s AI. We just need a half face to create the mask. It was even simpler than we ourselves had thought.”

The researchers claim the entire mask used to trick Face ID cost less than $A200 to create.

“We used a popular 3D printer. Nose was made by a handmade artist. We use 2D printing for other parts (similar to how we tricked Face Recognition 9 years ago). The skin was also handmade to trick Apple’s AI,” they wrote.

While most soccer-loving fans around the globe will be glued to their TV sets next year during the World Cup, restaurants and cinemas around Italy might find themselves a little extra busy during the summer.

That's because Italy, the country that has won four World Cups and is almost always considered to be one of the favorites at major soccer events, failed to qualify for next year's tournament and won't be going to Russia.

""I'll still watch the World Cup when I can, but I'll give precedence to going out for dinner, drinks, to the cinema and going to the beach and playing sports outside,"" said Marco Angelelli, a 31-year-old shop assistant from Salento in southern Italy who now lives in Milan.

Soccer, called ""calcio"" in Italy, is by far the most popular sport in the country. Millions of kids play for fun, while the professionals have been at the top of the game for decades.

Italy won the World Cup in 1934, '38, '82 and 2006, and had qualified for every tournament since 1958. The country's national team also won the European Championship in 1968. At the club level, AC Milan, Juventus and Inter Milan have won dozens of titles between them, constantly making themselves contenders in the Champions League and other competitions.

But in June 2018, soccer will likely take a backseat for the average Italian as the often-deserted streets during matches stay alive with the usual hustle and bustle of summer fun.

""I'll watch if I'm with friends who are watching, but otherwise I won't really care,"" said Giancarlo Esposito, a retired architect from Milan. ""If your team isn't in it, what sense is there?""

Italy was eliminated from World Cup contention on Monday. The team needed to beat Sweden to qualify, but was held to a 0-0 draw. That gave the Swedes a 1-0 win over the two matches of the playoff and a spot at the World Cup.

Will any Italians turn their attention to rooting for Sweden? Sure, according some fans.

""I'll certainly watch the World Cup because I love soccer, but it will be strange for me not seeing Italy, seeing as I have always followed them since I was really young,"" said Alessia Corsi, a 46-year-old housewife from Tuscany. ""I will support who plays well and why not also Sweden, if we're out it's only our fault.""

Angelelli also has a soft spot for Sweden, at least he does now.

Last week, two female students, Emily and Hailey, took to Twitter to protest their school’s dress code after one of the girls earned detention for her attire. And now the girls — and the Twitterverse — are fired up not only over the charges, but the way that Loyalsack High administrators handled this dress code violation.

“@itsleeeeeee has an after school detention for 'excessive midriff' in this outfit,"" wrote Emily of her friend Hailey's offending attire, along with a photo of the loose yellow sweatshirt — with what appears to be a hand-cut choker neck and cropped hem — and high-waisted jeans that Hailey was dress-coded for wearing.

Emily also hinted that she had discussed the dress code with her principal in the past.

""It’s almost like we didn’t have a meeting with @LTHSPrincipal to change the issue of girls constantly being shamed & taken out of class for their normal outfits?” she added.

Apparently, Hailey’s outfit was reported to the school by a male classmate for exposing her cleavage (though there’s no cleavage to be seen), according to responses from herself and a fellow classmate on the thread.

The Harris County medical examiner ruled that her death was caused by the toxic effects of two drugs in the pain cream.","A Mississippi doctor was hit last month with a 16-count indictment for allegedly defrauding a government health care program of more than $2.3 million by prescribing unnecessary and highly suspect compound pain creams to patients he never examined.

The details in Albert Diaz’s indictment highlight the growing scams carried out by medical professionals and pharmacists to hock phony pain ointments that only function to bilk taxpayers of millions of dollars and, in some cases, leave patients dead.

In numerous ploys reminiscent of 19th century snake oil salesmen, pharmacy owners and marketers are bribing or giving kickbacks to doctors for writing spurious prescriptions to Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare patients for costly, dangerous and unneeded pain and scar creams. These compounded ointments – many of which have been found to contain a powerful anesthetic and sedative known as ketamine – have led to at least two deaths and can cost the government up to $28,000 per cream container.

“The snake oil for the 21st century is currently being peddled by compounding pharmacies with claims of miraculous pain creams,” wrote Carol Crisci, an attorney at Chartwell Law Offices. “If these creams worked, and actually reduced patient reliance on oral narcotics, the high price might be warranted. The problem is that there is little evidence that the creams or many of their expensive ingredients actually work when rubbed into the skin.”

Once the predominant form of pharmacy in the U.S. before the advent of mass drug manufacturing in the 1950s, compounding pharmacies mix medications and ingredients based on a doctor’s prescription for strength and dosage. While this allows pharmacists to specifically tailor a medication for patients who may have an allergy to certain ingredients or need a higher or lower dosage than produced, it can also lead to scams and abuse like the fraudulent pain creams.

After more than 50 people died from fungal meningitis and another 680 were sickened after receiving injections in 2012 of a contaminated steroid made by the New England Compounding Center, the Food and Drug Administration investigated and found 30 compounding pharmacies across 18 states with numerous unsafe practices.

In the case of the pain cream schemes, which have been unearthed from New Jersey to California, all follow a similar pattern, with doctors and compound pharmacies working hand-in-hand to prescribe patients these bogus ointments and reaping the financial benefits when the government paid the tab. Pharmacists also have been known to change the ingredients and exploit the narrow legitimate medical uses of the creams to keep ahead of the law.

""The snake oil for the 21st century is currently being peddled by compounding pharmacies with claims of miraculous pain creams."" - Carol Crisci, attorney at Chartwell Law Offices

In two active cases in Texas, pharmacies allegedly defrauded the government of more than $180 million. In one case, the Dallas Morning News reported that Fort Worth’s Ability Pharmacy spent $15 to make a container of cream and charged $28,000 to the government, with federal prosecutors claiming the pharmacy took in $1 million a day on these compound medications alone.

There was no difference in any of the creams given to different patients and many of the patients prescribed the ointments did not have any pain or scars to treat.

“This is yet another shocking example of how unmitigated greed can spawn a fraud so brazen that it almost takes your breath away,” John Parker, the U.S. attorney in Dallas, told the Dallas Morning News. “I would suggest that the costs of playing these games far outweigh whatever short-term gains are realized, no matter their size.”

More nefarious than the financial fraud behind the schemes is the sometimes deadly consequences of taking these creams and ointments.

A baby in California died in 2012 after accidently ingesting her mother’s compound cream, which was ultimately linked to a shady kickback scheme.

Two years later, Desiree Ford, a 22-year-old Houston woman, died only hours after applying a pain cream to her skin. The Harris County medical examiner ruled that her death was caused by the toxic effects of two drugs in the pain cream.

Ford’s father, Richard, is suing the pharmacy that supplied his daughter with the cream, while the doctor who prescribed it – without having talked to or examined her – surrendered his medical license.

“They’re just terrible people,” Ford said. “They make so much money off this, it could be their full-time job.”",Bogus pain creams are costing taxpayers millions -- and their lives,https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/11/13/bogus-pain-creams-are-costing-taxpayers-millions-and-their-lives.html

The television plays a crucial part in our day-to-day lives, so it’s important to keep its placement in mind when planning out a room. Given the shape and massive size of today’s TVs, the big screen has become a massive eyesore without many places to go other than smack dab in the center of a wall. If this is sounds familiar, get ready to get inspired by these three inventive tricks to hide your TV in plain sight.

1. Camouflage it with a black wall. One lone rectangular block of black in a room can create a striking feature that is unfavorable in many designs. By extending the dark hue across a bigger space, you can create a fun accent wall and play down the glaring, shiny black electronic screen. All it requires is a bucket of paint from your local hardware store and a little know-how on basic painting techniques.

If a full black wall is too bold for your design taste, painting just the horizontal strip of the wall that the TV occupies is a nice compromise. Then, you can balance the room with black home decor pieces. Keep it minimal with a black-and-white palette or add some color to lighten the look.

2. Pair it alongside other appliances. If you’re faced with the scenario of having two or more gaping black holes in your room, the best solution may be to simply combine them as an intentional arrangement instead of an odd-one-out situation. For example, you can juxtapose a fireplace with a TV above the mantel. Get a gallery look by hanging similarly-sized pieces, such as a cabinet or oversized artwork. Alternatively, if you enjoy watching television in the kitchen while you prepare or eat dinner, nestle it in with other appliances, such as an oven or wine fridge.

Be sure to take some safety measures when displaying electronics above appliances. Protect your TV from rising heat by mounting it above a mantel or enclosing it in a well-ventilated cabinet. Also make sure the television is still at a comfortable viewing angle to reduce neck strain or consider investing in a flexible wall mount.

3. Invest in built-ins. This is a more customized approach to hiding a TV. Sliding doors, swiveling panels and folding cabinets are carefully measured to the device for a sleek disguise. One of the simpler strategies is to cover the TV with sliding doors that can be matched to the rest of your wall or stand out as an interesting focal point. Other popular ideas include a snug art panel that slides to reveal or conceal a TV. Or if you’d rather opt for a cabinet enclosure, you can conceal additional media components, like speakers or game consoles. Although these options are more expensive and time-consuming, they will completely conceal your TV from view. Do your research and consult an experienced cabinetmaker, electrician or media professional to make the job more manageable.",3 strategies for disguising your TV in plain sight,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/03/3-strategies-for-disguising-your-tv-in-plain-sight.html

Inspired by ISIS, more terrorists are internet-radicalized loners, and many are already known in a general way to law enforcement.
In the 1990s, I was one of those who defended the idea of a wall between intelligence and law enforcement.","You might be surprised to discover that the average college freshman doesn’t remember 9/11.

I was even more surprised to find that a lot of Congressmen don’t either.

That’s the only good explanation for their willingness to play chicken with one of our most valuable anti-terrorism programs. Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act will lapse at the end of the year. And that has inspired a group of Congressmen from the extreme left and extreme right to say that they will let it die if they don’t get what they want. Unfortunately, what they want is to repeal history – and the lessons we all learned on 9/11.

Section 702 allows the government to intercept communications of foreigners who are located overseas. Only foreigners can be targeted for surveillance, but if a foreign terrorist is trading emails with an American, both sides of those conversations will be collected -- the American’s as well as the foreign target’s. No one is arguing that such intercepts shouldn’t happen; if foreign terrorists (or other intelligence targets) are talking to Americans, we need to know who they’re talking to and what they’re saying.

What has the left-right coalition upset is that the intercepted emails are stored in a database that can be checked for other names to help investigators find other terrorist connections. That means, they say, that the communications of Americans (at least the ones who’ve been writing to foreign terrorists) could be searched without a warrant. So they want government investigators to get a separate warrant every time they go back to that lawfully collected database and type in the name of an American.

That sounds like a constitutional requirement, but it’s not. The courts have reviewed the program, and none have held that the Constitution requires a belt for collecting evidence and separate suspenders for searching the same evidence after it’s been collected. Nor is it a response to intentional abuses. The program gets vigorous oversight from Congressional committees, FISA judges, the Justice Department, and privacy and civil liberties officers inside the executive branch; none has found intentional abuses.

I never again want to stand before the children and parents of Americans killed by terrorists and say that my enthusiasm for some unproven theory of civil liberties helped get their loved ones killed.

Instead, the motive of the proposal is ideological, and the risk it addresses is entirely hypothetical. Maybe someday, its supporters say, the government will be tempted to engage in abusive searches, and requiring a warrant will make that less likely.

Unfortunately, the costs of the proposal are anything but hypothetical. It would raise new barriers to the information-sharing and dot-connecting that we’ve rightly insisted upon after learning the lessons of 9/11. Today, when an FBI counterterrorism analyst gets a tip about a suspicious actor, the analyst can run the suspect’s name and number through many databases, including the one holding 702 intercepts.

If the suspect has been communicating with known terrorists abroad, the FBI will get a hit from the 702 database – while there’s still time to stop an attack. Under the new proposal, the 702 database could be locked behind a wall built of probable cause , courts, warrants, and a set of chilling reporting requirements. By the time the FBI gets over this new wall, it could be too late.

That’s exactly the wrong response in today’s climate. Inspired by ISIS, more terrorists are internet-radicalized loners, and many are already known in a general way to law enforcement. They may be “lone wolves” but they’re also “known wolves.” This is no time to make it harder to do an electronic background check on these known suspects. If there were a truth in labeling requirement for acts of Congress, the proposed warrant requirement would be called the “Known Lone Wolf Preservation Act.”

This is all achingly familiar to me. In the 1990s, I was one of those who defended the idea of a wall between intelligence and law enforcement. Not because there had been actual abuses, but because it was easy to imagine them. So why not construct a wall and reduce the risk of abuse?

Well, now we know. In August of 2001, just weeks before the 9/11 attacks, it was the wall that prevented the FBI’s largest and most sophisticated counterterrorism task force from acting when it got word that hardened al Qaeda terror plotters were inside the United States. The FBI had plenty of time in late August and early September to track the plotters down; if they had been allowed to use the intelligence, I am convinced that they would have caught the terrorists and changed history. But the FISA court and FBI lawyers were enforcing the wall so harshly that in the end the FBI task force was forced to stand down, and the attacks played out.

When the 9/11 Commission held its hearings, I felt compelled to tell that story – and to recant my support for the wall.

“I was wrong,” I testified.

I never again want to stand before the children and parents of Americans killed by terrorists and say that my enthusiasm for some unproven theory of civil liberties helped get their loved ones killed.

And if I can offer one piece of hard-earned advice to members of Congress, it’s this: Neither do you.",Ex-Homeland Security official: FISA checks on known terror suspects are a matter of life and death,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/14/ex-homeland-security-official-fisa-checks-on-known-terror-suspects-are-matter-life-and-death.html

The ripple effect is felt to this day.

“A real good friend of ours committed suicide March 31,” said Cox, who told Fox News that the number lost to suicide rivals combat deaths. “For my deployments, equal with suicide and combat kills. So many factors, too many to list.”

They averaged 15 to 20 miles a day, buoyed by the strangers who join the walk to support their cause. When Lingo broke a bone in his foot from overuse, Collins, left his Oklahoma job, and stepped up.

“I’ve been that guy who’s had a gun to my head,” said Collins, whose brush with suicidal thoughts was a gut check, though he says he never seriously considered ending his life. “We’ve all struggled with things. … I think what’s really missing is when people get out of military, they don’t have the support group.

The NFL take-a-knee protests dropped off dramatically Sunday, with all but a handful of players standing for the national anthem as teams pulled out the stops to honor the military for Veterans Day.

“Please stop smashing your Keurig coffee machines,” Hannity said in his monologue Monday night, explaining that the coffee company was “a victim in all of this.”

Conservatives took to social media over the weekend to post videos of themselves throwing out, or destroying, their Keurig machines after the company tweeted Saturday that it “worked with our media partner and FOX news to stop our ad from airing during the Sean Hannity Show.”

Hannity said the liberal group Media Matters for America was responsible for targeting his advertisers after critics said he seemed to defend Moore, who was accused last week of having sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl in 1979. Hannity said critics took his statements out of context.

Keurig’s CEO, Bob Gamgort, addressed the situation in an email to company employees obtained by The Washington Post, calling the situation “unacceptable” and said the move “was done outside of company protocols.”

The memo explained the company advertises to both liberal and conservative networks, “which will continue.” Gamgort told employees, “I apologize for any negativity that you have experienced as a result of this situation and assure you that we will learn and improve going forward.”

Hannity said Keurig was “preyed upon by the most anti-free speech, pro-censorship group in the United States today.

Who’s afraid of the Clintons? Not Donna Brazile.

The explosive book by the former head of the Democratic National Committee is rocking the political world with its tales of Hillary Clinton’s brazen corruption and tawdry deceits. To add extra punch to her insider’s account, Brazile is telling interviewers that Clinton’s 2016 campaign was “sterile” and a “cult,” and mocking it as sexless and joyless.

She even writes that she considered trying to replace Clinton as the nominee over health concerns after the candidate collapsed at the 9/11 anniversary ceremony, a fact that demolishes the myth that suspicions about Clinton’s condition were the sole province of conservative partisans.

To say the Clinton camp is furious at what they regard as betrayal doesn’t do justice to their outrage. They are attacking Brazile personally, accusing her of telling outright lies just to sell books.

Pendants, uplights, downlights, LEDs — are you confused by all the options out there in kitchen lighting when it comes to creating the illumination you need to prep, cook and dine? We’ve asked expert Ben Mills to explain the different lighting types and the main things to consider in planning an effective design.

Why is kitchen lighting so important? For most of us, the kitchen is the workhorse of the home and a busy spot from morning till night. Good lighting is essential, as it allows you to perform tasks such as prepping food and cleaning up safely, says Mills, executive general manager at Australia’s Crompton Lighting. Plus, it adds character to a space and can quickly take the mood from functional to cozy, perfect for an eat-in kitchen.

Plan lighting as early as possible. Moving light fixtures after a kitchen has been installed can be expensive: Rewiring and repainting mean costs can add up quickly. For that reason, it’s best to plan kitchen lighting during the design stage.

What is a layered lighting design? Light layering involves creating different shades of light, playing with shadows and using colors to highlight a room’s best features. In the kitchen, it generally incorporates task lighting for food prep and cooking, ambient lighting for general illumination and character, and accent lighting to highlight specific features such as a gorgeous backsplash or a piece of art.

Consider safety first. The first priority of kitchen lighting is to provide sufficient illumination for safe and efficient meal prep, cooking and cleaning. This is achieved with task lighting — think LED strip lights under an upper cabinet (these create a lovely, even light with no shadows or heat) or a track system over the island.

Make sure there are no shadows in your prep zones. The best way to do is this is to install task lighting in front of or above you, rather than behind you.

Add ambient lighting for character. Soft, ambient lighting will wash your kitchen with light and create a warm, welcoming glow. It could be in the form of a pendant above a counter or dining table, downlights around the perimeter of the room or a central ceiling light.

Highlight your best features with accent light. Use accent lighting to draw attention to special features such as a backsplash or a dramatic island facade. Installing strip lighting under cabinets or counters is a great way to achieve this. You could also add accent lighting to glass cabinets or open shelving to highlight your displays.

Choose the right style. When it comes to choosing kitchen lights, take your cues from your home’s architecture and the lighting styles in the rest of the home. Choosing similar styles (or at least having a unifying theme such as shape or finish) will create a sense of flow among the spaces. This is particularly important in an open-plan kitchen that flows directly into a living or dining area.

When it comes to decorative lighting trends, the Scandi look is still popular, as well as simple styles in natural wood and black, white and industrial metallics.

Get the proportions right. With pendant lights and other decorative styles, size is also important: too large and the fixture will overwhelm a small kitchen; too small and it may get lost in a large space.

It’s also important to hang the pendant at an appropriate height to reduce the risk of people bumping their heads. Generally speaking, it should be about 32 inches above a table or counter.

Take control. Lighting control systems allow you to alter the illumination as needed and change the mood of the space. With dimmers, for example, you can go from bright lighting for precision cooking to a warm glow for dining. Having controls on separate switch plates lets you control lights in different areas separately.

Don’t be tempted to do the job yourself — unless you’re a trained electrician, always hire a professional to do electrical work in your home.",9 pro tips for choosing kitchen lighting,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/03/9-pro-tips-for-choosing-kitchen-lighting.html

The only reason women don’t do this today is because we place so little value on motherhood.
We don’t understand the significance of what goes on the early years and how indispensable mothers are to their babies.","This past weekend the Wall Street Journal published what I consider to be the most important op-ed of the 21st century. Due to its sensitive nature, Americans rarely hear about this subject. But they should.

The article, by James Taranto, is entitled “The Politicization of Motherhood,” and it centers on an interview with psychoanalyst Erica Komisar, whose new book “Being There: Why Prioritizing Motherhood in the First Three Years Matters,” makes the oh-so-obvious yet controversial argument that babies need their mothers.

As Komisar says in a video about her book, “Mothers are critically important to children in the first three years of life. [It] impacts their emotional well-being.”

For daring to write such a book, Komisar has received the inevitable backlash. After all, it’s taboo enough to suggest parents should stay home. It’s even more taboo to suggest that parent be Mom. Why? Because popular orthodoxy insists the sexes are interchangeable. That’s what the gender equality crowd believes, and it’s what they want everyone else to believe.

If you don’t agree with it (and you shouldn’t, because it isn’t true), you’ll be treated as a pariah. “I couldn’t get on NPR,” Komisar told Taranto. And, she adds, she was “rejected wholesale—particularly in New York—by the liberal press.”

Addressing the effects of maternal absence is difficult enough on its own, but it’s impossible when, as Taranto points out, liberals—who, as we all know, dominate mainstream media—“won’t even acknowledge the problem.”

Komisar did manage to get a spot on “Good Morning America;” but prior to the interview, host Lara Spencer made it clear to Komisar that she didn’t like her book and didn’t “believe in its premise.”

Well, of course she didn’t. Morning television is dominated by female producers and journalists, many of whom are married with kids. And as Bernard Goldberg wrote in “Bias,” “…those gals got a dog in this fight.” He adds, “America’s newsrooms are filled with women who drop their kids off someplace before they go to work or leave them at home with a nanny. These journalists are not just defending working mothers—they’re defending themselves!”

How rich I’d be if I had a dollar for every time I’ve run into this media bias. My first book, which was published 15 years ago (and was coincidentally re-released this year), is similar to Komisar’s in that I make a case for why a mother’s physical and emotional presence are vital to children, to families and to society as a whole. And I too was vilified in the media.

And yet my goal, aside from supporting the work mothers at home do, is no different from Komisar’s: “We don’t want the 50s to come back. What we do want is to be a child-centric society.”

Not the kind of child-centric society we have now, where children are coddled by well-meaning but overprotective parents.

The kind that puts the needs of children above the needs of adults.

Unfortunately, Komisar and I part ways on how to create such a society. As a political liberal, Komisar believes the answer is other people’s money. “All mothers and babies should have the right to be together in the first year,” she says. To do that, America needs maternity leave at full pay “and then flexibility to be together as much as possible for the next two years—meaning mothers should have the ability to work flexibly and part time.”

It is true that flexibility and part-time work become indispensable once children are older and in school all day, but it’s pointless in the first three years. The needs and demands of a baby, let alone a baby and a toddler, are simply too great to be able devote one’s attention to something else without everything falling apart.

Still, there is much Komisar gets right. Her case is particularly compelling because her work has been developed from “three decades’ experience treating families,” writes Taranto. And her conclusions are right on the mark—though admittedly, for some, are hard to hear.

“What I was seeing,” notes Komisar, “was an increase in children being diagnosed with ADHD and an increase in aggression in children, especially in boys, and an increase in depression in little girls.” She saw that the absence of mothers in children’s daily lives was “one of the triggers for these mental disorders.”

Addressing the effects of maternal absence is difficult enough on its own, but it’s impossible when, as Taranto points out, liberals—who, as we all know, dominate mainstream media—“won’t even acknowledge the problem.”

They won’t acknowledge it because they refuse to allow themselves, or anyone else, to feel guilty about the choices they’ve made—as if experiencing this emotion is tantamount to being tortured.

But it isn’t the end of the world to feel guilt. “My best patient is a patient who comes to me feeling guilty,” says Komisar. “Women who feel guilty—it’s a ‘signal’ feeling, that something’s wrong, that they’re in conflict. If they go talk to a therapist or deal with the conflict head-on, they often make different choices and better choices.”

And one of those choices, to prioritize baby care well in advance of its arrival, is a smart one. The only reason women don’t do this today is because we place so little value on motherhood. We don’t understand the significance of what goes on the early years and how indispensable mothers are to their babies. We don’t understand it because we refuse to look.

But the information is there for all who choose to see.",It's time we acknowledge how indispensable mothers are to their babies,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/31/its-time-acknowledge-how-indispensable-mothers-are-to-their-babies.html

He’s saying agree with me or be banished.
A whole lot of Trump voters don’t agree with Trump.
But perhaps Yankah should actually engage with some Trump voters (though I wonder if he knows that many personally).","The Sunday “New York Times” published an op-ed that’s causing a stir: “Can My Children Be Friends With White People?”

It’s by Ekow N. Yankah, a Professor of Law at Cardozo. He’s an African-American who’s got sons, the eldest a four-year-old.

According to Yankah, Donald Trump’s election means he’ll have to teach his sons that racism will continue to be a deep part of the American character, and that they’ll have to learn to be suspicious. “Much sooner than I thought I would, I will have to discuss with my boys whether they can truly be friends with white people.”

He goes on to explain that real friendship only happens where there’s trust, and no desire to wield power over the other.

While it may seem like Yankah is making an argument, what he’s doing is the opposite. He’s shutting off debate. He’s saying agree with me or be banished.

Surprisingly, Yankah claims his childhood in a “Midwestern college town [....] lacked the deep racial tension and mistrust that seem so hard to escape now.”

There’s tension today, yes, but there was tension a few decades ago when he was a kid — maybe he just didn’t notice.

How is it that the election of Trump, following Barack Obama’s two terms, was a turning point in race relations, even if it only supposedly revealed what was there all along? Nevertheless, with Trump if office, Yankah notes for many minorities “the ridiculous thing was thinking friendship was possible in the first place.”

According to Yankah, Trump’s essence is racist. For instance, when the President sees blacks protesting and he speaks out, it’s evidence that the President “cannot tolerate [that] the uppity do not stay in their place.”

But it’s more than Trump. It’s Trump’s supporters who have broken Yankah’s heart. (Though Yankah writes about white people, it should be noted almost 30 percent of Asians and Hispanics, and 8 percent of black people, voted for Trump. Also, millions of Obama voters pulled the lever for Trump.)

Yankah cannot excuse those who explain or apologize for what Trump says and does. The President’s designs are so obvious there can be no other interpretation.

While it may seem like Yankah is making an argument, what he’s doing is the opposite. He’s shutting off debate. He’s saying agree with me or be banished.

Not that he doesn’t feel bad about it: “I do not write this with liberal condescension or glee. My heart is unbearably heavy when I assure you we cannot be friends.”

Heavy heart or not, this is a disastrous attitude, in politics or in friendship. When others disagree, you should first try to understand them, rather than simply condemn them. Certainly there’s a decent chance you don’t fully grasp what they’re saying. And maybe, just maybe, you’re the one who’s mistaken.

In trying to explain the violence earlier this year in Charlottesville, Yankah told his four-year-old “Some people hate others because they are different.” His son replied “But I’m not different.”

His son’s response gives me hope, a lot more than the counsel of despair that Yankah has to offer.

Because if the solution is to shutter friendships, where does that leave us?

No one is saying Yankah has to agree with Trump. A whole lot of Trump voters don’t agree with Trump. But perhaps Yankah should actually engage with some Trump voters (though I wonder if he knows that many personally). He might discover they’re decent people.

He may even discover both Democrats and Republicans — all the way up to the president himself — want Americans of all races and ethnicities to do well.

Furthermore, maybe others will open up and understand him better, and the pain he feels when dealing with his children.

The country is having an argument right now, but it’s often not about the goal, but rather how to get there. And if you think the apologists for Trump are wrong, fine, try to explain to them why, rather than reading their minds and writing them off.

According to Taillon, officials didn't see the ascent as a serious escape attempt, because the inmates would have had to get through at least three fences topped with razor wire to get to freedom.

The news of the disturbance came after social media exploded with what Corrections officials said were false rumors about the prison being overtaken and on fire. McCormick County Sheriff Clarke Starnes told AP that no inmates had escaped and that firefighters had been called but were asked to stay outside the facility until it was safe.

About 900 men are housed at McCormick. In December, an inmate serving a life sentence there escaped and stabbed a police officer while on the run. The officer's protective vest deflected many of the blows, and Michael Allen Williamson was recaptured after a locked door stopped him from getting into a school.

The event commemorated the 242nd birthday of the United States Marine Corps, and we were lucky to have arrived in Rome in time to attend.

Former Private First Class Harold Blunk was the guest speaker. In May 1968, during the Vietnam War, he played a major role in the brutal battle for Foxtrot Ridge. This melee was part of the larger battle for Khe Sanh (one of the largest set piece battles with the North Vietnamese Army in the entire war).

Private Blunk’s role was powerfully captured in the citation written for the Silver Star he was awarded for the indisputable valor and bravery he exhibited in the face of combat:

""In spite of the withering enemy fire, he continued to call in fire missions, adjust the fire around the perimeter, and coordinate the adjustments with the forward observer in the company command post. Throughout the hours of darkness, he and his fellow Marines repelled numerous enemy attacks on their position. Private First Class Blunk's leadership and courage in the face of overwhelming odds rallied his fellow Marines and was decisive in their holding the ‘Crow's Nest.’ With ammunition running critically low, he and another Marine left their besieged perimeter on more than one occasion to collect enemy weapons and ammunition to continue their fight against the enemy.""

Now, 49 years later, Harold Blunk is a successful businessman and active citizen, who is delighted to visit Marine celebrations and remind younger Marines of the bond of courage and sacrifice which binds them all together.

My stepfather, Bob Gingrich, served in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. He spent 27 years in the Army and felt he was serving a cause larger than himself. Much of my devotion to and passion for public service grew from the example he set and his attitude and habits.

Callista had four uncles who served in World War II. Three served in Europe and made it home. Uncle Louie served in the Pacific and was killed in the last months of the war. He is buried on Luzon.

One of the most decent men I ever worked with was the late Republican leader Bob Michel. He landed in Normandy and fought his way across France. In the Battle of the Hürtgen Forest in 1944, he was in a foxhole when a German sniper killed the man next to him. He always wondered why he had been spared, and felt God wanted him to devote his life to serving others.

One of the most amazing men I have worked with is former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. Severely wounded in Italy in the last months of World War II, he spent more than three years in rehabilitation hospitals. Bob then forced himself to get well enough to earn a law degree, run for office, and serve 27 years in Congress. He eventually became Senate Majority Leader and a Republican Presidential nominee. Today, at 94 years old, Bob Dole still goes to work every day.

Our freedom, prosperity, and safety depend on the bravery and loyalty of veterans like these and the monumental sacrifices they make for our country. We are infinitely grateful for their service, as well as for the support and countless sacrifices made by their families, who often spend long periods, periods of intense worrying, without their loved ones.

This Veterans Day is a good time to remind ourselves how much we owe the brave men and women who make great sacrifices to defend America and our freedoms.

Fusion GPS, the firm behind the controversial dossier of allegations about President Trump’s connections to Russia, was – at least in part – hired by a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

The revelation has sparked a frenzy among Republicans who have called for more information on just how involved former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in the production of the unverified dossier.

Here’s what to know about the firm and its connection to the Russia investigations.

What is Fusion GPS?

Founded by veteran journalists, Fusion GPS “provides premium research, strategic intelligence, and due diligence services to corporations, law firms and investors worldwide,” according to its sparse website.

The Washington, D.C.-based firm also says it offers a “cross-disciplinary approach with expertise in media, politics, regulation, national security, and global markets.”

Fusion GPS was started in 2009 by former Wall Street Journal reporters Peter Fritsch and Glenn Simpson.

How is Fusion GPS linked to the Russia investigation?

The political firm was behind the controversial dossier that contained a number of colorful but unverifiable claims about Trump. The company retained British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who produced the 35-page dossier.

FUSION GPS LINK TO DEMOCRATS MURKY BY DESIGN

While it has not been verified, the dossier, which included explicit sexual and financial allegations against Trump, created further speculation about any Trump connection to Russian officials – a question that has dogged his campaign and presidency.

Who funded the dossier?

The firm was originally retained during the election by the conservative website Washington Free Beacon who wanted opposition research on Trump.

After Trump became the GOP presidential nominee, Clinton and the DNC retained Fusion GPS through lawyer Marc Elias and his firm, Perkins Coie, Fox News confirmed.

Clinton reportedly did not know about the dossier until BuzzFeed News published it in January 2017. Democrats have defended it as simply opposition research.

TRUMP AND THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION: WHAT TO KNOW

It's unclear what Fusion GPS had dug up by the time Perkins Coie hired them, or how much money was involved in the transaction. The Clinton campaign and the DNC paid Perkins Coie more than $9 million – although it’s uncertain how much of that money, if any, went toward the dossier.

The Clinton campaign and the DNC funded the project until October 2016 – right before the election.

Trump has suggested that the dossier was funded by Russia, Democrats, the FBI or all of them.

Anything else?

Simpson has done substantial investigative work on the case of Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who was imprisoned after reporting a massive tax fraud scheme. Magnitsky died in prison, and the U.S. enacted the Magnitsky Act, which imposes sanctions on certain Russian officials.

During the campaign, Donald Trump Jr., the president’s oldest son, took a controversial meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who was supposed to have damning information about Clinton. Instead, those who went to the meeting said she just wanted to talk about the Magnitsky Act.

In his investigative work on Magnitsky, Simpson may have found evidence that contradicts details of the case accepted by the U.S., NBC News reported.

Fusion GPS also did work as a firm related to the Magnitsky Act.

Late last week, Iowa State University sophomore Chris Jorgensen tweeted out a photo of a Pop-Tart and processed cheese sandwich to his 1100 followers, along with a caption reading, “You ain’t from Iowa if you never had one of these.”

The Iowans who saw his tweet, however, apparently had no idea what he was talking about, and they weren’t afraid to share their opinions in the comments. In the days since posting his recipe, Jorgensen has been blasted by fellow residents who were so grossed-out, that they not only refuted his claims, but refused to claim him as one of their own.

One user, who responded “on behalf of Iowa,” further suggested that Wisconsin should claim him instead, as they’re more known for their cheese and cheese-based dishes. But soon, even this devolved into a game of Jorgensen hot-potato, with Wisconsin passing on the offer and suggesting a different state, and so on and so forth:

Others even called for Jorgensen to be arrested for his crimes against food, which ultimately prompted the official campus police of Iowa State to respond: “You’re under arrest,” they told Jorgensen.

NUTELLA FANS ARE FUMING OVER RECIPE CHANGE

Jorgensen’s post wasn’t completely without its fans. At least one person said she’d “like to try” one and asked what kind of Pop-Tarts he uses (strawberry), while another praised him for his artsy photography. According to his website, Jorgensen is a photographer for Iowa State's student newspaper.

Jorgensen, meanwhile, doesn’t seem too fazed by the criticism, but rather excited that his tweet went viral on Reddit, and earned him a story in the Des Moines Register.

On the other hand, it’s clear he sees the humor in all of this, and didn’t actually enjoy his sweet, cheesy sandwich: Once his idea was shared on WorldStarHipHop’s Twitter account — with no link back to the original tweet — Jorgensen lamented the fact that he wasn’t getting credit for his viral, if flawed, recipe.

The NFL take-a-knee protests dropped off dramatically Sunday, with all but a handful of players standing for the national anthem as teams pulled out the stops to honor the military for Veterans Day.

As of Sunday afternoon, only three players — the San Francisco 49ers’ Eric Reid and Marquise Goodwin and the New York Giants’ Olivier Vernon — had refused to stand for “The Star-Spangled Banner.” That was down from 15 players the week before, according to the ESPN tally.

A sport-loving man has been left wheelchair-bound in middle age after a devastating bout of chicken pox.

Pub landlord Danny Reeves, 44, was very active man enjoyed cycling and snowboarding.

But he caught chicken pox and the infection developed into encephalitis, a rare brain disease that piggy-backs onto other viruses and has a terrifying 70 percent death rate.

Reeves, of Cheltenham, Glos., was lucky to survive but he was left paralyzed and faced the rest of his life in a wheelchair.

To begin with he struggled to cope with regular bouts of severe anxiety, depression, and crippling head pain.

Reeves and his wife Ruth were forced to give up their pub as he spent most of his days struck upstairs in bed.

But eight years later, Reeves is in line for a top award after dramatically rebuilding his life with the support of his wife and mental health charity Headway.

Last year he took part in his first fun run and that rekindled his love of exercise and and he has now competed in his first half-marathon.

""When I arrived at Headway I was a broken shell of a man,"" he said. ""After I left hospital there were some very dark times, but Headway helped to shine a light and guided me to a better place.

""I had lost my identity in many ways, my whole life and how I saw myself - my place in the world was changed forever and I was mourning the life I lost,"" he said. ""I had lost all my confidence and I was scared of my shadow. I felt very isolated.""

""But day by the day Headway helped me take small steps to get better,"" Reeves said. ""They made me realize that I should not focus on what had gone but what was in front of me - not what I couldn't achieve but what I could.""

""I just thought, for my family, I need to keep going, keep pushing myself to get better,"" he said. ""I owe much to Headway but also so much to my wife too. She has been so patient and shown me such love ""

After the informal park run, Reeves began to exercise and really pushed himself, going to training every week.

He progressed to a 10k event and last month took part in Cheltenham's half marathon, which was an emotional landmark for him.

""Around two miles in I saw Ruth on the sidelines. She had tears in her eyes, but they weren't of sadness, they were of happiness,"" Reeves said. ""When I saw that, it really hit me, it gave me the strength to keep going.""

Reeves has now been nominated for the Headway annual award, which celebrates the exceptional efforts of survivors of brain injury.

""Danny has pushed himself and shown such determination and courage,"" Fiona Barnes, of Headway Gloucestershire, said. ""I happen to go to the same training session on a Thursday night and to see someone you know is seriously challenging themselves, and accomplishing so much in what they are doing is truly inspiring.""

""He has been so brave and has worked so hard to continue to take small steps in his recovery,"" she said. ""I really hope he wins the award.""",Man left paralyzed after severe case of chicken pox,https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/11/14/man-left-paralyzed-after-severe-case-chicken-pox.html

By Cleta Mitchell and Hans von Spakovsky, The Wall Street Journal



Donna Brazile has confirmed Bernie Sanders’s worst suspicions. Ms. Brazile, who served as interim chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the fall 2016 campaign, says in a new book that during the primaries, the DNC was controlled by Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Ms. Brazile claims the arrangement was “not illegal,” but that is far from clear.

Ms. Brazile reports that when she arrived on the job in July 2016, Gary Gensler, the campaign’s chief financial officer, told her the DNC was fully under the control of the campaign. In September 2015, 10 months before Mrs. Clinton’s nomination, the party had moved its bank account to the same bank in New York used by the Clinton campaign and created a joint fundraising committee, the Hillary Victory Fund, whose treasurer, bank account, and control were vested in the campaign.

Then, in an August 2015 memorandum of understanding, the DNC essentially handed over its operations to the Clinton campaign for the next 15 months.

The purpose of joint fundraising committees is to allow more than one entity to collaborate in raising money and share in the costs. Each participant is subject to federal contribution limits. When the party itself is a participant, its committee (in this case the DNC) normally handles accounting and financial controls. Not here. The Hillary Victory Fund was controlled by the Clinton campaign, with a campaign employee as treasurer and the fund’s bank account established at the Clinton campaign’s bank. According to Federal Election Commission reports, the Hillary Victory Fund has raised more than $526 million.

The DNC asserted its “neutrality” by also entering into a joint fundraising committee with the Sanders campaign. It raised a total of $1,000. And the Bernie Victory Committee treasurer was the DNC’s designee.

“Money in the battleground states usually stayed in that state,” Ms. Brazile writes, “but all the other states funneled that money directly to the DNC, which quickly transferred the money to Brooklyn”—i.e., Clinton headquarters. She says state parties raised $82 million, of which they kept less than 0.5%.","Hillary Clinton, the DNC and the Law",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/13/hillary-clinton-dnc-and-law

GQ magazine has named Colin Kaepernick, the unemployed NFL quarterback, as its 2017 Citizen of the Year.

Mr. Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, was responsible for starting a national movement to protest the Star Spangled Banner by taking a knee along the sideline.

It wasn’t long before football players across the fruited plain, from pee-wee to professional, emulated Mr. Kaepernick’s unpatriotic protest. Even a few cheerleaders dropped their pom-poms in a show of solidarity.

They said they were protesting alleged racial inequality and police brutality, but it’s pretty clear to most of the country that Mr. Kaepernick and his minions were dishonoring the flag, the anthem and the military.

GQ, the magazine for emasculated men, hailed Mr. Kaepernick as a “powerful symbol of activism and resistance.”

Apparently, GQ seems to think that disrespecting our military and spitting on our flag is a symbol of heroism and manliness. That’s not citizenship – that’s cowardice.

The designation came in the magazine’s annual “Men of the Year” edition – subtitled, “The New American Heroes.”

Apparently, GQ seems to think that disrespecting our military and spitting on our flag is a symbol of heroism and manliness.

That’s not citizenship – that’s cowardice.

“In my view, the most pernicious element of white backlash against Colin’s protest has been the way in which the narrative has been co-opted and re-framed so that taking a knee is now somehow synonymous with disrespecting the flag, with a lack of patriotism,” scholar Christopher Petrella wrote in a GQ essay.",Starnes: GQ Should've Named Colin Kaepernick Its 'Coward of the Year',http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/14/starnes-gq-shouldve-named-colin-kaepernick-its-coward-year

(Katie) ""I knew that she was going to be born in the car because she started coming out.""

So Michael put her professional skills to good use, delivering her own baby outside of the hospital in Harrisburg while her husband George Michael ran in for help:

The Latin American nation says satellite data show 159 square kilometers (61 square miles) of protected rainforest were destroyed in the 12 months ending July 2017.

The software giant's pledge Tuesday on the sidelines of global climate talks in Bonn, Germany, reflects the kinds of efforts large businesses are making to help curb climate change, which is largely caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.

Microsoft has already cut its emissions from 900,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2013 to about 230,000 tons this year, taking it a long way toward the stated goal for 2030.

The Latest on the Syria conflict (all times local):

5:15 p.m.

Syria has called on the United States to withdraw its forces from the country now that the fight against the Islamic State group is nearly over.

The Foreign Ministry statement, carried by state-run media Tuesday, says the presence of the troops will not force a political solution to the conflict.

The comments came a day after U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said ""we are not going to just walk away right now"" before the U.N-backed political process yields results.

U.S troops and advisers are supporting the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in their fight against Islamic State militants in northern and eastern Syria. Kurdish officials want the U.S. troops to remain in the country to help prevent clashes with pro-government forces, which are also battling IS.

U.S. officials say they are maintaining contacts with their Russian counterparts to ensure no friction occurs between the two forces. Russia is a key ally of President Bashar Assad.

Or maybe you don't, but you'd rather use your day off to catch up on precious sleep than spend eight hours (or, hey, three days) in the kitchen. Maybe you hadn't planned on hosting Thanksgiving dinner at all, but all of the sudden, you have to. Or maybe you've planned on hosting Thanksgiving all along, but haven't had a chance to figure out your menu in advance.

Whatever your reasons are for needing a Thanksgiving menu you can pull off in just three hours, I'm here for you, with the menu you need, plus the shopping list and the timed game-plan you need to pull it off as smoothly as possible.

But just because this is a last-minute Thanksgiving plan doesn't mean it's not festive and fresh and modern and delicious. In fact, it even has a bit of an Italian flare going on. The menu feeds eight, but it'd be pretty easy to cut it all in half to feed four if you've got a smaller crowd. And did I mention that you only need to spend three hours in the kitchen to make it happen?

Roast that turkey in pieces.

Cutting a turkey in pieces (two bone-in breast pieces and two whole legs) before roasting not only helps it cook faster, it also makes it easy to add more flavor and moisture without brining. I love to brush a flavor-packed melted butter under and over the skin, and then nestle the pieces on a baking sheet and pour some wine around. Cover it with foil, then roast it for 20 minutes to keep all the moisture and flavor trapped inside, then uncover it for the final cooking to get that nicely crisped skin. Bonus: The pan juices are your shortcut to a flavorful sauce that's a faster and easier answer to gravy.

If you can, buy two whole turkey legs and two split bone-in turkey breasts. Or have your butcher break down a 10–12-pound bird for you and reserve the backbone and wings for another use. If you can't do either of those things, just buy a whole 10–12 pound bird and break it down yourself — the method is the same one you'd use to cut up chicken, and will only take you 10 or 15 minutes to do at the most.

Serve kale salad, which everyone is already obsessed with

I always serve salad at Thanksgiving. You need something bright and fresh and green to balance out the meal, but there's another reason to make one of your sides a fresh salad: no oven or stovetop space needed. And it's fast. For this menu, I use a kale and Brussels sprout recipe that's been popular on epicurious for a long time (hello 274 four-fork reviews!) that fits well with the sort-of-Italian flavor profile of the whole meal. It takes 20 minutes to prep — to make it even faster, use your food processor's slicing disc to cut the Brussels sprouts for you.

Roast some gorgeous squash and sunny sweet potatoes

To cover both the sweet potato and winter squash categories of customary Thanksgiving sides, I roast a whole bunch of sweet potatoes and Delicata squash, cut into aesthetically pleasing circles. And yes, I like to serve it on a circular platter to highlight the circle theme. I add fresh thyme sprigs (no time for pickin' leaves here!) and red-pepper flakes to the veg before roasting.

To finish the dish, I make a gorgeous cranberry agrodolce (a fancy Italian term for sweet and sour dishes — including sauces) from tart cranberries, red-wine vinegar, and sugar. The bright-red sauce is gorgeous drizzled over all those orange circles, but it's also just the thing to balance out the natural sweetness of the roasted squash and sweet potatoes. I make enough to use it as a condiment for the turkey, too. In fact this might be how I make cranberry sauce forevermore.

Make a skillet stuffing

You can't have Thanksgiving without stuffing (or dressing, rather) but you don't have time for a complicated recipe, do you? So I created a stuffing that you can bake in the same pan you used to sauté the stuffing flavorings. There are lots of wild mushrooms because mushrooms in stuffing are the best, and spicy Italian sausage and some fresh sage for extra flavor. There's white wine in here too, just like in the turkey, and grated cheese to make it richer and more flavorful (and because we're already using pecorino in the salad, so why not?). It takes about 20 minutes to assemble and another 20 to bake, and everyone who has tried it so far has asked for seconds.

Frozen puff pastry is your secret weapon for dessert

Alas, there's no time for homemade pie on a three-hour Thanksgiving menu. Someone else is welcome to bring one, of course, but I suggest you follow my teammate Rhoda Boone's easy recipe for a maple-pear sheet tart, which only requires 10 minutes of prep time. Just pop it in the oven right before you sit down to dinner, and it'll be freshly baked in time for dessert. I like to serve it with vanilla ice cream to make dessert a little more substantial. And I pour some Italian amaro to drink after it, because we've been flirting with Italy all night, and because it helps the digestion, right?

THE LEAD STORY: Fox News Exclusive - Attorney General Jeff Sessions directed senior federal prosecutors to evaluate “certain issues” requested by congressional Republicans, involving the sale of Uranium One and alleged unlawful dealings related to the Clinton Foundation, leaving the door open for an appointment of another special counsel ... In a letter first obtained by Fox News, the Justice Department responded to July 27 and September 26 requests from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and other committee members, who called for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the matters in question. The letter comes as Sessions is scheduled to testify before the House Judiciary Committee today.

DONALD TRUMP JR. RELEASES WIKILEAKS COMMUNICATION: President Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., has confirmed on Twitter that he corresponded with WikiLeaks before the 2016 presidential election ... Trump Jr. released his entire dialogue with WikiLeaks in a series of tweets Monday night. WikiLeaks published thousands of emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign Chairman Tony Podesta during the course of the presidential campaign. This is not the first time that Trump Jr's actions have been questioned amid the larger probe into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election. In June 2016, he accepted a now-highly scrutinized meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, after he allegedly was promised “dirt” on Hillary Clinton.

GOP PRESSURE ON MOORE MOUNTS: A growing number of national Republican leaders have pulled their support for Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore in the wake of allegations claiming he had inappropriate sexual contact with teenage girls ... On Monday, a fifth woman, Beverly Young Nelson, stepped forward and said Moore assaulted her in the late 1970s when she was a 16-year-old waitress and he was a 32-year-old lawyer. Moore called Nelson's claims ""absolutely false,"" saying """"I don't even know this woman, I don't know anything about her."" Last week, The Washington Post reported that four women accused Moore of initiating sexual contact with them in the late 1970s and early 1980s. GOP politicians continued to come out against Moore's candidacy following Nelson's accusations, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell calling for Moore to ""step aside"" in the Senate race against Democrat Doug Jones, and acknowledging the possibility of a write-in candidate. Other Republicans who called on Moore to drop out or rescinded their support included the following: Sens. John McCain, John Cornyn, Lindsey Graham, Richard Shelby and Ted Cruz.

HANNITY CALLS FOR CEASE-FIRE IN KEURIG PROTESTS: Fox News' Sean Hannity asked fans to quit smashing their Keurig coffeemakers, after critics blasted the company for moving to pull its advertising from his show over his coverage of sexual assault accusations against U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore ... ""Please stop smashing your Keurig coffee machines,"" Hannity said in his monologue Monday night, explaining that the coffee company was “a victim in all of this.” Conservatives took to social media over the weekend to post videos of themselves throwing out, or destroying, their Keurig machines after the company tweeted Saturday that it “worked with our media partner and FOX news to stop our ad from airing during the Sean Hannity Show.” Hannity said the liberal group Media Matters for America was responsible for targeting his advertisers after critics took his comments out of context and said he seemed to defend Moore.

Wechsler, senior fellow on national security and counterterrorism at the Middle East Institute, told Fox News.","Is it possible to deprogram a terrorist? A group recently formed outside Aleppo is working to find out.

The Syrian Center for Anti-Extremist Ideology, which opened on Oct. 28 and is housed inside an area contested by ISIS, aims to be a place where those who have been indoctrinated by the terrorists can be rehabilitated.

One hundred students -- composed of former ISIS fighters, sympathizers of the Islamic State who worked in civil society and foreigners who fought for the group before defecting and being detained in liberated areas -- are enrolled in the program.

“Everyone has a point of weakness and thinking, from which, we can get into his ideas from a particular side and then remove this extremist and terrorist thought from his brain,” Hussien Nasser, the center’s director, told Fox News.

Participants will take part in programs, lectures and seminars covering Islam, psychological and intellectual development, media and entertainment. With the assistance of specialists who chair each session, the center has tailor-made initiatives to figure out what technique works best at de-radicalizing each militant.

Many of these men, Nasser said, may reside within prisons for a certain amount of time, only to re-enter society and continue to sow chaos or spread hate. He told Fox News his goal is to ""find a solution to these people.""

ISRAEL OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE IN SYRIA AS NEEDED

Although the nascent organization is bootstrapping it -- specialists are unpaid and they have no legal framework to formally “graduate” people out of the center -- they will pass along evaluations about each enrolled prisoner to the relevant court.

Nasser said ISIS itself poses the biggest threat in terms of reforming militants.

“The biggest obstacle is the senior members of ISIS, who planted negative ideas about the concept of moderate Islam and made them criminals under the name of Islam,” Nasser said.

Research into whether these de-radicalization efforts have worked is limited. A 2010 Rand Corporation study on the topic pointed out that recidivism rates may not be the best way to judge a program’s success, while another analysis said Saudi Arabia’s programs had only mixed success. The Saudis poured a lot of funds into their efforts, but saw subsequent suicide bombings perpetrated by graduates of the de-radicalization program.

Sometimes what happens on the battlefield is the biggest catalyst for deprogramming a militant.

TRUMP, PUTIN REPORTEDLY AGREE TO DEFEAT ISIS IN SYRIA

In November 2001, Usama bin Laden gave a speech in which he said, “When people see a strong horse and a weak horse, by nature, they will like the strong horse” -- the idea being, it’s easier for terrorist groups to recruit new followers when they're gaining territory and scoring battlefield victories because people are attracted to winners.

“[ISIS] have shown themselves to be failures in their grand aspiration,” William F. Wechsler, senior fellow on national security and counterterrorism at the Middle East Institute, told Fox News. “Everything they said has so far turned out to be not true. That’s the greatest contribution that the U.S. has made to this effort. You’re de-radicalized because your side has lost.”

A study from King’s College in London of 15 prison-based de-radicalization programs found these programs work better when an insurgency or extremist movement is losing—rather than in places where civil war is still ongoing.

Nasser said he sees some small indications of early progress from his managers in the program.

But he added a caveat: “Of course, I cannot confirm the evaluation until a group of prisoners are released and closely monitored to be properly and effectively evaluated.""",Syria tries 'terrorist rehab' to de-radicalize ISIS militants,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/14/syria-tries-terrorist-rehab-to-de-radicalize-isis-militants.html

While the ""Property Brothers"" star is marrying his fiancée Linda Phan next year, Slater got engaged last fall – live on ""DWTS"" -- to fellow pro dancer Sasha Farber and is finalizing details of their nuptials.

On Monday night, after Scott and Slater learned they were advancing to the ""DWTS"" finals, they filled reporters in on their personal joy. Both are twins and couldn't be happier to be getting married to their longtime loves.

Drew Scott wore a kilt for his Monday night tango and told Fox News after the show that it's a good warm up for his wedding to Phan, in which he also plans to honor his Scottish heritage.

""I'm going to wear a kilt to my wedding,"" Scott said. ""When you're Scottish, [that's] not unusual. A kilt is your tuxedo so she loves that and she's Chinese so for us, we're going to do a sort of fusion of her heritage and my heritage.""

When asked what you wear under a kilt, Scott replied, ""I think you know the answer to that!""

His pro dance partner Slater told reporters that she and Farber have set a date noting that ""Things have been picking up this last week. I'm in the process of sorting out invitations. We're about to go on [the upcoming ""DWTS"" tour] so I'm going to be like crazy strange bridezilla for doing my wedding planning on tour which is going to be difficult, but we're going to make it work.""

""DWTS"" fans were thrilled in October 2016 when Farber proposed to Slater during the live show. He got down on one knee with a dazzling ring during the broadcast and, of course, Slater said yes to her longtime fellow dancer beau who's been paired with such stars as Snooki and gymnast Simone Biles. Farber isn't competing this season.

Slater plansto have fellow ""DWTS"" pros in her bridal party, saying, ""We're not going to be that posh, elegant wedding. I want it to be a party of love and have all our friends there and we're going to focus a lot on the entertainment. I want to surprise Sasha. We want it to be crazy!""

Scott said as he's rehearsed with Slater, they've joked about a double wedding.

That would be an interesting idea, particularly because Scott famously co-stars with his identical twin brother Jonathan on their hit HGTV show while Slater has a fraternal twin sister, Kelly.

Scott joked, ""We talked about it. It's still in the works. What we might just do is let Linda and Emma go and plan half of it and Sasha and I will take it up, we'll claim the other half, and then we'll merge.""

But he quipped that they won't get married at the same ceremony because, ""I don't want her and Sasha to upstage me in my first dance with Linda.""

Neither Scott nor Slater wants their wedding to be televised.

The ""Property Brothers"" star noted, ""For me, it's all about family and family time. I don't get a lot of time because I'm on the road all the time and so they're first and foremost to me and [Linda and I are] going to do our wedding in Europe in the spring and that's exciting.""

Inspired by ISIS, more terrorists are internet-radicalized loners, and many are already known in a general way to law enforcement.
In the 1990s, I was one of those who defended the idea of a wall between intelligence and law enforcement.","You might be surprised to discover that the average college freshman doesn’t remember 9/11.

I was even more surprised to find that a lot of Congressmen don’t either.

That’s the only good explanation for their willingness to play chicken with one of our most valuable anti-terrorism programs. Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act will lapse at the end of the year. And that has inspired a group of Congressmen from the extreme left and extreme right to say that they will let it die if they don’t get what they want. Unfortunately, what they want is to repeal history – and the lessons we all learned on 9/11.

Section 702 allows the government to intercept communications of foreigners who are located overseas. Only foreigners can be targeted for surveillance, but if a foreign terrorist is trading emails with an American, both sides of those conversations will be collected -- the American’s as well as the foreign target’s. No one is arguing that such intercepts shouldn’t happen; if foreign terrorists (or other intelligence targets) are talking to Americans, we need to know who they’re talking to and what they’re saying.

What has the left-right coalition upset is that the intercepted emails are stored in a database that can be checked for other names to help investigators find other terrorist connections. That means, they say, that the communications of Americans (at least the ones who’ve been writing to foreign terrorists) could be searched without a warrant. So they want government investigators to get a separate warrant every time they go back to that lawfully collected database and type in the name of an American.

That sounds like a constitutional requirement, but it’s not. The courts have reviewed the program, and none have held that the Constitution requires a belt for collecting evidence and separate suspenders for searching the same evidence after it’s been collected. Nor is it a response to intentional abuses. The program gets vigorous oversight from Congressional committees, FISA judges, the Justice Department, and privacy and civil liberties officers inside the executive branch; none has found intentional abuses.

I never again want to stand before the children and parents of Americans killed by terrorists and say that my enthusiasm for some unproven theory of civil liberties helped get their loved ones killed.

Instead, the motive of the proposal is ideological, and the risk it addresses is entirely hypothetical. Maybe someday, its supporters say, the government will be tempted to engage in abusive searches, and requiring a warrant will make that less likely.

Unfortunately, the costs of the proposal are anything but hypothetical. It would raise new barriers to the information-sharing and dot-connecting that we’ve rightly insisted upon after learning the lessons of 9/11. Today, when an FBI counterterrorism analyst gets a tip about a suspicious actor, the analyst can run the suspect’s name and number through many databases, including the one holding 702 intercepts.

If the suspect has been communicating with known terrorists abroad, the FBI will get a hit from the 702 database – while there’s still time to stop an attack. Under the new proposal, the 702 database could be locked behind a wall built of probable cause , courts, warrants, and a set of chilling reporting requirements. By the time the FBI gets over this new wall, it could be too late.

That’s exactly the wrong response in today’s climate. Inspired by ISIS, more terrorists are internet-radicalized loners, and many are already known in a general way to law enforcement. They may be “lone wolves” but they’re also “known wolves.” This is no time to make it harder to do an electronic background check on these known suspects. If there were a truth in labeling requirement for acts of Congress, the proposed warrant requirement would be called the “Known Lone Wolf Preservation Act.”

This is all achingly familiar to me. In the 1990s, I was one of those who defended the idea of a wall between intelligence and law enforcement. Not because there had been actual abuses, but because it was easy to imagine them. So why not construct a wall and reduce the risk of abuse?

Well, now we know. In August of 2001, just weeks before the 9/11 attacks, it was the wall that prevented the FBI’s largest and most sophisticated counterterrorism task force from acting when it got word that hardened al Qaeda terror plotters were inside the United States. The FBI had plenty of time in late August and early September to track the plotters down; if they had been allowed to use the intelligence, I am convinced that they would have caught the terrorists and changed history. But the FISA court and FBI lawyers were enforcing the wall so harshly that in the end the FBI task force was forced to stand down, and the attacks played out.

When the 9/11 Commission held its hearings, I felt compelled to tell that story – and to recant my support for the wall.

“I was wrong,” I testified.

I never again want to stand before the children and parents of Americans killed by terrorists and say that my enthusiasm for some unproven theory of civil liberties helped get their loved ones killed.

The study is the first to examine sexual activity as a potential trigger for sudden cardiac arrest among the general population, the researchers said.
People who experienced a sudden cardiac arrest during sex tended to be slightly younger, around 60 years old on average, than those who had a sudden cardiac arrest at other times, who were around 65 years old on average.
But those who had a sudden cardiac arrest during sex were just as likely to have a heart condition or be on heart medication as those who had a sudden cardiac arrest at other times.
""Multiple research studies have shown that CPR performed by bystanders … can improve the chances of survival from cardiac arrest,"" Chugh said.","Can having sex cause your heart to suddenly stop beating? A new study suggests that, although this can happen, it's very rare.

In the study, researchers analyzed information from more than 4,500 people who experienced sudden cardiac arrest, a condition in which the heart abruptly stops beating due to problems with the heart's electrical activity.

Among these cases, less than 1 percent of cardiac arrests occurred during or immediately after sexual activity, the study found.

The study is the first to examine sexual activity as a potential trigger for sudden cardiac arrest among the general population, the researchers said. The findings were presented on Nov. 12 at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions meeting in Anaheim, California, and are published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

""While sudden cardiac arrest is a devastating condition with a high chance of death, the likelihood of this occurring during sexual activity … was extremely low,"" said Dr. Sumeet Chugh, medical director of the Heart Rhythm Center at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles and senior author of the study.

""This is a reassurance that can now be provided to heart disease patients, and will be based on actual data,"" Chugh told Live Science.

In the rare instances in which sex was linked with cardiac arrest, almost all of the cases — 94 percent — were in men, the study found: Among men, about 1 in 100 cases of cardiac arrest were linked with sex, compared with just 1 in 1,000 cases among women.

People who experienced a sudden cardiac arrest during sex tended to be slightly younger, around 60 years old on average, than those who had a sudden cardiac arrest at other times, who were around 65 years old on average.

But those who had a sudden cardiac arrest during sex were just as likely to have a heart condition or be on heart medication as those who had a sudden cardiac arrest at other times.

The study also found that, even though sudden cardiac arrest linked with sexual activity was usually witnessed by the person's partner, bystander CPR was performed in only one-third of cases. (Bystander CPR is CPR that is performed by a witness until an ambulance shows up.) These findings highlight the need to educate the public about the importance of CPR for sudden-cardiac-arrest patients, the researchers said.

""Multiple research studies have shown that CPR performed by bystanders … can improve the chances of survival from cardiac arrest,"" Chugh said. ""It stands to reason that if CPR is learned [and] performed by all sexual partners, there is a good possibility of improving survival.""

Consider for a moment that is also 300 hp more than the base Corvette Stingray and you realize this car means the business. The engine is fitted with port and direct fuel injection and also sends 715 lb-ft of torque to the rear wheels through a standard 7-speed manual, or optional 8-speed automatic transmission.

Chevy hasn’t revealed how quick it is, but says the ZR1 will break the 210 mph barrier, which could put it within range of the $450,000 2016 mph Ford GT.

That’s if you order it with the Low Wing aerodynamic package, which was designed to create tremendous downforce with little drag. An enormous High Wing is also available that’s adjustable and can plant the 14-inch wide rear tires to the ground with up to 950 pounds of pressure.

It can do that because it's mounted to the chassis aft of the hatchback opening for strength, which presents the downside of making you lift your groceries up and over the wing to get them in the trunk. (Chevy's sorry not sorry about that.)

An underbody front wing helps to balance out the handling and leaves plenty of space above it for three air intakes that help feed some of the baker’s dozen of heat exchangers needed to keep the ZR1’s components cool.

The car is undeniably cool, even when it’s parked, but will surely look even better when it hits the street and track next spring at a price that hasn’t been announced, but will likely be north of the $112,000 the last ZR1 went for in 2012.

The toddler vanished after the girl’s mother left her outside for a moment with their new puppy, The Cullman Tribune reported. When the woman returned outside, the puppy and Serenity were gone.

“My first thought was helping getting out there and looking. I wasn't going to give up,"" Gilbreath told WHNT.

The man traveled two hours from his residence to DeKalb County to search for the toddler. He said he got out of the car on County Road 957 and began searching in the wooded area for the little girl.

“There were several rescue people there, deputies and police, but they had been out searching for hours and had just about decided to quit until daylight,” Gilbreath told The Cullman Tribune. “I couldn’t wait; I just went off into the woods and started calling her name.”

After a few hours, Gilbreath spotted the puppy first and then followed the canine to Serenity.

“Hi Eric!” Serenity said when Gilbreath found her.

The hero called her mother to tell her that her daughter was safe.

Even still, those angered by the untidy bun have argued that, just because the white model’s tousled look works, it doesn’t mean the same aesthetic can be achieved on textured hair.

In response, some said that the overconcern with “edging” is a Eurofication of black hair, and that leaving it alone is a better solution.

Many of us have piles upon boxes upon albums of photos that we haven’t picked up in years. This month marks the season of gratitude - the perfect time to take a trip down memory lane. Here are eight ways to finally organize, use and declutter your family photos.

Research. If you’re a history buff or just curious about the strangers staring back at you with striking resemblance, there are a few measures you can take to piece together your family tree. If you know where the photos were taken, dedicate a rainy afternoon to pouring over information at the local library. Some newspapers will print photos with a caption asking readers if they recognize people in the picture. You can also hire a genealogist or upload photos online to genealogy sites if you’re willing to pay for research.

Donate. Most of us find it difficult to throw photos away, let alone ones that have been passed down from generation to generation. If you can’t find any connection to your collection, most historical societies accept photos, especially if you can provide some information about how you inherited them.

Reminisce. Pass around family photos and albums at your next family gathering. Stoke the fire and let the storytelling begin! This is a great chance to learn more about your family and introduce your kids to their late relatives who they never met, but can still get to know through cherished photo albums.

Digitize. Printed photos are typically stored in attics, basements and closets and are therefore susceptible to fires, floods and dust. Preserve photos by scanning them yourself, shipping them to a scanning service or hiring someone to scan them for you. Saving photos to the cloud will give them a safe home where they’ll stay vibrant forever.

Display. Gallery walls are very popular in today’s home designs. Use frames all in the same color for a consistent, contemporary look or arrange frames in different shapes and sizes around other wall decor for an eclectic vibe. Hang photos on a wall with track lighting to put your photos in the spotlight.

Scrapbook. Scrapbooks make meaningful holiday gifts full of creativity and personalization. Get the whole family involved by giving each child an age-appropriate task, like taping or labeling, or assign them few pages to complete on their own. If you’re making these books for your own home, make sure you keep them in an accessible place rather than storage so you can enjoy them more often.

DIY. Go to any craft store and you’ll find that there are so many more creative ways to use and display photos beyond frames and scrapbooks. Buy a big jar of Mod Podge and create playful collages or make ornaments for the Christmas tree. You could also arrange photos under glass on a dresser or desktop to enjoy them in every room.

Delete. After you’ve backed up your collection with digital copies, you can feel better about throwing away printed photos that you didn’t display or use. It’s also important to declutter your digital collection so that it’s easier to find and share photos online. You can safely delete the following from your devices: duplicates; blurry or dark shots; unphotogenic moments you know you will never share or display; and shutter mistakes, like accidental shots of the ceiling or the contents of your purse.",What to do with all of your family photos,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/10/what-to-do-with-all-your-family-photos.html

Costas, the longtime NBC broadcaster, said at the University of Maryland on Tuesday that the one-time “cash machine” sport was suffering after multiple investigations into former players who've experienced serious health issues, USA Today reported.

“The reality is that this game destroys people’s brains,"" Costas said. “Not everyone, but a substantial number. That’s the fundamental fact of football, and that to me is the biggest story in American sports.”

Costas was referring to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disease linked with repeated head trauma that has become a concern for many athletes, but mostly those playing in the NFL.

An NBC Sports spokesperson told The New York Daily News, ""Bob’s opinions are his own, and they do not represent those of the NBC Sports Group.""

In a July report, researchers studying the brains of 202 former football players discovered traces of CTE in nearly all of them, The Associated Press reported.

Late New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez suffered substantial damage to parts of the brain that affect memory, judgment and behavior from the most severe case of a degenerative disease linked to head blows ever found in someone so young, a researcher said Thursday.

BOB COSTAS WARNS FUTURE OF FOOTBALL IS BLEAK BECAUSE SPORT 'DESTROYS PEOPLE'S BRAINS'

Dr. Ann McKee, director of Boston University's CTE Center, stressed she could not ""connect the dots"" between the brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy and the behavior of the 27-year-old who hanged himself in April while serving life in prison for murder.

But McKee said CTE had significantly impacted key parts of Hernandez's brain, including the hippocampus -- which is associated with memory -- and the frontal lobe, which is involved in impulse control, judgment and behavior.

""We can say collectively, in our collective experience, that individuals with CTE — and CTE of this severity — have difficulty with impulse control, decision-making, inhibition of impulses or aggression, often emotional volatility and rage behaviors,"" said McKee, who has studied hundreds of brains from football players, college athletes and even younger players, donated after their deaths.

In his speech last week at the University of Maryland, Costas said “the cracks in the foundation are there.""

“The day-to-day issues, as serious as they may be, they may come and go. But you cannot change the nature of the game. I certainly would not let, if I had an athletically gifted 12- or 13-year-old son, I would not let him play football,"" he told the group.

Costas appeared on the Maryland panel with USA Today’s Christine Brennan and ESPN's Tony Kornheiser, each of whom spoke about the future of professional football.

“It’s not going to happen this year, and it’s not going to happen in five years or ten years,"" Kornheiser said. ""But Bob is right: At some point, the cultural wheel turns just a little bit, almost imperceptibly, and parents say, ‘I don’t want my kids to play.’ And then it becomes only the province of the poor, who want it for economic reasons to get up and out.""

Costas said the NFL’s belated efforts to study the dangers of football will only hurt the league in the end.

“The more information [that] comes out, the worse it looks,” Costas said.

He crept round to the other male's muzzle, for a nuzzle, and threw a conspiratorial wink his way,"" Goldstein said.

Female lions do it too, he added.","A photograph of two male lions seemingly in an amorous embrace has some humans clutching their pearls.

After the release of the photograph, taken in August at Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve, Ezekiel Mutua, the chief executive of the Kenya Film Classification Board, blamed humans (or maybe demons) for the male-on-male mounting.

""[P]robably, they have been influenced by gays who have gone to the national parks and behaved badly,"" Mutua told Nairobi News, before suggesting that the lions be isolated and studied because the ""demonic spirits inflicting in humans seem to have now caught up with animals.""

The actual story behind the photograph shows that Mutua got some things wrong. The mounting behavior isn't actually sexual. And the official jumped the gun on attributing human motivations to animal behavior, experts said. ['Gay' Animals: 10 Alternative Lifestyles in the Wild]

""It's rare, it's not really sexual and it tells us a lot more about those officials in Kenya and their homophobia than anything else,"" Craig Packer, the director of the Lion Research Center at the University of Minnesota, told Live Science. ""It's a bizarre overreaction.""

Lion loving

This isn't the first time two lions have been seen in a same-sex embrace. In March 2016, another photographer snapped a male mounting and humping another male in Botswana.

The latest pictures were taken by Paul Goldstein, a British guide for Exodus Travels, who said the lions first stood side by side, and then one lay down and was mounted by the other. The lions stayed that way for over a minute, Goldstein said in a caption accompanying the photo.

""Even as he dismounted, he did not back off as is normal after mating. He crept round to the other male's muzzle, for a nuzzle, and threw a conspiratorial wink his way,"" Goldstein said.

This sequence is fairly similar to what was described in Botswana, where the two lions spent a long time in the mating position. But in both cases, these lions aren't mating, Packer said. When male lions mate, they zealously guard a receptive female for days at a time, having sex every half-hour or so and refusing to let any other males come near the female. A male lion ejaculates almost immediately upon inserting his penis into the female, Packer said, and accompanies his ejaculation with a particular yowl.

The male-on-male behavior in Kenya was nothing like that, and the male on top didn't ejaculate, Packer said.

Same-sex affections

Instead, the photograph captures a rare moment of social bonding between male lions. These lions spend their lives trying to reproduce. To up their odds, they work together in small groups of two, three or more males, called coalitions. These groups cooperate to drive off rival males and take over prides of females, killing any babies fathered by previous males, Packer said. Long-term studies dating back to the 1970s show that lions who manage to become part of a coalition, particularly a larger one, get more access to females and ultimately produce more surviving offspring than other individuals.

Coalition males are typically affectionate with each other, Packer said. They'll flop down on each other, lick each other and rub each other's faces. On rare occasions, they'll display the mounting behavior that Goldstein witnessed. It seems to be a way to smooth over social tensions. The same sort of behavior occurs in baboons and many other social mammals, Packer said. Female lions do it too, he added.

""It's a social interaction that has nothing to do with sexual pleasure,"" he said.

But remarkably, a story in Newsweek trashes Lara Trump for doing charity work uniting veterans and animals.

If I am reading the contrived outrage of the story correctly, it is somehow inappropriate for members of the Trump family to volunteer their time and talents – at no cost to taxpayers – for worthy non-political causes that all Americans should be able to support.

I was honored to participate in a White House round table today discussing ways to help veterans and homeless dogs simultaneously. My favorite moment was meeting a veteran named Justin and his service dog Thor (who likely “sits” better for Justin 😉) More to come — stay tuned! #PetsForVets 🇺🇸 A post shared by Lara Trump (@laraleatrump) on Oct 18, 2017 at 6:47pm PDT

In the case of Lara Trump, she was holding meetings in the White House trying to coordinate the training of service dogs that might otherwise be destroyed so the dogs could be given to veterans who need them, either for disabilities or other needs.

Lara Trump was working with The Humane Society and various veterans’ organizations. But because the groups met in the White House to talk about this project to help veterans, and because Lara Trump also serves on president’s campaign committee, the whole idea was deemed political patronage and attacked. This is absurd.

Had Lara been able to establish her program, how many veterans’ lives would be saved? How many veterans could have seen lives improve?

I understand we must guard against political patronage. No one should personally benefit financially from a family member in office. But this isn’t that.

What’s wrong with the president’s daughter-in-law – or his other relatives, for that matter –working as unpaid volunteers to benefit great causes like veterans and homeless animals? Isn’t this ideal of selfless service something that parents, religious leaders and teachers work to instill in all our children?

Lara Trump and other members of the Trump family deserve praise for their dedication to good causes. Yet incredibly, the leftist media mocks the Trumps and heinously twists their efforts on behalf of others to make it seem like they are some sort of crime family scheming to enrich themselves and harm our nation. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Media whining about this and other volunteer and charitable work by the Trump family has already forced some family members to give up this work.

For example, thanks to the media watchdogs, no longer is President Trump’s son (and Lara’s husband) Eric raising money to help children with cancer.

The anti-Trump media have also “saved” women from Ivanka Trump’s female empowerment fund. That's got to be a relief to feminists everywhere!

Now the liberal media finds nobility in precluding veterans from having a loving companion animal to accompany them? Thousands of dogs will instead be killed or used for research. The dogs can’t protest this injustice – but the rest of us should.

The leftist media wear the label ""hypocrite"" like a badge, and they only deepen the divide between the rational and irrational in America.

While they talk about unity and tolerance, members of the liberal media go out of their way to divide and mock. While they talk about liberalism, the only thing they do liberally is pass out hate for the Trump family, and their supporters (roughly half of voters). While they deem themselves ""progressive,"" the only thing progressive about them is that they are progressively ensuring a conservative landslide in 2018 and 2020.

President Trump may not need Lara Trump on the campaign side, or really need any of us (I serve on his Campaign Media Advisory Board, for full disclosure). He has the entire leftist regressive media campaigning non-stop for his re-election.

Maybe the media are right! Lara can just take a much-needed vacation. The media have this.

Last week, the 41-year-old star made news for her decision to breastfeed her 30-month-old son, which she said has led to backlash from many who believe he is too old to breastfeed. Meanwhile, Curtis has been in and out of courtrooms for several years, facing off with her ex, the city of Minneapolis and even her own mother.

With all of her personal struggles, she is quickly becoming one of Scripps Networks' most controversy-ridden stars.

But DIY Network, which is owned by Food Network and HGTV’s parent company Scripps Networks, said Curtis’ headline-making behavior isn’t impacting the show.

“‘Rehab Addict’ is currently on the air, and we are in active production for new episodes of the series,” a rep for DIY told Fox News.

However, the 8th season of her DIY show was, in fact, temporarily delayed in April 2017 because of her troubles. Curtis cited the death of her grandmother as the reason for the show’s unexpected hiatus.

Still, experts say DIY fans want to watch Curtis succeed, which will help boost the show’s mainstream presence.

“Audiences like to watch as people wade through problems and rise above them. There is a good and inspiring message in that,” said pop culture enthusiast Cate Meighan.

And Dr. John Huber, a psychologist, told Fox News Curtis’ public problems could make the home design show more intriguing.

“…If her problem cards are played well they could become a marketing goldmine,” he said. “No one has ever said living in the limelight is easy, and Nicole has her 30-month-old, her contractors and national media that she has to balance. This could be a drama worth watching!”

Curtis is engaged in a very public custody battle with the father of her 2 ½-year-old son Harper. The bitter battle has, at times, been chronicled by Curtis on Instagram, where she lamented about some of the issues she faced while sharing joint custody of Harper.

And back in 2015, her mother filed a protective order against her, which made headlines earlier this year, right around the time she was sued by the city of Minneapolis over a dispute regarding a home she purchased from the city.

But Meighan warned Curtis likely can’t keep up the drama for too long or DIY may take action.

The design network features a feud-free brand of reality TV, where the biggest drama is typically a corroded pipe or a decaying roof.

""Her problems and negative press has already disrupted things, and I believe that will only be allowed once,” Meighan speculated. “ The next action would be to pull the plug on the series all together.”

But DIY likely won’t ditch the show if the network can help it. Ratings for the show have held steady since the show first premiered in 2010.

The directions it gives for marriage are simple, and you can remember them with three rhyming words—leave, cleave and weave.
Cleave: God designed marriage to be a relationship where partners cleave to one another – like glue, they are united.
But in a larger sense, this is where the real work of marriage comes in.
But when you are following the Lord and his directions for marriage, it really is an awesome journey.","One of my wife Terrie’s favorite travel stories took place well before GPS units and smartphones were around. We were visiting New York City with another couple and had rented a car. The ladies were sitting in the back seat and the men in the front, with me driving. We were headed to a meeting and enjoying the iconic landmarks along the way.

When we noticed we were seeing the same landmarks multiple times, it became apparent that we didn’t know the way. Finally, after several pointed hints from the back seat, I pulled in to a gas station to ask for directions.

We two men talked to someone outside pumping gas. The ladies could see from our informant’s gestures that he felt confident as he gave directions, and they could see us nodding as we listened.

We got back in the car, however, and my friend and I asked each other in unison, “What did he say?” As it turned out, the man who gave us directions didn’t know much English. Neither of us wanted to say that we couldn’t understand, so instead, we both nodded along, assuming the other really did understand.

That scenario is a picture of so many couples in our culture. When it comes to marriage, couples often know they are not where they want to be – and nowhere near where they dreamed that marriage would take them. But when they look for help, they get input from sources who give garbled directions and mixed messages.

Our culture is, at best, confused on the meaning and significance of marriage and relationships. It’s amazing to me, for instance, that in the same month our culture praised the late Playboy Magazine founder Hugh Hefner, who objectified women, we condemned film producer Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has been accused by more than 90 women of sexual assault or harassment and is being investigated by police in New York, California and Britain.

In reality, the stories of both men are many shades of deplorable and tragic. But to add insult to injury, recall that several months previous the “celebrity story” dominating the news was how ridiculous it was for Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to have lunch alone with a woman other than his wife.

Apparently, objectifying women is OK, taking advantage of them is bad (as long as it’s in real life and not in a movie you pay to watch), but setting personal guidelines to protect the sanctity of your own marriage is also bad.

Hollywood, media and our culture provide conflicting directions. And couples who base their relationship on these sources are sure to become confused. We simply can’t follow a sloppy map and be surprised when it leads us to a different destination than we wanted to go.

At some point, you have to wonder. What was so bad about God’s plan for marriage? God created marriage to be awesome. In the actual words of Genesis, he made it “very good” (Genesis 1:31).

And in the very first wedding ceremony of human history, God gave specific, not-difficult-to-understand directions for marriage: “Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh” (Genesis 2:18–24). This passage is so significant that Jesus quoted from it and the apostle Paul referenced it. The directions it gives for marriage are simple, and you can remember them with three rhyming words—leave, cleave and weave.

Leave: When a couple begins a marriage, they are establishing a new identity together. And that necessitates leaving previous problems, identities and hang-ups behind – both physically and emotionally. This doesn’t mean that the bride and groom have lost their personal identities. It simply means they are leaving their previous family units and their identities as separate from each other to create a new home in which they are inseparably joined.

Cleave: God designed marriage to be a relationship where partners cleave to one another – like glue, they are united. To cleave to one another with total acceptance and unconditional love for each another. The world believes that couples who stay married 50, 60 and 70 years must have been perfect for each other – that their success is rooted in the fact that they were two lucky people who found their soul mates and that the rest of us mortals are foolish to insist on cleaving to one another during times of pain or difficulty.

The world is wrong. Marriage, as God designed it, carries a commitment to cleave – to hold onto your spouse. Obviously, there are times when one spouse makes wrong decisions and walks away from an innocent party. But when two people focus on the same person – the Lord Jesus – they also draw close to one another and gain strength to keep their commitment to each other.

Weave: In one sense, becoming “one flesh” refers to physical intimacy. But in a larger sense, this is where the real work of marriage comes in. It is the intertwining of lives that happens over time. Marital intimacy is a gift of God, the physical celebration of oneness and unity. But the weaving of two lives together is more than physical. It takes place through daily decisions to pursue your spouse’s heart, to draw near to each other in acceptance, to entwine your lives around each other.

Every journey needs a map. And when it comes to marriage, the truth is, your source of directions matters. A couple that follows Hollywood’s map should not be surprised when they have a Hollywood-typical marriage – outwardly glamorous, but inwardly hollow.

What better map to follow than from the originator of marriage? When you take two people who are committed to one another and are daily drawing nearer to the Lord, there is an ongoing pattern of growth. This isn’t the result of one day, but of habits carried out day after day as together they walk through life and strengthen their relationship.

When it comes to the journey of marriage, none of us has “arrived.” It’s a lifelong journey that includes detours, bumps, mistakes and growth. But when you are following the Lord and his directions for marriage, it really is an awesome journey.","To achieve a good marriage, God’s plan will give you good directions",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/11/to-achieve-good-marriage-god-s-plan-will-give-good-directions.html

Open shelves in the kitchen can be used to store almost anything, but what should you place on them that truly works best? Here are some of my favorite uses for open shelving, along with some style tips to get the best arrangement for your kitchen.

Open shelves are a love-it or leave-it idea, but for those who love them, the breezy appeal is undeniable. They take an extra investment of time compared to closed cabinets (as more tidying is necessary), but they can add a lot of style and functionality without too much work.

Open shelves are especially suitable, I think, to transitional kitchen designs, in which a balance of traditional and contemporary sensibilities come together to produce beautifully livable spaces.

Daily Essentials

Some of the most common items to spot on open kitchen shelves are daily essentials like coffee mugs, plates and bowls. Items like this work well on open shelves for two reasons.

First, they’re kept in easy reach, which speeds up your morning just that little extra bit. And it’s especially convenient for guests who may want to grab a coffee mug or water glass without having to poke through every cabinet.

Second, putting often-used items on shelves avoids the issue of dust buildup. If the items are used frequently, they won’t sit for long. If you keep rarely used items like specialty glasses or serving pitchers on open shelves, be prepared to give them a rinse before use.

Drinking Glasses

Glasses are especially attractive items to store on an open shelf because their clear material plays into the breezy look. Storing basic drinking glasses upside down (as is typically done in restaurants) effectively seals out dust and debris, so the glass is ready to go whenever you grab it.

Again, for less commonly used pieces like martini glasses (for some, anyway), a quick rinse will generally do the trick before use, along with the occasional seasonal dusting.

Storage Jars

Storage jars are another great use for an easily reached shelf. This keeps items off the counter so you have more free space to work, but the jars are still handy so you can grab them without having to open a cabinet with (potentially) messy fingers.

Colorful Pieces

Besides practical uses, open shelves can also add a lot of character and beauty to a kitchen. Whether you already have a colorful kitchen or a more neutral scheme, shelves are a great place to introduce a new accent hue, such as classic rich-blue water glasses or copper mule mugs.

White Porcelain

In contrast to the previous tip, sometimes the items on open shelves can serve as a visual break on an already busy wall. If you have a dramatic tile or a stunning brick feature, simple white porcelain and other subdued pieces provide a pleasing counterpoint.

Coffee Station

If you have a nice coffee maker, you’ll likely want to carve out a little space to hold fresh beans, sugar, coffee spoons and other supplies to craft the perfect cup. A floating shelf above the machine creates a simple station to store everything, plus a few good go-to cookbooks.

And of course, for the tea drinkers (or home-soda aficionados), you can stash tea bags, honeys and syrups, cups and saucers … the list goes on. Just be sure to consider whether such items will be OK outside the fridge and potentially exposed to warm sunlight or exhaust from nearby appliances.

Home Bar

If you drink alcohol, you can also take an array of beautifully bottled liquors and make them into a simple home bar. Richly hued glass bottles with ornate labels make for a subtly colorful display with a sophisticated air, especially when paired with classic bar tools in a golden finish. To keep the arrangement lasting, you can always refill an emptied bottle with water and mix it back onto the shelf.

Cookware

If you cook often, you may want to have more than just your ingredients right at hand. Stacking casserole dishes, cake pans or even pasta pots on a shelf keeps them from getting buried in the back of cabinets. The look works especially well for kitchens with a rustic or industrial edge, where a little controlled chaos adds to the charm.

Tech Devices

Here’s an option you might never have thought of: using open shelves to dock your devices, like tablets or laptops. Angled shelves are great for storing devices securely, with any charging cables discreetly tucked behind the lip. It’s especially handy for those who cook along to online recipes. Alternately, you can locate them on a side wall out of the main cooking area, paired with some books to make an attractive library-like display.

Decorative Pieces

Do you love the look of open shelves but are concerned about having to dust lots of items? Consider using just a single shelf with only a few decorative pieces. You won’t have too much space to worry about filling or maintaining, but it will add a fun, contemporary twist to the space.

A Few Style Tips

To help you get the function and the look you love, try these kitchen shelf styling tips.

Play with heights and directions. Playing with the arrangement by mixing different-sized objects and small or short stacks of items creates a dynamic look.

Mix eclectic items. It also helps to mix diverse items, both practical and decorative pieces.

Go tone on tone. If you prefer a more subdued look, try sticking to all pale-colored objects. Try contrasting whites and off-whites to highlight the subtle undertones, along with a touch of glass and the occasional metallic accent.

Top with an upper shelf. Sometimes the best thing to put on your top shelf is: nothing! Leaving a bare top shelf as a topper gives a polished look to your shelving, which makes the whole space feel subtly tidier.

Highlight with a sconce. Finally, to really bring out the best of your shelving, add a sconce above to cast a little light on the situation. Don’t have the option of hardwiring a fixture? Choose a plug-in sconce that comes with an elegantly simple metal channel to hide wires, run it down behind the shelving or next to a cabinet, and let it add to the open look – or simply run the wires back to a cabinet so they can be hidden to reach a power source.",10 things to store on open kitchen shelves for efficiency and style,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/10/10-things-to-store-on-open-kitchen-shelves-for-efficiency-and-style.html

Terrafugia, based in Boston, Massachusetts, became one of the first firms in the flying car space when it was founded in 2006 by a group of engineers at MIT.

Geely says it’s investing in Terrafugia to make flying cars a reality. It’s also hiring some big guns. A former managing director at Bell Helicopter, Chris Jaran, has been appointed CEO of Terrafugia. And in anticipation of the deal, Terrafugia has tripled the size of its engineering team over the past quarter.

Meanwhile, Terrafugia founder Carl Dietrich is staying on as the company’s chief technology officer.

The company’s first product will be the Transition, which is promised for a market launch in 2019. It features a 2-seat cabin and a foldable wing. The latter enables it to easily fit in a standard car lane, and unfolding the wings can be achieved in under a minute.

MORE AUTO NEWS FROM MOTOR AUTHORITY

The Transition is promised to deliver a 400-mile flying range and a top flight speed of 100 mph. While it still requires a runway for takeoff and landing, Terrafugia has a more advanced design known as the Transition TF-X that promises vertical takeoff and landing and even better performance. This model is promised for a market launch in 2023.

Terrafugia is currently accepting $10,000 reservations for the Transition and expects the final price to come in at $279,000.

As cities become more congested, more and more companies are entering the race to develop safe, reliable and relatively affordable flying cars.

The news comes from The Hollywood Reporter, which claims at least 12 people who worked on the set of the 2003 film “Born Killers,” not to be confused with the 1994 film “Natural Born Killers” in which Sizemore also played a role, came forward. The star reportedly was removed from the set after an 11-year-old co-star revealed that she believed her genitals were touched during a photoshoot in which she had to sit on Sizemore’s lap.

Representatives for Sizemore told the outlet that the star had no comment on the matter.

The girl reportedly told her parents about the encounter who ran it up the production ladder. Sizemore was removed from the set and the family was encouraged to go to the police. However, it was noted that the images from the photoshoot did not provide any conclusive evidence of inappropriate touching. After going to the police, the family decided not to press charges. Many involved speculated that it was an effort to preserve their daughter’s career and not drag her through the emotional ringer that comes with such legal proceedings.

Sizemore has made a name for himself in Hollywood as a “bad boy,” an image compounded by the tough guy roles he typically gravitates toward. He’s been arrested in the past for assault and drug charges, and the 2003 shoot saw him at the height of that reputation. The now 26-year-old actress declined to be identified, but others who worked on the set remember the drama vividly.

“It filtered down to the crew,” Roi Maufas, who worked as a production assistant, told the outlet. “The little girl said what she said, and we all thought, ‘That f---ing sleazebag.’ There was never any doubt. He was this guy who was already known for making inappropriate comments, being drunk, being high. We’re talking about consistent behavior, just being ‘Tom Sizemore’ on set every day. Then this happens. Guys reached for hammers. [Producer James R. Rosenthal, who died in 2011], who was livid himself, had to stop a group of us from going to visit Mr. Sizemore to kick the guy’s a--.”

Allegedly spurred by the recent unprecedented conversation in Hollywood surrounding sexual harassment and assault, following the bombshell allegations against Harvey Weinstein, the actress in question reportedly has hired a lawyer and is looking into what can be done.

There’s no reason that children need smartphones; if parents are concerned about staying in touch with their children, they can still give them feature phones without internet access.","A few weeks ago on “The Next Revolution” on Fox News Channel, we debated the impact of technology on children. My guest, Dr. Jean Twenge, shared shocking research from her latest book, which has a rather wonderful title: “iGen: Why Today’s Super-Connected Kids are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy – and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood.”

According to Twenge – and her research is backed up by numerous other studies – the use of smartphones is changing childhood in fundamental and deeply negative ways.

I wanted to talk to her about this topic because it’s one that I’ve long been interested in – and where I have views that many consider to be somewhat extreme.

In my own book, “More Human – Designing a World Where People Come First,” I looked at the way unsupervised access to the internet is exposing children to dark and dangerous forms of online pornography. This leads to premature sexualization that has a devastating impact on young people’s attitudes to sex and relationships.

I wrote that unsupervised internet access is actually setting back the progress our society has made on gender equality. Early access to online porn is leading boys to think of girls as sexual objects, always available for male gratification.

For these and other reasons, I made the case in “More Human” that we should not allow children to access the internet unsupervised. What does that mean in practice? Just as we ban smoking and drinking for under 16, because we want to shield young people from their harmful effects, we should do the same for smartphones.

Most parents don’t want their kids to have smartphones in the first place. But parents worry about the social stigma of their child being the only one without a phone. A total ban would help parents do what they want to do anyway.

But just this week, we heard something that made me think: this isn’t just about children. It’s about adults too.

Sean Parker, the founding president of Facebook, recently revealed something that is widely known within Silicon Valley. And as the co-founder and CEO of a tech company myself, I hear it all the time. The revelation? The aim of tech firms is to make their products “addictive.”

As Tucker Carlson noted on his own Fox News show, the bosses of Big Tobacco knew their product was addictive too. They just weren’t as open about it as Sean Parker.

As viewers of “The Next Revolution” know, despite (or perhaps because of) living in Silicon Valley and running a tech firm, I’m a critic of technology’s impact on society. I myself don’t have a cellphone. But I nevertheless recognize the positive things that technology brings.

Facebook (disclosure: my wife is a senior executive there) has enabled a previously unimaginable flourishing of small businesses – including my own – by making it possible for them to reach customers in affordable ways.

Google (disclosure: my wife was once a senior executive there) has contributed to the greatest and fastest spread of knowledge in human history.

Uber (disclosure: yes, you’ve guessed it, my wife worked there too) is creating new ways for people to boost their income, as well as democratizing transportation for millions.

But if a tech skeptic like me can appreciate the positives, I think it’s time for the tech evangelists to accept the negatives too.

In any discussion of technology, you hear the same argument: You can’t turn the clock back and you can’t put the genie back in the bottle.

Maybe not. But there are steps we can take to limit the social harm caused by this industry, just like we do with others. And that brings us back to Big Tobacco and the commercialization of addiction.

Let’s start by being precise about the comparison. When it comes to Big Tech, the real transformation in addictive behavior has come about not through the internet itself, or the businesses that have grown to dominate it. It has come through the device that more and more people use to access the internet: the smartphone.

It’s the smartphone that has turned adults and children alike into tech-addicted zombies, dumbly swiping and jabbing at their screens, oblivious to the world around them.

It’s the smartphone that has trapped people in this constant, miserable hamster-wheel of updates and notifications and self-destructive comparisons with friends and celebrities, and the virtual demolition of any remaining barriers between work and personal life.

It’s the smartphone that is responsible for one of the most depressing – and increasingly ubiquitous – sights of the modern age: a family sitting together but totally detached from one another, engaged with their screens rather than the people closest to them.

Of course many companies now make smartphones. But it was the iPhone that first made them so irresistibly addictive. Apple’s Steve Jobs, idolized by so many as a hero, probably did more to undermine humanity than any other business leader in history.

If smartphones are the new smoking, here are four practical ways we can learn from the success of anti-smoking efforts and reduce the damage to mental health that smartphones cause:

Ban smartphones for kids. They should never have unsupervised access to the internet. There’s no reason that children need smartphones; if parents are concerned about staying in touch with their children, they can still give them feature phones without internet access.

Require all smartphone makers to show regular mental health warnings prominently on screens after a certain amount of usage.

Tax phone usage and direct the proceeds towards mental health programs that educate people about the safe use of technology, and help those who have been hurt by it.

Restrict smartphone use in public spaces. It’s absurd that cities around the world now have to introduce safety measures to prevent people from getting hit by cars because pedestrians are walking around buried in their phones.

Of course these measures would not solve all the problems associated with smartphones. But they would help reduce the social harm imposed by technology, while ensuring we still enjoy its many social and economic benefits.

We’ll be debating these ideas this Sunday on “The Next Revolution” at 9 p.m. EST on FNC. Hope you can join us!",Steve Hilton: Smartphones have turned us into tech-addicted zombies.

Diana Lovejoy, 45, collapsed in court after she was found guilty of a conspiracy charge as well as attempted murder, prompting loud gasps from the courtroom.

When court reconvened around 30 minutes later Lovejoy was no longer at the defendants' table, instead she was wheeled out by paramedics and taken to a nearby hospital, FOX 5 San Diego reported.

The same jury also found gun instructor Weldon McDavid Jr., 50, guilty of attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon for his role in the plot.

Lovejoy and McDavid planned the crime after meeting at a gun range where she was taking lessons, and contacted her ex-husband Greg Mulvihill on Sept. 1, 2016 while posing as a private investigator claiming to have information on his estranged while, according to prosecutors.

The caller instructed Mulvihill at the time to go to a remote dirt road where he could pick up a package containing materials related to Lovejoy, prosecutor Jodi Breton told jurors. Mulvihill and a co-worker, Jason Kovach, drove to the area together to look for a package taped to a power pole.

Kovach testified that they saw some rustling in the bushes, then noticed what looked like a person lying down with a rifle pointed at them. The witness said shots rang out, and he and a wounded Mulvihill took off running.

Breton said Mulvihill, 45, was trying to reclaim his life after Lovejoy had made claims that he had molested their young son and sexually abused her. The couple had been separated since July 2014, and were in the final stages of completing their divorce, FOX 5 reported.

Authorities later determined the phone used to call Mulvihill was purchased by Lovejoy, and feces found in the bushes at the scene of the shooting were traced to McDavid.

McDavid's attorney, Ricky Crawford, said his client was a trained marksman and retired Marine who fired his rifle only after he heard someone yell ""I have a gun!""

""If Weldon McDavid wanted to kill someone with his skill set, he would have done so,"" Crawford told the jury. ""That was not his intent.""

Lovejoy faces 25 years to life in prison, while McDavid faces 50 years to life in prison when they are sentenced Dec. 12.

Jurors who deliberated two days before reaching their verdicts told the San Diego Union-Tribune they didn't believe McDavid’s testimony.

Gardeners know that a landscape is much more than plants. The lushest foliage and flowers have limited appeal without other elements to act as a foil. Rocks and stones play a vital role, setting unpolished grainy textures against delicate plants, playing earthy tones against vivid floral displays, and adding weight, mass and a sense of solidity to a dynamic green scene. Enlist these heavy hitters to take your garden to the next level of loveliness.

Steady as a rock. The presence of rocks in a garden is calming and restful. Surrounded by seasonal changes of plants and weather, rocks stand firm. For some, this steadfastness promotes a meditative environment and a strong connection with nature on a spiritual level.

Creating a rock garden as a place for reflection is possible in even the smallest garden, using existing materials and virtually no water. Sitting in a quiet corner contemplating plants growing in harmony with rocks is a respite from the busy outside world.

Stones for sustainability. Rocks, stones and gravel cut down on areas used for lawns and water-hungry plants, substantially reducing water usage. “With our limited water resources and changing climate, sustainability is an underlying philosophy for most landscape designers,” says Janine Mendel, a landscape designer at Cultivart Landscape Design.

Local heroes. Mendel points out that many washed river stones for sale are from countries like Indonesia, and this contributes to erosion there. Buying exotic stone is really the reverse of sustainability, she says. Going local makes even more sense when you factor in the financial and environmental cost of transporting heavy materials long distances.

Aesthetically, local stones and rocks add a cohesive look, especially if there are already naturally occurring rock elements in your garden.

Supporting players. Rocks and stones enhance feature plants as an attractive edging for garden beds. If existing soil is poor, they form a raised bed that can be filled with a more fertile medium.

When planting around rocks, consider color, shape and size. Dark green backgrounds make light rocks stand out, while pale planting makes an ideal foil for dark rocks. Don’t forget that rocks absorb heat — ideal for warmth-loving plants. Don’t plant shrubs that will grow to hide them.

Smooth stones are a lovely accent for tiny succulents in a small garden. Plant a selection of quirky cactuses in a light potting mix with crushed pumice or gravel mulch for drainage. Decorate with a layer of pretty stones — they’ll help retain moisture, which means that less watering is required.

Rocks au naturel. “The placement of rocks in a contrived landscape should reflect how they’d occur in a natural environment. It’s quite a creative skill,” Mendel says.

Japanese “dry landscapes.” Rocks and stones are fundamental to Asian gardens. The Japanese concept of karesansui, meaning “dry landscape,” has taken off globally as a way to use small spaces, reduce water consumption and provide a calm environment. Raked into ripples, sand or fine gravel represents ocean waves, while rocks symbolize islands. Moss is sometimes included, but no other plants or trees.

Water on the rocks. The alliance of rocks and water is key to Asian garden philosophy. It affirms the yin-yang concept of balancing opposite and complementary natural forces. Water is mercurial, filled with light and motion, while rocks are constant and immovable. Together, they create balance and unity.

Bring tranquillity and harmony to your garden by positioning rocks near water, whether it’s a small pond, a stone vessel or a bubbling water feature.

Water also intensifies subtle colors, sharpens contrast, and makes rocks and stones mirrorlike. Dull, dry rocks reveal their full beauty and character when wet, so submerge them or let droplets splash from a water feature to make them shine.

Sculptural rocks. When it comes to garden sculpture, nature does it best. Wind, water, earthquakes and time shape rocks into astonishing artworks. If you’re lucky enough to have an amazing rock, position it prominently to reveal its most interesting face.

Note: Landscaping outlets sell naturally sculpted rocks. Also keep an eye on construction sites — you may be able to get permission to haul away excavated rocks. Before removing any rock from private or public land like a beach or preserve, check to make sure that it’s allowed.

Bold boulders. A boulder is a large rock worn smooth by water. Transporting massive boulders for landscaping is expensive, but using lightweight ceramic versions is one solution.

Stacking stones. Humans have built piles of rocks and stones for eons; dry stone walls date back to Neolithic times. Rock walls have survived in many areas, including England, Ireland, Scandinavia and South America. The Peruvian Inca city of Machu Picchu is made entirely of dry stone construction.

“Currently in Australia one of the trends is … stone used in walling and paving rather than as a more sculptural element,” Mendel says. Local stones and no adhesive chemicals make dry stone walls an eco-friendly addition to a garden.

Cairns occur all over the world. In some places, they are primitive stone stacks; in others, elaborate hive-like monuments. They often have religious, memorial or ceremonial significance, though many were built as navigation aids for travelers.

Building a cairn is an absorbing way to spend time in nature. Play “rock Lego” and plant feathery grasses, such as the variegated Japanese silver grass (Miscanthus sinensis ‘Variegata’) that wave in the wind as a contrast.

A cairn can be as simple as a tower of rocks in decreasing sizes. Ensure that your rocks have a stable seat, or use a little help from cement. Practice on small ones until you get the idea. When you feel confident, go bigger.

Choose a spot where it shows to best advantage and where surrounding plants enhance it.

A liking for lichen. Moss and lichen add color and texture to rocks, and they bring the impression of age. Their amazing colors often occur naturally and turn a nondescript rock into a special attraction.

I’ve used a “moss milkshake” with some success — and a good dash of patience. Make a thick sludge of buttermilk or yogurt and live moss (many nurseries sell tubs of moss, or you could collect it), and then paint it on rocks and stones in a shady place. Mist with water daily until it’s established. Pitted rocks are a better medium than smooth ones.

A little girl who was born with a life-threatening heart condition saw a big wish come true recently, when she was able to “marry” her best friend in a special playground ceremony. Sophia Elyssa Chiappalone, of Connecticut, has already undergone two open-heart surgeries and several other procedures, and had made the special request ahead of a third surgery, which is scheduled for January at Boston Children’s Medical Center, Yahoo reported.

On Oct. 23, Sophia and her best friend, Hunter, who she met in preschool, joined together on a playground and exchanged “vows” while photographer Marisa Balletti-Lavoie of Sassy Mouth Photo captured the precious images. The idea came from the pint-sized bride herself, and was happily agreed to by Hunter and his mom.

Sophia was diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, which is a genetic heart defect involving four different issues, shortly after her birth. Sophia’s mother, Kristy Somerset-Chiappalone, started the “Sophia Elyssa Chiappalone the beautiful baby with a broken heart” Facebook page and explained that her daughter’s case is considered severe and will require several open-heart procedures before it is completely repaired. The condition is also likely to shorten her lifespan, and she will need a heart and lung transplant in the future.

FAMILY SEES HOPE IN GENE THERAPY FOR SON DIAGNOSED WITH FATAL NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE

“She’s a walking miracle,” Somerset-Chiappalone told NBC Connecticut. “There is no life expectancy at this time because there’s no reason for her to be alive.”

Balletti-Lavoie told Yahoo she was asked to do the shoot by Hunter’s mom, Tracy Laferriere, who is a close friend. Shortly after she shared photos of the pair on her Facebook page, their story went viral.

“I cannot help but be overwhelmed by the love and support we’ve gotten with Sophia and her recent wish,” Somerset-Chiappalone posted on her personal Facebook page, on Oct. 25. “It was pure innocence in the purest form. My heart aches with joy with the people standing behind Supergirl on this fight. She’s fought to be alive since her first breath, but that’s all she knows. I love the idea of sharing the beautiful story that is her and Hunter. Most people wait a lifetime for someone who wouldn’t stand by them through such illness. She met a best friend and love of her life at 3 who does. You know they say marry your best friend, it just doesn’t usually happen before 1st grade!!! I agree, the world should know this story.”

You’re boring with it.”But it wasn’t the drugs that nearly made Dickinson quit Iron Maiden as early as 1984 during the band’s heydey.
Dickinson left Iron Maiden in 1993 and he didn't return until 1999.
And I remember one evening going, that’s absolutely exhausting.
So that’s where it came from.”Dickinson is now cancer-free and still achieving success with Iron Maiden.","Iron Maiden has sold over 90 million albums and played over 2,000 shows in 63 countries since their formation in 1975 — but one person who nearly left the band’s singer speechless was The Man in Black.

“It was very brief and really quite awe inspiring,” Bruce Dickinson told Fox News. “Because I’ve always admired Johnny Cash… I love him because he’s got this rebellious maverick thing going on with him.”

The 59-year-old frontman recalled meeting Cash in his new autobiography – “What Does This Button Do?” – along with his own personal journey in leading one of the most recognizable English heavy metal bands in music history for about 40 years.

“I met him a long time ago… in Toronto when he and his band came and they were sitting, watching us do a soundcheck,” said Dickinson. “And he came backstage after we finished. And I’m not exactly the world’s tallest guy. I’m like 5’6” and a half — and make sure you get the half in, you know? And Johnny Cash, I’m not even going to guess, but as far as I know, it was a lamp post that came in dressed in a coat.

""This was like meeting John Wayne... Just wow. And he was just the most charming, quietly spoken guy… He said, 'Hi, My name is Johnny Cash… Look, can you sign an autograph for my daughter? She’s a big fan.' So I went, 'Yeah, of course.' And that was it! But, he was fantastic… and exactly what a legend should be.”

But not all of Dickinson’s memories with Iron Maiden were positive. The man behind the operatic, tower-shattering scream insisted that, unlike other rock stars, he’s always managed to avoid drugs. It may not be a popular choice within the music scene, but frankly, Dickinson doesn’t care.

“Well, you just don’t take them,” explained Dickinson. “It’s as simple as that. It’s not difficult, is it? I mean, you’re surrounded in one way, shape or form by, particularly in the ‘80s, people who’ve taken rather too much cocaine or smoked rather too much marijuana. I mean, the big issue in the ‘80s was cocaine. It was rampant.

""And for all I know, it still is. It’s probably some different drug. I’m a little bit out of of the loop of what drugs are popular or unpopular because I don’t know nobody who takes those kinds of drugs. But cocaine was the thing. And just cocaine turns you into a stupid, self-confident ass. And what’s worse? You’re boring with it.”

But it wasn’t the drugs that nearly made Dickinson quit Iron Maiden as early as 1984 during the band’s heydey. It was the grueling, no-nonsense “Powerslave Tour.”

“It was just simply burnout,” he explained. “… I’ve been on the road for 3-4 years, [and] apart from roadies and the people you meet in the rock ’n’ roll madness, the only [thing] that kept me sane were fencing clubs, which I used to go off and take my kit and run away on days off and do that, to try to keep my sanity… I just really questioned whether or not music, fame, money and everything else was worth it. And I was pretty close to the decision that maybe it wasn’t. I would just walk away.""

Dickinson left Iron Maiden in 1993 and he didn't return until 1999. During his break, Dickinson pursued music as a solo artist, all while reserving time to pick up his sword as a competitive fencer. But these days, he keeps busy pursuing a lifelong passion — flying planes.

“It was quite literally a revelation,” said Dickinson on being a pilot capable of flying a Boeing 747. “I had this incredible moment of apprehension when I realized how close to ground it was. But as soon as we got away from the ground… the happier I was. I was in the air.

""I realized the complexity of the world that I was in… and the fact that you could never, ever know this activity... you would never fully know what was going to happen next or understand exactly what was going to go on for your day. And that I found incredibly exciting.”

Dickinson recently piloted Ed Force One, which is named after Iron Maiden’s devilish mascot, carrying the band, its entire crew and over 20 tons of equipment around the world.

But Dickinson’s life nearly came crashing down in 2015 when he was diagnosed with tongue cancer. Doctors found a cancerous tumor at the back of Dickinson’s tongue after a routine check-up. Still, he was determined to stay confident during his health ordeal.

“I guess I had to take a long, hard look at myself… So what am I going to be like? How am I going to be just grumpy, aggressive, snappy and [feel] sorry for myself?” he explained. “I thought there must be a better way of doing it. Because I actually thought of getting angry with it, like in my head. Like, I would visualize angry things. Like sticking pins in all these nasty cancer cells. And I remember one evening going, that’s absolutely exhausting. I mean, why exhaust yourself? The chemo and radiation is already doing that. That’s sticking plenty of pins in.

""Why don’t you just look after yourself and feel good about yourself and just get on with it? And behave as if this were an aberration and not a permanent fixture. Maybe that’s the best way of dealing with it. And that was my choice… And I’m not a terribly negative person in general. So the idea of being wholly negative for six months went completely against my personality... I have to think of it in a positive way. So that’s where it came from.”

Dickinson is now cancer-free and still achieving success with Iron Maiden.

“There is no secret,” he described on the band’s lasting legacy. “You go out, you tour and you do great shows. You do albums, which we hope are interesting and certainly within our own niche. We stay in touch with our fans and yes, we do that through social media and also through playing live.

""And also, we try to do things with integrity, which means we don’t indulge in the cult of celebrity, turning up to the opening of an envelope, because you might think you’ll end up in Hello! Magazine or whatever the equivalent reality show is that’s currently going on about people with their faces made up to look like fish.""","Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson recalls meeting Johnny Cash, fighting cancer in new memoir",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/14/iron-maidens-bruce-dickinson-recalls-meeting-johnny-cash-fighting-cancer-in-new-memoir.html

Under President Trump’s strong leadership, the Department of Justice has made restoring the rule of law our top priority. Everything we do is guided by this principle.

Under the previous administration, parties who had been sued by the government and then settled the lawsuit were sometimes required to pay community organizations that were not even involved in the case or harmed by the defendant. That was not only wrong, but contrary to longstanding legal principles, and we have put a stop to it. Lawsuit settlements with the government should not be used to bankroll third-party special interest groups or the friends of whomever is in power. They should help compensate victims or go to the taxpayer. Now that is what they will do.

We are also trusting our prosecutors again and letting them do their jobs. The previous administration forced them to leave out important facts in drug cases to achieve sentences lighter than were required by the law. Federal drug prosecutions—and sentences—went down dramatically. Meanwhile drug deaths rose to unprecedented levels.

We have removed this restriction on our prosecutors and told them to target the most violent criminals. They have already achieved significant results, with charges for federal gun crimes up nearly a quarter.

Under this administration, the Department of Justice is serving the American people by following the laws they have duly enacted—and we are just getting started.

The rule of law means abiding by all of our laws. Restoring the rule of law therefore requires enforcing our immigration laws.

We are rewarding those jurisdictions that assist federal law enforcement—not those who refuse to, like “sanctuary” jurisdictions. Our law enforcement grants now have conditions to encourage our state and local partners to help us remove criminal aliens from this country. Politicians have no right to protect criminals or promote lawlessness.

Neither do those entrusted with classified information. Leaks break the public trust and threaten public safety. That is why we tripled the number of active investigations into leaks. We have already charged four people with unlawfully disclosing classified material or concealing contacts with foreign intelligence officers.

When necessary, we go to court to keep the American people safe, such as when we defend the president’s right to protect this country from security threats. We are defending the president’s clear legal right to stop the entry of those who cannot be adequately vetted. Numerous judges—and two district courts—have upheld the president’s travel ban, and we are confident that it will stand.

The Department cannot, however, defend illegal actions. That is why we advised the administration to end the previous administration’s unlawful Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, or DACA. This policy was contrary to our immigration laws and did not have Congressional approval—indeed, Congress rejected similar legislative proposals numerous times.

For the same reason, the Department has agreed to settlement terms with 469 Tea Party and other conservative groups whose tax-exempt applications were delayed by the IRS based on inappropriate criteria including conservative names and policy positions, and civil cases with 90 plaintiffs regarding the previous administration’s contraception mandate. These cases never should have been necessary.

Religious liberty is an inalienable right, and at the president’s direction, we issued legal guidance on how to properly interpret and apply legal protections for religious liberty. And it is not just freedom of worship: we do not give up our religious freedom when we are at work, when we interact with the federal government, or any other time we participate in society.

TRUMP AND THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION: WHAT TO KNOW

April 27, 2016 – Reports suggest Sessions may have had a private meeting with Russia’s then-ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C.

Sessions later denies having any private meetings while at the hotel for Trump's speech.

July 2016 – Sessions meets with Kislyak during the Republican National Convention in Ohio. This meeting, as well as a subsequent one with Kislyak, would not be disclosed during his attorney general confirmation hearing.

September, 8 2016 – Sessions again meets with Kislyak in his office. Sessions later says that he did not remember the details of the meeting aside from discussing a trip he took to Russia with a church group in the early 1990s.

The pair also have a heated discussion regarding Ukraine, Sessions later tells Fox News.

November 8, 2017 – Trump wins the presidential election.

January, 10 2017 – Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., asks Sessions if he knows of any communication between the Russian government and the Trump campaign during his confirmation hearing for attorney general.

“I’m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn’t have – did not have communications with the Russians, and I’m unable to comment on it,” Sessions says.

TRUMP SLAMS SESSIONS, DOJ FOR NOT GOING AFTER CLINTON

January 17, 2017 – Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., submits written questions for Sessions to answer, which includes the question, “Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after Election Day?”

Sessions reportedly responds with one word: “No.”

February 1, 2017 – Sessions is approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee to be the U.S. attorney general.

During this hearing, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., asks Sessions about whether specific individuals met with Russian officials. Sessions is asked about Carter Page, a former campaign adviser.

“I don’t know,” Sessions responds.

CARTER PAGE CONTRADICTS SESSIONS ABOUT RUSSIA TRIP

July 23, 2017 – The Russian Embassy announces that Kislyak has concluded his assignment in the U.S.

Oct. 5, 2017 – Papadopoulos pleads guilty to lying to the FBI regarding “the timing, extent and nature of his relationships and interactions with certain foreign nationals whom he understood to have close connections with senior Russian government officials,” court documents say.

Charging documents in that case indicate that Papadopoulos told the council he sat on with Sessions “that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump” and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

October 18, 2017 – Appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sessions is repeatedly grilled by Democratic lawmakers about why he didn’t previously disclose his meetings with the Russian official.

Sessions also says during this hearing that it’s “possible” he discussed Trump’s campaign with Kislyak.

“We’re sending the National Football League, its corporate sponsors, and the television networks a message this Veterans Day weekend!” 2ndVote told the newspaper. “Americans are sick of the disrespectful National Anthem protests that the NFL has not only allowed to continue, but has institutionalized in pregame ceremonies.”

The league and its players union announced Saturday there would be “no change” in league policy regarding the on-field protests, which began last season with a one-man effort by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who said he wanted to draw attention to police mistreatment of African-Americans across the U.S.

The protests broadened across the league in September, after President Donald Trump told an Alabama crowd that any player protesting during the anthem should be removed from the field.

The president and other critics argued that the playing of the national anthem was the wrong time for protests, regardless of the reason, because the song represents U.S. national unity and respect for those who serve in the military.

Rob Johnson, a co-owner of the New Jersey bar, told NJ.com that their anti-NFL event was inspired by a regular customer who served in Vietnam and felt disrespected by NFL players taking a knee during the anthem.

McClanahan, who played four years with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League in the mid-1990s after a collegiate career at Washington State University, initially told officers he and his wife and baby had been attacked, but investigators found no evidence of an infant at the condo, or anyone entering the unit in the Park Regency in Park City.

Fusion GPS, the firm behind the controversial dossier of allegations about President Trump’s connections to Russia, was – at least in part – hired by a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

The revelation has sparked a frenzy among Republicans who have called for more information on just how involved former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in the production of the unverified dossier.

Here’s what to know about the firm and its connection to the Russia investigations.

What is Fusion GPS?

Founded by veteran journalists, Fusion GPS “provides premium research, strategic intelligence, and due diligence services to corporations, law firms and investors worldwide,” according to its sparse website.

The Washington, D.C.-based firm also says it offers a “cross-disciplinary approach with expertise in media, politics, regulation, national security, and global markets.”

Fusion GPS was started in 2009 by former Wall Street Journal reporters Peter Fritsch and Glenn Simpson.

How is Fusion GPS linked to the Russia investigation?

The political firm was behind the controversial dossier that contained a number of colorful but unverifiable claims about Trump. The company retained British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who produced the 35-page dossier.

FUSION GPS LINK TO DEMOCRATS MURKY BY DESIGN

While it has not been verified, the dossier, which included explicit sexual and financial allegations against Trump, created further speculation about any Trump connection to Russian officials – a question that has dogged his campaign and presidency.

Who funded the dossier?

The firm was originally retained during the election by the conservative website Washington Free Beacon who wanted opposition research on Trump.

After Trump became the GOP presidential nominee, Clinton and the DNC retained Fusion GPS through lawyer Marc Elias and his firm, Perkins Coie, Fox News confirmed.

Clinton reportedly did not know about the dossier until BuzzFeed News published it in January 2017. Democrats have defended it as simply opposition research.

TRUMP AND THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION: WHAT TO KNOW

It's unclear what Fusion GPS had dug up by the time Perkins Coie hired them, or how much money was involved in the transaction. The Clinton campaign and the DNC paid Perkins Coie more than $9 million – although it’s uncertain how much of that money, if any, went toward the dossier.

The Clinton campaign and the DNC funded the project until October 2016 – right before the election.

Trump has suggested that the dossier was funded by Russia, Democrats, the FBI or all of them.

Anything else?

Simpson has done substantial investigative work on the case of Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who was imprisoned after reporting a massive tax fraud scheme. Magnitsky died in prison, and the U.S. enacted the Magnitsky Act, which imposes sanctions on certain Russian officials.

During the campaign, Donald Trump Jr., the president’s oldest son, took a controversial meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who was supposed to have damning information about Clinton. Instead, those who went to the meeting said she just wanted to talk about the Magnitsky Act.

In his investigative work on Magnitsky, Simpson may have found evidence that contradicts details of the case accepted by the U.S., NBC News reported.

Fusion GPS also did work as a firm related to the Magnitsky Act.

Because of the stigma (of mental illness), we stereotype them.”Dvoskin said in some cases, mental illness might make would-be soldiers “tougher and better” as the result.
But some say accepting recruits with mental health conditions – specifically cutting - puts others at risk, especially in high-pressure situations in the field.
The Army says the burden of proof will be on the applicant to provide a case why a waiver should be considered.","Facing low recruitment levels, the U.S. Army quietly lifted its ban on allowing people with a history of mental illness, self-mutilation and drug abuse to serve in the military – despite warnings from the industry about the risks involved.

The new rules green-light recruits who have bipolar disorder, depression and issues with cutting – a process in which a person takes a knife or razor to his or her own skin – along with those who bite, hit or bruise themselves intentionally.

“I am shocked,” Craig Bryan, executive director of the National Center for Veterans Studies at The University of Utah, told Fox News. “This contradicts everything we have been working toward for the past 10-to-15 years.”

“This contradicts everything we have been working toward for the past 10-to-15 years.” - Craig Bryan, National Center for Veterans Studies

Bryan says there is strong evidence to indicate self-injury is a “stepping stone to suicide” and is “the single strongest predictor of suicidal behavior.”

The Army signed off on the new policy in August but never announced it, according to USA Today, which first reported the news.

The decision to lift restrictions comes as the military looks like it will miss its goal of recruiting 80,000 new soldiers through September 2018.

In order to hit last year’s goal of 69,000 recruits, the Army also accepted men and women who did poorly on aptitude tests, increased the number of waivers for pot use and offered hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses.

In fiscal year 2017, it paid out $424 million in bonuses, up from $284 million in 2016. In 2014, that figure was $8.2 million. According to USA Today, some of the recruits qualified for bonuses of $40,000.

When it comes to mental health, recruits who would have previously been barred can submit waivers allowing them to sign up.

The change reverses an eight-year ban on the wavers following a spike of suicides.

The move is especially troubling following the Texas church massacre a week ago, in which 26 people were killed and another 20 injured when Devin Patrick Kelley, a veteran with a history of psychiatric problems, opened fire inside the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs.

Following the deadly episode, it was revealed that Kelley made death threats against his superiors and escaped from a mental hospital during his stint in the Air Force.

Army spokesman Lt. Col. Randy Taylor says the waiver expansion was possible because the government has more access to applicants’ medical records.

“These records allow Army officials to better document applicant medical histories,” he said – but adds that the “waivers are not considered lightly.”

The change in waiver procedures, which means requests can be reviewed and approved by the U.S. Army Recruiting Command, or in the case of the National Guard, by the State Adjutant General, has been ""widely misinterpreted,"" according to Army Deputy Cheif of Staff Lt. Gen. Thomas C. Seamands.

""It's also important to note that the conditions themselves have been unfairly characterized,"" he added. ""For example, a child who received behavioral counseling at age 10 would be forever banned from military service were it not for the ability to make a waiver request.

""We're not prepared to close the door on such individuals who are otherwise medically, mentally and physically qualified for military service,"" Seamands said. ""We think this is the right thing for our Army, and the selfless young men and women who wish to serve.""

Dr. Joel Dvoskin, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor in the University of Arizona's Department of Psychiatry, told Fox News he believes lifting the ban is a step in the right direction.

“The label of mental illness is meaningless,” he said. “There are a ton of people who have a history of something – some kind of emotional trouble – and they are fine. There is no reason in the world they couldn’t serve in the military.”

He added, “Stereotypes are pretty evil all the way around. Because of the stigma (of mental illness), we stereotype them.”

Dvoskin said in some cases, mental illness might make would-be soldiers “tougher and better” as the result.

But some say accepting recruits with mental health conditions – specifically cutting - puts others at risk, especially in high-pressure situations in the field.

“Is it a red flag,” Elspeth Ritchie, a psychiatrist who retired from the Army in 2010, said. “The question is, how much of a red flag is it?”

According to the Army, recruits with a history of self-mutilation must provide documentation that includes a detailed statement from the applicant, medical records, photos submitted by the recruiter and a psych evaluation.

The Army says the burden of proof will be on the applicant to provide a case why a waiver should be considered.","Army lifts ban on cutters, mentally ill and drug abusers to meet recruiting goals",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/13/army-lifts-ban-on-cutters-mentally-ill-and-drug-abusers-to-meet-recruiting-goals.html

The Latest on the Syria conflict (all times local):

5:15 p.m.

Syria has called on the United States to withdraw its forces from the country now that the fight against the Islamic State group is nearly over.

The Foreign Ministry statement, carried by state-run media Tuesday, says the presence of the troops will not force a political solution to the conflict.

The comments came a day after U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said ""we are not going to just walk away right now"" before the U.N-backed political process yields results.

U.S troops and advisers are supporting the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in their fight against Islamic State militants in northern and eastern Syria. Kurdish officials want the U.S. troops to remain in the country to help prevent clashes with pro-government forces, which are also battling IS.

U.S. officials say they are maintaining contacts with their Russian counterparts to ensure no friction occurs between the two forces. Russia is a key ally of President Bashar Assad.

Yasser Hmeish, a clinician at the scene, says rescuers were still pulling bodies from the rubble on Tuesday morning.

But perhaps Yankah should actually engage with some Trump voters (though I wonder if he knows that many personally).","The Sunday “New York Times” published an op-ed that’s causing a stir: “Can My Children Be Friends With White People?”

It’s by Ekow N. Yankah, a Professor of Law at Cardozo. He’s an African-American who’s got sons, the eldest a four-year-old.

According to Yankah, Donald Trump’s election means he’ll have to teach his sons that racism will continue to be a deep part of the American character, and that they’ll have to learn to be suspicious. “Much sooner than I thought I would, I will have to discuss with my boys whether they can truly be friends with white people.”

He goes on to explain that real friendship only happens where there’s trust, and no desire to wield power over the other.

While it may seem like Yankah is making an argument, what he’s doing is the opposite. He’s shutting off debate. He’s saying agree with me or be banished.

Surprisingly, Yankah claims his childhood in a “Midwestern college town [....] lacked the deep racial tension and mistrust that seem so hard to escape now.”

There’s tension today, yes, but there was tension a few decades ago when he was a kid — maybe he just didn’t notice.

How is it that the election of Trump, following Barack Obama’s two terms, was a turning point in race relations, even if it only supposedly revealed what was there all along? Nevertheless, with Trump if office, Yankah notes for many minorities “the ridiculous thing was thinking friendship was possible in the first place.”

According to Yankah, Trump’s essence is racist. For instance, when the President sees blacks protesting and he speaks out, it’s evidence that the President “cannot tolerate [that] the uppity do not stay in their place.”

But it’s more than Trump. It’s Trump’s supporters who have broken Yankah’s heart. (Though Yankah writes about white people, it should be noted almost 30 percent of Asians and Hispanics, and 8 percent of black people, voted for Trump. Also, millions of Obama voters pulled the lever for Trump.)

Yankah cannot excuse those who explain or apologize for what Trump says and does. The President’s designs are so obvious there can be no other interpretation.

While it may seem like Yankah is making an argument, what he’s doing is the opposite. He’s shutting off debate. He’s saying agree with me or be banished.

Not that he doesn’t feel bad about it: “I do not write this with liberal condescension or glee. My heart is unbearably heavy when I assure you we cannot be friends.”

Heavy heart or not, this is a disastrous attitude, in politics or in friendship. When others disagree, you should first try to understand them, rather than simply condemn them. Certainly there’s a decent chance you don’t fully grasp what they’re saying. And maybe, just maybe, you’re the one who’s mistaken.

In trying to explain the violence earlier this year in Charlottesville, Yankah told his four-year-old “Some people hate others because they are different.” His son replied “But I’m not different.”

His son’s response gives me hope, a lot more than the counsel of despair that Yankah has to offer.

Because if the solution is to shutter friendships, where does that leave us?

No one is saying Yankah has to agree with Trump. A whole lot of Trump voters don’t agree with Trump. But perhaps Yankah should actually engage with some Trump voters (though I wonder if he knows that many personally). He might discover they’re decent people.

He may even discover both Democrats and Republicans — all the way up to the president himself — want Americans of all races and ethnicities to do well.

Furthermore, maybe others will open up and understand him better, and the pain he feels when dealing with his children.

The country is having an argument right now, but it’s often not about the goal, but rather how to get there. And if you think the apologists for Trump are wrong, fine, try to explain to them why, rather than reading their minds and writing them off.

A keeper says twin Malayan tigers born in Prague Zoo have a good chance of survival, a rare success for any zoo on the European continent.

The cubs, a male and a female, were born on Oct 3. So far, only two European zoos have managed to breed this subspecies of tiger, most recently a zoo in Halle, Germany, in 2013.

There are only a few hundred Malayan tigers surviving in the wild in Asia and they are classified as critically endangered.

A key obstacle for breeding is that the males are too often aggressive toward their female partners. Other problems include the inability of the mother to take care of the cubs, and diseases.

Keeper Pavel Brandl says the 11-year-old mother, Banya, has been doing well and the two are fine.

Chances are that you hardly notice it half the time, but it might change colors or hurt a little if something’s not quite right. Take a look at a few health problems that your tongue might be telling you about.

First of all, a healthy tongue will have a light pink color to it and be covered with tiny bumps called papillae.

PARENTS OF 10-MONTH-OLD BOY WHO WEIGHS AS MUCH AS A 9-YEAR-OLD SEEK HELP

You won’t usually see a strong color or spots and dots coating a normal tongue, and you definitely shouldn’t feel tingling, burning or pain. If you do, these could be signs of a health problem that you’ll want to look into.

Common Tongue Problems:

Fortunately, tongue problems have specific characteristics that help you zero in on the true health issue. You might see:

Strawberry Red

What it means: Unless you just ate a carton of strawberries or a lollipop, a bright red tongue is not a normal color. There’s a few possibilities that might be causing it.

Vitamin deficiency – Your tongue might be turning a shiny red because it’s losing taste buds. This happens when you’re not getting enough of certain vitamins, namely B-12, folic acid or iron. You’ll need to supplement or eat more foods that contain these vitamins to solve the problem.

Scarlet fever – If you’re red tongue is accompanying a high fever, you should get checked for this bacterial condition. You might see scarlet fever pop up with strep throat.

Chronic dryness – If you have an overly dry mouth, you might see an abnormal red. In this case, you’ll just need to take care of the symptoms with over-the-counter or prescription medications.

White All Over

What it means: If you’re noticing what looks like a lumpy blanket of white all over your tongue, you may have a yeast infection (or oral thrush).

Most of the time, oral thrush happens because too many good bacteria are killed by antibiotics, letting yeast take over instead. You do need to see your doctor for prescription anti-fungal medication.

White patches

What it means: You might notice a painless white patch on or underneath your tongue, a spot called leukoplakia. For the most part, you don’t have anything to worry about.

5 SUBTLE SIGNS OF KIDNEY CANCER

However, especially if you’re a smoker, these white spots can be a form of pre-cancer, warning you to take precautions. Be sure to get any abnormal patches cleared by a doctor.

Cracks or wrinkles

What it means: Concerned about deep cracks in the middle or sides of your tongue? What about wrinkles or ridges? You shouldn’t fret over these pesky ridges that often get more pronounced with age.

In themselves, they’re usually harmless. However, you may develop infections if you don’t clean thoroughly enough and if the ridges are deep. Get any abnormal symptoms checked out, such as a foul smell or tongue pain.

Painful sores

What it means: If you have a painful sore in your mouth, it’s likely a canker sore, or mouth ulcer. They’re usually round, shallow and mostly white with a red rim.

If left alone, they usually heal themselves within two weeks, but you’ll want to stay away from spicy or acidic foods until then. Experts don’t know exactly why canker sores happen, but many think that they’re related to stress or damage to mouth tissue.

Red bumps

What it means: Sometimes, you might notice red bumps forming underneath your tongue or on the top or sides. While bumps on the top may be an inflammation of the papillae, red bumps that don’t go away could be a sign of oral cancer. Treat them seriously and schedule a medical evaluation.

Black or brown hair

What it means: Are you worried that your tongue is turning into a hairy monster? The black or brown fuzz is actually not hair. It happens when cells on your tongue multiply before your body can shed them, and then they trap in bacteria from food or drinks more easily.

At the same time, the bacteria growth is likely due to poor hygiene but sometimes signifies poorly managed diabetes or antibiotic overuse. Make sure that you’re brushing your tongue and your teeth several times per day to get rid of the problem.

IS IT BROKEN OR SPRAINED? WHEN TO SEEK HELP

Your tongue says a lot about your health and can signal you of underlying problems like infection or poor hygiene. Normally, you won’t notice anything out the ordinary, but you might see a change in color or feel some pain if something’s wrong. The next time you’re brushing your teeth, take a look at your tongue in the mirror and hear what it has to tell you about your health.

You might have a budding latte artist at your local coffee shop, but is your barista so spectacular that customers can’t bring themselves to ruin his/her foamy artwork by drinking it?

That’s apparently what’s happening in Taiwan, where one barista is not only making latte art, but 3-D latte art based on her clients’ own pets.

5 TIPS FOR MAKING A BETTER CUP OF COFFEE

Chang Kuei-fang, who works at the My Cofi shop in the Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung, is becoming widely known for her latte-based artwork, which can take the shape of cats, dogs, and even characters from popular culture.

“I came up with a way to express [the animals’] charm,” Chang told Reuters of her work. “I stack up milk froth to create a feeling of layers.” She also frequently uses chocolate or fruit jams to finish her masterpieces.

According to Reuters, Chang takes less than 10 minutes to complete one of her works of latte art. And her customers are in no rush to drink — i.e., ruin — the coffees when they’re finally ready, instead preferring to snap photos for social media.

“We have been taking pictures for one hour now, but are still reluctant to start drinking,” said one young woman who was visiting the area on a school trip.

At his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, the former senator seemingly recused himself from any investigations involving Clinton.
Lawmakers, in both the House and the Senate, have questioned whether Sessions must step aside, and whether Rosenstein should be recused from an investigation involving Uranium One.
Rosenstein has signaled he does not need to recuse himself from a probe involving Uranium One.","Attorney General Jeff Sessions could face heat from both sides of the aisle Tuesday, in a widely anticipated appearance before House lawmakers that comes just hours after he revealed that he has ordered top prosecutors to look into ""certain issues"" involving the Clinton Foundation and the controversial sale of American uranium interests to Russia.

Sessions is expected to testify before the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday morning, and will face tough questioning from Republicans, who believe he took too long, and Democrats, who consider the potential probes partisan.

The appearance comes after Fox News first reported Monday evening that the Justice Department informed committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and other members the issues were on the Department of Justice's radar. Committee members had pressed Sessions to appoint a special counsel to look into alleged wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation and the possibly related sale of Uranium One to a Russian company.

“The Attorney General has directed senior federal prosecutors to evaluate certain issues raised in your letters,” Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote Monday.

Republicans on the committee are also expected to press Sessions on perceived politicization of the FBI during the probe into Hillary Clinton’s private email server. Clinton was eventually cleared by former FBI Director James Comey, but new information has raised questions about Comey's decision-making process.

It is unclear what Sessions can directly do regarding appointment of a special counsel. At his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, the former senator seemingly recused himself from any investigations involving Clinton.

“I believe the proper thing for me to do, would be to recuse myself from any questions involving those kinds of investigations that involve Secretary Clinton and that were raised during the campaign or to be otherwise connected to it,” Sessions said.

The Justice Department did not confirm the breadth of Sessions’ recusal to Fox News, as that would confirm the existence of an investigation, but referred queries to Sessions' confirmation hearing statement.

SESSIONS DIRECTS PROSECUTORS TO 'EVALUATE CERTAIN ISSUES' INVOLVING URANIUM ONE AND CLINTON, LEAVES DOOR OPEN ON SPECIAL COUNSEL

In the letter to Goodlatte and other committee members –including Reps. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Louis Gohmert, R-Texas, and Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the Justice Department said the prosecutors would report to Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein.

“These senior prosecutors will report directly to the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, as appropriate, and will make recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources, or whether any matters merit the appointment of a Special Counsel,” Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote.

Lawmakers, in both the House and the Senate, have questioned whether Sessions must step aside, and whether Rosenstein should be recused from an investigation involving Uranium One. Rosenstein, as a U.S. Attorney, reportedly helped supervise a bribery probe into a subsidiary of the same Russian firm—Rosatom—involved in the Uranium One deal.

REPS. JORDAN AND GAETZ: SPECIAL COUNSEL NEEDED AS QUESTIONS MOUNT ON CLINTON, COMEY, RUSSIAN DOSSIER, AND MORE

The deal concerns the 2010 approval of the sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company. The U.S. was involved because the sale gave the Russians control of part of the uranium supply in the U.S.

The Hill reported, however, that the FBI had evidence as early as 2009 that Russian operatives used bribes, kickbacks and other dirty tactics to expand Moscow’s atomic energy footprint in the U.S., related to a subsidiary of the same Russian firm. Principals involved in the deal also reportedly made massive donations to the Clinton Foundation around the time of the deal.

Rosenstein has signaled he does not need to recuse himself from a probe involving Uranium One.

“The U.S. Attorney’s Office played no role in the 2010 approval of the transfer of rights to mine American uranium involving a different Russian subsidiary,” Rosenstein wrote to Grassley and Feinstein, also noting that “this case” was the first issue questioned during his confirmation hearing.

Still, many on the Republican side do not believe Rosenstein can lead an objective probe into the Uranium One deal.

“We certainly cannot leave it to Mr. Rosenstein,” Gaetz said on “The Ingraham Angle” Monday. “It’s Rosenstein’s name on the signature block sealing from Congress and the American people the very testimony of the informant ready to tell us about the bribes and the kickbacks.”

GRASSLEY CALLS FOR SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE URANIUM ONE

If Sessions and Rosenstein did, in fact, need to recuse themselves from any investigation, Rep. Jim Jordan said “we don’t know the answer” to who would have the authority to appoint a special counsel if necessary.

But the Justice Department told Fox News that if the attorney general and the deputy attorney general were both to step aside from any sort of investigation, not acknowledging the existence of a probe, or their recusal for this specific case, Rachel Brand, who is third in line at the Justice Department, would become acting attorney general for said investigation.

On “Fox & Friends” Tuesday, following the Justice Department’s announcement, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, seemed content with the investigation being led by the DOJ, with officials who “haven’t had any involvement in any of this.”

“If they can carry it out, I’m satisfied with that,” Grassley said, noting that he initially requested the appointment of a special counsel. “It isn’t about Clinton. It isn’t about Trump. What all of this is is political interference within the Justice Department, is there a political interference in the FBI?”

Sessions is also expected to answer questions Tuesday regarding Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which he recused himself from.","Sessions to face Uranium One, Clinton Foundation, recusal questions on Hill",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/14/sessions-to-face-uranium-one-clinton-foundation-recusal-questions-on-hill.html

However, Amazon is apparently working on a completely free version of its Prime Video service, but it will be full of ads.

According to AdAge, Amazon is currently in talks with movie studios, media companies, and TV networks to plan content for a free video streaming service. Where as Prime subscribers pay $99 a year and gain access to Prime Video without adverts, this service wouldn't cost consumers a dime. In return for that free viewing experience, Amazon would surround content with advertising to cover the costs of the service.

Earlier this year, the number of Amazon prime subscribers went past 80 million, but that still leaves tens of million more who don't or even won't pay for access to streamed content. A free service may entice them to try Amazon's platform, at which point Amazon could regularly try and upsell them to a Prime subscription as well as introducing all the other perks paying for Prime offers. And don't forget, free viewers will likely still need to buy a Amazon Fire TV device to watch.

If this free service sounds like a return to regular ad-funded TV, think again. Amazon is apparently planning a much more lucrative deal to content owners. For example, it has been suggested Amazon will share advertising revenue with content creators by allowing them to setup their own channels and provide a set number of hours of content each week. We could effectively have the equivalent of YouTube, only each channel would be from an approved and established movie studio, TV network, or media company.

As to what content we should expect to see on a free Prime Video service, expect a little of everything from children's programming, travel, and cooking, to classic TV shows and the thousands of old movies the studios have to offer.

For now, Amazon is choosing not to comment and the focus remains on Prime subscriptions. If a free service does appear, do you think it will use the Prime Video name or some alternate and new branding?

Late last week, Iowa State University sophomore Chris Jorgensen tweeted out a photo of a Pop-Tart and processed cheese sandwich to his 1100 followers, along with a caption reading, “You ain’t from Iowa if you never had one of these.”

STOVE TOP STUFFING HAS RELEASED 'THANKSGIVING DINNER PANTS'

The Iowans who saw his tweet, however, apparently had no idea what he was talking about, and they weren’t afraid to share their opinions in the comments. In the days since posting his recipe, Jorgensen has been blasted by fellow residents who were so grossed-out, that they not only refuted his claims, but refused to claim him as one of their own.

One user, who responded “on behalf of Iowa,” further suggested that Wisconsin should claim him instead, as they’re more known for their cheese and cheese-based dishes. But soon, even this devolved into a game of Jorgensen hot-potato, with Wisconsin passing on the offer and suggesting a different state, and so on and so forth:

Others even called for Jorgensen to be arrested for his crimes against food, which ultimately prompted the official campus police of Iowa State to respond: “You’re under arrest,” they told Jorgensen.

NUTELLA FANS ARE FUMING OVER RECIPE CHANGE

Jorgensen’s post wasn’t completely without its fans. At least one person said she’d “like to try” one and asked what kind of Pop-Tarts he uses (strawberry), while another praised him for his artsy photography. According to his website, Jorgensen is a photographer for Iowa State's student newspaper.

Jorgensen, meanwhile, doesn’t seem too fazed by the criticism, but rather excited that his tweet went viral on Reddit, and earned him a story in the Des Moines Register.

“I don’t think there’s anybody in the Las Vegas valley that did not know someone who was affected.","A fighter jet at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada now is considered a work of art in tribute to the 58 victims who died in the Las Vegas shooting on Oct. 1. The aircraft is debuting to the public at Aviation Nation, an annual air show at the base.

The jet originally was going to be painted to honor the 70th anniversary of the Air Force, but when the tragedy happened, airmen decided to memorialize the event by treating a static, retired F-15 fighter jet as a canvas.

In just three short weeks, the plane’s paint job was complete, and it had to remain a secret among members of the base.

“The Air Force’s motto is adapt and overcome, and that’s what we did throughout the process. Everybody stepped up,” said Troy Blaschko, an aircraft painter.

He added, “We were very proud to be a part of this.”

The plane won’t be doing any flying, but will be on display for the duration of the air show, which is expected to draw over 400,000 people. It is one of the largest air shows in the western United States. Nellis Air Force Base is home to the Thunderbirds, the famous air demonstration squadron.

The base is integral to the wider Las Vegas community and was directly impacted by the shooting.

“We have some healing to do too. … The passion and the honor of the paint team and design crews as they put this airplane together piece by piece, and scrubbed it piece by piece with meticulous detail was all based on the honor of being able to give back something to the community,” said Major General Peter Gersten.

Around 20 people were involved in the project. Some of the motifs and images have a lot of detail. “Vegas Strong” is painted on the left fuselage, while also including the famous Las Vegas sign and the city’s skyline featured in other areas on the plane.

This wasn’t the only paint job Blaschko and his team undertook. On the opening day of the show, there was one surprise. The same painters also were tasked with a second job: painting Vegas’ new motto, “Vegas Strong” onto the tail of an F-16. This aircraft did fly for the spectators during the show, flying low enough so people on the ground could see it.

“I don’t think there’s anybody in the Las Vegas valley that did not know someone who was affected. We had a few hundred airmen at the concert at the time. … It’s been a community effort across the board,” Gersten said.",'Vegas Strong' F-15 fighter jet debuts at Nevada air show,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/13/vegas-strong-f-15-fighter-jet-debuts-at-nevada-air-show.html

Let Doug Jones do his thing on his own terms.
Unless Jones leads a rally chant of “lock her up,” we’re all good.","You don’t have to be a cable news or Twitter junkie like me to know that Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore is in serious trouble.

The Washington Post revealed Thursday that Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct by four women, including one woman who was just 14 when the 32-year old Moore allegedly assaulted her. That’s the definition of pedophilia for those who are on the fence. And Monday we heard a statement from Beverly Young Nelson, who alleges that Moore assaulted her when she was just 16, telling her “if you tell anyone about this no one will believe you.”

The other women in the Washington Post story were in their teens so I’m hard pressed to consider the 14-year old Moore’s one big mistake. His ex-colleague said it was “common knowledge” that Moore “dated high school girls” into his 30s and would hang around high school football games and the mall. You’d think a legal mind as great as Moore would have better things to do, but I digress.

I’m sure you’ve already read a bunch of pieces on the attempt to discredit these women by using the phrase “if true” before any statement about Moore’s alleged activities. And you’ve probably seen the faux outrage over Jerry Seinfeld’s relationship with a 17-year old or my personal favorite that JFK had an affair with 19-year old Mimi Alford when he was 45.

My suggestion is that no one vote for Jerry Seinfeld if he runs for public office. As for JFK, you can also not vote for him if he somehow comes back from the dead.

Our leadership isn’t popular and it is especially unpopular in Alabama. So cancel any trips down south unless you’ve got bipartisan appeal and are named Joe Biden.

When you get into the realm of Bill Clinton’s accusers things inevitably get trickier, but the good news there is that there are no Clintons left on any ballots, including the one who never has been accused of assaulting anyone.

It looks like Alabamans are skeptical of Moore’s protestations, just like Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is. He said that he believes the women and Moore should step aside. So does the chair of the Republican Senatorial Committee, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who says Moore should withdraw and if he doesn’t, and he wins, then the Senate should expel him.

The first two polls conducted since the allegations broke shows Democrat Doug Jones ahead by four points – a 12-point reversal in one of them.

Moore is busy furiously fundraising off this “fake news” accusation and Democrats are stepping up all over the country for Jones. Prominent Senators like Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Chris Murphy are all working their social channels and phones for Jones. And their followers are doing their part, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for the insurgent campaign.

Democrats won’t stop. But I sincerely hope they will continue to back Jones from afar.

Top Democrat brass should take note: if Tuesday’s wins felt as good for you as they did for me and you’d like to be the winning team again, stay out of Alabama. Let Doug Jones do his thing on his own terms.

If he has to trash Nancy Pelosi, so be it. If he has to say that Hillary Clinton was the wrong candidate for this election and Joe Biden would’ve won, so it goes. If he has to say that the Democrat primary was rigged and Bernie never had a chance, that’s how the cookie crumbles. And if he has to say that the media is biased, let it slide.

Our leadership isn’t popular and it is especially unpopular in Alabama. Unless Jones leads a rally chant of “lock her up,” we’re all good.

So cancel any trips down south unless you’ve got bipartisan appeal and are named Joe Biden and host a fundraiser for Jones in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago or just about anywhere else than Mobile.

We can totally pull this off. Just gotta let Doug be Doug. He’s been doing pretty great thus far.","Jessica Tarlov: Democrats, stay out of the Alabama Senate race if you want to win, send cash instead",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/13/jessica-tarlov-democrats-stay-out-alabama-senate-race-if-want-to-win-send-cash-instead.html

Costas, the longtime NBC broadcaster, said at the University of Maryland on Tuesday that the one-time “cash machine” sport was suffering after multiple investigations into former players who've experienced serious health issues, USA Today reported.

“The reality is that this game destroys people’s brains,"" Costas said. “Not everyone, but a substantial number. That’s the fundamental fact of football, and that to me is the biggest story in American sports.”

Costas was referring to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disease linked with repeated head trauma that has become a concern for many athletes, but mostly those playing in the NFL.

An NBC Sports spokesperson told The New York Daily News, ""Bob’s opinions are his own, and they do not represent those of the NBC Sports Group.""

In a July report, researchers studying the brains of 202 former football players discovered traces of CTE in nearly all of them, The Associated Press reported.

Late New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez suffered substantial damage to parts of the brain that affect memory, judgment and behavior from the most severe case of a degenerative disease linked to head blows ever found in someone so young, a researcher said Thursday.

BOB COSTAS WARNS FUTURE OF FOOTBALL IS BLEAK BECAUSE SPORT 'DESTROYS PEOPLE'S BRAINS'

Dr. Ann McKee, director of Boston University's CTE Center, stressed she could not ""connect the dots"" between the brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy and the behavior of the 27-year-old who hanged himself in April while serving life in prison for murder.

But McKee said CTE had significantly impacted key parts of Hernandez's brain, including the hippocampus -- which is associated with memory -- and the frontal lobe, which is involved in impulse control, judgment and behavior.

""We can say collectively, in our collective experience, that individuals with CTE — and CTE of this severity — have difficulty with impulse control, decision-making, inhibition of impulses or aggression, often emotional volatility and rage behaviors,"" said McKee, who has studied hundreds of brains from football players, college athletes and even younger players, donated after their deaths.

In his speech last week at the University of Maryland, Costas said “the cracks in the foundation are there.""

“The day-to-day issues, as serious as they may be, they may come and go. But you cannot change the nature of the game. I certainly would not let, if I had an athletically gifted 12- or 13-year-old son, I would not let him play football,"" he told the group.

Costas appeared on the Maryland panel with USA Today’s Christine Brennan and ESPN's Tony Kornheiser, each of whom spoke about the future of professional football.

“It’s not going to happen this year, and it’s not going to happen in five years or ten years,"" Kornheiser said. ""But Bob is right: At some point, the cultural wheel turns just a little bit, almost imperceptibly, and parents say, ‘I don’t want my kids to play.’ And then it becomes only the province of the poor, who want it for economic reasons to get up and out.""

Costas said the NFL’s belated efforts to study the dangers of football will only hurt the league in the end.

“The more information [that] comes out, the worse it looks,” Costas said.

Rep. Adam B. Schiff, who is leading House Democrats’ inquisition into Trump-Russia collusion, has not given up on proving that his party’s financed, Kremlin-sourced dossier is true.

The Californian pressed his case again this month during a long closed hearing with former Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page to try to revive what had become dormant charges of criminal conduct.

Mr. Schiff, who on Wednesday labeled President Trump “the worst president in modern history,” previously said that one of his main objectives for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigation is to find which dossier parts are true.

In the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election last year, Mr. Schiff and his Democratic colleagues since January have been more than willing to cite the dossier’s paid unidentified Kremlin sources to attack the Trump administration.

The seven former inmates of the St. Louis Medium Security Institution who filed the lawsuit Monday say the squalid -- and dangerous -- conditions violate inmates’ constitutional rights, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

""I felt like I was treated like a dog,"" said 43-year-old James Cody of Jefferson City, who was jailed there for eight months this year on a probation violation.

He then corrected himself: ""Dogs get treated better, to tell you the truth.""

Cody, speaking at a news conference, said he often found mouse feces in cake served at the jail.

The response from jail staff? Simply scrape off the feces, Cody said.

Cody added mice would jump into bed with inmates and one prisoner tried constructing a crude rat trap with peanut butter so he could kill them himself.

Some of the windows at the jail – which houses 551 inmates – are boarded up, creating sweltering conditions in the summertime, the lawsuit alleges. Others have no window screens, providing an open door for such invaders as mosquitoes, squirrels and birds, allowing the critters to have “a regular presence” inside, the lawsuit adds.

The St. Louis mayor's office told The Associated Press the jail is inspected multiple times each year by the city Health Department and problems are addressed as they arise. Spokesman Koran Addo said preventative maintenance is also regularly conducted at the jail, which opened in the 1960s.

SOME SERIOUS CRIMINALS PAY FOR A ‘LESS INTIMIDATING’ PRISON EXPERIENCE

St. Louis Corrections Commissioner Dale Glass would not comment on the lawsuit Monday, but rejected claims about mold and the infestations, and said guards and inmates were not being attacked by snakes and spiders.

He told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch the jail is “showing signs of disrepair, but it’s clean.”

The nonprofit ArchCity Defenders law firm filed the federal lawsuit seeking closure of the facility -- or to fine St. Louis $10,000 per day until the alleged problems are fixed, the Post-Dispatch reported.

Blake Strode, an attorney for ArchCity Defenders, called conditions at the jail ""unconstitutional and inhumane,"" violating constitutional provisions against cruel and unusual punishment.

Another former inmate, Diedre Wortham, was arrested on a decade-old traffic ticket and spent 22 days in the jail, she said. She says after being hospitalized for high blood pressure, she was denied medicine for a week.

Wortham told The Associated Press she breathed through a T-shirt because of mold in the jail, and stuffed shirts under her cell door to keep mice out.

""I didn't think I was going to make it out of the Workhouse alive,"" Wortham said.

Cody also said he was housed in a dorm with 69 other men, all sharing a single working toilet, sink and shower. He recalled the heat of summer, when temperatures inside the jail reached 125 degrees, according to the lawsuit. The hot conditions led to July protests that resulted in city officials temporarily bringing in portable air conditioners.

But limited ice and water has sparked conflicts among inmates, who find themselves suffering from dehydration and heat rashes, the lawsuit alleges, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Glass told the newspaper future heat waves could bring back the temporary air conditioners, but said it’s not unusual for local jails and state prisons to be without AC.

He said a health department inspection earlier this year found no mold, despite inmates being given the chance to point out any.

Glass, a former Baptist minister, also told the Post-Dispatch his goal is to have “no need” for the facility by addressing mental health, substance abuse and other factors that can lead to the crimes that get inmates sent there.

Still, the jail has been accused of wrongdoing numerous times in the past few years.

A 2009 American Civil Liberties Union report said the staff running the facility allowed inmates to assault each other and ignored sexual harassment, according to the Post-Dispatch.

A 2012 lawsuit also accused the jail’s guards of forcing prisoners into ""gladiator-style combat,” which it denied.

Missouri state Rep. Joshua Peters, who was also at the press conference Monday, said he toured the jail in April with other lawmakers and confirmed the inmates’ complaints in the lawsuit. But so far, according to the Post-Dispatch, he has not been able to get local and state officials to make changes.

And in light of a new accuser who told a tearful, gripping tale at a televised presser yesterday, perhaps skeptics will take a different view.

Beverly Young Nelson, appearing with Gloria Allred, said that when she was 16 Moore groped her in a car, locked the doors, grabbed her neck in an attempt to force sexual contact and left her with bruises after she escaped. Her story will be subjected to scrutiny, but as a self-described Trump voter, Nelson has no apparent motivation to lie. She is the first accuser to say that Moore accosted her, and in fact says she feared he would rape her.

The Post’s account of four women making on-the-record accusations against the Alabama Senate candidate is fair game for criticism, given that the alleged events took place nearly four decades ago. The spotlight is especially intense on the Post’s reporting on Leigh Corfman, who says she was 14 when Moore, then a 32-year-old prosecutor, befriended and sexually molested her.

Breitbart, which has mounted a full-court defense for Moore, spoke to Corfman’s mother and leveled this charge: “that the Washington Post worked to convince her daughter to give an interview about the allegations against Moore.”

That is a process called reporting. If there’s something wrong with that, I’ve committed hundreds of violations. Sources are often reluctant to provide information, especially on the record, and even more especially if they are taking on someone perceived as powerful.

Reporters for the New York Times and the New Yorker had to coax a number of women into going on the record with their allegations against Harvey Weinstein. The same goes for reporting on allegations involving Silicon Valley companies and media figures at Fox, MSNBC and NPR. A couple of Post metro reporters once tried to persuade people to talk by knocking on their doors during Watergate. There is no suggestion of coercion here; indeed, Corfman spoke to the Post’s reporters six times.

Sometimes allegations turn out to be false. But no less a figure than Mitch McConnell, asking Moore to quit the race yesterday, said: “I believe the women.”

Breitbart quoted, Corfman’s mom, Nancy Wells, as saying of her daughter and the journalists: “She did not go to them. They called her…It wasn’t done for politics, you know. It was done for personal reasons. And it wouldn’t have been done if the reporters hadn’t contacted my daughter.”

Breitbart also seized on Wells’ recollection that her teenage daughter didn’t have a phone in her room for Moore to call her, but said Leigh could easily be reached on the household phone.

Steve Bannon, Breitbart’s executive chairman and the former Trump strategist, questioned the Post’s motivation by noting that the paper also disclosed the “Access Hollywood” tape last year:

“The Bezos-Amazon-Washington Post that dropped that dime on Donald Trump. The Bezos-Amazon-Washington Post that dropped the dime this afternoon on Judge Roy Moore. Now is that a coincidence?”

But even if you buy the premise that the Post was anxious to break a negative story on Moore, that doesn’t make it untrue.

Moore, for his part, is threatening a lawsuit: “The Washington Post published another attack on my character and reputation because they are desperate to stop my political campaign. These attacks said I was with a minor child and are false and untrue—and for which they will be sued.”

In a series of tweets, Trump Jr. produced “the entire chain of messages with @wikileaks (with my whopping 3 responses) which one of the congressional committees has chosen to selectively leak. How ironic!”

The Atlantic first reported on Monday that Trump Jr. received a private message from the WikiLeaks Twitter account on September 20, 2016 — a message shown in the tweets produced by the president’s son.

“A PAC run anti-Trump site putintrump.org is about to launch,” WikiLeaks wrote. “The PAC is a recycled pro-Iraq war PAC. We have guessed the password. It is ‘putintrump.’ See ‘About’ for who is behind it. Any comments?”

Trump Jr. replied, “Off the record I don’t know who that is, but I’ll ask around. Thanks.”

In a separate October 2016 exchange, WikiLeaks urged Trump Jr. to “comment on/push this story” about then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wanting to “just drone” Julian Assange, the Wikileaks founder.

“Already did that earlier today,” Trump Jr. later replied. “It’s amazing what she can get away with.”

The messages obtained by The Atlantic were turned over to investigators by Trump Jr.’s attorneys. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence had access to the documents, a source told Fox News.

“Over the last several months, we have worked cooperatively with each of the committees and have voluntarily turned over thousands of documents in response to their requests,” Alan Futerfas, an attorney for Trump Jr., said in a statement.

“Putting aside the question as to why or by whom such documents, provided to Congress under promises of confidentiality, have been selectively leaked, we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum.”

According to the report, the messages are part of a long correspondence between WikiLeaks and Trump Jr., though Trump Jr. seemed to ignore many of the messages, including some which urged him to release “one or more of your father’s tax returns.”

President Trump’s attorney Ty Cobb told Fox News on Monday that he was not aware that Donald Trump Jr.’s attorneys provided these documents to congressional investigators, but said there is likely no legal issue, from what he knows of the documents.

Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange tweeted about the report on Monday, saying that the organization couldn’t “confirm” the messages with Trump Jr.

Wikileaks “does not keep such records and the Atlantic’s presentation is edited and clearly does not have the full context,” Assange wrote.

“WikiLeaks loves its pending publications and ignores those who ask for details,” Assange continued. “Trump Jr. was rebuffed just like Cambridge Analytica. In both cases WikiLeaks had publicly teased the publications. Thousands of people asked about them. WikiLeaks can be very effective at convincing even high profile people that it is their interest to promote links to its publications.

“WikiLeaks has such chutzpah that it allegedly tried to convince Trump Jr to leak his father’s tax returns & his own “Russian lawyer meeting” emails (he did),” Assange wrote. “WikiLeaks appears to beguile some people into transparency by convincing them that it is in their interest.”

Assange also claimed that the “full text of alleged DMs with context provides a different reading, unsurprisingly.”

This is not the first time that Trump Jr. has been in the spotlight, and has had his actions brought into question amid the larger probe into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election.

In June 2016, Trump Jr. accepted a now-highly scrutinized meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, after he allegedly was promised “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. The meeting was brokered by music publicist Rob Goldstone who promised the campaign information. Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, who was charged last month in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian collusion, also attended the meeting.

Still, she's glad of the attention it's brought to ""Olive Trees.""","There's a secret hidden in a Vincent van Gogh painting.

It remained undetected for 128 years, until Mary Schafer, a paintings conservator at Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Missouri, discovered it with the aid of a surgical microscope — imbedded in the paint in the foreground of van Gogh's 1889 work ""Olive Trees"" are the remains of a tiny grasshopper.

""I came across what I first thought was the impression of a tiny leaf,"" Schafer told Live Science. ""But then, I discovered it was in fact a tiny insect.""

Conservators like Schafer can be like detectives, uncovering clues in their careful studies of works of art hat reveal new details about their origins and contexts. Many of history's artists worked outdoors, Schaefer said, especially in the 19th century. [11 Hidden Secrets in Famous Works of Art]

""You can find sand in the paint from beach scenes, plant material in forest scenes,"" Schafer said.

Researchers already knew that van Gogh, in particular, liked to paint while outdoors — and occasionally wrangled with a wayward bug — thanks to a letter he wrote to his brother Theo in 1885, according to a museum press release:

""But just go and sit outdoors, painting on the spot itself!"" the letter reads. ""Then all sorts of things like the following happen – I must have picked up a good hundred flies and more off the 4 canvases that you'll be getting, not to mention dust and sand … when one carries them across the heath and through hedgerows for a few hours, the odd branch or two scrapes across them…""

Still, Schafer hoped that further study of ""Olive Trees"" might reveal new details about the context in which it was painted.

""We're trying to apply scientific means [to understanding the art in the museum],"" she said.

Schafer contacted Michael Engel, a professor of paleoentomology at the University of Kansas and an associate at the American Museum of Natural History, to see what he could glean from her discovery — including, perhaps, the season in which it was painted.

But there was one problem: The little critter's remains were incomplete. The thorax and abdomen, which might have contained the remains of its last meal — which, in turn, might have offered clues as to the season in which it died — were missing. Nor was there any sign that the insect struggled to escape the sticky paint.

Schafer said she suspects the dead grasshopper was already on van Gogh's brush when he pressed it into his characteristically thickly painted ""Olive Trees."" [Gallery: 5 Times Science Inspired Art]

The discovery itself may not be very important in strict scholarly terms, Schafer said, but she's glad that it's sparked the public's interest, with museum visitors crowding the painting to hunt for specks of the grasshopper's remains.

It also offers the public a window into the work of conservators. Schafer and her colleagues work in near silence, she said, with painting and photography conservators gathered in the same room. An array of equipment, some of it borrowed from other precision professions, sits on their desks. The microscope's arm comes down across the table, and the conservators adjust its position as they move across their subjects.

""Under the microscope, you can really see the paint in a three-dimensional way,"" Schafer said.

Van Gogh's thick swirls, in particular, come alive, she added.

While Schafer said she's glad of the attention the discovery has received, a grasshopper is far from the most exciting thing a conservator has discovered in artwork; the real drama lies in finding traces of an old painting behind the current paint on a canvas, or signs of alterations. (In 2008, scientists announced they had discovered the portrait of a woman hiding beneath van Gogh's ""Patch of Grass"" painting.)

Still, she's glad of the attention it's brought to ""Olive Trees.""

""Whenever we can tie something to the artist and their work, we're happy,"" she said.

Poor compliance with drug regimens is a common problem in many disease areas, especially when patients suffer from chronic conditions.","U.S. regulators have approved the first digital pill with an embedded sensor to track if patients are taking their medication properly, marking a significant step forward in the convergence of healthcare and technology.

The medicine is a version of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co Ltd’s established drug Abilify for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression, containing a tracking device developed by Proteus Digital Health.

The system offers doctors an objective way to measure if patients are swallowing their pills on schedule, opening up a new avenue for monitoring medicine compliance that could be applied in other therapeutic areas.

Shares in Otsuka rose 2.5 percent on Tuesday after news of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) late on Monday.

The FDA said that being able to track ingestion of medicines prescribed for mental illness may be useful “for some patients”, although the ability of the digital pill to improve patient compliance had not been proved.

BOGUS PAIN CREAMS ARE COSTING TAXPAYERS MILLIONS -- AND THEIR LIVES

“The FDA supports the development and use of new technology in prescription drugs and is committed to working with companies to understand how technology might benefit patients and prescribers,” said Mitchell Mathis of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

The system works by sending a message from the pill’s sensor to a wearable patch, which then transmits the information to a mobile application so that patients can track the ingestion of the medication on their smartphone.

About the size of a grain of salt, the sensor has no battery or antenna and is activated when it gets wet from stomach juices. That completes a circuit between coatings of copper and magnesium on either side, generating a tiny electric charge.

In the longer term, such digital pills could also be used to manage patients with other complicated medicine routines, such as those suffering from diabetes or heart conditions.

Poor compliance with drug regimens is a common problem in many disease areas, especially when patients suffer from chronic conditions.

Proteus has been working on the pill tracking system for many years and the sensor used in Abilify MyCite was first cleared for use by the FDA in 2012.

The unlisted Californian company has attracted investments from several large healthcare companies, including Novartis AG, Medtronic Inc and St. Jude Medical Inc, as well as Otsuka.

We are defending the president’s clear legal right to stop the entry of those who cannot be adequately vetted.","The rule of law is the foundation of our system of government. In the vision of our Founders, we have “a government of laws—and not of men.”

Under President Trump’s strong leadership, the Department of Justice has made restoring the rule of law our top priority. Everything we do is guided by this principle.

Under the previous administration, parties who had been sued by the government and then settled the lawsuit were sometimes required to pay community organizations that were not even involved in the case or harmed by the defendant. That was not only wrong, but contrary to longstanding legal principles, and we have put a stop to it. Lawsuit settlements with the government should not be used to bankroll third-party special interest groups or the friends of whomever is in power. They should help compensate victims or go to the taxpayer. Now that is what they will do.

We are also trusting our prosecutors again and letting them do their jobs. The previous administration forced them to leave out important facts in drug cases to achieve sentences lighter than were required by the law. Federal drug prosecutions—and sentences—went down dramatically. Meanwhile drug deaths rose to unprecedented levels.

We have removed this restriction on our prosecutors and told them to target the most violent criminals. They have already achieved significant results, with charges for federal gun crimes up nearly a quarter.

Under this administration, the Department of Justice is serving the American people by following the laws they have duly enacted—and we are just getting started.

The rule of law means abiding by all of our laws. Restoring the rule of law therefore requires enforcing our immigration laws.

We are rewarding those jurisdictions that assist federal law enforcement—not those who refuse to, like “sanctuary” jurisdictions. Our law enforcement grants now have conditions to encourage our state and local partners to help us remove criminal aliens from this country. Politicians have no right to protect criminals or promote lawlessness.

Neither do those entrusted with classified information. Leaks break the public trust and threaten public safety. That is why we tripled the number of active investigations into leaks. We have already charged four people with unlawfully disclosing classified material or concealing contacts with foreign intelligence officers.

When necessary, we go to court to keep the American people safe, such as when we defend the president’s right to protect this country from security threats. We are defending the president’s clear legal right to stop the entry of those who cannot be adequately vetted. Numerous judges—and two district courts—have upheld the president’s travel ban, and we are confident that it will stand.

The Department cannot, however, defend illegal actions. That is why we advised the administration to end the previous administration’s unlawful Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, or DACA. This policy was contrary to our immigration laws and did not have Congressional approval—indeed, Congress rejected similar legislative proposals numerous times.

For the same reason, the Department has agreed to settlement terms with 469 Tea Party and other conservative groups whose tax-exempt applications were delayed by the IRS based on inappropriate criteria including conservative names and policy positions, and civil cases with 90 plaintiffs regarding the previous administration’s contraception mandate. These cases never should have been necessary.

Religious liberty is an inalienable right, and at the president’s direction, we issued legal guidance on how to properly interpret and apply legal protections for religious liberty. And it is not just freedom of worship: we do not give up our religious freedom when we are at work, when we interact with the federal government, or any other time we participate in society.

We do not give up our rights when we go to school, either. This Department is standing up for those whose rights have been violated on campus, including supporting a lawsuit by one young man who was punished for discussing his faith outside of his school’s tiny “free speech zone.” And we are examining a case where Asian-American students allege racial discrimination in one university’s admissions.

Alva Campbell, 69, a death row prisoner who has argued he was too ill for lethal injection is slated to die by injection Wednesday.

Campbell has severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder as the result of a decades-long two-pack-a-day smoking habit.

SCANDAL ROCKS OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY AS 83 STUDENTS ACCUSED OF CHEATING VIA APP

Campbell’s attorneys say he uses a walker, relies on a colostomy bag, requires four breathing treatments a day and may have lung cancer. They have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop Wednesday's execution, because of his poor health, a motion opposed by the state.

The attorneys warned Campbell’s death could become a “spectacle” if guards are unable to find suitable veins in the sick inmate’s arms.

Dr. James McWeeney noted there were no objective findings such as increased pulse rate or breathing to corroborate Campbell’s anxiety. However, he recommended allowing Campbell to lie “in a semi-recumbent position” during the execution.

Earlier this month, Campbell lost a bid to be executed by firing squad after a federal judge questioned whether lawmakers would enact the bill needed to allow the method.

Prison department spokeswoman JoEllen Smith said Monday that Campbell's ""medical condition and history are being assessed and considered in order to identify any necessary accommodations or contingencies for his execution.""

OHIO GAS STATION CASHIER PUMMELS WOULD-BE ROBBER, OFFICIALS SAY

Meanwhile, prosecutors say Campbell’s health claims were ironic -- given he faked paralysis to escape court custody the day he killed a teenager during a carjacking.

Campbell, who has a lengthy arrest record, first went to jail in 1967, when he was 19 years old, for shooting a state trooper, Dayton Daily News reported. The ill inmate was paroled in 1992 after serving 20 years for killing a man in a Cleveland bar.

In 1997, Campbell, who was shot during a robbery, faked being paralyzed as he was driven by a Franklin County sheriff’s deputy to a court hearing on several armed robbery charges. While in a wheelchair, Campbell overpowered the deputy and fled.

Campbell took the deputy’s gun, carjacked Charles Dials’ car and drove around with him for several hours. Dials, 18, while crouched in the footwell of his own truck, was shot twice in the head by Campbell, court records showed.

Campbell fled, carjacked another vehicle and tried to kidnap two more people before he was found by deputies hiding in a tree, Dayton Daily News reported.

Campbell’s attorney’s argued he was regularly beaten, sexually abused and tortured as a child.

Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich rejected clemency for Campbell last week.

On Tuesday, the state said it was starting final preparations for Campbell’s execution. If the execution happens, Campbell would be the third inmate to be executed in the state this year.

Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.","At least 26 people were killed and 20 wounded in Texas after a gunman dressed in tactical gear opened fire at a church outside San Antonio on Sunday, investigators confirmed.

Multiple sources speaking to Fox News identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley. The mass shooting unfolded around 11:30 a.m. at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, which is about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio.

Investigators said at a news conference Sunday evening that the victims ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. One official said about 20 people were hospitalized with injuries ranging from minor to ""very severe.""

Sunday's massacre is the deadliest church shooting in modern U.S. history. It is also, according to Gov. Greg Abbott, the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history.

A possible motive was unclear. Kelley lived in a suburb of San Antonio and didn't appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. The official said investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley may have made in the days before Sunday's attack, including one that appeared to show a semiautomatic weapon.

A spokesperson with the U.S. Air Force confirmed to Fox News that Kelley served in the military branch at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until a bad conduct discharge in 2014.

He was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and child, and when he was discharged received 12 months of confinement and a reduction in military rank.

""It is horrible,"" Wilson County Commissioner Larry Wiley told Fox News of the massacre. ""It appears someone walked in and started shooting.""

Around 11:20 a.m., Kelley arrived at a Valero gas station across from the First Baptist Church dressed in black tactical gear and a ballistic vest. He crossed the street and started firing a Ruger AR rifle at the church, officials said. He entered the building and kept shooting.

He was confronted by an armed nearby resident who chased after him. Kelley was later found dead, roughly five miles away in Guadalupe County, according to Wiley. It's unclear whether Kelley was killed by police or the armed resident, or from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

""We have accepted a multiple number of patients from the shooting,"" Megan Posey, a spokeswoman for Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, 15 miles from the church, told Fox News.

Some victims were transported to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, KSAT reported.

Officials said 23 people were found deceased in First Baptist Church, while two were found dead outside. One person who was transported to a hospital later died.

One of those killed was 14-year-old Annabelle Pomeroy, the church pastor's daughter.

The FBI is investigating the shooting, in addition to multiple other agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The San Antonio Express-News reported police were checking the gunman's home for explosives following the shooting.

The church's layout would've made it difficult for churchgoers to flee a shooter who came through the front door, according to a congregant attending a vigil at the church Sunday night.

The church was described as having only small exits on the side and in the back, according to Hunter Green. He said if a gunman came through the front door, people ""wouldn't have had anywhere to go.""

Neighbors of Kelley's told The Associated Press they heard gunfire coming from his direction in recent days.

""It's really loud,"" 16-year-old Ryan Albers said. ""It was someone using automatic weapon fire.""

Another neighbor, who argued hearing gunfire in the area is not uncommon, said they had heard gunfire coming from across the street, but couldn't be sure if it was from Kelley's property.

Attorney General Paxton told Fox News that ""people never think"" a shooting like this can ""happen in their communities.""

""In a small town ... I can imagine that these people are devastated. And everyone in the community is going to ... have some type of close relationship"" to those either killed or injured at the First Baptist Church. He added it's ""hard to justify why anyone would do this.""

""This is horrific for our tiny little tight-knit town,"" Alena Berlanga, who lives 10 minutes outside of Sutherland Springs told The Associated Press. ""Everybody's going to be affected and everybody knows someone who's affected.""

President Trump, speaking from Tokyo during his trip to Asia, called the shooting an ""act of evil,"" and added: ""Through the tears and through the sadness, we stand strong.""

Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.""

Gov. Abbott said in a statement that ""While the details of this horrific act are still under investigation, Cecilia and I want to send our sincerest thoughts and prayers to all those who have been affected by this evil act.""

""I want to thank law enforcement for their response and ask that all Texans pray for the Sutherland Springs community during this time of mourning and loss,"" the statement read.

Sutherland Springs has a population of about 400 residents.

Sunday's shooting comes just over a month after 58 people were killed and hundreds injured on Oct. 1 after a gunman opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas.

“It’s a bleaching cream that I apply before going to bed and whitens my skin some,” Sosa, 49, told Univision in 2009. “It’s a cream that I have, that I use to soften [my skin], but has bleached me some. I’m not a racist, I live my life happily.”

At the time, Sosa said the cream, along with the bright TV lights, made his skin appear lighter than it is. He did not specify why he was using the cream, but it came at a time when many were linking his changing looks to steroid use.

“I don’t think I look like Michael Jackson,” he said.

While he’s yet to address the latest photos, Sosa previously revealed the cream was purchased in Europe, but did not mention it by name. Over the summer, fans went wild after he made a brief appearance during ESPN Deportes’ coverage of the home run derby wearing a pink outfit with noticeably lighter skin. The Dominican Republic native did not address speculation about his skin color then, either.

While some were quick to make light of Sosa’s latest looks and compared him to cartoon characters and other celebrities accused of bleaching their skin, others questioned his mental health status.

“Can I just say that the stuff where people make fun of Sammy Sosa’s lighter-skinned appearance makes me deeply uncomfortable? Not even from a racial perspective, but mostly from a health/mental health perspective. Lay off,” Twitter user Brett Taylor tweeted.

Let Doug Jones do his thing on his own terms.
Unless Jones leads a rally chant of “lock her up,” we’re all good.","You don’t have to be a cable news or Twitter junkie like me to know that Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore is in serious trouble.

The Washington Post revealed Thursday that Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct by four women, including one woman who was just 14 when the 32-year old Moore allegedly assaulted her. That’s the definition of pedophilia for those who are on the fence. And Monday we heard a statement from Beverly Young Nelson, who alleges that Moore assaulted her when she was just 16, telling her “if you tell anyone about this no one will believe you.”

The other women in the Washington Post story were in their teens so I’m hard pressed to consider the 14-year old Moore’s one big mistake. His ex-colleague said it was “common knowledge” that Moore “dated high school girls” into his 30s and would hang around high school football games and the mall. You’d think a legal mind as great as Moore would have better things to do, but I digress.

I’m sure you’ve already read a bunch of pieces on the attempt to discredit these women by using the phrase “if true” before any statement about Moore’s alleged activities. And you’ve probably seen the faux outrage over Jerry Seinfeld’s relationship with a 17-year old or my personal favorite that JFK had an affair with 19-year old Mimi Alford when he was 45.

My suggestion is that no one vote for Jerry Seinfeld if he runs for public office. As for JFK, you can also not vote for him if he somehow comes back from the dead.

Our leadership isn’t popular and it is especially unpopular in Alabama. So cancel any trips down south unless you’ve got bipartisan appeal and are named Joe Biden.

When you get into the realm of Bill Clinton’s accusers things inevitably get trickier, but the good news there is that there are no Clintons left on any ballots, including the one who never has been accused of assaulting anyone.

It looks like Alabamans are skeptical of Moore’s protestations, just like Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is. He said that he believes the women and Moore should step aside. So does the chair of the Republican Senatorial Committee, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who says Moore should withdraw and if he doesn’t, and he wins, then the Senate should expel him.

The first two polls conducted since the allegations broke shows Democrat Doug Jones ahead by four points – a 12-point reversal in one of them.

Moore is busy furiously fundraising off this “fake news” accusation and Democrats are stepping up all over the country for Jones. Prominent Senators like Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Chris Murphy are all working their social channels and phones for Jones. And their followers are doing their part, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for the insurgent campaign.

Democrats won’t stop. But I sincerely hope they will continue to back Jones from afar.

Top Democrat brass should take note: if Tuesday’s wins felt as good for you as they did for me and you’d like to be the winning team again, stay out of Alabama. Let Doug Jones do his thing on his own terms.

If he has to trash Nancy Pelosi, so be it. If he has to say that Hillary Clinton was the wrong candidate for this election and Joe Biden would’ve won, so it goes. If he has to say that the Democrat primary was rigged and Bernie never had a chance, that’s how the cookie crumbles. And if he has to say that the media is biased, let it slide.

Our leadership isn’t popular and it is especially unpopular in Alabama. Unless Jones leads a rally chant of “lock her up,” we’re all good.

So cancel any trips down south unless you’ve got bipartisan appeal and are named Joe Biden and host a fundraiser for Jones in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago or just about anywhere else than Mobile.

Apparently, GQ seems to think that disrespecting our military and spitting on our flag is a symbol of heroism and manliness. That’s not citizenship – that’s cowardice.

Apparently, GQ seems to think that disrespecting our military and spitting on our flag is a symbol of heroism and manliness.

That’s not citizenship – that’s cowardice.

“In my view, the most pernicious element of white backlash against Colin’s protest has been the way in which the narrative has been co-opted and re-framed so that taking a knee is now somehow synonymous with disrespecting the flag, with a lack of patriotism,” scholar Christopher Petrella wrote in a GQ essay.",Starnes: GQ Should've Named Colin Kaepernick Its 'Coward of the Year',http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/14/starnes-gq-shouldve-named-colin-kaepernick-its-coward-year#commenting

I don’t know how they found out we were in need, and it doesn’t really matter to me. We needed some food, and I’m just thankful that someone listened when the Lord nudged them to come through for us.

When you think about it, we all have the opportunity to be the answer to someone else’s prayers today. Maybe they don’t need groceries, but they need some encouragement, a friend, an invitation, someone to listen.

Maybe they don’t even know what they need – they’re just hurting and need someone like you or me to be present in their lives. Maybe we will be the evidence that Jesus sees them in their hurt and that he deeply cares for them.

So many of us pray that God will use us in a big way. What if he wants to use us in a small way that will be big in someone’s life? Is that enough? If it is, then today is full of opportunities to love Jesus with an unexpected knock on the door, an open trunk and a box of Fruit Loops.",The day we ran out of food,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/04/day-ran-out-food.html

TAMPA NEIGHBORHOOD ON ALERT AFTER 3 KILLINGS, 'NOTHING LINKING' VICTIMS, COPS SAYThe Seminole Heights is a working-class neighborhood northeast of downtown Tampa that's slowly becoming gentrified.","Residents of a Tampa neighborhood were asked to shelter in place early Tuesday after a body was found close to where three people were killed within a half-mile of each other last month -- once again sparking fears of a serial killer in the Sunshine State.

Tampa Police said they're investigating a suspicious death in the Seminole Heights neighborhood, where residents have been in fear since mid-October when three people were fatally shot within a 10-day period.

Officers have saturated the area, and are going door-to-door searching for a suspect and any potential witnesses, FOX13 Tampa reported.

""Police officers are all over the place,"" Tampa police spokesman Steve Hegarty said. ""We hope to catch him before he gets outside the area.""

Police received a report of shots fired around 4:51 a.m., and responded within a minute to find the body of 60-year-old Ronald Felton in the street, interim Police Chief Brian Dugan said at a news conference.



Felton was crossing the street at the time to meet someone when a gunman came up from behind him and shot him, according to Dugan.

The suspect is described as a black male, with a thin build, dressed in all black and wearing a baseball cap, police said.

It is unknown what type of weapon was used in the shooting early Tuesday. The shooting has caused a main road to be shut down as part of the investigation.

TAMPA MAYOR TELLS COPS IN SEARCH FOR KILLER: 'BRING HIS HEAD TO ME'

""Right now, we are treating it as related until we can rule otherwise,"" he said, referring to the other killings. Dugan said he believes the killer lives in the neighborhood and asked for ""everyone to pay attention.""

""We need to catch this killer before we have to notify one more family that one of their loved ones is dead."" - Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn

Felton was shot to death outside of the church where he volunteers at a food kitchen, according to FOX 13.

Dugan said the shooting was similar to the other killings, but because this killing happened early in the morning as opposed to late at night, he believes the suspect is hiding out in the area.

""Because the time has changed, how were they able to get here at this hour? How were they able to vanish so quickly? You have to believe they are hiding out somewhere,"" he told reporters.

The interim police chief also once again asked residents to look through the area and report any suspicious activity to authorities.

""If you own a firearm of any kind, we need you to verify that it's where it's supposed to be,"" he said. ""If it's not, call us.""

Schools in the neighborhood are open, but Hillsborough County district officials are telling students in the search perimeter to stay home.

""Do not go to bus stops or leave to walk or drive to school until police secure the area,"" school officials posted to Twitter.

Steve Zinder, the incoming neighborhood association president, told FOX13 he was awakened by the sound of police helicopters. He said in the last month, the neighborhood adjusted to having the helicopters hovering above them, but this morning it was different.

""They were much lower, much more concentrated, so I knew something was going on,"" he said. ""This is not the kind of news we wanted to wake up to this morning.""

Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn said officials believe the suspect ""lives in close proximity"" to the killing, and officials need residents to ""think about what they heard last night.

""This is personal. This has got to stop,"" he told reporters, adding ""We need to catch this killer before we have to notify one more family that one of their loved ones is dead.""

The killings in Seminole Heights last month led the department to increase police patrols in the neighborhood. All of the victims were alone, and had gotten off a bus before they were killed.

Last month, Buckhorn told officers at a briefing to hunt down the killer and ""bring his head to me.""

""We're going to hunt this son of a b---- down until we catch him, and it's gonna be you guys, it's gonna be great police work doing what you guys do every day,"" Buckhorn told officers before they headed out to patrol the neighborhood in late October.

Police have released surveillance videos of a hooded suspect from near the scene of the killings. In a security video taken moments after Benjamin Mitchell became the first victim on Oct. 9, the suspect was spotted running from the scene.

Two days after Mitchell, 22, was shot, Monica Hoffa, 32, was also gunned down. On Oct. 19, Anthony Naiboa, 20, was shot after taking the wrong bus home from his new job. Police patrolling nearby heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene to find Naiboa dead.

TAMPA NEIGHBORHOOD ON ALERT AFTER 3 KILLINGS, 'NOTHING LINKING' VICTIMS, COPS SAY

The Seminole Heights is a working-class neighborhood northeast of downtown Tampa that's slowly becoming gentrified. Run-down homes sit next to renovated, historic bungalows, and trendy restaurants have sprung up near auto body shops.

Residents and business owners have said there are car burglaries and fights between kids, but nothing like this.

Listen here for the full interview

BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: Welcome back, everyone. Brian Kilmeade here. Thanks so much for listening to the Brian Kilmeade show. In a little while, we're going to have Bill Hammer on. Yes, that same Bill Hammer. But first things first, there's only very few people in this world I break format for and give up the big three, and one of them is on the line. He is Speaker Paul Ryan. Mr. Speaker, welcome.

SEN. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Hey, thanks for breaking format. How are you doing, man?

KILMEADE: Anything for you. Now, what time were you up working out today?

RYAN: Six.

KILMEADE: Six o'clock.

RYAN: Yes.

KILMEADE: Knowing that you had a lot to do, is it harder to work out knowing that you had a lot to do?

RYAN: No, it makes it easier actually. It just helps me get on my day. My mind's a little distracted, but working out's the best way to just process stress to me.

KILMEADE: Process stress. That's what I want to bring up to you. A lot of people on either side of the aisle, the republicans are saying last night was no big deal when the marquee matchup was at Gillespie against Northam, and that Gillespie lost by nine. And democrats are saying this is ""the beginning of our turnaround."" What do you take from Ed Gillespie's significant loss yesterday?

RYAN: Well, obviously democrats are going to do that, and we would be saying the same kind of thing. That's the way the spin works on these things. The way I see it, honestly, is we've got to get our job done, and we've got to - that's why I think tax reform is just so important. Not just politically, but just for the country.

And I think what people want to know and see is that this Donald Trump presidency and this republican Congress makes a positive difference in my life. And granted in the House we feel pretty good because we've actually been passing this agenda left and right. We've passed 394 bills out of the House alone, more in this presidency than in Obama, Clinton, and Bush's at the same time. It's just that about 308 of those bills still haven't gotten into the law. They're still kind of over in the Senate, so we're a little gummed up and frustrated there, but that's why tax reform is so important --

KILMEADE: Right.

RYAN: -- because tax reform is one of those things. Those 308 bills I mentioned, those all can be filibustered.

KILMEADE: You talk --

RYAN: Tax reform --

KILMEADE: Right. Well --

RYAN: -- cannot be filibustered.

KILMEADE: -- Mr. Speaker, you know - you just said that's the way politics is. People spin their way out of it. Do you have to make (ph) as republicans -- either you're going to side with President Bush and his policies - 43 or more, free trade, and maybe some type of immigration compromise - or do you have to go with Donald Trump? Is it going to be a choice for republicans - Bush or Trump?

RYAN: We already made that choice. We're with Trump. We already made that choice. That's a choice we made at the beginning of the year. That's a choice we made during the campaign which is we merged our agendas. We ran on a joint agenda with Donald Trump. We got together with Donald Trump when he was President Elect Trump and walked through what is it we want to accomplish in the next two years. We all agreed on that agenda. We're processing that agenda.

Again, in the House, we passed, repeal, and replaced Obamacare. We funded the wall already in the House. We passed rebuilding the military. Once we're on the second installment there, we pass out veterans over all those. We pass, repeal, and replace of Dodd-Frank.

Now, not everything I just said is going into law because, again, if Chuck Schumer gets to filibuster these things in the Senate, that frustrates everybody. But that's my point, Brian. Tax reform is the most singular, signature issue that people think of when they think of republican, when they think of Donald Trump, when they think of how is this going to help me in my life.

An average $1,200 tax cut for the average household in America...

KILMEADE: Right.

RYAN: -- where you got half the country living paycheck to paycheck is a big deal. Dropping the tax rates on businesses by 40 percent so they can compete globally and hire more people is a big deal. When you see statistics like the corporate rate reduction loan increases wages like $4,000, it's a big deal. When you see an analysis that just came up that says this tax reform bill will increase jobs by a million jobs, increase economic growth, take home pay and wage growth, that's a big deal. So we got to deliver. And that's what I get out of this, is we got to deliver, we're in the middle of doing it.

The committee's putting the bill through the committee this week, the floor next week, the Senate's following one week behind us. So we just got to deliver, that's what I get out of this.

KILMEADE: And Mr. Speaker, as you know, you got to keep one eye on the Senate, because you're about passing, you're not just about committee and mark ups.

RYAN: Right. Right.

KILMEADE: So you saw what came out yesterday. Evidently, Orrin Hatch's committee is putting out a policy that's backed by Senator Portman that possibly would delay the corporate tax until 2019. So you'll get it to 20 -- would you wait a year for the corporate tax reduction?

RYAN: Yes, I mean this is a long process. The House is going to it's thing, the Senate's going to do it's thing, then we're going to go meet in what we call a conference committee and iron out those differences. Right now, the House bill -- I can't speak for the Senate -- we're immediate and we're permanent.

The -- what Rob Portman will probably tell you is phasing in the corporate reduction still is very good for economic growth, because you have full expensing. And that means it's actually more valuable for a company to expand their operations immediately with a phase in, because they can deduct it off a higher tax rate.

And businesses do multi-year planning. So what economists tell us -- and this is what I think Senator Portman would say -- is that you still get very fast economic growth and you actually are encouraging companies to spend on factories and plants and equipment and hiring people sooner with the phase in.

So I still think you get the faster economic growth. So I'm not trying to come up with excuses, all I'm saying is the Senate is still focused on getting an economic growth plan and the House does it as well. So at the end of the day, this is all to the good, it's just a debate about how good it gets.

KILMEADE: So the Wall Street Journal, who doesn't wake up every day thinking how am I going to mess with the GOP, I just don't like those guys, maybe like Salon or the Huffington Post does, has a little bit of a problem. And they also point out the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is normally supportive of your efforts to overhaul the tax system, said that there's a lot of work to be done here.

And the Chairman of the National Association of Home Builders has a problem on the cap on $500,000 to be able to write off your mortgage. He says that really hurts people in high tax states.

RYAN: Well look, for even people with (ph) the high tax states, here's what this bill does. It's -- you still get to write off the first $500,000 of your mortgage, you get an additional -- we had to back a property tax deduction, oh, and don't forget the fact you just got a doubled standard deduction, so your first $24,000 instead of your first $12,000 are tax free.

If you have kids, you just increased your child tax credit by $600 per child. And we're lowering tax rates across the board. The people above a million don't get a rate lowering, but their income -- most -- more of their income is -- is taxed at lower rates. So actually, even though there's a lot of counter -- false information out there, everybody gets a tax cut.

Everybody's rates go down, everybody's exemption goes up. So the difference here with these kinds of deductions is this.

KILMEADE: Right.

RYAN: Do you -- do we just cut tax rates and let you keep your money and you decide what to do with it? Or do we keep tax rates higher, you send your money to Washington, and then if you do something that the IRS approves of, you know a mortgage or something like that, then you can get you some of your money back.

Our philosophy is just cut tax rates across the board so you deduct less but you keep your money first. And you decide what you want to do with your money because it's your money. That's the philosophical difference here.

KILMEADE: So the one thing is you do not cut the top rate for those who -- for the upper class and you leave it at 39.6 percent.

RYAN: Right.

KILMEADE: If you get rid of the deductions and leave that, you'd actually up the taxes on the most successful people in the country, which a lot of people don't despise or resent.

RYAN: No. I'd say -- but one more thing you're forgetting in that, which is we're taking the -- the -- the dollar amount that that rate hits, from $477,000 up to $1 million. So that means another half a million dollars are taxed at a lower rate than they would be under our current law.

KILMEADE: What would that new rate be? So if the high - if the --

RYAN: Well it's 39.6. But it's just - I'm saying 39.6 kicks in at a million instead of $477,000, and 35 percent would be the rate you're at for 477 to a million. The point being even people in the Joint Committee in Taxation that runs the numbers for - official number for Congress say everybody gets a tax cut. Everyone gets a tax cut.

Now what I would simply say is the president made really clear to us that he wants the tax relief on the endikem (ph) tax side to be focused on middle income people. He doesn't want massive tax relief on top.

KILMEADE: Right.

RYAN: He wants massive tax relief in the middle and for low income people. That was what the president basically said to Congress to do, that Congress followed suit and did that, but also the people who own businesses are the people you're describing. Businesses are getting their tax rates dropped tremendously. Successful small businesses, their top tax rate goes from over 40 percent down to 25 percent -- KILMEADE: Right.

RYAN: -- a proper rate (ph) from 35 percent to 20 percent, the debt tax being repealed. So I would say that most of those folks that you're talking about are owner of businesses. They're getting a big business tax cut, so everyone's going to benefit from this, and that's why we're seeing these estimates that show --

KILMEADE: Right.

RYAN: -- more jobs, higher wages, faster economic growth.

KILMEADE: So, Mr. Speaker, two more quick things - I'm getting a lot of people who are I would label as working class say to me, ""I cannot believe they're going to get rid of the tax credit for adoptive parents --

RYAN: Yes.

KILMEADE: -- we needed that money. That's why I - that's one of the --

RYAN: Sure.

KILMEADE: -- great things about adopting,"" which is a great thing to do. Anyway, why would you attacked that?

RYAN: I was one of the authors of the tax credit. We obviously are for that. It's a tax credit that is enjoyed by higher income people, not lower income people. You don't get a tax credit, for instance, if you're getting -taking fosters kids. You actually get a different arrangement there. It was - the question the Ways of Mean Committee asked was, ""do we want to give a person one tax cut for one year for doing one thing, or do we want to give families a tax cut every year for anything?""

And that's the difference here which is do you get one tax cut for adopting a child once, or do we give families a tax cut each and every year for each and every child always, and then let them decide what they want to do with their money. That's the difference here.

KILMEADE: All right. He's getting his hands dirty defending a tax point that hasn't quite take total shape knowing that the democrats are coming out with a plan of their own, and their going to get their hands dirty again. You still act optimistic to get this done by Thanksgiving?

RYAN: Yes, in the House. The plan was always the House out by Thanksgiving, the Senate's going to be about a week behind us because the rule is required the House go first, and the goal here is law by the end of the year, and we're on track.

KILMEADE: Thanks so much, Mr. Speaker. I'll see you in Washington. Hopefully we'll do a longer version of this.

RYAN: All right, Brian. Take care.",Speaker of the House Paul Ryan: We Have To Deliver Tax Reform & Are In Middle Of Doing So,https://radio.foxnews.com/2017/11/08/speaker-of-the-house-paul-ryan-we-have-to-deliver-tax-reform-are-in-middle-of-doing-so/

In a letter first obtained by Fox News, the Justice Department responded to July 27 and September 26 requests from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and other committee members, who called for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the matters in question.

The letter comes on the eve of Sessions’ testimony before the same committee, scheduled for Tuesday.

“The Attorney General has directed senior federal prosecutors to evaluate certain issues raised in your letters,” Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote.

“These senior prosecutors will report directly to the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General [Rod Rosenstein], as appropriate, and will make recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources, or whether any matters merit the appointment of a Special Counsel,” Boyd wrote.

The Justice Department does not ordinarily confirm or deny investigations, and Boyd wrote that “this letter should not be construed to do so.”

The Justice Department’s letter specifically said that some of the topics requested by Goodlatte and other committee members were already being investigated by the department’s Inspector General’s office.

The letter specifically mentioned allegations related to the FBI’s handling of the Clinton email probe, including allegations that DOJ and FBI “policies or procedures” were “not followed in connection with, or in actions leading up to or related to” then-FBI Director James Comey’s public announcement to close the Clinton email “matter” on July 5, 2016, or the letter he sent lawmakers on October 28, 2016, about newly discovered Clinton emails, and that those “investigative decisions were based on improper considerations.”

“The Department has forwarded a copy of your letters to the IG so he can determine whether he should expand the scope of his investigation based on the information contained in those letters,” Boyd wrote. “Once the IG’s review is complete, the Department will assess what, if any, additional steps are necessary to address any issues identified by that review.”

While the Justice Department did not confirm or deny an ongoing investigation into Clinton matters, administration officials pointed Fox News to the attorney general’s testimony at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, raising questions over whether he would recuse himself from this investigation.

“With regard to Secretary Clinton and some of the comments I made, I do believe that that could place my objectivity in question,” Sessions said in response to committee Chairman Chuck Grassley’s, R-Iowa, asking whether he could approach a Clinton investigation “impartially.” Sessions added at the time, “I believe the proper thing for me to do would be to recuse myself from any questions involving those kind of investigations that involve Secretary Clinton and that were raised during the campaign or to be otherwise connected to it.”

Former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed in May as a special counsel to investigate accusations of collusion between Russia and officials close to President Trump.

FOX's Gurnal Scott with the story:

House Speaker Paul Ryan on FOX News Sunday says the reform bill with a trillion-dollar tax cut is on pace to pass the House by Thanksgiving. But critics say key deductions are being left out of the proposal.

Host Chris Wallace pressed the Speaker on what it could mean for many, like those paying off student loans:

(Wallace) ""If I'm able to deduct the interest rate. Now I'm losing that, if I have huge medical expenses and I'm able to deduct the medical.""

(Ryan) ""In exchange for a tax cut, so you get to keep your money more in the first place. So you get to decide what you want to do with your money.""

Lawmakers, in both the House and the Senate, have questioned whether Sessions must step aside, and whether Rosenstein should be recused from an investigation involving Uranium One.
Rosenstein has signaled he does not need to recuse himself from a probe involving Uranium One.","Attorney General Jeff Sessions could face heat from both sides of the aisle Tuesday, in a widely anticipated appearance before House lawmakers that comes just hours after he revealed that he has ordered top prosecutors to look into ""certain issues"" involving the Clinton Foundation and the controversial sale of American uranium interests to Russia.

Sessions is expected to testify before the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday morning, and will face tough questioning from Republicans, who believe he took too long, and Democrats, who consider the potential probes partisan.

The appearance comes after Fox News first reported Monday evening that the Justice Department informed committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and other members the issues were on the Department of Justice's radar. Committee members had pressed Sessions to appoint a special counsel to look into alleged wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation and the possibly related sale of Uranium One to a Russian company.

“The Attorney General has directed senior federal prosecutors to evaluate certain issues raised in your letters,” Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote Monday.

Republicans on the committee are also expected to press Sessions on perceived politicization of the FBI during the probe into Hillary Clinton’s private email server. Clinton was eventually cleared by former FBI Director James Comey, but new information has raised questions about Comey's decision-making process.

It is unclear what Sessions can directly do regarding appointment of a special counsel. At his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, the former senator seemingly recused himself from any investigations involving Clinton.

“I believe the proper thing for me to do, would be to recuse myself from any questions involving those kinds of investigations that involve Secretary Clinton and that were raised during the campaign or to be otherwise connected to it,” Sessions said.

The Justice Department did not confirm the breadth of Sessions’ recusal to Fox News, as that would confirm the existence of an investigation, but referred queries to Sessions' confirmation hearing statement.

SESSIONS DIRECTS PROSECUTORS TO 'EVALUATE CERTAIN ISSUES' INVOLVING URANIUM ONE AND CLINTON, LEAVES DOOR OPEN ON SPECIAL COUNSEL

In the letter to Goodlatte and other committee members –including Reps. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Louis Gohmert, R-Texas, and Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the Justice Department said the prosecutors would report to Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein.

“These senior prosecutors will report directly to the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, as appropriate, and will make recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources, or whether any matters merit the appointment of a Special Counsel,” Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote.

Lawmakers, in both the House and the Senate, have questioned whether Sessions must step aside, and whether Rosenstein should be recused from an investigation involving Uranium One. Rosenstein, as a U.S. Attorney, reportedly helped supervise a bribery probe into a subsidiary of the same Russian firm—Rosatom—involved in the Uranium One deal.

REPS. JORDAN AND GAETZ: SPECIAL COUNSEL NEEDED AS QUESTIONS MOUNT ON CLINTON, COMEY, RUSSIAN DOSSIER, AND MORE

The deal concerns the 2010 approval of the sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company. The U.S. was involved because the sale gave the Russians control of part of the uranium supply in the U.S.

The Hill reported, however, that the FBI had evidence as early as 2009 that Russian operatives used bribes, kickbacks and other dirty tactics to expand Moscow’s atomic energy footprint in the U.S., related to a subsidiary of the same Russian firm. Principals involved in the deal also reportedly made massive donations to the Clinton Foundation around the time of the deal.

Rosenstein has signaled he does not need to recuse himself from a probe involving Uranium One.

“The U.S. Attorney’s Office played no role in the 2010 approval of the transfer of rights to mine American uranium involving a different Russian subsidiary,” Rosenstein wrote to Grassley and Feinstein, also noting that “this case” was the first issue questioned during his confirmation hearing.

Still, many on the Republican side do not believe Rosenstein can lead an objective probe into the Uranium One deal.

“We certainly cannot leave it to Mr. Rosenstein,” Gaetz said on “The Ingraham Angle” Monday. “It’s Rosenstein’s name on the signature block sealing from Congress and the American people the very testimony of the informant ready to tell us about the bribes and the kickbacks.”

GRASSLEY CALLS FOR SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE URANIUM ONE

If Sessions and Rosenstein did, in fact, need to recuse themselves from any investigation, Rep. Jim Jordan said “we don’t know the answer” to who would have the authority to appoint a special counsel if necessary.

But the Justice Department told Fox News that if the attorney general and the deputy attorney general were both to step aside from any sort of investigation, not acknowledging the existence of a probe, or their recusal for this specific case, Rachel Brand, who is third in line at the Justice Department, would become acting attorney general for said investigation.

On “Fox & Friends” Tuesday, following the Justice Department’s announcement, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, seemed content with the investigation being led by the DOJ, with officials who “haven’t had any involvement in any of this.”

“If they can carry it out, I’m satisfied with that,” Grassley said, noting that he initially requested the appointment of a special counsel. “It isn’t about Clinton. It isn’t about Trump. What all of this is is political interference within the Justice Department, is there a political interference in the FBI?”

Sessions is also expected to answer questions Tuesday regarding Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which he recused himself from.","Sessions to face Uranium One, Clinton Foundation, recusal questions on Hill",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/14/sessions-to-face-uranium-one-clinton-foundation-recusal-questions-on-hill.html

The YOLO culture seeks not content of character, but equality of outcome.
The YOLO culture divides people against the each other.","The recent Texas church shooting, the terrorist driving a truck through a crowd in New York City, and the Las Vegas massacre may seem shocking – but to anyone who has been paying attention, they should not.

Our culture is undergoing a hostile takeover. American society used to be governed by Judeo-Christian do-unto-others morals. But we have drifted (been pushed, really) into a hedonistic YOLO (You Only Live Once) cultural morass. The upshot of this is a distinct lack of respect for human life in general, as well as a pervasive, insidious obsession with self.

This is the “me” generation, the “selfie” culture, the “entitlement” mentality. And what is entitlement, except the narcissistic assumption of deserving and demanding what is not earned?

Our cultural crisis is exhibited by egotistic multimillionaires demonstrating on football fields against the police instead of seeking solutions to rampant inner-city violence; coddled young people demanding free birth control and socialized health care; and even the major media ignoring the corruption trial of Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.

No amount of self-love can fill the God-shaped hole in someone’s heart. We are created and called to love each other, and no self-absorbed spa treatment or Instagram post can supplant our innate yearning for love from God.

Another example of the crisis is the lack of attention the mainstream media are paying to the Clintons’ collusion to sell Russia 20 percent of U.S. uranium.

We’ve replaced our moral imperative to do what’s right with a personal obsession of what’s in it for ME?

But no amount of self-love can fill the God-shaped hole in someone’s heart. We are created and called to love each other, and no self-absorbed spa treatment or Instagram post can supplant our innate yearning for love from God.

The spirit of our time is gradually revealing in our culture a subversive, resolute, and increasing hatred toward God and Christianity, and an irresistible temptation toward evil that betrays man’s innate desire for power: a longing to be God.

The Harvey Weinsteins of the world (and they are myriad, both in Hollywood and out) seek to force others to do their will, much like they envision a capricious God would be, if they believed in such a being.

It is much easier, however, to deny God than to acknowledge him. God, being good, condemns evil-doers. So, like a child throwing a tantrum in a toy store, some people must deny the existence of God and his inherent goodness, and lord their power over weaker people. “I can make you watch me shower.”

Society, still trading in our inherited moral capital, might verbally condemn the behavior. But that’s just lip-service, because we’ve succumbed to the YOLO moral relativism and forgotten our metric for right and wrong.

“I forbid you to see me as a sex object,” screamed the gal in the pink hat! And those who claim they wanted to expose the bully – and they all say that now – confess they were too afraid of retribution. Translation: I like my money and position more than I believe in right and wrong. “Followers” on social media beat morals every day of the week in YOLO land.

When a righteous dad wanted to expose a high-powered elitist climbing in bed with youngsters, the Hollywood leftists and atheists sided with the pedophile over the conservative. Status is more important than virtue in YOLO land.

The growing YOLO culture seeks to silence the stalwart dissent of facts. Feelings are more important than truth in YOLO land.

Threatened by disagreement and privilege, yelling triumphs over logic. The YOLO culture seeks not content of character, but equality of outcome. Hatred is so much easier than forgiveness.

Self-destructive loathing and jealousy stems from the hypocrisy that started in kindergarten, when children are taught: You are an accident of nature, and survival of the fittest is the law of the land. Now, don’t bully.

And so, they distrust the dark abyss of irreligion, even as they embrace it.

Attacks against the only one who preached forgiveness and grace, goodness and love – and any who support him – will increase: He challenges the YOLO worldview taught in public school.

As it becomes more and more costly to be an adherent of Christianity, with stories of the persecution of bakers, florists, teachers, and T-shirt makers splashing across newspapers every day, the truth gathers defenders.

Though meant to intimidate us, these stories do the opposite. They galvanize Christians to stand firm in the light of understanding, and the peace that surpasses it.

The people who still trade in the Judeo-Christian ethic of “love one another” and “life has value” are not called simply to defend their position, but to fight for it, before the overwhelming tide of YOLO selfishness inundates us with the intolerance and bigotry integral to the religion of self.

The YOLO culture divides people against the each other.

To survive and prosper as a nation, we must reaffirm our Judeo-Christian heritage, indivisible, under God. Because if you only live once, it’s survival of the fittest, and it’s all about you, then laws are meaningless.",Our culture is experiencing a hostile takeover.

The seven former inmates of the St. Louis Medium Security Institution who filed the lawsuit Monday say the squalid -- and dangerous -- conditions violate inmates’ constitutional rights, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

""I felt like I was treated like a dog,"" said 43-year-old James Cody of Jefferson City, who was jailed there for eight months this year on a probation violation.

He then corrected himself: ""Dogs get treated better, to tell you the truth.""

Cody, speaking at a news conference, said he often found mouse feces in cake served at the jail.

The response from jail staff? Simply scrape off the feces, Cody said.

Cody added mice would jump into bed with inmates and one prisoner tried constructing a crude rat trap with peanut butter so he could kill them himself.

Some of the windows at the jail – which houses 551 inmates – are boarded up, creating sweltering conditions in the summertime, the lawsuit alleges. Others have no window screens, providing an open door for such invaders as mosquitoes, squirrels and birds, allowing the critters to have “a regular presence” inside, the lawsuit adds.

The St. Louis mayor's office told The Associated Press the jail is inspected multiple times each year by the city Health Department and problems are addressed as they arise. Spokesman Koran Addo said preventative maintenance is also regularly conducted at the jail, which opened in the 1960s.

SOME SERIOUS CRIMINALS PAY FOR A ‘LESS INTIMIDATING’ PRISON EXPERIENCE

St. Louis Corrections Commissioner Dale Glass would not comment on the lawsuit Monday, but rejected claims about mold and the infestations, and said guards and inmates were not being attacked by snakes and spiders.

He told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch the jail is “showing signs of disrepair, but it’s clean.”

The nonprofit ArchCity Defenders law firm filed the federal lawsuit seeking closure of the facility -- or to fine St. Louis $10,000 per day until the alleged problems are fixed, the Post-Dispatch reported.

Blake Strode, an attorney for ArchCity Defenders, called conditions at the jail ""unconstitutional and inhumane,"" violating constitutional provisions against cruel and unusual punishment.

Another former inmate, Diedre Wortham, was arrested on a decade-old traffic ticket and spent 22 days in the jail, she said. She says after being hospitalized for high blood pressure, she was denied medicine for a week.

Wortham told The Associated Press she breathed through a T-shirt because of mold in the jail, and stuffed shirts under her cell door to keep mice out.

""I didn't think I was going to make it out of the Workhouse alive,"" Wortham said.

Cody also said he was housed in a dorm with 69 other men, all sharing a single working toilet, sink and shower. He recalled the heat of summer, when temperatures inside the jail reached 125 degrees, according to the lawsuit. The hot conditions led to July protests that resulted in city officials temporarily bringing in portable air conditioners.

But limited ice and water has sparked conflicts among inmates, who find themselves suffering from dehydration and heat rashes, the lawsuit alleges, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Glass told the newspaper future heat waves could bring back the temporary air conditioners, but said it’s not unusual for local jails and state prisons to be without AC.

He said a health department inspection earlier this year found no mold, despite inmates being given the chance to point out any.

BECOMING A PRISONER IN THE FEDERAL PRISON SYSTEM -- SURPRISING COURTEST AT A SEMINAR NO ONE WANTS TO ATTEND

Glass, a former Baptist minister, also told the Post-Dispatch his goal is to have “no need” for the facility by addressing mental health, substance abuse and other factors that can lead to the crimes that get inmates sent there.

Still, the jail has been accused of wrongdoing numerous times in the past few years.

A 2009 American Civil Liberties Union report said the staff running the facility allowed inmates to assault each other and ignored sexual harassment, according to the Post-Dispatch.

A 2012 lawsuit also accused the jail’s guards of forcing prisoners into ""gladiator-style combat,” which it denied.

Missouri state Rep. Joshua Peters, who was also at the press conference Monday, said he toured the jail in April with other lawmakers and confirmed the inmates’ complaints in the lawsuit. But so far, according to the Post-Dispatch, he has not been able to get local and state officials to make changes.

Reddit, a discussion website with various “subreddit” forums, has posted about the CICO diet across many of its weight-loss forums.

One user who had been following CICO for two months and shed 20 pounds wrote, “For years I actually thought that [losing weight] required vigorous exercise, and eating nothing but tilapia, broccoli, and spinach. How wrong I was,” Yahoo Style reported.

In a separate thread, another user shared, “CICO will work regardless of what you’re eating. Junk food, healthy food, fancy food, cheap food. It doesn’t matter. CICO is essentially the only thing that matters when it comes to weight loss.”

HOW LONG SHOULD IT REALLY TAKE TO LOSE WEIGHT?

However, the CICO diet, which stands for “calories in, calories out,” is challenged by nutritionists as an old way of thinking.

The diet suggests that you can eat whatever type of food you want – healthy food, junk food – and still lose weight by creating a calorie deficit throughout the day, meaning consuming fewer calories than you expend each day.

However, nutritionists argue that not all calories are created equally, and relying on calorie counting to lose weight does your body a disservice in the end. You have to also consider how your food choices affect your body beyond weight loss.

“Eating all junk, but keeping it low-calorie, will still wreak havoc on things like your skin, your mood, your gastrointestinal functions,” Dawn Jackson Blatner, RDN, and author of “The Superfood Swap” told Yahoo.

“At the core of it, it’s true that calories will rule things when it comes to weight loss,” Blatner concedes, but explains ""that is [only] true in the most crude, raw possible way.”

Nutrition expert, Cynthia Sass, MPH, RD and Health’s contributing nutrition editor told Yahoo, “We now know that the quality of the calories you consume—as well as the macronutrient balance and timing—all impact metabolism, satiety, and how your body utilizes calories.”

“It’s not as simple as a math equation,” Sass adds.

Clinical dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic, Mira Ilic, extrapolates on macronutrient needs stating a well-balanced diet is necessary for things like tissue repair, and muscle recovery and growth.

While Ilic knows people can lose weight with CICO, she says, “But would I recommend this to my patients? Definitely not.”

For those who are interested in being more calorie conscious, Blatner recommends looking at your plate and making sure you’re getting a balanced, healthy meal with whole grains, protein and vegetables.

“If you look at your plate and you have what you can guesstimate is a half-cup of a grain, that’s going to be roughly 150 calories; if you see a reasonably sized piece of protein, it’s likely about 3 ounces, or about 150 calories,” Blatner says. “And if you see a lot of vegetables, topped with just a little bit of fat, like a drizzle of olive oil, you’re probably adding up to about a 400 to 450 calorie meal.”

For the average woman looking to lose weight, Blatner suggests keeping 1,500 calories in mind as a daily goal.

“That number might be a little bit up or down, depending on whether you’re taller or shorter, or how much you exercise,” she explains, “but 1,500 calories is a great starting point.”",Most popular weight-loss diet on Reddit would never be recommended by nutritionists,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2017/11/12/most-popular-weight-loss-diet-on-reddit-would-never-be-recommended-by-nutritionists.html

The two men tried to get Melgar to join the racket, but he declined the offer, the report said. Melgar later ended up dead in what appeared to be a strangulation.

Whether the SEALs were involved in the death remained unclear as the investigation continued. The commandos were initially described as “witnesses,” but authorities later changed that to “persons of interest.” Officials said Melgar’s cause of death was “homicide by asphyxiation.”

Melgar, 34, was found dead June 4 at the U.S. Embassy housing he shared in Mali with several other special operations personnel working in West Africa on training and counterterrorism missions, the New York Times reported.","Green Beret Killed in Mali Discovered SEALs' Illicit Cash Scheme, Report Says",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/13/green-beret-killed-mali-discovered-seals-illicit-cash-scheme-report-says#commenting

TRUMP AND THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION: WHAT TO KNOW

April 27, 2016 – Reports suggest Sessions may have had a private meeting with Russia’s then-ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C.

Sessions later denies having any private meetings while at the hotel for Trump's speech.

July 2016 – Sessions meets with Kislyak during the Republican National Convention in Ohio. This meeting, as well as a subsequent one with Kislyak, would not be disclosed during his attorney general confirmation hearing.

November 8, 2017 – Trump wins the presidential election.

January, 10 2017 –Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., asks Sessions if he knows of any communication between the Russian government and the Trump campaign during his confirmation hearing for attorney general.

TRUMP SLAMS SESSIONS, DOJ FOR NOT GOING AFTER CLINTON

January 17, 2017 – Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., submits written questions for Sessions to answer, which includes the question, “Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?”

Sessions reportedly responds with one word: “No.”

October 18, 2017 – Appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sessions is repeatedly grilled by Democratic lawmakers about why he didn’t previously disclose his meetings with the Russian official.

“I didn’t want a relationship [when we met], but I knew God was telling me he was the one, so I took a leap of faith,” Allison told the site.

In hopes of adding a personal touch to the ceremony, she decided to surprise her new husband with the musical interlude. The added touch was deeply personal, as the couple often travels to perform at other churches.

“People call and ask for her to sing, and I’m usually the one behind her,” Jason said.

While the groom remembered that Allison showed him a YouTube clip of another girl singing a similar Elvis cover a year ago, he was totally surprised by her serenade, especially since his best man acted as the sound guy for the ceremony. The bride did, however, tease him with a cryptic message beforehand.

“I told him that if he didn’t cry, I was going to turn around and do it all over again,” Allison said, adding that Jason’s emotional reaction is her favorite part of the video.

On the big day, as Presley’s heartfelt tune wafted through the venue, Jason said he was totally shocked to see his bride-to-be slowly coming towards him in song.

“I saw the mic in her hand, and she was singing, and at that moment, the floodgates opened up. It was a complete surprise. I was really flattered,” he said.

Officials said a passerby noticed a woman who appeared confused and possibly in danger along Combee Road near North Crystal Lake Road in Lakeland.

When deputies arrived they found Donna Byrne riding her horse on the road and had an odor of alcohol, red watery eyes and was staggering, Fox 13 Tampa reported.

Officers did a sobriety test and said she gave breath samples that registered blood-alcohol level of .161 — twice Florida's legal limit of .08.

Byrne is charged with DUI and animal neglect for endangering and failing to provide proper protection for the horse.

""Ms. Byrne was obviously not in any condition to be on the road,"" said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. ""She not only put herself and the horse in danger but also anyone who was driving on the road, which is typically very busy.""

Deputies took the horse to the Polk County Sheriff's Animal Control livestock facility. She was booked into the Polk County Jail. Jail records did not list an attorney for her.

Nasser said ISIS itself poses the biggest threat in terms of reforming militants.
“The biggest obstacle is the senior members of ISIS, who planted negative ideas about the concept of moderate Islam and made them criminals under the name of Islam,” Nasser said.
“[ISIS] have shown themselves to be failures in their grand aspiration,” William F. Wechsler, senior fellow on national security and counterterrorism at the Middle East Institute, told Fox News.","Is it possible to deprogram a terrorist? A group recently formed outside Aleppo is working to find out.

The Syrian Center for Anti-Extremist Ideology, which opened on Oct. 28 and is housed inside an area contested by ISIS, aims to be a place where those who have been indoctrinated by the terrorists can be rehabilitated.

One hundred students -- composed of former ISIS fighters, sympathizers of the Islamic State who worked in civil society and foreigners who fought for the group before defecting and being detained in liberated areas -- are enrolled in the program.

“Everyone has a point of weakness and thinking, from which, we can get into his ideas from a particular side and then remove this extremist and terrorist thought from his brain,” Hussien Nasser, the center’s director, told Fox News.

Participants will take part in programs, lectures and seminars covering Islam, psychological and intellectual development, media and entertainment. With the assistance of specialists who chair each session, the center has tailor-made initiatives to figure out what technique works best at de-radicalizing each militant.

Many of these men, Nasser said, may reside within prisons for a certain amount of time, only to re-enter society and continue to sow chaos or spread hate. He told Fox News his goal is to ""find a solution to these people.""

ISRAEL OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE IN SYRIA AS NEEDED

Although the nascent organization is bootstrapping it -- specialists are unpaid and they have no legal framework to formally “graduate” people out of the center -- they will pass along evaluations about each enrolled prisoner to the relevant court.

Nasser said ISIS itself poses the biggest threat in terms of reforming militants.

“The biggest obstacle is the senior members of ISIS, who planted negative ideas about the concept of moderate Islam and made them criminals under the name of Islam,” Nasser said.

Research into whether these de-radicalization efforts have worked is limited. A 2010 Rand Corporation study on the topic pointed out that recidivism rates may not be the best way to judge a program’s success, while another analysis said Saudi Arabia’s programs had only mixed success. The Saudis poured a lot of funds into their efforts, but saw subsequent suicide bombings perpetrated by graduates of the de-radicalization program.

Sometimes what happens on the battlefield is the biggest catalyst for deprogramming a militant.

TRUMP, PUTIN REPORTEDLY AGREE TO DEFEAT ISIS IN SYRIA

In November 2001, Usama bin Laden gave a speech in which he said, “When people see a strong horse and a weak horse, by nature, they will like the strong horse” -- the idea being, it’s easier for terrorist groups to recruit new followers when they're gaining territory and scoring battlefield victories because people are attracted to winners.

“[ISIS] have shown themselves to be failures in their grand aspiration,” William F. Wechsler, senior fellow on national security and counterterrorism at the Middle East Institute, told Fox News. “Everything they said has so far turned out to be not true. That’s the greatest contribution that the U.S. has made to this effort. You’re de-radicalized because your side has lost.”

A study from King’s College in London of 15 prison-based de-radicalization programs found these programs work better when an insurgency or extremist movement is losing—rather than in places where civil war is still ongoing.

Nasser said he sees some small indications of early progress from his managers in the program.

But he added a caveat: “Of course, I cannot confirm the evaluation until a group of prisoners are released and closely monitored to be properly and effectively evaluated.""",Syria tries 'terrorist rehab' to de-radicalize ISIS militants,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/14/syria-tries-terrorist-rehab-to-deradicalize-isis-militants.html

On Saturday, the network released a statement on Twitter explaining that it has severed ties with Dillard after another round of comments against Jennings, who stars on her own series, “I Am Jazz,” which chronicles her life following her decision at a young age to transition from a male to a female.

“We want to let our viewers know that Derick Dillard has not participated in ‘Counting On’ for months and the network has no plans to feature him in the future. We want to reiterate that Derick’s personal statements do not reflect the views of the network,” the statement reads. “TLC is proud to share the story of Jazz jennings and her family and will continue to do so.”

The decision from the network comes after Dillard spoke for a second time about Jennings, arguing that he doesn’t believe that one can change their gender identity and refused to use feminine pronouns when discussing Jennings.

“I pity Jazz, 4 those who take advantage of him in order 2 promote their agenda, including the parents who allow these kinds of decisions 2 be made by a child. It’s sad that ppl would use a juvenile this way. Again, nothing against him, just unfortunate what’s on tv these days,” he wrote in response to another commenter who brought up his older comments about Jennings.

As previously reported, Dillard, who came to fame alongside his wife Jill Duggar on TLC, previously took issue with Jennings saying that gender is “ordained by God.”

“What an oxymoron… a 'reality' show which follows a non-reality. 'Transgender' is a myth. Gender is not fluid; it’s ordained by God.”

Jennings, who hasn’t directly responded to Dillard’s latest comments, said at the time:

“Every day I experience cyber-bullying, but I keep sharing my story. Today was no different.”

Dillard continued to respond to his latest statements, saying that he’s just trying to have a mature discussion about his concerns as a Christian. He also speculated as to the capability of a child to make decisions about their gender identity.

""Light hurts, blinking hurts, keeping my eye open hurts, it's hard to see.","In a dramatic Monday night on ""Dancing with the Stars,"" former Paralympian and ESPN personality Victoria Arlen dissolved in tears after learning of her elimination—just short of the show's finals.

Meanwhile, front runner Jordan Fisher and his partner Lindsay Arnold earned top scores in the semifinal despite suffering serious injuries.

Arlen, who couldn't walk for years after becoming paralyzed, impressed judges and ""DWTS"" fans with her courage in the ballroom. The former athlete performed well all season with partner Val Chmerkovskiy but was shocked when told she was going home.

At the end of the live show, Arlen, who was in the bottom two with former ""Malcolm in the Middle"" star Frankie Muniz, was teary-eyed and Chmerkovskiy whispered some kind words in her ear before host Tom Bergeron bid her goodbye.

An emotional Arlen didn't complete her press interviews backstage, and Muniz told reporters, ""She's very sad [about elimination]….To be honest, I became really close with Victoria this whole time—and before every single one of my performances, no joke, she would come up to me and give me a motivational speech. She was so supportive so it was really sad to see her go.""

""Hamilton"" star Fisher's partner Arnold injured her knee while rehearsing a pro dance and told the cameras it felt like ""my whole leg gave out."" But, wearing tape around the knee, she guided Fisher to 28 out of 30 points for an Argentine tango and then a perfect score for a jive that recreated a dance from a previous ""DWTS"" season. Judge Bruno Tonioli said it topped the original dance by Paige Van Zant and Mark Ballas in season 22.

After the first dance, Fisher told co-host Erin Andrews that he'd scratched his cornea due to ""a [finger] nail in the eye.""

""Everything hurts at this point,"" Fisher admitted backstage about his eye. ""Light hurts, blinking hurts, keeping my eye open hurts, it's hard to see. It's just one of those freak things.""

Fisher said he and Arnold were ""like a pirate—with one good leg and one good eye, still managing to make a trip to the finals. We're looking forward to getting some good rest.""

They were delighted by being top of the leader board on Monday with a total of 58, and violinist Lindsey Stirling and Ballas were second with a cumulative 57 points for their two dances.

Stirling said, ""We made it through! This competition has made me grow.""

She revealed the show had healed her heartbreak as she'd split from her boyfriend during ""DWTS.""

""Breakups are so hard and I can't imagine anything better to distract you"" than nonstop dancing, Stirling said. ""I haven't had a chance to think.""

Muniz and pro Witney Carson did a creative salsa and on a night in which the dancers picked songs for their celebrities, the sitcom star performed to ""Shake.""

Carson ripped off his leather jacket at the end so Muniz fulfilled his earlier promise to bare his chest on the floor.

""That may have lost us the mirror ball,"" he joked afterwards.

Their second dance recreated an Apolo Anton Ohno number with Julianne Hough from season 4 and they grabbed a total of 51 points for the night.

Determined Muniz said he and Carson have been rehearsing up to ten hours a day. ""I don't think anyone's been allowed to rehearse that long"" before, he said.

""Property Brothers"" star Drew Scott scored the lowest of the night, as he did last week with partner Emma Slater, but he's been a big hit with fans and made it through again.

""I’m on cloud nine right now. I'm shaking, I'm so excited,"" Scott told reporters about advancing to next week's finals. He garnered 48 out of 60 from judges for two performances.

Scott amused the crowd by doing a tango while wearing a kilt and told Fox News after the show, as a man dancing in a skirt, ""It's a first!"" for ""DWTS.""

""I felt more comfortable in that than half the outfits I've worn [so far on the show] because I'm Scottish!"" the HGTV star said.

Diana Lovejoy, 45, collapsed in court after she was found guilty of a conspiracy charge as well as attempted murder, prompting loud gasps from the courtroom.

When court reconvened around 30 minutes later Lovejoy was no longer at the defendants' table, instead she was wheeled out by paramedics and taken to a nearby hospital, FOX 5 San Diego reported.

The same jury also found gun instructor Weldon McDavid Jr., 50, guilty of attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon for his role in the plot.

Lovejoy and McDavid planned the crime after meeting at a gun range where she was taking lessons, and contacted her ex-husband Greg Mulvihill on Sept. 1, 2016 while posing as a private investigator claiming to have information on his estranged while, according to prosecutors.

The caller instructed Mulvihill at the time to go to a remote dirt road where he could pick up a package containing materials related to Lovejoy, prosecutor Jodi Breton told jurors. Mulvihill and a co-worker, Jason Kovach, drove to the area together to look for a package taped to a power pole.

Kovach testified that they saw some rustling in the bushes, then noticed what looked like a person lying down with a rifle pointed at them. The witness said shots rang out, and he and a wounded Mulvihill took off running.

Breton said Mulvihill, 45, was trying to reclaim his life after Lovejoy had made claims that he had molested their young son and sexually abused her. The couple had been separated since July 2014, and were in the final stages of completing their divorce, FOX 5 reported.

Authorities later determined the phone used to call Mulvihill was purchased by Lovejoy, and feces found in the bushes at the scene of the shooting were traced to McDavid.

McDavid's attorney, Ricky Crawford, said his client was a trained marksman and retired Marine who fired his rifle only after he heard someone yell ""I have a gun!""

""If Weldon McDavid wanted to kill someone with his skill set, he would have done so,"" Crawford told the jury. ""That was not his intent.""

Lovejoy faces 25 years to life in prison, while McDavid faces 50 years to life in prison when they are sentenced Dec. 12.

Jurors who deliberated two days before reaching their verdicts told the San Diego Union-Tribune they didn't believe McDavid’s testimony.

The booming stock market speaks for itself. President Trump has our economy rolling and now the Senate comes along with ""business as usual"" tactics to mess things up. Free-market lovers will never stand for this!

The version of tax reform legislation unveiled by Senate Republicans on Thursday is another indication that the swamp is alive and well. This is a repeat performance of the failure of Congress to get health care done.



The Senate GOP has proposed a version of the tax bill that delays the corporate tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 20 percent until 2019 – contrary to the version supported by House Republicans that would create that desperately needed economic stimulus tax rate cut in 2018.

Effectively, the Senate tax bill calls for a slightly lower top tax rate for individuals of 38.5 percent, versus the 39.6 percent in the House bill. The Senate measure also would double the estate tax exemption, but not repeal the tax, as House Republicans proposed.

The Senate version keeps the deduction for medical expenses, while the House bill eliminates it.

The duration of real estate depreciation will be reduced from 39 years to 25 years. This initiative alone will create another real estate asset bubble like the 1980s, where the rush to invest in real estate was not matched with economic demand. This in turn created a supply-side bubble – not enough tenants to fill the buildings and a subsequent mortgage default, followed by the savings and loan crisis.

The scoring of the proposed Senate tax bill shows this will cost the federal government $5.8 trillion in reduced revenue over 10 years, adding to the national debt.

The controversy surrounding the blue states state and local tax deduction is also eliminated entirely in the Senate bill. This is contrary to the deal the House put forth after bending to pressure from Republicans from New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California, who raised concerns about losing that deduction for their constituents.

Once again, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., capitulated to the needs of a few American taxpayers. Once again, the special interests win, not the American voter.

The inability of Republicans in Congress to come to a consensus on a tax bill is reflective of their “repeal and replace” fail during the healthcare bill negotiations.

The increasing pressure to deliver a bill the President Trump can sign illustrates just how purposeful Congress is at enabling gridlock. Congress fails to understand that the voter is engaged and is already mobilizing and supporting candidates for the 2018 election cycle who support the president’s agenda.

Another failure to deliver a bill that President Trump campaigned for will only result in support for Steve Bannon’s rallying cry for a war on the GOP establishment.

President Trump has done an amazing job of growing our economy. Americans were promised cuts that will stimulate economy, tax simplification (the Senate bill is seven layers high!), and equality (the bracketed differences are socialist, not free market!).

Gen. George S. Patton was one of the most fascinating military figures to dominate the last century. Quite simply, he was a genius for war.

But at 11:45 on the morning of December 9, 1945, Gen. Patton was en route to a pheasant hunt near Mannheim, Germany, when his Cadillac staff car suddenly collided with a two-and-a-half ton U.S. Army truck. Twelve days later, the four-star general -- who had triumphed against Hitler's best from North Africa to Europe -- was dead. The Army concluded it was merely a traffic accident, but others believe it was an assassination attempt.

On VE Day May 8, 1945, American GIs were ready to return home. But George Patton wanted to keep fighting. The always-outspoken general was vocal about who his new enemy was: the Russians. Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower disagreed, and so did many others in Washington.

In this episode of ""War Stories Investigates with Oliver North,"" we'll explore the rumors, myths and conspiracy theories surrounding Patton's mysterious accident and death. We will also explore the highlights of his military career with members of his family.

Last week, the 41-year-old star made news for her decision to breastfeed her 30-month-old son, which she said has led to backlash from many who believe he is too old to breastfeed. Meanwhile, Curtis has been in and out of courtrooms for several years, facing off with her ex, the city of Minneapolis and even her own mother.

With all of her personal struggles, she is quickly becoming one of Scripps Networks' most controversy-ridden stars.

But DIY Network, which is owned by Food Network and HGTV’s parent company Scripps Networks, said Curtis’ headline-making behavior isn’t impacting the show.

“‘Rehab Addict’ is currently on the air, and we are in active production for new episodes of the series,” a rep for DIY told Fox News.

However, the 8th season of her DIY show was, in fact, temporarily delayed in April 2017 because of her troubles. Curtis cited the death of her grandmother as the reason for the show’s unexpected hiatus.

Still, experts say DIY fans want to watch Curtis succeed, which will help boost the show’s mainstream presence.

“Audiences like to watch as people wade through problems and rise above them. There is a good and inspiring message in that,” said pop culture enthusiast Cate Meighan.

And Dr. John Huber, a psychologist, told Fox News Curtis’ public problems could make the home design show more intriguing.

“…If her problem cards are played well they could become a marketing goldmine,” he said. “No one has ever said living in the limelight is easy, and Nicole has her 30-month-old, her contractors and national media that she has to balance. This could be a drama worth watching!”

Curtis is engaged in a very public custody battle with the father of her 2 ½-year-old son Harper. The bitter battle has, at times, been chronicled by Curtis on Instagram, where she lamented about some of the issues she faced while sharing joint custody of Harper.

And back in 2015, her mother filed a protective order against her, which made headlines earlier this year, right around the time she was sued by the city of Minneapolis over a dispute regarding a home she purchased from the city.

But Meighan warned Curtis likely can’t keep up the drama for too long or DIY may take action.

The design network features a feud-free brand of reality TV, where the biggest drama is typically a corroded pipe or a decaying roof.

""Her problems and negative press has already disrupted things, and I believe that will only be allowed once,” Meighan speculated. “ The next action would be to pull the plug on the series all together.”

But DIY likely won’t ditch the show if the network can help it. Ratings for the show have held steady since the show first premiered in 2010.

“I just want to thank my wife for being amazing and talking me off the ledge when I was on the phone about to die and Chris Wood for holding my hair back metaphorically,” he added. “I love all of you; thank you so much. It’s been a night.”

Marquise Goodwin ran the ball 83 yards into the end zone, fell to his knees in prayer and was consoled by his teammates during the emotional celebration. The 49ers went on to defeat the Giants 31-21 to earn their first win of the season.

“Unfortunately, we lost our baby boy due to some complications, and had to prematurely deliver him early this morning around 4 a.m.,” Goodwin wrote on his Instagram after the game next to a picture of the tiny infant’s hand wrapping around a fingertip. “Although we are hurt, I am grateful for the experience and grateful that God blessed me with a wife as courageous and resilient as Morgan. The pain (physically, mentally & emotionally) that she has endured is unbelievable.

“Please pray for the Goodwin family,” he added.

Goodwin left the team’s locker room quickly after the game to return to his family, NBC Sports reported.

He also posted a video on Instagram of the touchdown and captioned it with two emojis: a prayer gesture and a boy with a halo ring over his head.

“I’m glad that we were able to get him the ball, especially on a day like today for him,” 49ers safety Eric Reid told SFGate. “I have so much respect for him, to come out here and still play, with the hurt that he had in his heart, and to ball out.”

Morgan Goodwin also posted on Instagram that she had to deliver her “precious baby boy early this morning due to pre-term labor.

“Despite our loss, my hubby kept grinding, scored his son a touchdown & got our first “W” of the season,” she added. “He had a wonderful game today. I appreciate everyone who kept us in their prayers and constantly checked in on us.

Well, there goes the fake news.

It is real news that Republicans got shellacked on Tuesday in gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey.

And it is real news that President Trump’s grip as the party’s leader loosened for the first time since he claimed the White House.

Republicans running in 2018 saw the reality of an anti-Trump wave among white suburban voters. House Republicans rely on votes from suburban areas to keep their majorities in states such as Pennsylvania, Georgia and Florida.

Republicans currently hold 23 seats in congressional districts won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 and 11 in districts she lost by fewer than 5 percentage points.

Now the urgent fear among Republicans on Capitol Hill is a 2018 landslide for Democrats as voters turn on Trump.

The anger at Trump was evident in exit polls conducted by Edison Media Research.

In Virginia, Republican Ed Gillespie won 91 percent of voters who “approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president.” Democrat Ralph Northam won 87 percent of those who disapprove.

In essence, Gillespie had all the Trump voters. But there just weren’t enough of them and Northam won easily, by 9 points.

People upset with Trump turned out in big numbers. In fact, exit polls showed one-third of the electorate wanted to send a message of opposition to Trump with their vote for governor.

Now the urgent fear among Republicans on Capitol Hill is a 2018 landslide for Democrats as voters turn on Trump.

The vote in Virginia comes on the heels of Trump’s disapproval hitting 57 percent in the latest Fox News poll.

The president’s support among white men without a college degree is down to 56 percent from the 71 percent who voted for him a year ago. He has lost support among white evangelicals, with 66 percent supporting him now instead of the 80 percent that voted for him. He has also seen his support among independents slide from 46 percent in 2016 to 30 percent today.

Trump’s support among self-identified Republicans remains high at 83 percent in the Fox poll, but fewer people overall are identifying themselves as Republicans.

That sets the stage for the battle to claim the future of the party going into the 2018 races.

On one side, you have Trump and Stephen Bannon, his former top political aide. On the other side are the Presidents Bush, both 41 and 43, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., trapped in the ring and ducking punches from both sides.

The fight comes down to a contest between Trump’s anti-immigrant, isolationist, white grievance politics and the Bush policies favoring immigration, free trade and growing the party through outreach to racial minorities.

After last week’s defeat in Virginia, Trump and Bannon quickly threw dirt on Gillespie. Trump said Gillespie did “not embrace me or what I stand for.” Bannon piled on by saying the “lesson” of the loss was that future Republican candidates must avoid campaigning with President George W. Bush and “embrace the entire Trump agenda,” to the point of taking Trump on the campaign trail.

But Gillespie, the former party chairman, did use Trump-like advertising that focused on stirring fear of immigrants by tying them to MS-13 gangs; he did defend Confederate statues; and he did attack athletes kneeling to protest police brutality.

Gillespie lost because Virginia voters rejected Trump’s politics.

The Bush team also punched back.

“This guy doesn't know what it means to be president,” the younger President Bush said of Trump in an interview for a new book.

“I don't like him,” the elder President Bush told author Mark Updegrove. “I don't know much about [Trump], but I know he's a blowhard. And I'm not too excited about him being our leader.”

The Bush comments drew a sharp rebuke from Trump’s White House

""If one presidential candidate can disassemble a political party, it speaks volumes about how strong a legacy its past two presidents really had,"" an unnamed White House official told CNN. “And that begins with the Iraq war, one of the greatest foreign policy mistakes in American history.”

The split between Bush-style establishment conservatism and Trump populism has already hurt the party with about two dozen House Republicans announcing this is a good time for them to leave.

That rush for the door comes as polls show “voters say they prefer Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives over Republicans by the widest margin in over a decade,” The Washington Post reported before Tuesday’s GOP collapse.

Ryan said last week that despite the intraparty fight, it is too late for his House caucus to do anything but side with Trump on the future of the party.

“We already made that choice,” Ryan said on Fox News Radio. “We're with Trump. We already made that choice. … That’s a choice we made during the campaign, which is we merged our agendas.”

What must Republican congressional candidates be thinking today when their Speaker tells them they are handcuffed to a president who has the lowest approval rating in 70 years? At what point do they ignore the Speaker’s directive, cut ties with the president and strike out on their own?

A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll found that just 37 percent of Americans approve of the way Trump is handling his job, while 59 percent disapprove. In the history of the poll, no American president has had a net negative rating so high in his ninth month in office since Harry Truman in 1945.

I’m living proof that you are never too old to serve others.
During World War II, I was missing in action two different times.
It also has meant turning my daughter’s house into a workshop where my family has packed thousands of shoebox gifts.
I planned to mark the day by helping my family reach their goal of packing 1,000 shoebox gifts for children in need.","I was in the senior year of high school when I enlisted in the Army and was sent to Germany to fight in World War II. For me, there wasn’t a question of whether or not I would enlist. My parents raised me to believe that it was an honor to serve my country. While the war was a painful and brutal experience, I never lost sight of the fact that I was serving my nation and the cause of freedom.

Today I am 92 years old. Though my military service ended decades ago, my commitment to service is still very much a part of my life. I’m living proof that you are never too old to serve others.

Of course the way I serve looks a lot different today than it did during the war. But my volunteering today has its roots in my experience during the war.

I have always cared about the wellbeing of kids. During the war, we would see kids in Germany living in dumpsters because they had lost both of their parents and were starving. We would give them the scraps after we got our share of food. These kids had nothing. It really had an impact on me and made me want to do things to help them. When it came to children, there were no sides and no enemies.

Following the war, when I was back home in New Jersey, my wife and I would take in kids who needed a safe place to live. I helped run a Little League baseball team in East Marion, New York. Caring for kids and making their lives better has always been a priority for me.

Years later, I started to pack shoebox gifts for Operation Christmas Child. This is a program that brings simple gifts to kids in need around the world—many of whom have never received a present in their lives. We have filled thousands of shoeboxes with school supplies, small cars, stuffed animals, and practical things like soap and toothbrushes.

But the best thing I can give to these kids through Operation Christmas Child is the gift of hope and God’s love.

During World War II, I was missing in action two different times. My bags got shipped home on both occasions. It scared my mother each time. Throughout the war, though, my faith in God’s love sustained me and earned me the nickname “the preacher.” Without the gift of hope, I don’t know that I would have survived.

And so for nearly the past two decades, I have tried to share that gift with children around the world. For me, that has meant standing outside of shoe stores to ask shoppers to give me their empty shoeboxes so that my family and I can fill them with gifts as part of Operation Christmas Child. It also has meant turning my daughter’s house into a workshop where my family has packed thousands of shoebox gifts. Even in my nineties, serving others is still an important and rewarding part of my life.

This year I celebrated my 72nd Veteran’s Day. I planned to mark the day by helping my family reach their goal of packing 1,000 shoebox gifts for children in need. If you are looking for a way to honor the service of American veterans, why not spend a few hours helping others? It doesn’t matter if you are nine or 99. After all, you’re never too old to serve.",WWII Veteran and Purple Heart recipient: You're never too old to serve,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/13/wwii-veteran-and-purple-heart-recipient-youre-never-too-old-to-serve.html

The league has faced pressure amid new outcry over the protests on social media, such as a Facebook page called “Boycott the NFL,”which boasted more than 227,000 followers and asked football fans to skip watching Sunday’s games “in solidarity with veterans around the country.""

The San Francisco 49ers' Eric Reid and Marquise Goodwin were the only members of the team seen kneeling. No other protests immediately emerged. The controversy started last year with a one-man effort by former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who said he wanted to draw attention to police mistreatment of African-Americans across the U.S.

The Atlanta Falcons said each of their players would be wearing the initials of a fallen service member on a special helmet decal.

Titans receiver Rishard Matthews walked onto the field holding hands with soldiers and stood with teammates for the anthem for the first time since President Donald Trump criticized players for protesting.

On Thursday night, all of the players with the Seattle Seahawks stood during the national anthem as part of the NFL's Salute to Service before playing the Arizona Cardinals, Q13 Fox reported.

As a massive American flag draped the field, guard Oday Aboushi, center Justin Britt, defensive linemen Dion Jordan, Frank Clark, Quinton Jefferson, Cliff Avril, Michael Bennett, Jarran Reed, Branden Jackson, Nazair Jones, Sheldon Richardson and running back Thomas Rawls all stood, according to ESPN.

The league and its players union announced Saturday there would be “no change” in league policy regarding the on-field protests.

The protests broadened across the league in September, after President Trump told an Alabama crowd that any player protesting during the anthem should be removed from the field.

The president and other critics argued that the playing of the national anthem was the wrong time for protests, regardless of the reason, because the song represents U.S. national unity and respect for those who serve in the military.

By Cleta Mitchell and Hans von Spakovsky, The Wall Street Journal



Donna Brazile has confirmed Bernie Sanders’s worst suspicions. Ms. Brazile, who served as interim chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the fall 2016 campaign, says in a new book that during the primaries, the DNC was controlled by Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Ms. Brazile claims the arrangement was “not illegal,” but that is far from clear.

Ms. Brazile reports that when she arrived on the job in July 2016, Gary Gensler, the campaign’s chief financial officer, told her the DNC was fully under the control of the campaign. In September 2015, 10 months before Mrs. Clinton’s nomination, the party had moved its bank account to the same bank in New York used by the Clinton campaign and created a joint fundraising committee, the Hillary Victory Fund, whose treasurer, bank account, and control were vested in the campaign.

Then, in an August 2015 memorandum of understanding, the DNC essentially handed over its operations to the Clinton campaign for the next 15 months.

The purpose of joint fundraising committees is to allow more than one entity to collaborate in raising money and share in the costs. Each participant is subject to federal contribution limits. When the party itself is a participant, its committee (in this case the DNC) normally handles accounting and financial controls. Not here. The Hillary Victory Fund was controlled by the Clinton campaign, with a campaign employee as treasurer and the fund’s bank account established at the Clinton campaign’s bank. According to Federal Election Commission reports, the Hillary Victory Fund has raised more than $526 million.

The DNC asserted its “neutrality” by also entering into a joint fundraising committee with the Sanders campaign. It raised a total of $1,000. And the Bernie Victory Committee treasurer was the DNC’s designee.

“Money in the battleground states usually stayed in that state,” Ms. Brazile writes, “but all the other states funneled that money directly to the DNC, which quickly transferred the money to Brooklyn”—i.e., Clinton headquarters. She says state parties raised $82 million, of which they kept less than 0.5%.","Hillary Clinton, the DNC and the Law",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/13/hillary-clinton-dnc-and-law#commenting

Brittany Langlois told Fox 25 Boston that she was bit by a fellow passenger’s dog while waiting to check in for her flight. However, she says she’s having no luck tracking down the animal’s owner after JetBlue employees scuttled the other passenger from the line — leaving Langlois uncertain of whether or not to seek treatment for rabies.

""[My doctor says] 'it's an extremely painful shot and it's a series of three, I wouldn't want you to go through that if you didn't have to,'” Langlios told Fox 25. “At the same time, I'm like, I don't wanna go through that either.”

Langlois added that when the incident first occurred last Sunday, she was in such a state of shock that she didn’t get the other passenger’s information, let alone any information on the dog or its vaccination history.

""[JetBlue customer service is] like, 'There's nothing we can do, we can cover your medical bills but that's about it,' said Langlois. She also claims the airline offered her a $50 voucher for a future JetBlue flight, though she doubts she’ll use it.

“House of Cards,” goodbye and good riddance!","The next Kevin Spacey-less season of Netflix's ""House of Cards"" will be the last. To those lamenting its end, I say good riddance.

I for one will not miss what I have come to view as one of the most anti-American phenomena in modern pop culture. With an upside-down American flag as its logo, and “Democracy Is So Overrated” as both its Facebook and Twitter themes — with 3 million likes and 2 million Twitter followers— our enemies couldn’t have designed a better way to undermine our democracy through entertainment and social media. There’s a reason that “House of Cards” is so popular in China and Russia: it paints a dark, dystopian picture of America. Is that what we really need right now?

I realize that I’m unusual. It seems everybody in Washington, D.C., watches “House of Cards.” But many in Washington came here from elsewhere, don’t stay long, and are proud of being “outsiders” in a town full of transients. I was born and raised here, and have been a lifelong resident of Our Nation’s Capital. My husband and I got married here, live and work here, raised our kids here. We don’t blackmail others, manipulate reporters, have an open marriage, make pacts to destroy colleagues’ careers, profanely insult underlings in business meetings, murder political rivals, create phony cyberattacks by foreign entities, or orchestrate fake terrorist attacks in order to stage coup d’etats. And no one else we know in Washington does, either.

“When Sergey Shoygu became Russia’s minister of defense in 2012, Russian leader Vladimir Putin gave him some interesting advice: If you want to understand America, he said, watch “House of Cards.”

The problem with “House of Cards” is it paints everyone in Washington with the same poison brush. I suspected it would bad for our brand from the start, but tuned in for the first season out of curiosity. I turned off the first episode after Frank Underwood killed a dog with his bare hands. After a year of persuading, friends talked me out of my boycott. I gritted my teeth through three more episodes, until Frank Underwood was in bed with a 20-something female reporter 30 years his junior, who was calling her dad to wish him a happy Father’s Day while the Congressman was ripping her clothes off. We have two twenty-something daughters. I was done.

Here’s how the creators themselves describe “House of Cards:” “This wicked political drama slithers beneath the curtain and through the back halls of greed, sex, love and corruption in modern Washington D.C.”

No wonder Chinese censors allowed “House of Cards” to continue its run for years — it depicts America as corrupt, sleazy, and weak. According to the New York Post, “When Sergey Shoygu became Russia’s minister of defense in 2012, Russian leader Vladimir Putin gave him some interesting advice: If you want to understand America, he said, watch “House of Cards.” In his book “All the Kremlin’s Men,” author Mikhail Zygar writes that “House of Cards” affirmed Putin’s belief “that Western politicians are all cynical scoundrels whose words about values and human rights are pure hot air and simply a tool to attack enemies.”

So much for being the beacon of democracy and freedom in the world. So much for winning the moral high ground over the twisted ideology of ISIS. Much better for Hollywood to have a wildly popular show that is “critically acclaimed” — seven Emmys and a whopping 53 Emmy nominations so far, but that’s another column for another day — and at the same time glorifies a president whose initials are “F.U.” Again, bad for the brand.

So much for being the beacon of democracy and freedom in the world. Much better for Hollywood to have a wildly popular show that is “critically acclaimed” and at the same time glorifies a president whose initials are “F.U.”

By its own account, Netflix is the world’s leading Internet television network with over 70 million members in over 190 countries watching more than 125 million hours of content a day. Maybe promoting a show that delights in bashing American democracy and trashing public service in front of that big a global audience is one reason why elected officials consistently rank below used car salesmen in public trust. It may be only one of many reasons, but “House of Cards” certainly isn’t helping to encourage good people to go into public service.

I worked for President George H.W. Bush, who said – in a quote that is engraved below his bust at the George H.W. Bush School of Public Service at Texas A&M University – “Public service is a noble calling and we need men and women of character to believe that they can make a difference in their communities, in their states and in their country.”

That’s why I went into public service, and I know a lot of other people – from both sides of the aisle – who did the same. Now that Frank Underwood is gone, maybe we’ll see more men and women of character believing they can make a difference, too. We need them.

At the time, Sosa said the cream, along with the bright TV lights, made his skin appear lighter than it is. He did not specify why he was using the cream, but it came at a time when many were linking his changing looks to steroid use.

School alumni and the public alike were quick to denounce the school’s actions, calling out Loyalsock for ""shaming women"" and “discriminating girls’ clothing” with the dress code policies.

While she refuses to be silenced, Hailey, however, is thinking bigger picture.

“I’m actually going to college in NYC for political science and women and gender studies, and I plan on being in many clubs that raise awareness for LGBTQA+ people, women, and people of all kinds,” she told Yahoo Lifestyle.

“I want to leave a message and help raise awareness for issues such as what I was dress coded for,” she added.

In the video, which was captured at around 5 p.m. on Friday evening, passengers can be seen quickly dispersing from a security checkpoint after a loud noise and smoke started emanating from a nearby passenger's bag. Security officer Ricado Perez — a 20-year army veteran — then rushes in to carry the bag to a less-populated area.

""In an abundance of caution, passengers inside the terminal were instructed to exit the building while Orlando Police and Orlando International Airport staff investigated,” the airport said.

Once searched, the noise was discovered to have been a lithium ion camera battery that had exploded and caught fire inside the camera bag, which began to smoke.

The Greater Orlando International Aviation Authority CEO Phil Brown said in a letter posted online Saturday that the passenger “immediately dropped the bag and those around them moved away from it. Emergency services arrived quickly and moved the bag farther away” from the crowds.

WESH 2 further reported that the officer who grabbed the bag was well equipped to handle the situation.

""When I picked up that bag, I did think, 'Yep, this is it,"" Perez told WESH 2. ""And so I did what I had to do. It could've happened, but it didn't. So I live to do it again.""

The TSA has also lauded Perez's actions in an Instagram post, saying that Perez put everyone else's safety ""before his own,"" and lauding him as a hero.

After the incident, thousands of people were forced to go back through the TSA lines, causing severe delays and flight cancelations.

The loud event also led to panic throughout the airport, with some believing the noise generated by the incident — along with the sound of the stanchions falling in the wake of the scared passegners — were from gunfire.

""Others hearing the luggage being dropped, stanchions falling, and rapid movement mistook the sounds as gunfire and within seconds a spontaneous evacuation of the main terminal occurred,"" Brown said in the letter.

Orlando police posted on Twitter that there was no shooting.

Brown said in the letter that emergency staff tried to restore calm “but as everyone is aware, a few trying to communicate a message to this large of a mass is a daunting task.”

After an investigation, the battery responsible for the incident was reported to have been a camera battery, which is legal aboard flights. The Federal Aviation Administration allows lithium ion batteries under 100 watt hours in carry-on luggage, which includes most consumer-sized batteries for cell phones, cameras and other personal electronic devices.

""The probability of the mass extinction occurring was only 13 percent,"" said study lead author Kunio Kaiho, a geochemist at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan.
This would involve an asteroid impact sending 385 million tons (350 million metric tons) of soot into the stratosphere.
""If the asteroid had hit a low- to medium-level hydrocarbon area on Earth, occupying approximately 87 percent of the Earth's surface, mass extinction could not have occurred,"" Kaiho told Live Science.","The age of dinosaurs met an unlikely end — because had the cosmic impact that doomed it hit just about anywhere else on the planet, the ""terrible lizards"" might still roam the Earth, a new study finds.

The impact of an asteroid about 6 miles (10 kilometers) wide about 66 million years ago created a crater more than 110 miles (180 km) across near what is now the town of Chicxulub (CHEEK-sheh-loob) in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. The meteor strike would have released as much energy as 100 trillion tons of TNT, more than a billion times more than the atom bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. The blast is thought to have ended the age of dinosaurs, killing off more than 75 percent of all land and sea animals.

Prior work suggested the Chicxulub impact would have lofted huge amounts of ash, soot and dust into the atmosphere, choking off the amount of sunlight reaching Earth's surface by as much as 80 percent. This would have caused Earth's surface to rapidly cool, leading to a so-called ""impact winter"" that would have killed off plants, causing a global collapse of terrestrial and marine food webs. [Wipe Out: History's 7 Most Mysterious Extinctions]

To explain why the Chicxulub impact winter proved so catastrophic, Japanese scientists previously suggested the superhot debris from the meteor strike not only caused wildfires across the planet, but also ignited rocks loaded with hydrocarbon molecules such as oil. They calculated that such oily rocks would have generated vast amounts of soot.

The amount of hydrocarbons in rocks varies widely depending on location. In the new study, the Japanese researchers analyzed the places on Earth where an asteroid impact could have happened to cause the level of devastation seen with the Chicxulub event.

The scientists now find the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurshappened to hit an unlucky spot — had it landed in about 87 percent of anywhere else on Earth, the mass extinction might not have occurred.

""The probability of the mass extinction occurring was only 13 percent,"" said study lead author Kunio Kaiho, a geochemist at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan.

The scientists ran computer models simulating the amount of soot that asteroid impacts would have generated depending on the amount of hydrocarbons in the ground. They next estimated the climate effects caused by these different impact scenarios.

The researchers calculated the level of climate change needed to cause a mass extinction was a 14.4 to 18 degrees Fahrenheit (8 to 10 degrees Celsius) drop in global average surface air temperatures. This would involve an asteroid impact sending 385 million tons (350 million metric tons) of soot into the stratosphere.

The scientists found that a mass extinction would have occurred from the impact only if it had hit 13 percent of the surface of the Earth, including both land and oceans. ""If the asteroid had hit a low- to medium-level hydrocarbon area on Earth, occupying approximately 87 percent of the Earth's surface, mass extinction could not have occurred,"" Kaiho told Live Science.

The scientists are also analyzing the level of climate change ""caused by large volcanic eruptions that may have contributed to other mass extinctions,"" Kaiho said. ""It is hoped that the results will lead to further understanding of the processes behind those mass extinctions.""

Kaiho and his colleague Naga Oshima at the Meteorological Research Institute in Tsukuba, Japan, detailed their findings online today (Nov. 9) in the journal Scientific Reports.

Tampa Police said they're investigating a suspicious death in the Seminole Heights neighborhood, where residents have been in fear since mid-October when three people were fatally shot within a 10-day period.

Officers have saturated the area, and are going door-to-door searching for a suspect and any potential witnesses, FOX13 Tampa reported.

""Police officers are all over the place,"" Tampa police spokesman Steve Hegarty said. ""We hope to catch him before he gets outside the area.""

Police received a report of shots fired around 4:51 a.m., and responded within a minute to find the body of 60-year-old Ronald Felton in the street, interim Police Chief Brian Dugan said at a news conference.



Felton was crossing the street at the time to meet someone when a gunman came up from behind him and shot him, according to Dugan.

The suspect is described as a black male, with a thin build, dressed in all black and wearing a baseball cap, police said.

It is unknown what type of weapon was used in the shooting early Tuesday. The shooting has caused a main road to be shut down as part of the investigation.

""Right now, we are treating it as related until we can rule otherwise,"" he said, referring to the other killings. Dugan said he believes the killer lives in the neighborhood and asked for ""everyone to pay attention.""

""We need to catch this killer before we have to notify one more family that one of their loved ones is dead."" - Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn

Felton was shot to death outside of the church where he volunteers at a food kitchen, according to FOX 13.

Dugan said the shooting was similar to the other killings, but because this killing happened early in the morning as opposed to late at night, he believes the suspect is hiding out in the area.

""Because the time has changed, how were they able to get here at this hour? How were they able to vanish so quickly? You have to believe they are hiding out somewhere,"" he told reporters.

The interim police chief also once again asked residents to look through the area and report any suspicious activity to authorities.

""If you own a firearm of any kind, we need you to verify that it's where it's supposed to be,"" he said. ""If it's not, call us.""

Schools in the neighborhood are open, but Hillsborough County district officials are telling students in the search perimeter to stay home.

""Do not go to bus stops or leave to walk or drive to school until police secure the area,"" school officials posted to Twitter.

Steve Zinder, the incoming neighborhood association president, told FOX13 he was awakened by the sound of police helicopters. He said in the last month, the neighborhood adjusted to having the helicopters hovering above them, but this morning it was different.

""They were much lower, much more concentrated, so I knew something was going on,"" he said. ""This is not the kind of news we wanted to wake up to this morning.""

Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn said officials believe the suspect ""lives in close proximity"" to the killing, and officials need residents to ""think about what they heard last night.

""This is personal. This has got to stop,"" he told reporters, adding ""We need to catch this killer before we have to notify one more family that one of their loved ones is dead.""

The killings in Seminole Heights last month led the department to increase police patrols in the neighborhood. All of the victims were alone, and had gotten off a bus before they were killed.

Last month, Buckhorn told officers at a briefing to hunt down the killer and ""bring his head to me.""

""We're going to hunt this son of a b---- down until we catch him, and it's gonna be you guys, it's gonna be great police work doing what you guys do every day,"" Buckhorn told officers before they headed out to patrol the neighborhood in late October.

Police have released surveillance videos of a hooded suspect from near the scene of the killings. In a security video taken moments after Benjamin Mitchell became the first victim on Oct. 9, the suspect was spotted running from the scene.

Two days after Mitchell, 22, was shot, Monica Hoffa, 32, was also gunned down. On Oct. 19, Anthony Naiboa, 20, was shot after taking the wrong bus home from his new job. Police patrolling nearby heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene to find Naiboa dead.

Dugan said police are still looking for the a person seen on surveillance video walking through the neighborhood after one of the killings.

Police released surveillance video last week from Oct. 9 of a man seen walking in the area when the first victim, Benjamin Mitchell, 22, was shot to death.

""We're now calling person who is seen running after Benjamin Mitchell's murder a 'person of interest,'"" he said at a news conference Thursday as officials released new video of the person running away from the area.

In the video, the person is seen walking and flipping a cell phone in their hands before running in the opposite direction around the time Mitchell was shot dead.

""If that were me in that video, I have to believe that my neighbors would be able to identify me,"" he said.

The second killing took place on Oct. 13, when Monica Caridad Hoffa, 32, was found dead in a vacant lot of a gunshot wound.

A week ago, officers were patrolling the area when they heard gunshots and found Anthony Taino Naiboa dead on the sidewalk, about 100 yards from where one of the other victims was killed.

Officials are offering a $25,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest.

That's when, according to Jaleen, his wife Wanda brought him home Nemo, a Bichon Frise puppy.
To James, Nemo was another one of his kids.
After two years, the family decided Nemo needed company, so they brought home Lucy, another Bichon.
The Xuereb family had to make the difficult decision to put down their 13-year-old companion to stop his suffering.","Few things can mend a broken heart or a troubled mind.

But for James Xuereb the answer seems to always be the same: a loving dog.

A video of James receiving a Bichon Frise as an early birthday gift has gone viral and touched the hearts of many.

In the video, you see his daughter Jaleen handing him a card as he sits unwittingly on the couch.

The photo on the card is almost a dead giveaway -- a photo of a Bichon. But what's written inside and the story behind it brings the 52-year-old man to a heartfelt cry.

It read: ""Hi, my name is Lumo and I am a boy Bichon. No, I am not Nemo, nor could I ever be Lucy, but my mommy brought me to bring you some happiness back into your life. So, as we walk in this journey of life together, may we create our own wonderful memories and reclaim the beautiful memories that you had with Nemo and Lucy. Love, Lumo.""

What elicited such a strong emotion?

More than 13 years ago, James was going through a state of depression. Nothing would cheer him up. That's when, according to Jaleen, his wife Wanda brought him home Nemo, a Bichon Frise puppy. James instantly fell in love.

""He had an attachment to him. He leaned on him for anything and everything,"" says Jaleen of their relationship.

To James, Nemo was another one of his kids. His best friend.

After two years, the family decided Nemo needed company, so they brought home Lucy, another Bichon.

Both dogs, as is common with small breeds, suffered from a congenital heart defect.

Sadly, in late August, Lucy, 11, suffered a cardiac arrest that took her life. Two weeks later, things went from bad to worse.

Nemo's health was deteriorating. His lungs were filled with liquid and he had a hard time breathing. The Xuereb family had to make the difficult decision to put down their 13-year-old companion to stop his suffering.

""My dad was on edge,"" Jaleen recalls. ""He didn't want to talk about [Lucy and Nemo]. He would leave the room if we did. Or he would start crying.""

Meantime, the family put up photos and contemplated ways to make Xuereb feel better.

So Wanda decided it may be time for a new dog. She researched breeders, and found Fern Klapman-Flett's Bichon Lovers in Simcoe, Ontario.

In October, Wanda, and her daughters Jaleen and Jade, went to the breeder to meet a new litter.

""We went back in November to make our pick,"" Jaleen said. ""When we walked through the door, one came up to us and kept pulling on my mom's pants.""

It was number 25, and he kept coming to them and tugging at them.

""That's how we knew.""

Next came the card, the heartfelt cry, and tiny Lumo.

Lumo's name is a testament to the family's fallen -- L-U for Lucy, M-O for Nemo -- the two whose deaths were too much to bear.

But thanks to Lumo, James can finally talk about Lucy and Nemo and smile.

Terrafugia, based in Boston, Massachusetts, became one of the first firms in the flying car space when it was founded in 2006 by a group of engineers at MIT.

Geely says it’s investing in Terrafugia to make flying cars a reality. It’s also hiring some big guns. A former managing director at Bell Helicopter, Chris Jaran, has been appointed CEO of Terrafugia. And in anticipation of the deal, Terrafugia has tripled the size of its engineering team over the past quarter.

Meanwhile, Terrafugia founder Carl Dietrich is staying on as the company’s chief technology officer.

The company’s first product will be the Transition, which is promised for a market launch in 2019. It features a 2-seat cabin and a foldable wing. The latter enables it to easily fit in a standard car lane, and unfolding the wings can be achieved in under a minute.

MORE AUTO NEWS FROM MOTOR AUTHORITY

The Transition is promised to deliver a 400-mile flying range and a top flight speed of 100 mph. While it still requires a runway for takeoff and landing, Terrafugia has a more advanced design known as the Transition TF-X that promises vertical takeoff and landing and even better performance. This model is promised for a market launch in 2023.

Terrafugia is currently accepting $10,000 reservations for the Transition and expects the final price to come in at $279,000.

Geely isn’t even the first automaker to be associated with flying cars. Toyota already has a skunk works team working on a flying car.

But not just any candidate will do. To join the staff of seven at Eagle Plains Hotel & Service Station applicants must be ""quite quick"" and they ""better like isolation,"" owner Stan McNevin tells CBC News.

But the job calls for far more than serving up beer to truck drivers and a motley mix of characters who find themselves in the Yukon hundreds of miles from the nearest town, in a joint that has been compared to the Overlook Hotel in ""The Shining.""

The new hire will serve on the 32-room establishment's ""frontline,"" must be OK with working alone at night amid taxidermied bear and caribou—and a ghost named Albert Johnson.

When ""weird and strange things"" happen, ""we all just blame it on Albert,"" whose presence was ""definitely"" confirmed by a clairvoyant, McNevin adds. A high tolerance for people, or no people, is also recommended.

While the Eagle Plains Hotel is hopping during the summer and winter, it can be deserted for long stretches when the rivers freeze and thaw in spring and fall.

And if a blizzard strikes, guests can be stranded for days. One such storm failed to shut down a curling tournament: ""We built snow caves for the people so they could be outside and watch,"" says McNevin, ""and so then of course, the bartender would have to go out and serve hot drinks and hot toddies.""

The Ohio State University has accused 83 of its students of cheating by using the GroupMe app to work on classwork together.

SNAPCHAT IS GETTING A NEW LOOK BECAUSE IT'S 'TOO HARD TO USE'

Ohio State University said the students abused the code of conduct, citing “unauthorized collaboration on graded assignments.”

“Students charged with academic misconduct violations may accept responsibility for the charges or request a hearing...” Ohio State University spokesman Benjamin Johnson said in a statement obtained by news outlet WCHMH. “If found in violation, students receive sanctions based on the nature and severity of the violation in accordance with university standards and protocols.”

The app, which lets users send chats to large groups of people simultaneously, is permitted to be used by the school's rules, but is subject to the same scrutiny as any other form of communication. GroupMe is not among the top 50 apps in the App Store or Google Play, but it is ranked 14th among social networking apps in the App Store.

Fox News 8 in Cleveland noted that the investigation began after a professor in the university's business school reported the allegations this past April.

The names of the students have not been released. Potential penalties range from warnings to expulsion.

Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple.
On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.
President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.
Tax reform is not about numbers.","Mothers have enough to worry about without being thrown into the ever-present Mommy Wars – those endless debates about whether being a stay-at-home mother is harder than being a mom who works outside of the home. Let us all agree that parenting is both rewarding and incredibly difficult.

While moms may spend more time discussing potty training or social media and phone privileges, the family tax bill is an ever-present issue due to its direct impact on the family budget. Why? Because kids are so darn expensive.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that it will cost about $234,000 in 2015 dollars to raise a child until he or she is 17 years old. That is not even including college. Child care costs are big-ticket items on this list.

Care.com, with New America, found the national average for the annual cost of child care is 31 percent of the median household income. The average cost of day care in the country is just under $200 per week per child. Hiring an after-school sitter for about 15 hours a week averages $214 per week. Employing a nanny is about $556 per week. This is the average – if you live in New York, California or Washington, D.C., you’ll likely pay more.

These are the kinds of costs that make families think twice about having more children – or any children at all. Mothers (and fathers) stay up at night worrying about the quality of care their children receive while they work to keep food on the table. And low-income and middle-class families are hit the hardest.

About three-quarters of all Americans believe it is better for families to have one parent home with children and just over 40 percent of American families strive to make that happen, either with a parent or close relative taking care of their young children. The word “strive” paints an accurate picture of the 10.4 million stay-at-home moms, because despite pervasive stereotypes, the majority of them are not wealthy women.

This is not about government coming to the rescue, but rather families keeping more of their hard-earned dollars. Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple. Abraham Lincoln stated: “The strength of a nation lies in the homes of its people.”

A pro-family tax structure encourages families to grow and allows parents the choice of staying at home to care for their children or getting a paying job. This freedom helps families build safe and secure homes, which in turn benefits the country as a whole.

On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.

Child care subsidies can help with the expensive costs of day care and the like. But their benefits are limited to a small subset of the families that use those facilities, and not families that have a parent who stays home or families that are able to rely on other family members for full- or part-time child care.

Both political parties should be commended for wanting to meaningfully work on the federal level to help enable families choose the best option for quality care for their children, while working towards prosperity and a better life. But the solution cannot be more money thrown at problems that instead need thoughtful and creative ideas to benefit as many Americans as possible.

By increasing the child tax credit – now up to $1,000 annually for each child 16 and under – to a maximum of $2,500 a year per child, hardworking lower-income and middle-class parents will get the relief they need, putting more of their own money directly into their pockets.

This money will not just be available for child care but also for food, shelter and educational options like supplemental tutoring or sports programs. This ultimately has a multiplied impact – helping more families and allowing parents more choices, while encouraging economic equality.

President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Both would like to ensure that this reform is pro-family, because they understand that tax relief for families is an investment in America’s future.

As a mother who has both stayed at home and worked part-time or full-time, it is obvious that the more choices we have to provide for our families the better. Sadly, some moms do not have the opportunity to choose.

Congress should seize this historic opportunity to truly reform the tax system and make it pro-family. As part of that effort, forgotten families with children should be allowed to keep more of their own paychecks. This is an opportunity to make a life-changing difference in the lives of American families that are working hard every day to make ends meet.

Families are the crucial social institution tasked with safety and security and the inculcation of skills and values that create healthy, productive citizens necessary for the future of a thriving nation.

Who’s afraid of the Clintons? Not Donna Brazile.

The explosive book by the former head of the Democratic National Committee is rocking the political world with its tales of Hillary Clinton’s brazen corruption and tawdry deceits. To add extra punch to her insider’s account, Brazile is telling interviewers that Clinton’s 2016 campaign was “sterile” and a “cult,” and mocking it as sexless and joyless.

She even writes that she considered trying to replace Clinton as the nominee over health concerns after the candidate collapsed at the 9/11 anniversary ceremony, a fact that demolishes the myth that suspicions about Clinton’s condition were the sole province of conservative partisans.

To say the Clinton camp is furious at what they regard as betrayal doesn’t do justice to their outrage. They are attacking Brazile personally, accusing her of telling outright lies just to sell books.

Centre County District Attorney Stacy Parks Miller charged 12 additional men in the case, bringing the total number of former Beta Theta Pi brothers and pledges being charged to 17 in total.

Timothy Piazza, 19, of Lebanon, N.J., fell down a set of stairs and suffered fatal injuries on Feb. 9 after prosecutors said pledges were forced to down a dangerous amount of alcohol and were then made to run a “gauntlet” of booze-drinking stations.

The charges come from surveillance video that allegedly showed various members of the fraternity giving Piazza 18 alcoholic beverages in the span of 1 hour and 22 minutes, Parks Miller said.

The video was deleted after fraternity members were made aware that an investigation into Piazza’s death was under way, and police planned to obtain the footage.

The basement video captured the ongoing hazing that occurred on bid acceptance night, and the continued repeated furnishing of alcohol by Beta brothers to Piazza, as well as the other pledges, throughout the evening.

""In fact, on video, Tim Piazza does not obtain his own alcohol at any point-rather, every drink consumed was provided to him by a fraternity brother,"" her office said in a news release.

""Hazing needs to stop, there's just no place for it."" - Jim Piazza, father of former Penn State Student Timothy Piazza

Parks Miller said FBI agents were able to restore the surveillance video from the deleted hard drive in the basement of the house.

""People had asked us before, why would somebody had delete that video if they did delete it? That's what we wanted to know,"" she said. ""Well now we know, because it contained criminal conduct.”

PROSECUTORS REFILE CHARGES AGAINST 11 IN PENN STATE FRAT HAZING DEATH

Last month, prosecutors announced they moved to reinstate most of the dismissed charges against 11 members of the now-defunct Penn State fraternity for actions related to the hazing death of the sophomore pledge earlier this year.

Parks Miller announced the refiling of criminal charges, including involuntary manslaughter and felony aggravated assault, after District Justice Allen Sinclair threw out the felony charges in September against eight Beta Thea Pi fraternity members, her office said in a press release.

The judge let stand lesser charges against them and six others, but dismissed other charges altogether against four of the members of the fraternity. As a result, those defendants again face the possibility of several years in prison, if convicted.

Security video of the incident recorded Piazza appearing intoxicated and being led to a couch after 11 p.m. A few minutes later, he fell head-first down a set of basement stairs and had to be carried back up in an unconscious state.

For several hours, members of the fraternity appeared to tend to their injured friend, pouring liquid on him and strapping on a loaded backpack to prevent him from rolling over and choking on vomit. He died two days later on Feb. 4 at a local hospital.



""Hazing needs to stop, there's just no place for it,"" Timothy Piazza's father Jim said at a news conference.

Penn State said last week it punished seven students in connection with Piazza's death who were found to be in violation of the university's student code of conduct.

Penalties ranged from probation to expulsion, the school said, but it did not give a breakdown, citing student privacy.

Violations included ""hazing"" and ""creating a condition that endangers,"" the school said. It did not identify the students.

Another 19 students withdrew before completing the disciplinary process and must complete it before returning to Penn State, the school said. Six students participated in the process and were not charged with any violations.

Prosecutors on Monday charged with Ryan Liam Burke, Bo Han Sang, Joshua Robert Kurczewski, Aiden O’Brien and Jonathan Kanzler with felony aggravated assault and misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter for their alleged roles in the events that led to Piazza’s death in February. The five were also also charged with misdemeanor simple assault, misdemeanor recklessly endangering another person, misdemeanor hazing and misdemeanor furnishing liquor to a minor, according to the DA.

In addition to the five, Joseph Ems, Brian Gelb, Patrick Jackson, Reggie Goeke, Donald Prior and Mike Fernandez were charged with misdemeanor hazing and misdemeanor furnishing alcohol to minors.

Prosecutors also filed charges against Braxton Becker with tampering with evidence, obstructing administration of the law and hindering apprehension for allegedly trying to destroy the recording.

“The label of mental illness is meaningless,” he said.
Because of the stigma (of mental illness), we stereotype them.”Dvoskin said in some cases, mental illness might make would-be soldiers “tougher and better” as the result.
But some say accepting recruits with mental health conditions – specifically cutting - puts others at risk, especially in high-pressure situations in the field.
The Army says the burden of proof will be on the applicant to provide a case why a waiver should be considered.","Facing low recruitment levels, the U.S. Army quietly lifted its ban on allowing people with a history of mental illness, self-mutilation and drug abuse to serve in the military – despite warnings from the industry about the risks involved.

The new rules green-light recruits who have bipolar disorder, depression and issues with cutting – a process in which a person takes a knife or razor to his or her own skin – along with those who bite, hit or bruise themselves intentionally.

“I am shocked,” Craig Bryan, executive director of the National Center for Veterans Studies at The University of Utah, told Fox News. “This contradicts everything we have been working toward for the past 10-to-15 years.”

“This contradicts everything we have been working toward for the past 10-to-15 years.” - Craig Bryan, National Center for Veterans Studies

Bryan says there is strong evidence to indicate self-injury is a “stepping stone to suicide” and is “the single strongest predictor of suicidal behavior.”

The Army signed off on the new policy in August but never announced it, according to USA Today, which first reported the news.

The decision to lift restrictions comes as the military looks like it will miss its goal of recruiting 80,000 new soldiers through September 2018.

In order to hit last year’s goal of 69,000 recruits, the Army also accepted men and women who did poorly on aptitude tests, increased the number of waivers for pot use and offered hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses.

In fiscal year 2017, it paid out $424 million in bonuses, up from $284 million in 2016. In 2014, that figure was $8.2 million. According to USA Today, some of the recruits qualified for bonuses of $40,000.

When it comes to mental health, recruits who would have previously been barred can submit waivers allowing them to sign up.

The change reverses an eight-year ban on the wavers following a spike of suicides.

The move is especially troubling following the Texas church massacre a week ago, in which 26 people were killed and another 20 injured when Devin Patrick Kelley, a veteran with a history of psychiatric problems, opened fire inside the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs.

Following the deadly episode, it was revealed that Kelley made death threats against his superiors and escaped from a mental hospital during his stint in the Air Force.

Army spokesman Lt. Col. Randy Taylor says the waiver expansion was possible because the government has more access to applicants’ medical records.

“These records allow Army officials to better document applicant medical histories,” he said – but adds that the “waivers are not considered lightly.”

The change in waiver procedures, which means requests can be reviewed and approved by the U.S. Army Recruiting Command, or in the case of the National Guard, by the State Adjutant General, has been ""widely misinterpreted,"" according to Army Deputy Cheif of Staff Lt. Gen. Thomas C. Seamands.

""It's also important to note that the conditions themselves have been unfairly characterized,"" he added. ""For example, a child who received behavioral counseling at age 10 would be forever banned from military service were it not for the ability to make a waiver request.

""We're not prepared to close the door on such individuals who are otherwise medically, mentally and physically qualified for military service,"" Seamands said. ""We think this is the right thing for our Army, and the selfless young men and women who wish to serve.""

Dr. Joel Dvoskin, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor in the University of Arizona's Department of Psychiatry, told Fox News he believes lifting the ban is a step in the right direction.

“The label of mental illness is meaningless,” he said. “There are a ton of people who have a history of something – some kind of emotional trouble – and they are fine. There is no reason in the world they couldn’t serve in the military.”

He added, “Stereotypes are pretty evil all the way around. Because of the stigma (of mental illness), we stereotype them.”

Dvoskin said in some cases, mental illness might make would-be soldiers “tougher and better” as the result.

But some say accepting recruits with mental health conditions – specifically cutting - puts others at risk, especially in high-pressure situations in the field.

“Is it a red flag,” Elspeth Ritchie, a psychiatrist who retired from the Army in 2010, said. “The question is, how much of a red flag is it?”

According to the Army, recruits with a history of self-mutilation must provide documentation that includes a detailed statement from the applicant, medical records, photos submitted by the recruiter and a psych evaluation.

The Army says the burden of proof will be on the applicant to provide a case why a waiver should be considered.","Army lifts ban on cutters, mentally ill and drug abusers to meet recruiting goals",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/14/army-lifts-ban-on-cutters-mentally-ill-and-drug-abusers-to-meet-recruiting-goals.html

My slipping sense of control produces so much anxiety in my life so I end up grasping for even more control. I don’t know what else to do but I’m afraid to surrender. Really afraid.”

That was a very real and honest fear shared with me recently by another mom who is watching her eldest child navigate his teen years and is worried sick about his choices and the outcomes.

As I wrote about my own struggle with “controlling my kids” in my book “Mom Set Free,” I often wondered if surrender came easier to other moms. I wondered if I was mostly alone in my struggle to unclench my fists that were trying to control outcomes and parent more open-handed to God’s plans.

But based on an Instagram comment feed I scrolled through just last week, I know I am not alone. In fact, control seems to be something most moms struggle with.

Here are just six out of 132 comments shared by brave women and their struggle to surrender:

“I don’t even know what motherhood looks like without being worried, anxious and a total control freak!”

“My biggest fear is MY anxiety becoming THEIR anxiety.”

“I thought I’d moved past control issues once my kids got to school, but now they’re teens and it’s a real struggle to step back and give them their wings.”

“I’m such a control freak and it’s been a challenge not being able to control a single thing with my 5-week-old. Being on her schedule at all times has been the biggest struggle for me.”

“Mom guilt is real and life is crazy! Extra hard when you're a control freak.”

“I am anxious and worried way too often and want everything to be in perfect order. I need to be set free from those unhealthy mindsets!”

I can’t help but wonder if you can relate to any of these comments, because even if you wouldn’t describe yourself as a “control freak” you still might struggle with surrendering your kids to their sovereign Father.

I think part of our struggle is rooted in a misunderstanding of what surrender actually is.

One way we might think of surrender is this: “I give up. There is nothing I can do or say that is going to make a difference here. I’ve tried everything and nothing helps. My influence in my kid’s lives is useless and exhausted. I’m done trying. I surrender.”

But if we look to Jesus we find an entirely different lens through which to view surrender.

In the Gospel of Mark, chapter 14, we find that Jesus is “overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death” (v. 34 NIV). Jesus knew that the fulfillment of his mission was imminent. He would soon take on the sin of the world and bear the wrath and shame for the entire human race. Jesus was “deeply distressed and troubled” when he prayed: “Abba Father, everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will” (v. 36 NIV).

This simple but profound prayer shows us what surrender really is. Surrender is acknowledging God’s power, submitting to his will, and trusting in his goodness.

When we find ourselves grasping for control over our kid’s lives, or our own circumstances, we can pray like Jesus prayed to his Father: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

The above prayer, which my pastor Drew Williams shared at church many years ago, has expanded my heart and opened my hands to God’s perfect will in times when I have come to him very fearful and close-fisted.

This can be our prayer of surrender when:

Our hearts are aching and our fears are raging over the choices our kids are making.

We crash into the reality that our kids unique needs will seriously mess with our perfect plans.

We have so much anxiety over our role as moms that we witness our anxiety spilling over into our homes and onto our kids, who then take on our anxiety.

We feel helpless and hopeless.

This is a prayer that we probably need to pray over and over and over again, each and every day: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

Prayer is not only the antidote to finding peace amidst all of the anxiety-inducing pressure, but it is our most powerful weapon against the enemy who, like it or not, is working against us. He “prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:8 NIV).

I don’t say this to scare us. I say this to encourage us to get on our knees in surrender and fight for our kids in prayer.

Our prayers for our children (and with our children) are unimaginably significant. Through prayer, we get to partner with God in the work he is doing in the lives of our kids, all the while remembering that: “It won’t be long before this generous God who has great plans for us in Christ – eternal and glorious plans they are! – will have you put together and on your feet for good. He gets the last word; yes, He does!” (1 Peter 5:11 MSG).

In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ. And not just temporal plans, but eternal plans. And he gets the last word.

We can rest in his sovereignty and surrender to his will, just as we saw Jesus surrendering to his Father’s will in his prayer at Gethsemane. Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.

Surrender isn’t giving up. It’s giving over every one of our fears and worries and problems and weaknesses to God. And in turn, receiving his peace as we partner with him, rather than trying to be him in our kid’s lives.

We have a profound role to play in our kid’s lives, by establishing healthy boundaries and enforcing consistent consequences, wrapped in unconditional love. But as we do that, we have to remember that we are not the originator and orchestrator of our kid’s lives.

Our role is to seek and surrender to “The Great Originator and Orchestrator” and trust him to be – and to do – everything we can’t. He’s good at that, you know. He’s good at being God. So let’s let him. And in doing so, we are enabled to release the anxiety and reclaim the adventure that we’ve lost in the quest to play his role.

God can be trusted with the kids he has entrusted to us.",God’s given us our children. Let’s trust Him and let go of our anxiety,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/29/god-s-given-us-our-children-let-s-trust-him-and-let-go-our-anxiety.html

prev

It’s easy to overlook a mirror. After all, when we look at one, we see a reflection of so many other things before we even see the mirror itself. But a good mirror is an essential component to many rooms, especially your bathroom. There are many options for size, style and shape to choose from, so I’ve put together this guide to help you put things into perspective and get your bathroom mirror just right.

Sizing Your Mirror

When choosing the size of your mirror, you should consider not just function, but also proportion. To create a balanced look, think about the size of your mirror relative to that of your vanity.

Typically, vanity mirrors are not wider than the vanity itself, with some exceptions we will discuss a little later.

A common approach is to make the mirror exactly as wide as the vanity so the two line up perfectly.

Of course, this is much easier with a custom-sized mirror because you may not happen to find a pre-made mirror in the exact width of your vanity.

If they are not the same width, another solid approach is to make the mirror about 70 to 80 percent as wide as the vanity so the mirror appears a bit smaller, but not shrunken.

With respect to height, a functional mirror needs only to reach about a foot above and below the eye line of the people who will be using it. But the more height you can get, the better, because it will provide more viewing angles and a more open look to the space. Try to reach at least 4 to 7 feet above the floor.

Single vs. Multiple

If you have a wide vanity, especially one with multiple sinks, you have the option of using multiple mirrors or one single mirror wide enough to service both.

Using several tall and skinny mirrors can give a room a more vertical look, emphasizing the height of the space (especially effective when you have high ceilings). Of course, using a single large mirror opens up the room by reflecting more of the opposite walls. Ultimately the choice comes down to personal preference.

Using multiple mirrors can still work even when there is only one sink.

In fact, centering a mirror on the sink and then adding a second mirror symmetrical to the first can make the whole composition look more pleasingly balanced, compared with using just a single mirror.

Sconces

Another reason to use smaller mirrors is, of course, to allow some room for sconces to sit in between. Vanity light can be located in various places, but placing it to the sides of the mirror lights the face well, so it is both beautiful and functional.

When leaving room for sconces, choose a mirror that is closer to 60 to 70 percent of the width of the vanity (divided by the number of mirrors if you have more than one), so the sconces have room to sit above the vanity rather than hanging beyond the edges.

Wall-to-Wall Mirrors

For a different approach to sizing your mirror, you can ignore the size of the vanity on its own and instead use the mirror to fill the whole wall, often running above the toilet as well. This approach gives you a larger mirror, which can go a long way toward making a compact bathroom feel twice the size.

In this case, you can run the mirror literally wall-to-wall (and typically up to the ceiling) or extend it from one end of the vanity to the end of a nearby fixture.

In the latter case, though, it should still fill most of the wall to avoid looking like it’s simply the wrong size. And it should line up neatly with the objects below.

On one hand, having a custom-sized mirror cut to fit perfectly wall-to-wall is a higher investment than purchasing a prefab piece.

On the other hand, compared with running tile or stone behind or around a smaller mirror, it is often a relatively budget-friendly choice.

Depending on your budget and goals, it may make a lot of sense to use a custom-fitted mirror paired with a little splash of a splurge material below.

Framed vs. Frameless

Frameless mirrors are a popular choice in bathrooms for a few likely reasons. One is that they tend to be less expensive while often still quite stylish. A second is that they give modern appeal, and bathrooms even in somewhat traditional homes often run a bit more modern to achieve a clean, airy, “spa-like” look.

Frameless mirrors work most easily in contemporary or modern and minimalist spaces without a lot of busy decor. Mirrors with elaborate frames tend to suit traditional spaces where the other elements are also very detailed and decorative.

For a nice balance that can suit nearly any space, try a mirror with a simple frame that is a few inches wide and in a textural material that isn’t too busy.

For an eclectic sensibility, an ornate mirror can look magnificent as a statement piece in a modern bathroom.

Getting the mix just right will take a good design eye, but the unique result will bring a lot of personality and drama to the room.

Inset Mirrors

A clever way to get the modern look of a frameless mirror and the sense of polish of a framed mirror is to inset the mirror into tile so it’s essentially framed by the surrounding material.

Layering floating shelves over the top gives extra additional modern flair and some useful storage.

Round Mirrors

We’ve mostly looked at simple rectangular mirrors so far, but of course there are many other shapes.

Round mirrors can be a great way to bring some softness and relaxed appeal to a bathroom, which often has a lot of hard surfaces and crisp lines.

Round mirrors are a great companion to pedestal sinks, as they often have curved lines themselves.

Round mirrors generally leave more negative space at the “corners” than a rectangular mirror would, which makes sense because pedestal sinks leave some negative space around the pedestal base.

A round mirror is also a great choice if you have an interesting wall finish to show off. It gives you enough mirror to see your face, but it leaves a bit more wall exposed, and the curved lines will pick up the organic shapes in a leafy or floral print.

Medicine Cabinets

Sure, all of the previous mirrors were attractive, but what if you need some serious storage space?

Medicine cabinet mirrors are best when inset into the wall — that way they won’t be so in-your-face. A professional can guide you during a site visit as to whether your wall cavity can house some inset or partially inset cabinets.

Otherwise, try using a few tricks to avoid letting that cabinet visually shrink the room.

A cabinet with little or no frame will avoid feeling in-your-face, while adding some under-cabinet lighting (just as you might in a kitchen) will bring a glow that cancels out any dark shadows and makes the whole sink area feel more open.

Suspended Mirrors

If you have an unusual bathroom layout or an inconveniently placed window or obstacle, don’t forget that mirrors don’t absolutely have to hang flat on a wall.

Suspending a mirror from the ceiling or a window frame, or mounting it on rails rising from the counter, can allow you to place a mirror in a new, functional spot.

Four steps to take when deciding if you should let someone who betrayed you back into your life.

FOX's Ashley Papa has more:

Betrayal by a loved one is one of the most painful experiences. If you're thinking of letting someone who betrayed you back into your life, counselor, David Essel says first you must forgive:

""If you don't do this you're going to mistrust them, you're going to look for problems when maybe there aren't any, the other big problem you run into is that if this relationship doesn't work out and you want to move on and you haven't forgiven them you're going to put the next person you date on the cross.""

Step two is to own your role in the dysfunction of the relationship. The third step is to have the betrayer write you an apology letter:

""So in other words if someone says i'm so sorry for cheating on you, i'm so sorry i stole money from you that's not enough. I went them to write down the specific things they did who they did them with and why. See, that means they're sincere about coming back in and earning back your trust.""

Fourth, Essel says if they stole something they must pay you back. If they don't do step three or four- let them go.

Needing a win at Phoenix to make the final four in next weekend's championship finale, Johnson saw his hopes crumple with a blown tire that sent his No. 48 Chevrolet into the wall with one lap remaining in the second stage Sunday.

The crash eliminated the reigning and seven-time NASCAR champion from title contention.

""I'm disappointed for sure,"" Johnson said. ""The last couple of months we've been staying alive and at this stage with the Round of 8 and then the Round of 4, you can't just stay alive. You've got to be hitting on all cylinders and we just haven't been there, unfortunately.""

It's been a rough ride for Johnson since matching Hall of Famers Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt with his seventh title a year ago.

Johnson won three races this year, but those came during the first third of the season. He hasn't won since Dover in June and has one top-five finish the last 21 races.

Johnson came to Phoenix last among the eight title contenders, 51 points out of mathematically qualifying. Martin Truex Jr, Kyle Busch and Kevin Harvick already locked into next weekend's championship finale next weekend at Homestead-Miami Speedway, leaving Johnson among five drivers fighting for one spot.

A four-time winner at Phoenix, Johnson started 12th and earned a point by finishing eighth in the first stage. He was running 11th when his right front tired blew right before the caution at the end of the race's second stage.

Johnson drove the car straight to the garage, his day and championship hopes over.

""I didn't know it was coming,"" Johnson said. ""Clearly just got the brakes too hot and popped that tire with like a lap to go or two laps to go before the stage was up. We weren't leading, we were having a decent day, but we were going to need a great day today. I wish we were still out on track to still have a shot for it.""

They were then helped out of the water by Migues and the Good Samaritans.

""She was injured pretty bad, but she stuck out like a champ,"" Migues said. ""I told her she was a tough old lady. She enjoyed hearing that.""

Evan's family told FOX 13 she was hospitalized at the ICU with broken bones, open wounds, head trauma and possible damage to her spinal cord.

The two deputies said they would like to find those who stopped to help to thank them for what they did.",Florida deputies rescue 82-year-old woman after she crashes into pond,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/13/florida-deputies-rescue-82-year-old-woman-after-crashes-into-pond.html
