However, Lt. Howard Black told Fox News on Wednesday that it‚Äôs ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù that anyone would be discouraged from calling the department about a story and an incident.

Officials are struggling to contain a widespread and deadly outbreak of the plague that‚Äôs been wreaking havoc in Madagascar since late August. At least 45 deaths have been attributed to the outbreak, with more than 385 confirmed cases reported in 27 out of the country‚Äôs 114 districts.

The outbreak is worrisome because a majority of the confirmed illnesses include cases of the pneumonic plague, which can be transmitted through the air when an infected person coughs, and is 100 percent fatal if left untreated.

OPIOID CRISIS: RESEARCHERS EMPLOY NEW METHOD TO TRACK OVERDOSES

In response, the Malagasy Red Cross said it mobilized 700 volunteers to work on community education, tracing people who have been in contact with plague victims and other health initiatives. On the ground, authorities have been taking measures against citizens spreading false information about the outbreak on social media, including at least one arrest for a false report posted on Facebook, BBC News reported.

Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) delivered 1.2 million doses of antibiotics to the island and authorized $1.5 million in funding to help combat the illness, Business Insider reported. Authorities have placed a ban on large public gatherings in the capital, while the government has been working to disinfect school classrooms and hand out surgical masks. Prison visits in the worst hit areas have also been suspended.

Madagascar typically sees around 400 cases of the bubonic plague each year, with the illness typically spread through flea bites and contact with infected bodily fluids. WHO said cases of the plague typically begin popping up between September and April, but the current outbreak started even earlier and has struck in major cities like Antananarivo and Toamasina.

‚ÄúThe risk of the disease spreading is high at national level because it is present in several towns and this is just the start of the outbreak,‚Äù a WHO official said, according to BBC News.

The outbreak has been traced back to a 31-year-old man who died while on a public service vehicle in eastern Madagascar. Two others who had come into contact with the man later died. It gained widespread attention following the September death of a Seychellois basketball coach who had traveled to Madagascar for a tournament. As of Sunday, Seychelles national air carrier announced that it had temporarily suspended services between the region and Madagascar.

Hill violated the company‚Äôs social media guidelines a second time, according to ESPN, after she called on fans to take indirect action against the Dallas Cowboys after owner Jerry Jones told players they would be benched if they didn't stand up during the national anthem.

‚ÄúChange happens when advertisers are impacted,‚Äù Hill wrote. ‚ÄúIf you strongly reject what Jerry Jones said, the key is his advertisers.‚Äù

Hill wasn‚Äôt formally punished for mocking Trump on Twitter, but ESPN took action when she called for fans to boycott the Cowboys‚Äô advertisers.

‚ÄúJemele Hill has been suspended for two weeks for a second violation of our social media guidelines. She previously acknowledged letting her colleagues and company down with an impulsive tweet. In the aftermath, all employees were reminded of how much individual tweets may reflect negatively on ESPN and that such action would have consequences. Hence this decision,‚Äù an ESPN spokesman said in a statement.

In response, Hill's co-host on ‚ÄúSC6,‚Äù Michael Smith, chose to sit out Monday night's broadcast, in a ‚Äúmutual‚Äù decision with ESPN, The Wrap reported.

Other supporters of Hill said they were outraged. Rev. Al Sharpton said the suspension ‚Äúshould NOT go unanswered. ESPN and advertisers will hear from us!‚Äù

Rosie O'Donnell tweeted ‚ÄúWe are with you,‚Äù adding the hashtag #systemicRACISM.

""Jemele Hill has been suspended for two weeks for a second violation of our social media guidelines. She previously acknowledged letting her colleagues and company down with an impulsive tweet."" - ESPN spokesman

Jones issued his edict before the Cowboys' game Sunday against the Green Bay Packers. It came after amid a backlash against players ‚Äútaking a knee‚Äù during the national anthem, driven in part by President Trump's angry denouncement of what some players called legitimate social protest.

‚ÄúI know this, we cannot ... in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag,‚Äù Jones said. ‚ÄúWe know that there is a serious debate in this country about those issues, but there is no question in my mind that the National Football League and the Dallas Cowboys are going to stand up for the flag. So we're clear.‚Äù

Jones‚Äô comments, the strongest made on the anthem controversy, came after he was asked about Vice President Mike Pence leaving the game in Indianapolis early after several San Francisco 49ers players took a knee during the national anthem. Hill, an outspoken liberal, tweeted that Jones ‚Äúhas created a problem for his players, specifically the black ones‚Ä¶ If they don't kneel, some will see them as sellouts.‚Äù

The ESPN host wrote, ‚ÄúBy drawing a line in the sand, Jerry put his players under more scrutiny and threw them under the bus... If the rationale behind JJ's stance is keeping the fanbase happy, make him see that he is underestimated how all of his fanbase feels.‚Äù

She urged ‚Äúpaying customers‚Äù to ‚Äúboycott his advertisers‚Äù if they didn‚Äôt agree with Jones‚Äô comments. Hill quoted a list of Cowboys‚Äô advertisers in one of her tweets and sent a message to her 760,000-plus Twitter followers.

ESPN, the network that employs Hill, agreed to pay $15.2 billion in 2011 to air the NFL‚Äôs ‚ÄúMonday Night Football,‚Äù according to The New York Times. The NFL and its content are obviously extremely valuable to ESPN and Hill's latest violation will cost her two weeks of work.

ESPN declined comment regarding whether or not Hill will be paid during the suspension. The NFL declined comment when reached by Fox News.

Hill, who currently has a pair of photographs with former President Barack and Michelle Obama pinned atop her Twitter feed, co-hosts ‚ÄúSC6,‚Äù a relatively new version of the network‚Äôs flagship show, SportsCenter.

Hill was in the middle of a national story when she criticized President Trump on Twitter last month. Her tweets caught the attention of the White House and Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who said she considered the rhetoric a ‚Äúfireable offense.‚Äù Trump even took to Twitter himself to mock ESPN and demand an apology.

‚ÄúDonald Trump is a white supremacist who has surrounded himself with other white supremacists,‚Äù Hill wrote on Sept 11. She called him ‚Äúthe most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime.‚Äù Hill also called Trump a ‚Äúbigot,‚Äù and ‚Äúunqualified and unfit to be president.‚Äù She even added: ‚ÄúIf he were not white, he never would have been elected.‚Äù

There was speculation that ESPN wanted to sideline Hill for one episode of ‚ÄúSC6‚Äù as a result of the Trump tweets but her co-host, Michael Smith, refused to do the show without her. Citing ‚Äútwo sources familiar with the situation,‚Äù Think Progress reported last month that ESPN executives reached out to other black hosts to fill in. According to the website, ESPN scrapped the idea when two African-American ESPN hosts declined to fill in for Hill and Smith. The outspoken duo hosted the show that night. ESPN denied that it attempted to find alternative hosts.

Hill eventually admitted that she cried over the situation in a meeting with ESPN President John Skipper, but didn't exactly apologize to Trump or his supporters.

‚ÄúSince my tweets criticizing President Donald Trump exploded into a national story, the most difficult part for me has been watching ESPN become a punching bag and seeing a dumb narrative kept alive about the company‚Äôs political leanings,‚Äù Hill wrote.

‚ÄúIt was the first time I had ever cried in a meeting. I didn‚Äôt cry because Skipper was mean or rude to me. I cried because I felt I had let him and my colleagues down,‚Äù Hill wrote in a commentary on the ESPN site The Undefeated.

Jones and the rest of the Cowboys kneeled arm-in-arm before the national anthem before a game against the Arizona Cardinals two weeks ago, days after Trump reignited the anthem-protest controversy with a series of tweets. Former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started kneeling during the Anthem last season in protest of what he believed were instances of racial injustice in the U.S. He is currently out of the league and many feel his political stance is why no team has given him an opportunity to play in 2017.

Back in 2014, ESPN suspended Bill Simmons for criticizing NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. The following year his contract was not renewed by the network. Hill was also suspended nearly a decade ago when she compared Boston Celtics fans to Nazis in a blog on ESPN‚Äôs website in 2008.",ESPN‚Äôs Jemele Hill suspended from network for two weeks,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/09/espn-s-jemele-hill-suspended-from-network-for-two-weeks.html

The president understood, almost instinctively, how America feels about the flag and the anthem. If you don't stand up, you're insulting the country. That‚Äôs his position. So, at a rally in Huntsville, Alabama he waded right in; He called the football protesters S.O.B.'s, and said fire 'em. Right there, he turned the debate from alleged police brutality, to respect for the flag. He framed the debate on his terms. He provoked the liberal left, and they took the bait.

‚ÄúIf Hillary Clinton or anybody from her environment could have been such an individual [to help], I also would have passed that information [to her],‚Äù Veselnitskaya wrote.

The June 2016 meeting was first reported by The New York Times over the summer, reigniting claims that the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia in the presidential election.

Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort were known to have attended the meeting with Veselnitskaya, Russian-born lobbyist Rinat Ahkmetshin and music publicist Rob Goldstone, who brokered the get-together promising campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton.

Veselnitskaya told Fox News on Wednesday that the information being shared in the Trump Tower meeting ‚Äúwas not confidential,‚Äù but also ‚Äúwas not public.‚Äù ‚ÄúI wanted to make it public,‚Äù Veselnitskaya said in the email. ‚ÄúBecause I naively thought there should be justice in the US for the fraudsters fostering hatred between the two of our countries.‚Äù

The suggestion that she would have made contact with Clinton further challenges the notion that the meeting was about anything other than sanctions.

The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on correspondence between Veselnitskaya and Goldstone, likewise suggesting the meeting was not set up to pass on damaging information about Clinton on behalf of the Russian government.

The emails show Veselnitskaya requesting to invite Akhmetshin to the meeting, saying he had ‚Äúinvaluable knowledge about the positions held by the members of the Foreign Relations Committee that will be important to our discussion,‚Äù the Wall Street Journal reported.

While Veselnitskaya -- in correspondence at the time and comments made more recently -- has countered claims that the meeting might have dealt with Clinton dirt, that narrative emerged thanks to the originally published correspondence between Trump Jr. and Goldstone.

Goldstone said at the time that he could set up a meeting to provide ‚Äúvery high level and sensitive information‚Äù compromising Clinton‚Äôs election chances as part of ‚ÄúRussia and its government‚Äôs support for Mr. Trump.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs what you say, I love it,‚Äù Trump Jr. wrote in response.

It remains unclear what Goldstone was referring to.

Following the controversy, Trump Jr. defended himself, saying Veselnitskaya did not have any such information and wanted to focus on other non-election-related issues. She echoed his view on multiple occasions.

The emails were released by Scott Balber, an attorney for Aras Agalarov, who helped organize the meeting with Trump Jr.

Balber also told the Journal that the Russian lawyer has been fighting the Magnitsky Act for years and reached out to numerous Russian authorities.

As part of her effort against the sanctions law, Veselnitskaya reportedly had talking points that included one reference to Clinton, suggesting a U.S. company had avoided taxes in Russia and donated to the Democratic Party, possibly Clinton.

A crazed gunman took the lives of at least 59 people and injured more than 500 innocent country music fans at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas on Sunday night.

The tight-knit country music community immediately came together to commemorate those who were murdered and to stand behind the victims and their families.

Some of the industry's biggest stars like Keith Urban and Vince Gill performed at a vigil hosted by the Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp and the Country Music Association drawing a reported crowd of 600 people on Monday night.

Urban serenaded the audience with Simon & Garfunkel's ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" after recalling his 9-year-old daughter asking him if he knew any of the victims.

""[Fans are] like family,"" Urban said at the vigil. ""It's the one thing about country music. It is a community. I do know those people. It just hit me.""

Nashville Mayor Megan Barry said at the emotional event, ""Love is the answer and the only thing we know.""

Country singer Lee Brice, who performed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival two nights before the deadly shooting, told Fox News he feels ""attacked by an enemy.""

""I feel like the fans are probably reacting for the most part like I‚Äôm reacting,"" Brice told us. ""They feel the same way ‚Äì they feel like they‚Äôre being attacked by an enemy but they‚Äôre not going to let that enemy win. The enemy is hate.""

The ""Hard to Love"" singer said he is ""one of those fans.""

""There's a pride in country music and what they stand for and what they believe in and I don‚Äôt think that's going to change because of one person who wants to take that away from them.""

Country music fans echoed Brice's words, chiming in on social media after the tragedy.

""Country music is about love & home & family & support,"" one fan wrote.

Another tweeted, ""never been prouder to be a fan of country music. Those concerts are my home, like a family reunion. Stand tall.""

FOX & Friends FIRST is presented prior to the network‚Äôs signature morning show, previewing the day ahead by covering the latest news headlines in politics, business, entertainment and health.

The Chicago-based John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation on Wednesday announced the 24 fellows, who each receive $625,000 over five years to spend any way they choose. The recipients work in a variety of fields, from computer science to theater, immunology and photography.

The foundation has awarded the fellowships annually since 1981 to people who show ""exceptional creativity in their work and the prospect for still more in the future."" Previous winners include ""Hamilton"" playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda and author-journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates.

There is no application process. Instead, an anonymous pool of nominators brings potential fellows to the foundation's attention. Those selected learn they've been chosen shortly before the awards are announced.

For opera director and producer Yuval Sharon, the news that he had been selected was ""an enormous shock and honor."" When the foundation called, he assumed they were seeking a referral for someone else who'd been nominated.

""I'm totally amazed,"" said Sharon, 37, the founder and artistic director of The Industry, a Los Angeles-based production company that produces operas in nontraditional spaces and formats.

A 2015 production transported audience members and performers to various locations in Los Angeles via limousines, with singers and musicians performing along the way and at each stop.

His next work, an adaptation of the radio program ""War of the Worlds"" will utilize decommissioned World War II sirens to broadcast the performance occurring inside the theater onto the streets. The sounds of performers stationed outdoors ‚Äî and likely the traffic and other street noise ‚Äî will then be transmitted back into the concert hall.

Sharon said he comes across many people who don't think opera is for them, but he hopes hearing about these kinds of ""audacious experiments"" will peak their interest.

Another fellow, Cristina Jim√©nez Moreta, is co-founder and executive director of United We Dream, a national network of groups led by immigrant youth.

Moreta, 33, and her parents came to the U.S. illegally from Ecuador when she was a child. At 19, she revealed her undocumented status publicly. It was a move that put her and her family at risk of deportation, but also placed her at the forefront of a movement to change the way immigrants are perceived.

She was instrumental in pressing for the 2012 adoption of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the now-endangered executive order that allowed thousands of undocumented young people to live without fear of deportation.

Moreta said the fellowship is recognition of the resilience shown by her parents and other immigrants who ""had the courage to stand up and say 'we are here, this is our home and we are fighting.'""

The first people she told were her parents, who were fearful when she started organizing but now join her in marches and to pass petitions.

""They're very proud,"" she said.

Also selected was Dawoud Bey, a photographer and educator from Chicago whose portraits often feature people from marginalized communities. For ""The Birmingham Project,"" he commemorated the 1963 bombing at a church in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed six children, with a series of portraits of Birmingham residents who were the age of each of the children killed and the age they would be if they had lived.

Others announced Wednesday were writer and cultural critic Viet Thanh Nguyen ‚Äî whose novel, ""The Sympathizer,"" about a communist double agent, won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for fiction ‚Äî and Derek Peterson, a historian of East Africa and professor at the University of Michigan.

Maria's aftermath

Last month, Zuckerberg said that Facebook would work to ""get Puerto Rico back online"" after the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Maria, a category 4 storm, which ravaged the country. Facebook donated $1.5 million to NetHope and the World Food Programme, as well as donating ads ""to get critical information to people in the region"" and teams of facebook workers ""to deliver emergency telecommunications assistance to get the systems up and running.""

He has also helped raise over $120,000 for Save the Children to help support the recovery of Puerto Rico.

Three weeks after the storm, just over 10 percent of the island has power and roughly 33 percent of cell towers have been restored, according to the Puerto Rico government's website.

Bruce Hornsby could be heard at Key West‚Äôs Mallory Square as a ‚Äúreclamation party‚Äù got underway, Thursday afternoon. The feeling was positive and the outlook was bright.

Hours later, Key West Mayor Craig Cates came in to Two Friends Patio Restaurant for dinner, as nearby Duval Street began to show signs of life.

‚ÄúKey West is going to be open for business soon,‚Äù said Cates.

When asked about the higher volume of people out and about, the mayor replied, ‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôre taking visitors now. We haven‚Äôt advertised yet,‚Äù he said.

Cates, however, pointed out that the hardest hit parts of the Keys are still picking up the pieces from Irma‚Äôs devastation. ‚ÄúWe understand our neighbors to the north in the Florida Keys got more damage than us,‚Äù he said.

In nearby Big Pine Key, the cleanup is still ongoing.

Among those cleaning up are 85-year-old Wes Harris and his wife. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been married 63 years,‚Äù he said.

The couple rode out the storm near their now beat-up home.

The wheelchair ramp into Harris‚Äô home was just recently repaired by first responders, but there‚Äôs still so much more to do.

‚ÄúSee that rock? You see how big that rock is?‚Äù Harris said as he pointed to a large boulder in his yard. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my rock. I don‚Äôt know where the hell it came from.‚Äù

The legally blind U.S. Army veteran, who suffers from spinal stenosis, lost his orchid ranch, which he says had between 7,000 and 8,000 flowers.

Harris is so tough that the idea of getting a little emotional over the relief effort in the aftermath of the storm makes him annoyed.

‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt believe how everybody has helped. It‚Äôs absolutely unbelievable,‚Äù Harris said.

Harris‚Äô post-storm story isn‚Äôt necessarily unique. Residents told 7News about problems with their house, their boat, or in some cases, both.

Big names also came to help out the Keys, in the form of former football player Tim Tebow and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.

‚ÄúSo many people are so tough, and what they‚Äôve gone through,‚Äù said Tebow. ‚ÄúYou know what‚Äôs even more special? So many people, who don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs even going on with their houses, but they‚Äôre still volunteering for other people that need help.‚Äù

Residents appreciated Tebow‚Äôs visit. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs such a huge model for me, so it‚Äôs a nice thing that he came down here to the Keys,‚Äù said one woman.

7News cameras captured Rubio posing for pictures, as food, ice and relief supplies got to those in need.

When asked what he would say to those residents who fear they may be forgotten, Rubio responded: ‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt be forgotten by us ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know if someone else will ‚Äî primarily because we‚Äôve spent a lot of time, personally, in the Keys, up and down this place. I mean my family, we‚Äôve had so many incredible memories here. We want to see the Keys come back.‚Äù

Meanwhile, Harris indicated he will make it through that strong current called adversity, probably because of his big heart. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to keep stroking, bud. That‚Äôs all you can do,‚Äù he said.

As the reclamation party begins in Key West, many residents feel that, because the cleanup is still underway, the party is happening too soon. however, others feel that it needs to happen to show that the Florida Keys are still alive.

Officials said tourism will return to Key West in a limited capacity on Sunday with the arrival of a cruise ship at the Margaritaville Pier. It is scheduled to arrive at noon.

But now he has shifted gears, alarmed by Trump‚Äôs bellicose warnings to North Korea and threats to topple the Iran nuclear accord.
Meanwhile, the only progress made in hemming in North Korea has taken place recently, under President Trump.
But Corker says Trump‚Äôs threats of military action against North Korea could put the U.S. ‚Äúon the path to World War III.‚ÄùWe shall see.","Will Senator Bob Corker torch tax reform? That is the speculation of the New York Times, the Washington Post and other liberal outlets. Pundits suggest that Trump‚Äôs recent Twitter battle with Corker might drive the offended Tennessee senator to vote against the White House‚Äôs proposed tax package.

That says a lot more about Bob Corker than it does about Donald Trump.

Just as many think that personal animus against Trump drove John McCain to crush Republicans‚Äô efforts to undo ObamaCare, notwithstanding the dire health care situation in the senator‚Äôs home state of Arizona, now many believe that Corker, out of pique, could topple efforts to cut taxes. That would be a staggering defection from earlier campaign promises, and a serious blow to the GOP‚Äôs pro-worker tax plan.

On the campaign trail in 2006, Corker promised to ‚Äúensure that government works with entrepreneurs and businesses, rather than against them. By reducing the burden of taxation, litigation, and regulation, American entrepreneurs will be better able to create exciting new businesses and good-paying jobs.‚Äù

That was when Corker was first running for office, and still viewed the world from his perspective as a wealthy self-made real estate developer, or, in fact, much like Donald Trump. Indeed, perhaps because of their similar backgrounds, Corker is one of the few legislators reputed to have developed a good relationship with the president. Until now, when his disdain for Trump‚Äôs muscular and unpredictable foreign policy has driven Corker to much-hyped break with The Donald.

Trump is not the first to fall short of Corker‚Äôs expectations. He spent the past decade blasting President Obama‚Äôs lack of leadership, eventually writing an op-ed for the Washington Post entitled ‚ÄúObama is an Unreliable Ally.‚Äù In that 2014 piece Corker wrote about Obama‚Äôs wavering on Syria, Libya, our ‚Äútepid response to Russian aggression in Ukraine‚Äù and elsewhere, concluding, ‚ÄúThis U.S. president, despite his bold pronouncements and moral posturing, cannot be counted on.‚Äù He took Obama to task for issuing ‚Äúplenty of tough statements‚Äù about Russia, but failing to follow up.

In short, he echoed Trump‚Äôs disdain for Obama‚Äôs weak-kneed overseas engagements. But now he has shifted gears, alarmed by Trump‚Äôs bellicose warnings to North Korea and threats to topple the Iran nuclear accord. Those positions are surprising in light of his 2006 campaign statements that ‚ÄúIran and North Korea pose exceptional dangers because of their possession of nuclear materials and our relations with these nations should be a top foreign policy priority. We must be firm in our insistence that Iran and North Korea renounce any nuclear weapons programs and we should stay focused on solving this problem in the near term.‚Äù

Corker notably has not volunteered how exactly we are supposed to do that. He helped pass the fictional agreement with Iran that presumes to put off their nuclear development, but that has gaping holes in verification, and few imagine that the mullahs will not steadily advance towards nuclear capability.

Meanwhile, the only progress made in hemming in North Korea has taken place recently, under President Trump. Helped by his assertion that all options are on the table, including military, the White House has bullied the world into jointly enacting, for the first time, serious sanctions. His missile strike on Syria, carried out while entertaining Chinese President Xi Jinping, unsettled the Chinese and drove them to take his bluster seriously. Key to any success, the Chinese finally appear to be pressuring their rogue neighbor.

But Corker says Trump‚Äôs threats of military action against North Korea could put the U.S. ‚Äúon the path to World War III.‚Äù

We shall see. In the meantime, Corker‚Äôs dim view of Trump‚Äôs aggression towards our enemies and erratic management style should not deter him from voting in favor of much-needed tax reform. Proposals to lighten the tax burden on corporations and small businesses are an important step towards accelerating our growth and creating more jobs.

Corker has threatened to block the tax cuts, saying at a Budget Committee hearing, ‚ÄúUnless it reduces deficits ‚Äî let me say that one more time ‚Äî unless it reduces deficits and does not add to deficits with reasonable and responsible growth models, and unless we can make it permanent, I don't have any interest in it.""

Given that there will be widely divergent estimates of how lower taxes will impact the economy and the budget deficit, Corker will have cover for however he votes. Democrats can be counted on to discount any additional growth to come from reduced taxes, which will drive up estimated revenue shortfalls. Others will forecast a more positive impact from simplifying and reducing taxes, and from encouraging corporations to invest more in the U.S.

In the past, the senator has supported measures to boost economic growth, such as those underpinning the Trump agenda ‚Äì like lower taxes and lighter regulations -- which is perhaps why he was reelected in 2012. Now that he is wavering in those commitments, his popularity in his home state has plunged ‚Äì to 34 percent in one recent poll, even as Trump maintains much higher approval in Tennessee. Perhaps that is why Corker will not run for reelection, and why he is so peeved at the president.

Maybe that is why another poll showed 77 percent of Tennessee Republicans trust Trump, but only 40 percent have confidence in their senator.

Let us hope that Corker earns back that trust by putting his personal feelings aside, and doing what‚Äôs right for the country and for Tennessee.",Liz Peek: Could Corker's fight with Trump topple tax reform?,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/10/liz-peek-could-corkers-fight-with-trump-topple-tax-reform.html

""I would still do it,"" Jenkins said. ""I mean, I've been that committed to it because that decision is not mine. I made the decision a year ago that I was going to use my platform in a way to create positive change both on the field and off the field and having someone tell me I couldn't do that simply because, you know, a president or your bottom line is getting ready to be affected, that wouldn't deter me.""

Jones said Sunday after the Cowboys‚Äô loss to the Green Bay Packers that any player that chose to ‚Äúdisrespect‚Äù the flag by kneeling during the national anthem would not play. He doubled-down on those comments Sunday in an interview with ESPN.

Jenkins reiterated to NBC Sports Philadelphia that the demonstrations during the national anthem were not about the flag and were ‚Äúin no way disrespectful to our flag, country or service members.‚Äù

""I think we've made that very clear that what we are demonstrating about has nothing to do with the flag but everything to do with social injustice, racial inequality and the things that, you know, Jerry Jones and other owners who are making statements have yet to address,"" he said.

Jenkins said he would like for NFL owners to talk about the issues that players are protesting against ‚Äì racial injustice, police brutality and the education gap ‚Äì to move the conversation forward.

The Eagles veteran has been one of the most prominent leaders of the NFL protests since San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick opted out of his contract this past offseason.

Yahoo Sports reported last month Jenkins, teammate Torrey Smith, Seattle Seahawks‚Äô Michael Bennett and former NFL player Anquan Boldin co-authored a letter to the league office asking for money, political involvement and other commitments from the league. It also asked the NFL to recognize the month of November as activism awareness month.

It‚Äôs unlikely that Weinstein‚Äôs movies will be highlighted this awards season, which will be a major change from seasons‚Äô past when films like ‚ÄúThe King‚Äôs Speech,‚Äù ‚ÄúSilver Linings Playbook‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Artist‚Äù dominated the pre-awards show chatter.

Part of the reason for that is due to the fact that The Weinstein Company (TWC) had few noteworthy releases this year. The two biggest releases from the film studio this year are ‚ÄúWind River‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Current War,‚Äù which received a lukewarm reception at the Toronto Film Festival.

‚ÄúEven before this happened, this was a terrible Oscar year for The Weinstein Company,‚Äù IndieWire‚Äôs Editor-in-Chief Dana Harris told us. ‚Äú‚ÄôThe Current War‚Äô received withering reviews, and their best hope was ‚ÄòWind River.‚Äô At this point, however, I wouldn't be surprised if The Weinstein Company received no nominations.‚Äù

The Academy Awards nominations are set for Jan. 23, 2018 and the ceremony will be on March 4, 2018.

‚ÄúPeople will talk about Harvey's absence during awards season, certainly, but his company has been struggling for some time,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt's been years since he ruled the Oscar conversation.‚Äù

Following accusations that Weinstein raped, forcibly touched and harassed women in the industry, no one will want to be associated with TWC, which has since fired him, Harris predicted.

‚ÄúRight now, everything Weinstein touched is toxic.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Current War‚Äôs‚Äù top star Benedict Cumberbatch spoke out against Weinstein on Tuesday, stating he is ‚Äúutterly disgusted by the continuing revelations of Harvey Weinstein's horrifying and unforgivable actions.‚Äù

Weinstein reportedly removed his name from the film‚Äôs credits earlier this week -- before he was terminated by his studio -- likely in an effort to help bolster its awards season chances.

The Weinstein Company‚Äôs ‚ÄúWind River,‚Äù starring Jeremy Renner, is the only film that seemed to have serious awards potential. It grossed three times its $11 million budget, but the Editorial Director of The Hollywood Reporter told USA Today it‚Äôs unlikely the film will earn Oscar votes.

""There will be a real reluctance on the part of Oscar voters to vote for a Harvey Weinstein production this year,"" Matthew Belloni told the newspaper.

The Weinstein Company as a whole has won a staggering 75 Academy Awards in its history. TWC‚Äôs website states the studio has received 303 Oscar nominations including 16 bet picture nominations.

Some speculated that the taboo surrounding Weinstein will fade over time ‚Äì but not soon enough to help TWC's Oscar chances comes 2018.

‚ÄúWeinstein connections might hurt Oscar nominations this year as a PR move. But please remember that child rapist Roman Polanski both got an Oscar and a standing ovation from the Hollywood audience,‚Äù noted Dan Gainor, vice president of business and culture at the Media Research Center.

Officials are struggling to contain a widespread and deadly outbreak of the plague that‚Äôs been wreaking havoc in Madagascar since late August. At least 45 deaths have been attributed to the outbreak, with more than 385 confirmed cases reported in 27 out of the country‚Äôs 114 districts.

The outbreak is worrisome because a majority of the confirmed illnesses include cases of the pneumonic plague, which can be transmitted through the air when an infected person coughs, and is 100 percent fatal if left untreated.

OPIOID CRISIS: RESEARCHERS EMPLOY NEW METHOD TO TRACK OVERDOSES

In response, the Malagasy Red Cross said it mobilized 700 volunteers to work on community education, tracing people who have been in contact with plague victims and other health initiatives. On the ground, authorities have been taking measures against citizens spreading false information about the outbreak on social media, including at least one arrest for a false report posted on Facebook, BBC News reported.

Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) delivered 1.2 million doses of antibiotics to the island and authorized $1.5 million in funding to help combat the illness, Business Insider reported. Authorities have placed a ban on large public gatherings in the capital, while the government has been working to disinfect school classrooms and hand out surgical masks. Prison visits in the worst hit areas have also been suspended.

Madagascar typically sees around 400 cases of the bubonic plague each year, with the illness typically spread through flea bites and contact with infected bodily fluids. WHO said cases of the plague typically begin popping up between September and April, but the current outbreak started even earlier and has struck in major cities like Antananarivo and Toamasina.

‚ÄúThe risk of the disease spreading is high at national level because it is present in several towns and this is just the start of the outbreak,‚Äù a WHO official said, according to BBC News.

The outbreak has been traced back to a 31-year-old man who died while on a public service vehicle in eastern Madagascar. Two others who had come into contact with the man later died. It gained widespread attention following the September death of a Seychellois basketball coach who had traveled to Madagascar for a tournament. As of Sunday, Seychelles national air carrier announced that it had temporarily suspended services between the region and Madagascar.

Bush in the annual Warrior 100K mountain bike ride has a personal story of overcoming adversity. Warriors and civilians alike train for months for the privilege of challenging the rocky switchback single-track trails on Bush‚Äôs Texas ranch. The ride has its own momentum, and each year it is more about the networks that are forming and the obstacles being overcome than the physical challenge of the ride itself.

Out on the trail, the veterans ride in a kind of formation, banding together to assist someone who falls or has difficulty. Self-appointed supervisors, who must have been officers in war, bark out orders to start and stop. I am proud that my training allowed me to make it all the way up the challenging windy trail called Waterfall, over the narrow bridges and around the ridge in the lowest gear, and that I completed the two-day event on Sunday without falling.

But this ride wasn‚Äôt about me.

Many of the warriors who participate in the 100K carry incredible stories of courage and fortitude. President Bush said he was proud of retired Maj. Peter Way, who lost most of his right leg in Afghanistan and is transitioning from a hand cycle to a pedal-assisted e-bike with the help of a special leg prosthesis. He injured his back during the first day of this year‚Äôs ride, but he was back the next day, enduring intense pain, with the support of his brethren in Team 43, to ride at the conclusion of the event.

Research has shown that at least 20 percent of veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars suffer from post-traumatic stress or depression, but less than half seek help.

The theme this year was the Bush Institute‚Äôs new Warrior Wellness Alliance, which approaches the debilitating invisible wounds of war (traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress) with the wisdom that no one knows how to help a vet like another vet.

As President Bush told me in an interview, ‚ÄúOne, admit you got a problem. Pretty logical. If a vet kind of keeps it in inside, no one will understand what I think, no one can possibly relate to what I feel like, and doesn‚Äôt share, obviously that leads to negative consequences.

‚ÄúSecondly, when you seek help, you and I can be ‚Ä¶ we can be sympathetic. But we can‚Äôt possibly relate to what it‚Äôs like to see a friend killed in combat. And yet there are others who can. And here in this group, people have progressed from severe depression, a severe case of PTS, to a moderate case. In some cases, a light case of it, and they can share with their pal what it took. And so it‚Äôs logical, and it works.‚Äù

The Warrior Wellness Alliance focuses on the roles of spouses and caregivers, and it connects peer-to-peer veteran networks with expert health care providers around the country. The Stephen A. Cohen Military Family Clinics are heavily involved, including the one at my own medical center. Research has shown that at least 20 percent of veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars suffer from post-traumatic stress or depression, but less than half seek help.

The alliance hopes to help overcome this by building support systems like Team 43, which come together at sports events like the bike ride and share stories, struggles and hopes.

One of the most inspiring stories involves Marine Cpl. Dave Smith, who spoke at the first Warrior 100K mountain bike ride that I attended in 2012 and returned this year to ride with the alumni. He wears a haunted expression in President Bush‚Äôs evocative portrait in his book Portraits of Courage.

In Iraq in 2004, Smith‚Äôs unit came under heavy fire, and while trying to defend his position, he accidentally shot a fellow Marine in the leg. He has suffered for it ever since. He once put a shotgun in his mouth and almost pulled the trigger. He stopped himself at the last minute, thinking of a fellow vet who committed suicide and hurt many who cared about him.

Smith‚Äôs motto now is ‚ÄúNever give up.‚Äù He says he has sustained post-traumatic growth and that his heavy networking with fellow vets has helped him rebuild his life.

He earned the night's lowest score, 22 for a contemporary dance with Maks' wife, Peta Murgatroyd. But at the end of the night, it was Derek Fisher who was eliminated.



The top score of the night, 29, went to ""Hamilton"" star Jordan Fisher (with Lindsay Arnold), who told viewers about the year he'd been officially adopted in 2005 by his grandparents after his biological mom ""struggled with substance abuse. She wasn't ready to be a mom.""



His proud parents cheered in the audience for his contemporary dance tribute to them.



And after the show, Jordan told Fox News, ""The woman who gave birth to me did -- and I'm grateful for that. [She] also gave me a template for what not to do in life, of which I'm also grateful‚Ä¶ the story is what makes me who I am.""



Paralympian Victoria Arlen and Val Chmerkovskiy earned 27 for their foxtrot that showed how she recovered from paralysis. She doubled over in tears at the end of the dance.



Violinist Lindsey Stirling and partner Mark Ballas earned 26 points as she told viewers about the year her father died of cancer.



Ballas wore Stirling's father's actual hat and scarf in the touching Viennese waltz. She cried after the tribute to her beloved dad, who had taken a teaching job to earn enough money so that Stirling could take violin classes.



Stirling said to reporters afterwards, ""It's been a really heavy week. Mark has seen me cry so much‚Ä¶ I didn't know it would be this hard to talk about it. But‚Ä¶ my dad was here with me. I held it together pretty well.""



Drew Scott delighted the crowd when brother Jonathan of ""Property Brothers"" joined him to perform at the end of his jive dance with Emma Slater. Matching Vanessa, they earned 24.



Terrell Owens, Sasha Pieterse, Nikki Bella, and Frankie Muniz also walked away with 24 points.



While Muniz shared with fans the year he suffered memory loss, football player Owens paid tribute to 2012, the year his grandmother died after suffering from dementia.



They were two peas in a pod, Owens recalled to Fox News about the grandma who actually raised him. ""I lived in a relatively small town and people knew wherever she was, I was. We rode around on the go cart together.""

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and will allow the ad to run, even though the social network initially claimed it violated ad guidelines.

Blackburn confirmed on Fox News' ""The Story with Martha MacCallum"" Tuesday night that Twitter will allow her ad to be promoted on the social media platform.

Twitter said that they made the decision after reconsidering the ""context of the entire message,"" according to a report by Recode.

Blackburn said she believes Twitter reversed its decision because ""the American people rose up.""

""I think what has happened, the American people rose up. They are sick and tired of the liberal elites and the liberal media telling them what they're going to listen to, and what is going to be pushed forward and broadcast and what is not, and in this example it was Twitter,"" Blackburn said.

""And now they have reversed their decision after the American people have joined me in standing up to them, and they are going to allow the video to stand and us to push it forward.""

Twitter blocked an ad by Blackburn's campaign Monday, claiming it included ""an inflammatory statement that is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction."" The line in question stated: ""I'm 100% pro-life. I found Planned Parenthood, and we stopped the sale of baby body parts ‚Äî thank God.""

The social media platform initially said it would air the Senate candidate's ad, but only if the line about ""the sale of baby body parts"" was removed.

MARSHA BLACKBURN DEMANDS TWITTER APOLOGIZE FOR TRYING TO 'CENSOR' PRO-LIFE AD

Earlier Tuesday, Blackburn called on Twitter to apologize for blocking the advertisement, saying in a statement that she was ""appalled"" by Twitter's censorship.

‚ÄúI am appalled by Twitter‚Äôs attempt to censor my pro-life record, and I believe that the entire pro-life community deserves an apology and explanation for their actions,‚Äù Blackburn said in a statement. ‚ÄúI have spent my entire career fighting to protect and honor life, and I refuse to allow an organization whose stated mission is to ‚Äòprovide information instantly, without barriers‚Äô the ability to silence our efforts to protect the unborn.‚Äù

Twitter didn't prohibit Blackburn from promoting the ad on her own Twitter accounts, but the company wouldn't promote it as a sponsored ad on the site.

Blackburn was the chair of a Republican-run House panel created to investigate Planned Parenthood and fetal tissue research. The panel urged Congress to stop federal payments to the women‚Äôs health organization.

Democrats alleged that the GOP investigation had found no wrongdoing and wasted taxpayers‚Äô money in an abusive investigation.

TWITTER DROPS GOP REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN'S AD FOR 'INFLAMMATORY' LINE ABOUT PLANNED PARENTHOOD

The panel was created after anti-abortion activists secretly recorded videos in 2015 showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing how they sometimes provide fetal tissue to researchers, which is legal if no profit is made.

Fetal tissue research has strong backing among scientists for its value in studying Down syndrome, eye disease and other problems. But Blackburn‚Äôs committee report said fetal tissue ‚Äúmakes a vanishingly small contribution to clinical and research efforts, if it contributes at all,‚Äù and recommended curbing federal grants for such research.

Dove‚Äôs body wash ad, which was pulled during the backlash, featured several different women stripping off their nude-colored t-shirts to reveal an entirely different woman.

Afterward, the white woman does the same, and transforms into a completely different woman, and so on.

‚ÄúThere were seven of us in the full version, different races and ages, each of us answering the same question: ‚ÄòIf your skin were a wash label, what would it say?‚Äô‚Äù explained Ogunyemi.

Upon its release, controversy over the ad soon erupted on Twitter, with users calling it ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù and deeming it racist. Others called for a boycott of the product altogether.

Ogunyemi, too, said she is upset about becoming the ‚Äúunwitting poster child for racist advertising‚Äù in the wake of the controversy.

‚ÄúWhile I agree with Dove‚Äôs response to unequivocally apologize for any offense caused, they could have also defended their creative vision, and their choice to include me, an unequivocally dark-skinned black woman, as a face of their campaign,‚Äù Ogunyemi wrote. ‚ÄúI am not just some silent victim of a mistaken beauty campaign.

Something similar happened here Tuesday. The leader of Catalonia's regional government said that, as things stand, being part of Spain is no longer an option ‚Äì though a formal declaration of independence is on hold as talks with Madrid continue.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre living in an exceptional moment, of historic dimensions,‚Äù said a restrained but determined Carles Puigdemont, whose mop-top haircut has been the target of endless mirth across Spain. But Puigdeont‚Äôs words held no humor.

Like Jefferson, Adams and Franklin, Puigdemont is facing some pretty long odds in his quest. The long-simmering independence movement he leads came a boil on October 1, when Catalonians voted ‚Äì or tried to vote ‚Äì in a referendum to split from Spain. Police broke into polling places, confiscated ballots, and bashed hundreds of would-be voters with truncheons.

Sentiment for independence is far from unanimous. Last Sunday, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets, calling for Catalonia to remain part of Spain.

The Spanish government immediately declared the vote illegitimate, and said if Puigdemont carried on with his antics, it would enact a law known as Article 155, which allows it to suspend the regional government and impose direct control from Madrid.

Hours before Puigdemont‚Äôs speech to his regional parliament, crowds ‚Äì overwhelmingly in favor of independence ‚Äì jammed the plaza named for Catalonia‚Äôs beloved ex-President Lluis Companys, who opposed Francisco Franco‚Äôs dictatorship during World War II. Many draped the province‚Äôs flag over their shoulders.

Though the crowds were in a jubilant, non-violent mood, police were dispatched to guard the mansion on Carrer Mallorca, where the Spanish federal government is represented in Barcelona.

Sentiment for independence is far from unanimous. Last Sunday, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets, calling for Catalonia to remain part of Spain. Most Spanish newspapers are firmly against secession and a flurry of editorials scolding Puigdemont for his temerity filled their pages. Someone is reading them. Opinion polls before the Oct. 1 vote suggested nearly even numbers of pro and anti-independence citizens.

Catalonia‚Äôs fate notwithstanding, the last thing Europe needs right now is more political stress. Its 28 members states ‚Äì there‚Äôll be 27 once the United Kingdom leaves as a result of Brexit ‚Äì are at odds over a variety of crises: bailing out weak economies like Greece, inviting millions of refugees from the Middle East and Africa onto the continent, and combatting persistent unemployment. The E.U. will refuse to recognize an independent Catalonia, because doing otherwise would bring about more calls for national sovereignty. And nationalism is what the E.U. wants to erase across Europe.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not delinquents, we‚Äôre not crazy, and we‚Äôre not coup-makers,‚Äù Puigdemont told his parliament. And, with half of Catalonia‚Äôs lawmakers breaking into applause and nearly half sitting stony silent, he added, ‚ÄúI assume the mandate of the people of Catalonia, to become an independent state. I ask the government of Spain to accept dialogue.‚Äù

That‚Äôs about as likely as Spain giving up bullfighting. Catalonia, sometimes unwillingly, has been part of Spain since the days when Ferdinand and Isabella commissioned a wild-eyed explorer named Columbus ‚Äì whose achievements we just celebrated ‚Äì to set sail to find out what existed on the other side of the world.

A few hundred years later, that trip resulted in the Declaration of Independence. On Tuesday, another one was declared.",Spain: When in the course of human events,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/10/spain-when-in-course-human-events.html

During my years of painting people‚Äôs homes, I‚Äôve learned that small spaces don‚Äôt have to be boring or go unnoticed. All it takes is a little paint. By adding paint in strategic places around the home, you can easily and inexpensively transform a space. Plus, there is a good chance you could accomplish at least one of these eight painting projects during the course of one weekend.

Here are eight spaces to consider painting and my tips and tricks on making even the smallest places have a big impact.

1. Entryway. When a guest arrives, their first impression is based on your home‚Äôs exterior and the front door. Realtors call this curb appeal. But the very next thing guests will notice is the area right inside your front door, so you should use it to make a statement.

If your home has a formal entry, choose a paint color that is one to two shades darker than the next room. A darker paint color in the entryway can make the space feel more inviting, like a warm hug.

If your home has an open floor plan without a defined entryway, use paint to create one. Try a bold color on the wall surrounding the front door and an adjacent wall as visual borders for the entry.

2. Hall bath. Small bathrooms might appear to be limited when it comes to design, but they can easily be transformed with a quick paint color update.

How do you pick a color for this small bathroom? Look around your home for spots of color that crop up in your art or drapes. For example, a living room that is mostly beige with blue accent pieces would coordinate well with a bathroom painted in that same shade of blue.

Dark colors also have been trending with homeowners I‚Äôve worked with lately. To offset the dark nature of the paint, we typically recommend keeping the other design details, such as the floors and sink, light to make sure the room still feels open and bright.

Worried one color will overwhelm the small space? Consider installing a chair rail as a natural divider. Then paint the lower portion of the wall in a statement color while leaving the wall area above a neutral tone.

3. Bookshelf. Whether the bookshelves in your home are built-in or freestanding, you can easily create style with paint. Remove the shelves from the surround and paint the back wall of the case. Don‚Äôt be afraid to go bold with your paint color, because once the shelves and objects on the shelves are in place, your color choice will seem more subtle. You will get an instant pop of color without being too in-your-face.

4. Closet. This space is often overlooked when it comes to paint, but a fresh coat of paint on the walls and shelving in your closet can go a long way. With a small- or medium-sized closet, keep your paint color choice bright and light.

With a large walk-in closet, consider using a paint color that complements the attached room.

For shelving, use an oil-based paint for durability against scratches and scuffs.

5. Hallway. Hallways are typically long and narrow and, depending on the lighting, can also be dark. When choosing a paint color for the hallway, consider the paint colors in connecting rooms and then go one to two shades lighter. The colors will complement each other and coordinate the home‚Äôs overall design. Plus, a lighter shade will brighten up the passageway.

6. Accent wall. If you have a small amount of paint and want to make the biggest impact on your home‚Äôs design, then an accent wall is your best bet. Choose a wall in your living room or master bedroom that you want to highlight, such as the area behind the sofa or bed.

Once it is painted, hang coordinating artwork on the accent wall to finish the design.

7. Kitchen nooks and crannies. Typically, I find there isn‚Äôt too much paintable space in the kitchen. But when I do find it, it‚Äôs between the cabinets, appliances and backsplash.

When space is limited, I always encourage owners to go bold and use colors that offset the room‚Äôs features. For example, in a kitchen with white cabinets and natural stone countertops, pick a hunter green or dark blue. In large quantities, these dark shades might feel overwhelming, but in small quantities, they give the room a strong dimension.

By endorsing the kinds of reforms proposed by Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia, President Trump is offering Congress an opportunity to better consider how new arrivals can contribute to national prosperity.

The United States has about 45 million immigrants and annually welcomes 1.5 million.

About one quarter are here illegally, and in recent years, their number has hardly changed. Declining birth rates abroad and tougher border enforcement have already slowed the inflow.

Canada and Australia face challenges similar to ours ‚Äî falling birth rates, skill shortages and societies defined by waves of immigrants from Europe and Asia ‚Äî and both place priority on the needs of their economies.

In contrast to other industrialized countries, the United States places greater emphasis on family reunification. Green Cards are granted automatically to spouses, minor children and parents of U.S. citizens. Subject to annual limits, entry is granted to other relatives of citizens, legal immigrants and refugees, and those who can contribute to economic growth.

Ultimately, about 65 percent of immigrant visas are based on family ties and 15 percent on employment. The remainder is mostly through a lottery for underrepresented countries.

The Cotton-Perdue bill would limit family reunification visas to minor children and spouses, end the lottery and focus on workforce needs.

Potential economic growth is determined by the sum of productivity and labor force growth. Both have fallen, causing many economists to conclude 2 percent growth is inevitable. However, missing from this is a discussion of labor force quality.

Innovations in robotics, artificial intelligence and other areas indicate broad opportunities to boost productivity, but American businesses face shortages of skilled technicians and engineers to fully exploit those.

And there‚Äôs no better dragstrip than Atco Dragway in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, a muscle car hotbed and home to the legendary Jersey Devil.

That‚Äôs where I had the chance to strap into the driver‚Äôs seat and take a Demon for a dozen runs. I should say ‚Äúthe seat,‚Äù because it comes with only one, making it the world‚Äôs most awesome pizza delivery vehicle.

And it can haul.

The Demon is the most powerful American car ever made. It has a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 that puts out 808 hp and still gets 22 mph on the highway. It‚Äôs an update of the Challenger SRT Hellcat‚Äôs 707 hp motor, which now seems quaint ‚Äî even more so if you fit the Demon with the special engine control module, included in a tool-and-parts kit called the Demon Crate, that allows it to run on 100 octane race gas and bumps the power up to 840 hp to go with its 770 lb-ft of torque.

Over half of the Hellcat engine‚Äôs components were modified in the, including the block, and a monstrous 2.7-liter supercharger strapped on to the top of it. The Demon‚Äôs 8-speed automatic transmission, driveshaft, differential and half shafts are appropriately beefed-up, as well.

There is no manual transmission available, but the automatic is one of the coolest ever made. It‚Äôs equipped with a feature called a TransBrake. It‚Äôs a drag racing technology that, in this case, engages first and second gears simultaneously to bind the transmission, so you can step on the gas to build up torque in the engine and drivetrain without having to use the brakes, which wouldn‚Äôt be able to hold back much of what the Demon dishes out before the tires started spinning. Meanwhile, a torque converter with a high stall speed lets you rev engine even higher than you normally could without moving as you await the green light.

Before we get to that, a few other notes on the Challenger‚Äôs transformation from Hellcat to Demon. With the project‚Äôs goals being a sub-10-second quarter-mile and the ability to lift the front wheels on launch, the SRT team knew it had to trim a few pounds ‚Äî 232 pounds, it turns out ‚Äî from the coupe‚Äôs over 2-ton weight.

Eliminating the passenger seat and rear bench (both can be added back in for $1 each) along with the trunk carpet and spare tire was the easy part. Swapping in some lightweight suspension parts and smaller brakes is indicative of the Demon‚Äôs drag racing focus ‚Äî although it retains its computer-controlled shock absorber system and still handles pretty well for a behemoth.

The suspension plays an important role in the Demon‚Äôs straight-line speed, too. When you set the car to Drag Mode, it stiffens the rear shocks and softens the fronts to help transfer the weight to the meaty, 12.4-inch wide Nitto drag radials at launch. The result is a car that can cover a quarter mile in 9.96 seconds on premium fuel and 9.65 seconds on race gas in ideal conditions with a set of skinny ‚Äúfront-runner‚Äù tires installed. The Demon Crate comes with a set of rims for a pair.

The first time I gave it a shot, I skipped the TransBrake and used the traditional launch control system to get a feel for things. And oh, how it felt.

You simply press the brake pedal hard, floor the gas, release the brake and become one with the deep bucket seat. I‚Äôve been in quick production cars before, but none prepared me for the violence the Demon took off with. The thunder coming out of the exhaust mixed with the screeching supercharger enhanced the experience in a way the silent electric motors of a ‚ÄòLudicrous‚Äô Tesla never could.

And it pulled all the way down the strip, which I covered in 10.2 seconds at 134 mph. And to think that launch control neuters the car. Using the TransBrake is the way to unleash its full abilities, but you‚Äôll need plenty of your own to go with it.

To engage it, you pull both paddles behind the steering wheel, give it some gas (but not too much) and then, when the screen on the instrument cluster tells you it‚Äôs OK, you let one paddle go and take your foot off the brake.

It‚Äôll let you sit there like that for about 15 seconds. You release the other paddle to get moving, and then it‚Äôs all you. There‚Äôs no traction control in this mode, so you need to modulate the throttle to keep from smoking the tires. It‚Äôs easier said than done with all that power, even on a strip prepped with sticky traction compound and rubbered-in. On my first three tries, I botched it pretty good.

I eventually managed to get away cleanly a couple of times, but never did better than the launch control. I‚Äôm sure a drag racing regular could.

Jim Wilder, the Demon‚Äôs development manager, is one of those. He took me for a run in a two-seat car with front-runners on it and pretty much all I can remember is getting walloped in the back and looking at the sky as we left the line. He may have overseen its development, but the launch control has nothing on him. I was so taken aback by the ride that I spaced out and forgot to check his time. Pride wouldn‚Äôt allow me to tell you what it was, anyway.

Dodge isn‚Äôt the first to hop up a Hellcat, of course. Plenty of shops have figured out how to get this much power and more out of it. The difference is that the Demon comes with a warranty. Wilder said his team did over 500 quarter-mile runs on a single axle, and more than 900 with the same transmission, and both looked like new when they pulled them out to inspect them. It‚Äôs doubtful any Demons will see that much action in the real world.

The Demon starts at $86,090. That‚Äôs a lot for a toy, and that‚Äôs exactly what it is. But it‚Äôs likely a steal at that price.

Dodge is building only 3,300 of them for the U.S. and Canada, and they‚Äôve all been allocated. It did its best to keep dealers from marking them up, but some people are already trying to flip cars they don‚Äôt have yet for double what they‚Äôre paying, and a few probably will. If not now, then in a few years at one of those collector car auctions on TV.

That is, unless Dodge manages to outdo itself. When the Hellcat came out a few years ago, everyone thought it marked the end of days for the muscle car, and then they went and made the Demon and turned the Hellcat into a commodity. While it is a one-year-and-done model, the Challenger is going to be around at least until 2020, so there‚Äôs time for an even more evil encore.

But what the devil would they call it?

Out of sight, out of mind. When you think about your dream kitchen, what do you imagine? I‚Äôll bet the garbage bin is not the first thing that comes to mind. But then, this is the whole point of a waste pullout: It tucks the garbage, recycling and other waste bins out of sight but within easy access. That way you don‚Äôt have to look at a messy freestanding bin or struggle with a tiny, seemingly always full can tucked under the sink.

In fact, it‚Äôs quite common for a pullout drawer to be faced out with multiple false fronts to help it blend more seamlessly into a cabinet scheme.

Ease of use. If you cook often, one of the trickiest and yet most common tasks is sweeping away the remnants from chopping. You can carefully carry a chopping board to the bin, or you can bring the bin to the chopping board. Locating your garbage or compost pullout below a chopping zone means you can sweep waste directly into the bin with ease.

Here‚Äôs another smart take on this idea: a pullout chopping block (in place of a typical drawer) positioned above a waste pullout, with a simple hole to allow for trimmings to be swept directly into the bin. A great option for small kitchens, as the whole chopping station can be closed away when not in use, and the main counter can still be used for other things.

Waste sorting. Pullout cabinets aren‚Äôt just useful for holding your garbage bins. More and more cities today not only facilitate recycling or composting, they also require some level of waste sorting, and this requires managing multiple bins.

Depending on the system you use, you can easily have space for two sizable bins, or many smaller ones, configured with one tucked behind the other in a full-depth cabinet, or side by side, or many other configurations to suit your typical needs.

Odor control. One major concern that people often have with waste bins is the odors that can linger in the kitchen. There are several possible ways to combat this issue, and one is by using compartments with individual lids for organic waste.

Some waste pullout systems even integrate a special bin with a securely sealing lid specifically to hold compost, so you don‚Äôt have to change it with excessive frequency just to keep odors in check. Keep in mind how quickly it will fill; you‚Äôll want to plan ahead so that organic waste isn‚Äôt left sitting exposed to air for too long.

Another option is to put different types of waste into their own cabinets with appropriately sized bins so that you only have to open the relevant compartment at any particular time. You can devote more space for plastics and less for compost, or vice versa, depending on your needs.

All-in-one storage. If you want to make sure nobody has an excuse for not changing the bin when it‚Äôs full, try a drawer that includes a small storage drawer inside, and you can keep garbage bags and related products right by the bins themselves.

You can also use interior drawers to split compartments into smaller subcompartments or to keep cleaning products or deodorizers on hand.

A fit for any budget. Want a fully luxe look? For just a little extra investment, a system with side panels (which can be custom fitted by your cabinetmaker) will more fully cover the bins for a discreet look even while the cabinet is pulled open.

Meanwhile, at the other end of the budget spectrum, pullout systems integrated into a standard door cabinet can turn any underused space into a garbage pullout with room for multiple bins without a total renovation. Plus, for dexterous chefs, they can be pulled and pushed by foot to facilitate disposal even when hands are full.",7 reasons to consider pullout waste and recycling cabinets,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/08/03/7-reasons-to-consider-pullout-waste-and-recycling-cabinets.html

Fortunately for us noobs, Lauren Orsini, the author of ""Cosplay: The Fantasy World of Role Play,"" is giving Fox News the answer.

A COSPLAY SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR COMIC CON ATTENDEES

Orisini explains that the concept of ""cosplaying"" was first practiced by Americans at World-Con in 1939, but the word ""cosplay"" ‚Äî a portmanteau of the words cosplay and play ‚Äî created by Japanese journalist Nobuyuki Takahashi in 1984.

And as for the difference between cosplay and simply wearing a Halloween costume?

‚ÄúThe best way to tell if somebody is cosplaying, is that they will be assuming the mannerisms of the character that they‚Äôre trying to portray,"" says Orsini, who also added that cosplay costumes are generally more involved than a Halloween costume. ""They don‚Äôt just look like Superman, they might also have a pose like Superman too.‚Äù

BURGER KING'S NEW SPICY NUGGETS ARE A DIRECT ATTACK ON WENDY'S

‚ÄúThe pizza pouch is part of our completely re-engineered ‚Äòoven-hot delivery system,‚Äô‚Äù said Zipporah Allen, Pizza Hut vice president of brand marketing and consumer insight, told NRN on Monday. The pouch, which accommodates three boxed pizzas, was designed for a 20 to 35-minute delivery period.

A post shared by Pizza Hut üçï (@pizzahut) on Oct 9, 2017 at 2:17pm PDT

The pouch‚Äôs three layers consist of a 3M Thinsulate lining, a heat-reflecting aluminum material and a polyester fiber padding. Each layer was meticulously thought out, drawing from materials used in cold-weather jackets, space blankets and home insulation.

Along with the updated pizza pouch, the new box comes with some fresh features of its own. In addition to the heat-trapping corrugated sides, there will be a new tray for the pizza to sit on.

‚ÄúIn particular, the crisp sheet will go into every Pizza Hut box,‚Äù Allen said. ‚ÄúThe role of the crisp sheet is to keep the crust crisp and craveable as the pizza is being transported from the oven the consumer.‚Äù

In a statement provided to the Alaska Dispatch News, Iditarod officials said that the changes were made after a ‚Äúsingle musher‚Äôs team‚Äù tested positive for ‚Äúa prohibited substance‚Äù during the last running of the race. Citing legal concerns and confidentiality, Chas St. George, an Iditarod spokesperson, did not say who the musher was, what drugs the dogs tested positive for or where on the 979-mile route the dogs were tested.

Before the rule change, officials were prevented from disqualifying a musher because they could not prove his or her intent. The revised regulations stipulate that mushers will be ‚Äústrictly liable‚Äù for any positive drug tests.

‚ÄúAny musher who is found to be responsible, either directly or indirectly, for tampering with another musher‚Äôs dogs, foods, snacks or supplies, or tampering in any other manner, which effects the results of drug testing results of another musher‚Äôs dogs will be subject to discipline of disqualification and/or a ban from the Race,‚Äù the updated rules state.

If a musher is believed to be giving to pups performance-enhancing drugs -- which includes everything from common painkillers to blood doping like the kind used by some professional cyclists -- he or she could be brought before a review panel to prove ""by clear and convincing evidence that the positive tests resulted from causes completely beyond their control.‚Äù That evidence can include the musher taking a polygraph test.

Veterinarians working at the race collect urine samples from dogs at the ceremonial start in Anchorage, randomly along the race route and ‚Äì for the top 20 teams ‚Äì at the end of the race.

""We have to have a rule that is enforceable,"" Wade Marrs, who serves as the musher representative on the Iditarod board, told the Dispatch News. ""If we can't enforce it, then what's stopping people from getting out there and doing it all the time?""

One concern, however, among mushers is that someone will tamper with the dogs‚Äô food and snacks as mushers don‚Äôt always have eyes on their team. Mushers send food to checkpoints weeks in advance and also spend time eating and sleeping away from the dogs ‚Äì all times when someone could give their dogs a prohibited substance.

""I am strongly supportive and I appreciate the board for trying to enforce the drug dog policy, but I think it's a mistake to leave the mushers in a place where they can be sabotaged and have no recourse,"" reigning Iditarod champion Mitch Seavey said.

Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told lawmakers during a closed session of parliament that Iran ""will never renegotiate"" the deal brokered with the U.S. and five other world powers, the semi-official Fars news agency reported.

The nuclear agreement required Iran to curb its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. The state-run IRNA news agency quoted Zarif as saying Iran will offer a ""tougher response"" if the U.S. breaks the agreement.

Trump is expected to decline this week to certify Iran's compliance and refer the matter to Congress. He also is expected to target Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard with new sanctions. On Tuesday, the State Department offered $12 million for information leading to the location, arrest or conviction of two senior leaders of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told a Cabinet meeting that Trump's speech will make clear ""which is the rebellious government, and which is the side that violates international rules.""

If the U.S. backs out of the nuclear deal, ""it won't be our failure at all, but a failure for the other side,"" Rouhani said, according to state TV. He added that any effort to target the Revolutionary Guard would be a ""double mistake.""

Trump, who has called the nuclear agreement the ""worst deal ever,"" must recertify the measure by Oct. 15 because of unilateral conditions set by Congress.

British Prime Minister Theresa May meanwhile urged the United States to extend the nuclear deal, saying it is ""vitally important for regional security.""

May's office said she and Trump spoke late Tuesday and both sides agreed their teams would remain in contact ahead of Trump's decision on the pact.

The British government said Wednesday that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson had called Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to underscore British support for the deal.

Johnson said the agreement ""was the culmination of 13 years of painstaking diplomacy and has increased security, both in the region and in the UK. It is these security implications that we continue to encourage the U.S. to consider.""

The Foreign Office said Johnson also spoke to Zarif and will meet Ali Akhbar Salehi, Iran's vice president and head of its nuclear agency, in London on Wednesday.

China, France, Russia, Germany, Britain and the European Union all ratified the deal.

On Tuesday, Salehi warned Washington against undermining the 2015 deal, saying international nonproliferation efforts as well as Washington's international standing would suffer as a result.

Speaking at an international conference on enhancing nuclear safety in Rome, Salehi said that Washington's recent ""delusionary negative postures do not augur well"" for keeping the deal intact.

He said Iran didn't want to see the deal unravel but that ""much more is at stake for the entire international community than the national interests of Iran.""

The U.S. administration has faced two 90-day certification deadlines to state whether Iran is meeting the conditions needed to continue enjoying sanctions relief under the deal and has both times backed away from a showdown. But Trump more recently has said he does not expect to certify Iran's compliance with the October deadline looming.

One immigrant who achieved the American Dream and helped thousands more young people do so as well was Jack Kent Cooke. Born in Canada in 1912, he never had the chance to go to college, leaving high school during the Great Depression to help support his struggling family. He went from selling encyclopedias door to door, to leading a band, to being a runner on the floor of the Toronto Stock Exchange, to working as a salesman, to managing radio stations.

Cooke kept working his way up, becoming a part-owner of radio stations, newspapers and a magazine, and then buying a minor league baseball team in Toronto and other businesses. He immigrated to the United States in 1960 and became an even more successful businessman and owner of sports teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers, the Los Angeles Kings and the Washington Redskins.

The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which I now head as executive director, has awarded $175 million in scholarships to more than 2,300 high-achieving, low-income students from 8th grade through graduate school, along with comprehensive counseling and other support services. The foundation has also provided over $97 million in grants to organizations that serve such students.

Every year, the Cooke Foundation finds absolutely brilliant students who have overcome incredible obstacles and gives them scholarships. Some of our Cooke Scholars have been homeless, have gone hungry, have been undocumented, have suffered from serious illnesses, have been kicked out of their homes after announcing they were LGBT, have been teenage parents, and have faced other big challenges.

Yet Cooke Scholars have graduated with distinction from some of the top colleges and universities in the world. Some have become physicians, created nonprofit organizations to help others in need, become medical researchers working to prevent and cure diseases, launched successful businesses, become professors, started charter schools, written books, and taken on many other important rules. How sad it would have been if they never had the chance to get a college education and instead spent their lives in dead-end jobs.

Yet a stereotype persists that ‚Äì to put it crudely ‚Äì poor kids are dumb. Our Cooke Scholars prove every day that this is nonsense. They are some of the smartest and most capable people on our planet. All they needed was a helping hand and financial aid to succeed.

What‚Äôs lacking isn‚Äôt brainpower among those with low incomes. What‚Äôs lacking is the opportunity to get a higher education and the money to pay for it.

But we should be embarrassed that millions of low-income young people who do these things and are enormously talented hit a cash ceiling when they try to better themselves with a college degree. They should not be denied equal educational opportunity simply because they were born into families of modest means.

As the rape and sexual harassment accusations against movie mogul and Democratic donor Harvey Weinstein continue to aggregate, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand how Mr. Weinstein‚Äôs alleged offenses were not reported until the publication of a story last week in the New York Times . Even since the report, many of Mr. Weinstein‚Äôs associates are still reluctant to comment.

The website Mediaite takes note of an exchange this afternoon on CNN:

Hillary Clinton finally released a statement condemning Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, but CNN‚Äôs Dana Bash had to ask this afternoon, ‚ÄúWhere are the Obamas?‚Äù

Weinstein was a big Democratic fundraiser, and gave money to both Clinton and Barack Obama (though Clinton‚Äôs statement does not mention the donations or whether she will be giving them away).

‚ÄúWhere is Michelle Obama? Where is President Obama?‚Äù Bash asked. ‚ÄúHarvey Weinstein was, and probably is, still a big supporter of them and certainly of‚Ä¶the President‚Äôs political efforts.‚Äù

Chris Cillizza brought up when the former First Lady praised Weinstein during a student film symposium at the White House, saying that the Obamas need to be speaking out now and it‚Äôs ‚Äúodd‚Äù that they aren‚Äôt.

During the 2013 White House event, Michelle Obama called Mr. Weinstein ‚Äúa wonderful human being, a good friend and just a powerhouse.‚Äù

Wonderful is not the word that comes to mind when reading a heartbreaking new report by Ronan Farrow in the New Yorker detailing three separate rape allegations against Mr. Weinstein. The piece also alleges other cases of harassment followed by career setbacks for the alleged victims:

When I look at how badly Washington, D.C., governs, the idea of secession doesn't scare me.","The United States was born when the Founding Fathers seceded from England.

So why do so many people now see secession as a terrible thing?

Recently, people in Catalonia voted to break away from Spain -- not to declare war on Spain or refuse to trade with Spain, just to control their own affairs.

The Spanish government said they must not even vote. They sent police to shut down polling places and beat protestors into staying off the streets.

Governments never want to give up power.

The European Union was offended and American politicians shocked when the United Kingdom voted to exit the EU (Brexit). Pundits declared Britain's move a terrible mistake.

But local governments can be more responsive to the needs of constituents. No government is perfect. But keeping government close to home, keeping it local, makes it easier to keep an eye on it.

The powerful prefer one big central government. Some want the whole world to answer to one government.

President Ulysses S. Grant fantasized about countries becoming ""one nation, so that armies and navies are no longer necessary.""

President Harry Truman wanted a World Court. Just as American disputes are settled by our Supreme Court, he said, ""There is not a difficulty in the whole world that cannot be settled in exactly the same way in a world court.""

But central authorities aren't the best way to solve our problems. Competition is.

In the U.S., state governments behave not because their politicians are noble, but because people can ""vote with their feet"" -- move to other states.

If taxes get too high in New York, you can move Florida.

As California tortures businesses, Californians move to Arizona and Texas.

The more governments from which you can choose, the easier it is to benefit from competition between them.

All Americans, however, must obey rules set by Washington, D.C.

But what if most people in a state reject those rules and demand the right to govern themselves?

There have been several secession movements in California -- a plan to break California up into smaller states, a push to make Northern California a breakaway state called Jefferson, and now the ""Yes California"" movement that wants to make California a separate country.

Calexit's proponents say Californians shouldn't have to answer to that evil President Trump.

If Calexit ever happened, I suppose conservative parts of the state would vote to separate from the leftists who dominate Sacramento. Maybe we'd end up with three countries where there used to be one.

When I look at how badly Washington, D.C., governs, the idea of secession doesn't scare me.

After the Cold War, Czechoslovakia split into Slovakia and the Czech Republic. ""Tensions between Czechs and Slovaks have disappeared,"" writes Marian Tupy, a Cato Institute analyst born in Czechoslovakia. ""Czechs no longer subsidize their poorer cousins in the east, while Slovaks no longer blame their problems on their 'big brother' in the west. Everyone has won.""

Secession frightens some Americans because they associate it with slavery. Preserving that despicable practice was one reason southern states wanted to break away.

But obviously, one can favor secession without supporting slavery. Even some abolitionists, anti-slavery activists in the 19th century, supported the right to secede.

More recently, some black neighborhoods on the outskirts of Boston argued for turning the Greater Roxbury area into a new city called Mandela. They say it would be more responsive to locals' needs.

In New York City, Republicans on Staten Island sometimes argue for breaking away from the Democrats who mismanage the rest of New York. During the Obama administration, some Texans wanted a vote on ""Texit.""

None of those things is likely to happen, but I'm wary of any government that hates the idea of people escaping its influence.

President Trump weighed in on Catalonian independence. He's against it. ""I would like to see Spain continue to be united,"" said the president.

It's easy to love a big central government when you're in charge of one. Also, national governments can inspire proud nationalist sentiments.

But Catalans smarting from police batons probably feel differently.

‚ÄúI had never been looking for a meeting neither with Trump Jr., nor Sr., nor his team,‚Äù Veselnitskaya told Fox News in an email, sent in Russian and translated to English by her translator. Veselnitskaya wrote, however, that she ‚Äúhad been told‚Äù Trump Jr. ‚Äúcould help‚Äù her bring information to members of Congress about the Magnitsky Act, which Moscow adamantly opposed.

TRUMP TOWER MEETING WASN'T ABOUT CLINTON 'DIRT,' EMAILS SHOW

‚ÄúIf Hillary Clinton or anybody from her environment could have been such an individual [to help], I also would have passed that information [to her],‚Äù Veselnitskaya wrote.

The June 2016 meeting was first reported by The New York Times over the summer, reigniting claims that the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia in the presidential election.

Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort were known to have attended the meeting with Veselnitskaya, Russian-born lobbyist Rinat Ahkmetshin and music publicist Rob Goldstone, who brokered the get-together promising campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton.

Veselnitskaya told Fox News on Wednesday that the information being shared in the Trump Tower meeting ‚Äúwas not confidential,‚Äù but also ‚Äúwas not public.‚Äù ‚ÄúI wanted to make it public,‚Äù Veselnitskaya said in the email. ‚ÄúBecause I naively thought there should be justice in the US for the fraudsters fostering hatred between the two of our countries.‚Äù

The suggestion that she would have made contact with Clinton further challenges the notion that the meeting was about anything other than sanctions.

The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on correspondence between Veselnitskaya and Goldstone, likewise suggesting the meeting was not set up to pass on damaging information about Clinton on behalf of the Russian government.

RUSSIAN ATTORNEY RIPS ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER AS 'CHEAP GOSSIP,' AMID QUESTIONS OVER ORIGIN

The emails show Veselnitskaya requesting to invite Akhmetshin to the meeting, saying he had ‚Äúinvaluable knowledge about the positions held by the members of the Foreign Relations Committee that will be important to our discussion,‚Äù the Wall Street Journal reported.

While Veselnitskaya -- in correspondence at the time and comments made more recently -- has countered claims that the meeting might have dealt with Clinton dirt, that narrative emerged thanks to the originally published correspondence between Trump Jr. and Goldstone.

Goldstone said at the time that he could set up a meeting to provide ‚Äúvery high level and sensitive information‚Äù compromising Clinton‚Äôs election chances as part of ‚ÄúRussia and its government‚Äôs support for Mr. Trump.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs what you say, I love it,‚Äù Trump Jr. wrote in response.

It remains unclear what Goldstone was referring to.

Following the controversy, Trump Jr. defended himself, saying Veselnitskaya did not have any such information and wanted to focus on other non-election-related issues. She echoed his view on multiple occasions.

The emails were released by Scott Balber, an attorney for Aras Agalarov, who helped organize the meeting with Trump Jr.

Balber also told the Journal that the Russian lawyer has been fighting the Magnitsky Act for years and reached out to numerous Russian authorities.

As part of her effort against the sanctions law, Veselnitskaya reportedly had talking points that included one reference to Clinton, suggesting a U.S. company had avoided taxes in Russia and donated to the Democratic Party, possibly Clinton.

Francisco Franco.","The Spanish government, in what appeared to be a veiled threat on Wednesday, said it wanted clarification on whether Catalan's leader actually made a controversial declaration of independence.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the central government could limit or rescind the province‚Äôs autonomy depending on the Catalan government‚Äôs response, saying it would be crucial in deciding ‚Äúevents over the coming days.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe want to offer clarity and judicial security. The answer of the Generalitat (Catalan government) will mark events in coming days,‚Äù Rajoy tweeted after appearing at a special Cabinet meeting to respond to an announcement from the head of the wealthy Catalonia region, Carles Puigdemont, that he was proceeding with a declaration of independence. Puigdemont, however, said the official declaration would be suspended for several weeks to facilitate negotiations.

‚ÄúIf Puigdemont returns to legality, the uncertainty ends,‚Äù Rajoy tweeted. ‚ÄúWe advocate to recover institutional normality.‚Äù

It is the first time Rajoy had openly said Article 155 of the Spanish constitution will be the next step taken by government if Catalan authorities don‚Äôt backtrack. He said the government ‚Äúwants to offer certainty to citizens‚Äù and it is ‚Äúnecessary to return tranquility and calm.‚Äù

Rajoy‚Äôs comments followed a highly anticipated speech Puigdemont gave Tuesday night in which he said the landslide victory in the disputed Oct. 1 referendum gave his government the ground to implement its long-held desire to break century-old ties with Spain.

While pushing forward with secession, however, Puigdemont proposed the regional parliament hold off on the declaration to commence a dialogue with the central government in Madrid to help reduce tension.

The Spanish government has given little indication it is willing to talk, saying it did not accept the declaration and did not consider the referendum or its results to be valid.

The tension between Madrid and Catalonia is being considered the country‚Äôs worst political crisis in decades.

Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said the Puigdemont ""doesn't know where he is, where he is going and with whom he wants to go.""

She said Puigdemont had put Catalonia ""in the greatest level of uncertainty seen yet.""

Article 155 of the Constitution allows the central government to take some or total control of any of its 17 regions if they don't comply with their legal obligations. This would begin with a Cabinet meeting and a warning to the regional government to fall into line. Then, the Senate could be called to approve the measure.

Some 2.3 million Catalans -- or 43 percent of the electorate in the northeastern region -- voted in the referendum. Regional authorities say 90 percent were in favor and declared the results valid. Those who opposed the referendum had said they would boycott the vote.

Rajoy's government had repeatedly refused to grant Catalonia permission to hold a referendum on the grounds that it was unconstitutional, since it would only poll a portion of Spain's 46 million residents.

Catalonia's separatist camp has grown in recent years, strengthened by Spain's recent economic crisis and by Madrid's rejection of attempts to increase self-rule in the region.

The political deadlock has plunged Spain into its deepest political crisis in more than four decades, since democratic rule was restored following the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco.

Awan pleaded not guilty in September to multiple federal charges including bank fraud and conspiracy. A grand jury had returned an indictment in August in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia charging Imran Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, with a total of four charges.

Perry, a member of the Homeland Security subcommittee on cyber security, said Tuesday that the House Office of Inspector General tracked the network usage of Awan and his associates on House servers and found that a ‚Äúmassive‚Äù amount of data was flowing from the networks.

Awan and other IT aides for House Democrats had been on investigators‚Äô radar for months over concerns of possible double-billing, alleged equipment theft and access to sensitive computer systems. Most lawmakers fired Awan in February, but Wasserman Schultz had kept him on until his arrest in July.

THE DEMOCRATS‚Äô IT SCANDAL JUST GOT EVEN MORE BIZARRE

According to Perry, more than 5,700 logins by the five Awan associates were discovered on a single server within the House and 5,400 of those logins appeared unauthorized. That server, Perry said, belonged to then-Democratic Rep. Xavier Becerra, who is now attorney general in California.

Perry said a criminal investigation by Capitol Police begun after the House Office of Inspector General reported its findings into Awan and his associates last year.

The congressman said Capitol Police determined that an image they asked Imran to provide was falsified, believing it to be a ‚Äúdeliberate attempt to conceal the activities that they knew were against House policy and the law.‚Äù

Perry also discussed how Capitol Police recovered a bag with a laptop featuring Wasserman Shultz‚Äôs initials from a phone booth after midnight in the Rayburn building about two months after House investigators barred Awan and his coterie from access to House computer networks.

The indictment itself addresses separate allegations that Awan and his wife engaged in a conspiracy to obtain home equity lines of credit from the Congressional Federal Credit Union by giving false information about two properties ‚Äì and then sending the proceeds to individuals in Pakistan.

The case has put renewed scrutiny on Wasserman Schultz for keeping Awan on the payroll for months, even after a criminal investigation was revealed and he was barred from the House IT network.

In a recent interview published in the Sun Sentinel, Wasserman Schultz blamed the ‚Äúright-wing media circus fringe‚Äù for the attention on Awan. The former head of the Democratic National Committee has suggested it's all part of an effort to distract from the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign and possible ties to President Trump's team.

After Awan was arrested at Dulles airport in Virginia trying to board a plane to Pakistan, attorney Christopher Gowen told Fox News that federal authorities have no evidence of misconduct by Awan relating to his IT duties.

He recalls the first day he stepped on American soil:‚ÄúIt was a very beautiful day,‚Äù he says.
Instead, he started working for the Minneapolis School District and then the city‚Äôs housing authority.
Along the way, Tufaa maried and he and his wife have five children ranging in age from eight to 21.
‚ÄúI believe in the American dream because I appreciate what this country can provide to people like me,‚Äù Tufaa says.","When Minneapolis entrepreneur Tashitaa Tufaa came to the United States from his native Ethiopia he quickly embodied the American spirit.

The political refugee, now in his late 40s, came to this country in 1992 with nothing to his name and worked his way up from washing dishes to running his own transportation company that still continues to grow.

Tufaa says that his drive was inspired by his adopted home.

‚ÄúI had read a lot about America,‚Äù he said in a recent interview with Fox News. ‚ÄúEven though I had never been, I have always been a fan of the American way.‚Äù

Tuftaa was born in the Ethiopian village of Aloo and grew up working on his family‚Äôs farm with his 13 siblings until he attended an American college in Zimbabwe. He eventually returned to Ethiopia, where he was a history and English teacher until the early 90s when he decided to leave due to his native country‚Äôs changing political climate.

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt forced to leave my country,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI just knew that it was time to leave when I saw politicians fleeing. I knew it wasn‚Äôt safe. I came here and decided not to go back.‚Äù

‚ÄúEven though I had never been, I have always been a fan of the American way...‚Äù - Tashitaa Tufaa

He was granted political asylum and wound up in the city of Minneapolis, where he stayed in low-income housing with old college friends who had emigrated from Zimbabwe. He recalls the first day he stepped on American soil:

‚ÄúIt was a very beautiful day,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI was in downtown Minneapolis. I was amazed by the tall buildings and how clean it was compared to where I came from.‚Äù

Tufaa says that during those initial days in the U.S. it was difficult to find a job, but he never once thought about wavering.

‚ÄúIt was definitely hard. If you wanted a white-collar job, there were not many available,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMy first job was as a dishwasher at the Minneapolis Hilton for $5.60 an hour and I thought at the time that it was great.‚Äù

Tufaa washed dishes for about ten months before moving on to a manufacturing job and a security position before enrolling in graduate school at the University of Minnesota. He continued working security jobs as he went through school.

‚ÄúI would work until midnight and during the day in between my morning and afternoon classes,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúI had few hours to sleep, but the biggest thing was these opportunities for work. We were not able to get this back home. You were lucky if you were able to get one job, here, I could get three jobs.‚Äù

Tufaa eventually graduated from school and wanted to pursue a career as a diplomat but quickly found out that he would have to be a U.S. citizen to do so (he became a citizen in 2000). Instead, he started working for the Minneapolis School District and then the city‚Äôs housing authority. He also worked extra jobs as a taxi and bus driver.

‚ÄúI would leave work at 4:30 and then go drive a bus,‚Äù he says.

In 2003, he was laid off from his job with the city.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when I decided to form my own company.‚Äù

The determined Tufaa set out to market himself to school districts in the area, looking to provide transportation services for students.

‚ÄúIt was rough building it up,‚Äù the entrepreneur said. ‚ÄúOn paper, my company was incorporated, but technically, I had no experience. People generally don‚Äôt trust you if you can‚Äôt show them your experience.‚Äù

In September of that year, Tufaa finally started gaining that experience when he started providing bus services to a handful of special needs students. School administrators took notice of the stellar job he did and he started receiving more and more work from the district, putting nearly all of his profits back into the business.

Eventually, Tufaa was able to establish his company, Metropolitan Transportation Network (MetroTN) and soon after he received his first large contract with the Beacon Academy School after their original bus provider went out of business mid-year. About 300 of the school‚Äôs 400 plus students ride MetroTN buses to this day.

Business continued to grow for Tufaa and MetroTN now boasts three facilities in the state, with a fourth on the way in October. The company currently includes 300 employees, including several family members who also emigrated from Ethiopia.

‚ÄúThey had to apply like everyone else,‚Äù he says, half-joking.

Along the way, Tufaa maried and he and his wife have five children ranging in age from eight to 21.

He looks to continue the expansion of MetroTN and serve other facets of public transportation in the city he has called home for nearly 25 years.

‚ÄúI believe in the American dream because I appreciate what this country can provide to people like me,‚Äù Tufaa says.

‚ÄúIf you are free, you can exercise your talents in many different ways. I am free as long as I don‚Äôt do anything illegal. I can do anything.""",American Dream is alive and well for African immigrant entrepreneur,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/28/american-dream-is-alive-and-well-for-african-immigrant-entrepreneur.html

Fox News obtained a letter on Tuesday sent by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to the league's owners confirming the rule change would be discussed.

‚ÄúWe live in a country that can feel very divided. Sports, and especially the NFL, brings people together and lets them set aside those divisions, at least for a few hours.

‚ÄúIt is an important moment in our game. We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us,‚Äù Goodell wrote.

Goodell noted, however, the NFL respects the opinions of players who've knelt, sat or raised a fist in protest.

‚ÄúBuilding on many discussions with clubs and players, we have worked to develop a plan that we will review with you at next week‚Äôs League meeting,"" Goodell wrote. ""This would include such elements as an in-season platform to promote the work of our players on these core issues, and that will help to promote positive change in our country.""

Goodell said conversations with players about the anthem issue would continue and he hoped the NFL and owners could have a ‚Äúfull and open discussion‚Äù during next week‚Äôs meeting.

Goodell's letter follows President Trump‚Äôs tweets Tuesday that suggested the U.S. change its tax laws to punish organizations such as the NFL if members were found to be ‚Äúdisrespecting‚Äù the national anthem or flag.

""Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!"" Trump wrote.

Trump has also called on NFL owners to discipline players who don't stand for the anthem. On Sunday, Vice President Pence walked out on his home-state Indianapolis Colts game when members of the opposing team, the San Francisco 49ers, took a knee during the national anthem.

Pence tweeted around kickoff: ""I left today's Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.""

Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones became the first NFL owner to suggest repercussions for displays of protest during the national anthem.

The protests began last year when former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat or knelt during the national anthem as a way to bring attention to the killings of black men by police officers. Kaepernick, a free agent, has not yet been signed by a team after opting out of his contract with the 49ers.

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you‚Äôre lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath ‚Äî a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child‚Äôs former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book ‚Äî a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant ‚Äî I‚Äôm speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space ‚Äî at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.",How to make use and better your life with a spare bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/28/how-to-make-use-and-better-your-life-with-spare-bedroom.html

The younger Ramsey claims the network‚Äôs report ignored evidence to falsely implicate him.

The lawsuit says CBS and its featured experts set out to conduct a ""sham reinvestigation"" of the murder with ""the preconceived storyline"" that Burke Ramsey killed his sister and conspired with his parents to conceal the truth.

""The accusation that Burke Ramsey killed his sister was based on a compilation of lies, half-truths, manufactured information, and the intentional omission and avoidance of truthful information about the murder of JonBen√©t Ramsey,"" the lawsuit says.

A copy of the father's lawsuit was not immediately available, but was scheduled for a status conference Dec. 15.

The body of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey was found beaten and strangled at her family's home in Boulder on Dec. 26, 1996, just hours after Patsy Ramsey, the girl‚Äôs mother, called 911 to report her daughter missing after discovering a ransom note.

Now, NASA‚Äôs Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has discovered one place on the red planet that held a whole bunch of the life-giving liquid: an incredibly massive lake that, during its peak, held ten times the amount of water of all the Great Lakes, combined.

It‚Äôs an incredible discovery, and one that could help inform future exploration of Mars in the hopes of finding evidence that life once existed there. The idea that Mars was one a life-giving planet much like our own is one that has tantalized scientists for a long, long time, and if they ever hope to prove it, they now have a promising lead on where to start looking.

But even if Mars never hosted living organisms, its colossal lake could still help inform researchers painting the picture of life‚Äôs origins here on Earth. ‚ÄúEven if we never find evidence that there‚Äôs been life on Mars, this site can tell us about the type of environment where life may have begun on Earth,‚Äù Paul Niles of NASA‚Äôs Johnson Space Center explains. ‚ÄúVolcanic activity combined with standing water provided conditions that were likely similar to conditions that existed on Earth at about the same time ‚Äî when early life was evolving here.‚Äù

The lake was discovered thanks to the detection of huge mineral deposits hiding underneath the surface. It is believed that those minerals were the byproduct of volcanic underwater vents, much like those that exist deep in Earth‚Äôs oceans. On our planet, those hydrothermal vents actually host life, but it‚Äôs unclear whether the same was true for ancient Mars.

Roughly one year ago, NBC News sat on the infamous ‚ÄúAccess Hollywood‚Äù tape of then-candidate Trump making lewd sexual comments about women.
NBC News President Noah Oppenheim made the decision not to run Farrow‚Äôs story, according to The Daily Beast.
‚ÄúYou would have to ask NBC and NBC executives about the details of that story,‚Äù Farrow said.
Perhaps Oppenheim didn‚Äôt want to upset a Hollywood powerhouse such as Weinstein when he has ambitions of returning to the movie industry.","NBC News was embarrassed for passing on an explosive sex harassment scoop, with audio confirmation, for the second time in roughly a year after the network didn‚Äôt break Ronan Farrow‚Äôs bombshell on Harvey Weinstein‚Äôs rape allegations that landed in The New Yorker.

Farrow, a former MSNBC host, had his show canceled in 2015 and now has a non-exclusive relationship with NBC. He brought NBC News early reporting on what turned out to be his Weinstein scoop, but network brass felt it didn‚Äôt meet NBC‚Äôs standards and the story was passed on. An NBC insider said Farrow‚Äôs story didn‚Äôt have a specific accuser willing to go on the record at the time.

Farrow then asked if he could bring it to a print outlet, and NBC agreed as long as he promised to discuss the story on ‚ÄúNBC Nightly News‚Äù if it turned out to be newsworthy. Well, it was not only newsworthy, it dominated the entire news cycle and rocked the entertainment industry with new allegations of rape and harassment by one of the most powerful men in Hollywood.

Roughly one year ago, NBC News sat on the infamous ‚ÄúAccess Hollywood‚Äù tape of then-candidate Trump making lewd sexual comments about women. The Washington Post broke the story while NBC News corporate lawyers reportedly considered what to do with the video ‚Äì and the Post took just five hours to vet the same footage. Farrow‚Äôs piece and the ‚ÄúAccess Hollywood‚Äù tape both emerged as enormous stories that no reputable news organization could avoid ‚Äì but NBC had both stories exclusively and sat on them until they appeared on other outlets.

NBC News President Noah Oppenheim made the decision not to run Farrow‚Äôs story, according to The Daily Beast. Oppenheim is a screenwriter who has often told industry colleagues that he‚Äôs likely to one day return to Hollywood and resume that career. He wrote ‚ÄúJackie,‚Äù a film starring Natalie Portman, and was attached to multiple other projects during his years in Los Angeles. At this writing, NBC has not responded to queries about whether The Weinstein Company was involved with any of Oppenheim‚Äôs projects.

Farrow appeared on MSNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Rachel Maddow Show‚Äù on Tuesday night and threw NBC News under the bus when asked why the story ran in The New Yorker instead of the network.

‚ÄúYou would have to ask NBC and NBC executives about the details of that story,‚Äù Farrow said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to comment on any news organization‚Äôs story that they did or didn‚Äôt run. I will say that over many years, many news organizations have circled this story and faced a great deal of pressure in doing so. And there are now reports emerging publicly about the kinds of pressure that news organizations face in this. And that is real.‚Äù

Farrow disagreed when Maddow brought up NBC‚Äôs claim that the story didn‚Äôt meet the network‚Äôs standards, saying he ‚Äúwalked into the door‚Äù of The New Yorker and the magazine ‚Äúimmediately‚Äù recognized that the story was ready for publication. Farrow said it is not accurate to say the story wasn‚Äôt ready for publication when NBC passed on it.

‚ÄúIn fact, there were multiple determinations that it was reportable at NBC,‚Äù he said.

NBC‚Äôs handling of Weinstein‚Äôs sexual harassment allegations have been curious from the start. The HuffPost‚Äôs Yashar Ali pointed out last week that CBS and ABC covered the initial New York Times report, but ‚ÄúNBC Nightly News‚Äù failed to cover it and ‚ÄúToday‚Äù didn‚Äôt give it nearly as much attention as NBC‚Äôs rivals. In addition, NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù failed to address the Weinstein scandal. The show‚Äôs creator, Lorne Michaels, told the Daily Mail that, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a New York thing,‚Äù when he was asked why the show avoided the Weinstein allegations.

Insiders who spoke to Fox News speculated that NBC executives may have been wary of ruining relationships in Hollywood; and brittle from years of bad publicity and tabloid covers about its own stars‚Äô behavior and personal lives.

Farrow‚Äôs standing within NBC may also have been an issue. The young celebrity scion was hired in 2013 with great fanfare and a reported lofty salary to host an MSNBC show that flopped badly, and he‚Äôs drifted around the margins of NBC News ever since. According to the Daily Beast, his four-year contract with NBC has recently expired.

Insiders tell Fox News that Farrow -- who‚Äôs publicly supported his mother Mia Farrow‚Äôs campaign to accuse Farrow‚Äôs father, Woody Allen, of molesting an adopted daughter ‚Äì lacked credibility within NBC as a journalist, especially on the topic of celebrities accused of sexual offenses.

Mediaite‚Äôs Colby Hall pointed out that the network‚Äôs alleged ‚Äúboy‚Äôs club‚Äù mentality could have played a part. Perhaps Oppenheim didn‚Äôt want to upset a Hollywood powerhouse such as Weinstein when he has ambitions of returning to the movie industry. Oppenheim, who was in charge of the ‚ÄúToday‚Äù show when NBC sat on the ‚ÄúAccess Hollywood‚Äù tape of then-host Billy Bush, was promoted to head of the news division shortly after Inauguration Day.

NBC denies these issues had anything to do with their decision to kill the Weinstein story. But Oppenheim and his boss, Andy Lack --- already under considerable pressure over their hugely expensive hire of Megyn Kelly ‚Äì are now scrambling again to give a credible explanation for why they sat on an explosive audiotape of a powerful man behaving badly.

The good news is, Google isn't being purposefully evil.

As The Verge reports, the reason the Home Mini speakers record all sounds is due to a fault with the touch sensor on the top of the device. Google issued a software patch to stop the constant recording happening, and the company must be somewhat relieved it can be fixed remotely with a software update rather than a recall.

The fault was discovered by Artem Russakovskii from Android Police. His report of the ""near-constant"" listening and recording prompted a quick response from Google. Apparently the touch sensor fault is limited to Home Mini speakers given out at Made by Google events.

It's estimated there's at least 4,000 affected devices. So if you own a Home Mini and it wasn't acquired from such an event, you don't need to worry. The fault won't impact the Google Home Max of course as it isn't launching until December.

Foerster resigned Monday, just hours after the release of the video.

""I am resigning from my position with the Miami Dolphins and accept full responsibility for my actions,"" Foerster said in a statement. ""I want to apologize to the organization and my sole focus is on getting the help that I need with the support of my family and medical professionals.""

It wasn't immediately clear when the video was shot.

The Dolphins, in a statement Monday, said they ""have no tolerance for this behavior.""

""After speaking with Chris this morning, he accepted full responsibility and we accepted his resignation effective immediately,"" the statement said. ""Although Chris is no longer with the organization, we will work with him to get the help he needs during this time.""

In the video, the man, widely identified as Foerster, says ""Hey, baby, miss you, thinking about you. How about me going into a meeting and doing this before I go?"" The man then snorts a line of the white powder using a rolled-up $20 bill.

Foerster was in the second year of his second tour of duty with the Dolphins.

Instead, Apple is reportedly afraid Samsung Display will steal its ideas and pass them along to Apple's top rival, Samsung Electronics.
To Apple, Samsung has become a necessary evil.
One such example is the new OLED screen in the iPhone X; only Samsung Display is able to meet Apple's volume and quality demands.
The new handset will supposedly utilize foldable OLED display panels, which isn't exactly a surprise.","The new iPhone X represents the biggest design shift in Apple's iPhone lineup since the original model was released a decade ago. The company's tenth-anniversary iPhone ditches the iconic home button in favor of a nearly all-screen design, and it's also the first iPhone ever to feature an OLED display rather than an LCD displays. Apple's move to OLED screens is long overdue, and the iPhone X is just the first in a long line of iPhones that will sport the newer screen technology.

OLED screens are also believed to play a huge role in an upcoming iPhone design shift that is even more radical than the iPhone X. Interestingly, however, Apple is believed to be ditching its current display supplier -- Samsung Display -- as it works on this exciting new design. Why? It's not a question of display panel quality or technology. Instead, Apple is reportedly afraid Samsung Display will steal its ideas and pass them along to Apple's top rival, Samsung Electronics.

Samsung and Apple have a long history, as anyone who has been following the smartphone industry over the years knows all too well. Back in 2011, Apple filed the first in a long line of lawsuits claiming that Samsung was infringing its patents and stealing its software and hardware designs.

Apple's claims were of course entirely true. Samsung fans will deny it until they're blue in the face, but facts are facts and Samsung rose to the top of the smartphone industry thanks in large part to its efforts to copy Apple as much as possible. Documents exposed during the court proceedings prove this. Just one example is the 132-page document Samsung created to help its engineers copy the iPhone pixel by pixel. You just can't make this stuff up.

The companies went back and forth with lawsuits for years, and in the end Apple was awarded massive damages in excess of $1 billion. Those damages were then reduced time and time again during the appeal process, and now Apple and Samsung seem to have moved past their differences. Sort of.

To Apple, Samsung has become a necessary evil. The company is one of the world's largest suppliers of consumer electronics parts, and Apple has no choice but to use Samsung for many of the components needed for its iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. One such example is the new OLED screen in the iPhone X; only Samsung Display is able to meet Apple's volume and quality demands.

According to a new report, a new type of OLED display will play a major role in the near future in the most radical iPhone redesign the world has ever seen. But these exciting new screens apparently will not be supplied by Samsung Display.

South Korean market news site The Investor reports that Apple has already begun work on a new type of iPhone that could debut sometime in 2020 or later. The new handset will supposedly utilize foldable OLED display panels, which isn't exactly a surprise. The screen inside the iPhone X is foldable as well, and Apple makes use of the tech by folding the bottom of the screen so that it's able to hide the display controller and extend the usable portion of the display all the way to the bottom of the phone.

In the case of this mysterious new iPhone Apple is said to be developing for the future, however, the foldable OLED panel will be used in a different way. According to the report, which cites a separate report from Korean-language news publication The Bell, the iPhone itself may be able to fold.

Samsung is expected to release its first foldable smartphone with a flexible OLED screen next year, but Apple apparently has something special brewing behind closed doors. In fact, it's so special that the company supposedly thinks Samsung Display will steal its ideas and pass them off to Samsung Electronics, so Apple has turned to Samsung rival LG Display to help develop this new OLED screen technology.

""LG Display recently created a task force to develop a foldable OLED screen for the new iPhone model, while its parts-making sister firm LG Innotek has also setup a team dedicated to developing the rigid flexible printed circuit board,"" the report claims.

It's unclear exactly what Apple's plans are for a potentially foldable iPhone, but they must be pretty intriguing if the company feels it needs to dump its current OLED screen provider in order to keep the plans a secret.","Apple is working on a revolutionary new iPhone, but it's worried Samsung will steal the design",https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/11/apple-is-working-on-revolutionary-new-iphone-but-its-worried-samsung-will-steal-design.html

Also, the attack displayed our citizenry‚Äôs continuing unawareness of the possibility they could be caught up in a violent attack anywhere large crowds gather. Like the Boston Bombing in 2013, the Vegas attack was carried out on an open-air location that does not have the benefit of a controlled space surrounded by stadium walls that protect the patrons from an outside attack.

Like the Vegas attack, the tragic outcomes of most large domestic attacks that have occurred in the U.S. could have been mitigated using military defensive tactics in and around special events and populated areas. Likewise, with just a little effort, most people could have dramatically improved their survival rate by increasing their awareness before attending. Utilizing the same information as the bad guys, the patrons themselves could have made educated predictions of where, when and how an attacker may strike.

Consider the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England on May 22 of this year. The attackers knew that getting a bomb inside the moderately secured (hardened) stadium would be a very difficult procedure. Instead, the attackers determined the most effective place to carry out their attack would be the critical area outside the stadium at the main location for patron pick up and drop off at the end of the concert. Tragically, most of those killed would likely still be alive if they had understood it was possible to conduct the same target analysis as the bad guys, utilizing the same internet information, same venue schedules and same understanding of the location at event time to determine the critical areas and critical times of that venue that should be avoided.

If citizens and law enforcement officials start to understand this attacker mindset and their methods of information collection and mission planning, they will start to ask the proper questions.

If citizens and law enforcement officials start to understand this attacker mindset and their methods of information collection and mission planning, they will start to ask the proper questions. For instance: Why aren‚Äôt there counter snipers on the roofs of buildings around Las Vegas when large open-air events occur? Why were unchecked backpacks and duffle bags allowed in and around the most populated area of the Boston Marathon in 2013? Why do stadiums and arenas funnel tens of thousands of people through the same few exits at the end of every event? Why are civilians and law enforcement officials always caught off guard when an attack happens as if it were the first time evil has visited our nation? The answers to these questions lead back to the same issue in that we as a nation have failed to evolve in our awareness and defenses as fast as the attackers have advanced in their targeting and attack planning.

The days of traditional SWAT teams are over. Police departments should shift to training the total officer capable of engaging an enemy as effective as the military would in a warzone. What is needed now is a more robust and well-trained police force capable of outside the box thinking and unconventional tactics. Patrol officers should be outfitted and armed with long guns and body armor and trained in tactics that mimic the effective direct action techniques used by military Special Forces. As a U.S. Navy SEAL and FBI Special Agent, I have seen how effective unconventional military tactics can be against an enemy, and how they are desperately needed in police departments across the country.

With the advent of technologies such as Airsoft weapons that mimic real life firearms in size and weight, but shoot small plastic pellets, the cost of department tactical training should have plummeted. Yet departments continue to train their street officers on static ranges with very little real world scenarios, keeping costs high due to expensive live ammunition. The result is money wasted and officers still lacking effective skills and ineffective battle plans.

Likewise, in order for our citizenry to remain safe and alive on a daily basis as well as at special events, it is imperative that changes occur in awareness and in the way people forward think their personal defensive tactics and response procedures.

The bottom line is that we are involved in a war that has never been encountered in modern recorded history. It is a war that involves growing numbers of the mentally ill and people that have been brainwashed by extreme ideologies. Combine those warfronts with the plague of learned helplessness sweeping our citizenry and you can start to get a picture of how real this new type of war actually is and how violent it has become.

It is time for law enforcement to advance forward and take some lessons from the military and at the same time, our citizenry must start anticipating the worst so they can understand the threat they are facing and be more adequately prepared to act.",Former Navy SEAL and FBI Special Agent: Terror tactics are advancing faster than police tactics,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/11/former-navy-seal-and-fbi-special-agent-terror-tactics-are-advancing-faster-than-police-tactics.html

California blocked state-funded travel to multiple states in June that had what the state attorney general considered anti-LGBT policies. Those states were: Alabama, Kentucky, South Dakota and Texas.

Non-essential state-funded travel was already banned from Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee.

Foie gras

California‚Äôs foie gras ban was reinstated this month by a federal appeals court. It found that a state law preventing sales of the food product made by force-feeding ducks and geese was not preempted by federal authority to regulate poultry products.

The ban was signed into law in 2004 after proponents said the process of fattening the birds‚Äô livers was cruel and inhumane. The law took effect in 2012, but was blocked by a court in 2015, delighting chefs who wanted to serve it.

The defeat ends a streak of seven consecutive appearances for the U.S. at soccer's quadrennial showcase, dating back to 1990.

The U.S. entered its final qualifier with a berth uncertain for the first time since 1989. Home losses to Mexico last November and Costa Rica last month left the Americans little margin for error.

The 28th-ranked Americans needed merely a tie against 99th-ranked Trinidad, which lost its sixth straight qualifier last week. But the defeat -- coupled with Honduras' come-from-behind 3-2 win over Mexico and Panama's 2-1 victory over Costa Rica on Ramon Torres' 88th-minute goal -- dropped the Americans from third place into fifth in the six-nation final round of the North and Central American and Caribbean region.

Mexico and Costa Rica already had clinched berths, and Panama claimed the third and final automatic spot and will go the World Cup for the first time. Honduras will meet Australia in a two-game playoff next month for another spot at next year's 32-nation tournament.



Shocked American players slumped on the bench, and Matt Besler sat on the field after the final whistle as Panama's game ended and then Costa Rica's. At the end, dejected U.S. players filed into their locker rooms with blank looks.



Missing the World Cup is a devastating blow to the U.S. Soccer Federation, which has steadily built the sport in the last quarter-century with the help of sponsors and television partners. It also is a trauma for Fox, which broadcasts the next three World Cups after taking the U.S. rights from ESPN. The USSF hopes to co-host the 2026 tournament with Mexico and Canada, and Morocco is the only other bidder.



After an 0-2 start in the hexagonal last fall under Jurgen Klinsmann, the USSF replaced him last November with Bruce Arena, the American coach from 1998-2006. The team revived with home wins over Honduras and Trinidad last spring and draws at Panama and Mexico. But the 2-0 defeat to Costa Rica in New Jersey at the start of Labor Day weekend proved one hurdle too many to overcome.



""No excuses for us not getting the second goal and at least a point,"" Arena said. ""It's a blemish for us.""



The Americans fell behind in the 17th minute when defender Omar Gonzalez made a casual attempt with his left foot to clear Alvin Jones' cross and sent the ball looping over the outstretched right arm of goalkeeper Tim Howard from 18 yards.



Jones doubled the lead in the 37th with a 35-yard strike, again to Howard's upper right corner, and nearly scored another in the 44th when his swerving shot bounced off Howard's chest and spilled into the penalty area.



Christian Pulisic, the Americans' 19-year-old star midfielder, scored in the 47th minute from the arc with a right-footed shot. He played a role in 12 of the 17 Americans goals in the hexagonal.



One minute later, Howard made a kick save on Shahdon Winchester's short-range shot, and DeAndre Yedlin blocked Levi Garcia's follow-up attempt.



The U.S. bench was tense, as Honduras scored twice early in the second half to take the lead over visiting Mexico in the 60th minute and Panama tied the score against visiting Costa Rica in the 52nd.



Clint Dempsey, who entered at the start of the second half, was denied by goalkeeper Adrian Foncette's leaping save in the 69th and hit a post from 22 yards in the 77th. Pulisic's shot in the 87th was saved by Foncette.



All American reserves were standing for much of the final minutes, and Arena had repeated exasperated looks.



Just a few hundred fans were in the stands at 10,000-capacity Ato Boldon Stadium, located 24 miles south of the capital, Port-of-Spain. Paul Caligiuri's famous goal at the National Stadium in 1989 put the U.S. in the World Cup for the first time since 1950.

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home ‚Äì even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we‚Äôre leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week ‚Äî more often if the towels get a lot of use ‚Äî and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote.

Affleck wrote Tuesday that the news about the man who helped create his career ""made me sick"" and that we must ""condemn this type of behavior when we see it.""

A fan then accused Affleck of similar behavior tweeting, ""[Affleck] also grabbed Hilarie Burton's breasts on TRL once. Everyone forgot though.""

Burton chimed in tweeting, ""I didn't forget."" Her husband, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, played the father of Ben Affleck's character in ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.""

A rep for Affleck did not return Fox News' request for comment.

Actress Rose McGowan, is among the women accusing Weinstein, also blasted Affleck calling him a liar and claiming the actor knew of Weinstein's behavior but remained silent.

""@benaffleck 'GODDAMNIT! I TOLD HIM TO STOP DOING THAT' you said that to my face. The press conf I was made to go to after assault. You lie,"" McGowan tweeted.

McGowan also called out Affleck's brother, actor Casey Anthony who has been accused of sexual assault, on Twitter Monday writing, ""Ben Affleck Casey Affleck, how‚Äôs your morning boys?""

Casey Affleck recently faced intense public scrutiny for a past civil sexual harassment lawsuit. He made headlines ealier this year after reports surfaced that two women had filed lawsuits against him for sexual assault on the set of the 2009 film ""I'm Still Here."" Both suits were settled out of court.

Casey Affleck addressed the allegations in March 2017 in a statement to the Boston Globe.

""I believe that any kind of mistreatment of anyone for any reason is unacceptable and abhorrent, and everyone deserves to be treated with respect in the workplace and anywhere else,"" Affleck said. ""There's really nothing I can do about it other than live my life the way I know I live it and to speak to what my own values are and how I try to live by them all the time.""

This means that nearly 8 percent of boys and nearly 6 percent of girls worldwide were obese in 2016, against less than one percent for both sexes in 1975.

An additional 213 million children aged 5-19 were overweight last year, but fell below the threshold for obesity, according to the largest ever study, based on height and weight measurements of 129 million people.

The researchers called for better nutrition at home and at school, and more physical exercise to prevent a generation from becoming adults at greater risk of diabetes, heart disease and cancers due to excessive weight.

Clear food labels on salt, sugar and fat content are needed to help consumers make ""healthy choices"", the study said.

Taxation and tough restrictions on marketing of junk food should be considered, it said. WHO has already recommended a 20 percent tax on sugary drinks to reduce consumption.

""The experience of east Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean show that the transition from underweight to overweight and obesity can be rapid,"" the study said.

If current trends continue, in 2022 there will be more obese children and teenagers worldwide than underweight ones, who now number 192 million, half of them in India, the study said.

___Knickmeyer reported from Sonoma, California.","Jose Garnica worked for more than two decades to build up his dream home that was reduced to ashes in a matter of minutes by the deadly firestorm striking California's wine country.

Garnica, who moved to the U.S. from Mexico over 20 years ago, had finally decided he could afford to upgrade parts of his Santa Rosa house after building a stable career with the local garbage company and saving nearly everything he and his wife earned.

Over the past two years, he replaced the siding and installed a new air conditioner, stainless steel appliances and new flooring. Less than a week ago, the 44-year-old got an estimate to replace the fence, one of the last items on his list.

But at 3:30 a.m. Monday, he watched his house become one of the more than 2,000 homes and businesses destroyed by the series of blazes across the region that had killed at least 17 people.

""You feel helpless,"" he said Tuesday. ""There's nothing you can do. Everything, your whole life, goes through your mind in a minute. Everything you had done. I left all my family behind in Mexico to get a better life. Finally we were just coming to the comfort level, and this happens.""

Destructive flames have raced across the wine country of Napa and Sonoma counties and the coastal beauty of Mendocino further north, leaving little more than smoldering ashes and eye-stinging smoke in their wake. Whole neighborhoods are gone, with only brick chimneys and charred laundry machines to mark sites that were once family homes.

On Wednesday, authorities ordered more evacuations for several areas of Sonoma Valley after a blaze there grew to 44 square miles (113 square kilometers). Officials also cautioned that after a day of cooler weather and calmer winds, dangerous gusty winds will return to the region Wednesday afternoon, complicating efforts by firefighters to contain the flames.

""This is just pure devastation, and it's going to take us a while to get out and comb through all of this,"" said Ken Pimlott, chief of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. He said the state had ""several days of fire weather conditions to come.""

In some torched neighborhoods, fire hydrants still had hoses attached, apparently abandoned by firefighters who had to flee.

The wildfires already rank among the deadliest in California history, and officials expected the death toll to increase as the scope of destruction becomes clear. At least 185 people were injured during the blazes that cropped up Sunday night. Nearly 200 people were reported missing in Sonoma County alone.

David Leal, 55, and his wife and stepson salvaged a few decorative items from their Santa Rosa home, including a wind chime, tiles from the backsplash in the kitchen, a decorative sun and a cross.

""Our plan is to keep those things, and when we rebuild, they'll be mementos of what we've lived through, and of, just, resilience,"" Leal said. ""It's hard not to get emotional.

In the meantime, Leal got a post office box so the family can get mail, a new laptop and some clothes. They're living out of their two vehicles for now.

""We'll be back home again sooner than later, and with our chins held high,"" he said, choking back tears. ""And hopefully we'll be amongst our neighbors and friends as they do the same.""

Leal, a U.S. Navy veteran, evacuated with his family, two dogs and cat to nearby Petaluma late Sunday after seeing fierce, hot winds and flames whipping in the distance.

""We didn't have time to think about what to grab. We grabbed what we saw,"" he said. He got his external hard drive, which was lying out, but left his laptop.

Garnica also hung onto hope, saying he was not back at square one.

""I came into the States with nothing. I didn't have anything,"" Garnica said. ""I think I'm better off than how I came in. At least I got a job. I got a family. I'm healthy.""

The middle school‚Äôs health teacher assigned a quiz that defined 10 ‚Äúsexual identity‚Äù terms, such as gay, lesbian, and transgender. The quiz required the sixth graders to identify and differentiate between various sexual orientations and identities, FOX 5 Atlanta reported.

One mother, Octavia Parks, was particularly shocked when her 12-year-old daughter came home with the assignment.

""Why are they teaching that in school?‚Äù Parks said. ‚ÄúWhat does that have to do with life?""

Parks felt that the material was not appropriate for school, and that her daughter was too young to learn about sexual orientation.

""We had a brief conversation and she assured me that this sort of thing would not happen.‚Äù Parks said. ‚ÄúNonetheless, it is happening.""

Now, Parks has signed a consent form to remove her child from the health class. She is not the only parent to find fault with the controversial quiz.

Eva McClain, the mother of a past Lithonia Middle School student, agrees that the material is inappropriate for school. She also said that the sexual orientation quiz was not part of the health class‚Äô curriculum when her daughter was in school.

The haul was large, but no individual smuggler was caught carrying enough gold to meet the criminal threshold and were allowed to go free.

Gold is the country‚Äôs second largest import after crude oil. However, gold can fetch high customs fees, which makes smuggling seem desirable to some.

Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said Monday that gunman Stephen Paddock shot and wounded a Mandalay Bay hotel security guard outside his hotel room door and sprayed 200 bullets down the hall six minutes before he opened fire Oct. 1 from his high-rise suite on a crowd at a country music festival below.

That was a different account from the one police gave last week: that Paddock shot the unarmed guard, Jesus Campos, after unleashing his barrage of fire on the crowd, where 58 people were killed and hundreds were injured.

‚ÄúThis remains an ongoing investigation with a lot of moving parts.

Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News‚Äô senior judicial analyst, said on ‚ÄúCavuto: Coast to Coast,‚Äù that the news from the new timeline is not that the security guard was shot earlier than previously stated, but that the news was ""that the agent of the hotel who should have been carrying with him a recording device -- a device which would have allowed the head of security or somebody in security to listen in ‚Äì was shot at 200 times by an automatic weapon.‚Äù

He continued, ‚ÄúSo Mandalay Bay knew of the existence and presence and workability of the automatic weapon six minutes before he started killing people. That should have triggered an enormous response,‚Äù he said, considering the argument lawyers could make to a jury, if it gets to that point.

Ancient wisdom from a Higher Authority, which is available to anyone who takes the time to consider it, was provided to constrain people like Harvey Weinstein from acts he has been accused of committing.

In an age when we have cast off most restraints ‚Äî from restrictions on abortion, to sanctioning same-sex marriage, to normalizing the use of nudity, crude language and sex in Hollywood films, not to mention wisdom ‚Äî why is anything off limits? Who decides where the limits are these days? And on what do they base their decision?

Haven‚Äôt some federal judges been eviscerating the U.S. Constitution for decades? Haven‚Äôt even some clergy made attempts to rewrite or ignore Scripture to conform to opinion polls and align themselves with contemporary trends?

Denunciations of Weinstein are coming from all quarters, though the Hollywood crowd has been mostly silent. His critics presuppose a standard by which such behavior can be judged. But we are ridding ourselves of most standards faster than a snake sheds its skin. What did we expect?

Many Republicans and conservatives are joyfully berating and belittling Harvey Weinstein and his fellow leftists, but they should remind themselves that sin is not exclusive to one party or political persuasion. Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Penn., resigned his office last week after the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette obtained text messages between Murphy and his mistress in which he told her to have an abortion if she thought she might be pregnant. Murphy, who claims to be ‚Äúpro-life,‚Äù co-sponsored a bill that would ban abortion after 20 weeks.

Much newspaper ink is being spilled and nightly news time spent discussing Weinstein after an investigative story by The New York Times in which many women, who claim to have been harassed in the most disgusting ways imaginable, have come forward to tell their stories. On Sunday, Weinstein was fired by his own company.

Lisa Bloom, who resigned last Saturday as an adviser to Weinstein, made the laughable claim that he is a ‚Äúdinosaur‚Äù who came of age at a time when such behavior was more acceptable. Really? Acceptable to whom? Hugh Hefner, maybe, who fired the first shot in the sexual revolution. Aren‚Äôt victims of unwelcome sexual advances just some of the casualties of that revolution?

Hypocrisy is a word that is thrown around a lot. Conservatives are guffawing that Weinstein, who is a Democrat, was also an enthusiastic supporter and donor to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs 2016 presidential campaign. The Republican National Committee issued a press release demanding Democratic politicians who received donations from Weinstein return the money. Republicans are not immune from the temptations of the flesh and boorish, even criminal, behavior. In addition to Murphy, you can Google ‚ÄúRepublicans and sex scandals‚Äù and read some of them.

Denunciations of Weinstein are coming from all quarters of the political spectrum, though the Hollywood crowd has been mostly silent. His critics presuppose a standard by which such behavior can be judged. But we are ridding ourselves of most standards faster than a snake sheds its skin. What did we expect the outcome to look like?

Is our moral life and collective notions of right and wrong to be decided by opinion polls and personal feelings, or is there a ‚ÄúHigher Authority‚Äù that should rule over individuals, as well as nations? The question should not be rhetorical. It demands an answer.

This quote by Francois de La Rochefoucauld seems to fit our reaction to the Weinstein affair, as well as many others: ‚ÄúHypocrisy is the homage vice pays to virtue.‚Äù Once again, questions should be asked in this increasingly morally vacuous age: what is ‚Äúvice‚Äù and what is ‚Äúvirtue‚Äù? Who gets to decide? On what shall the definitions be based?

Weinstein needs help that no counselor can fully offer. Only a transformed life can help him become a new and different man.

When ovarian reserves are too low, women may not benefit from fertility treatments.
""By the time you have come to a doctor for help getting pregnant, ovarian reserve is a large consideration,"" Santoro said.","Lab tests showing that women have low reserves of eggs in their ovaries may not necessarily mean they will struggle to get pregnant, a U.S. study suggests.

For the study, researchers examined results from blood and urine tests for so-called biomarkers that indicate ovarian reserve, or egg supply, in 750 women ages 30 to 44.

Women with test results indicating low ovarian reserve were no less likely to conceive within six or 12 months of attempts than women whose lab tests didn't point to a limited egg supply, researchers report in JAMA.

CHILD AND TEEN OBESITY RATES SOAR GLOBALLY, WHO REPORTS

""These blood tests do predict how well a woman will respond to fertility treatment,"" said lead study author Dr. Anne Steiner of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

""However, we found that they do not predict her likelihood of conceiving naturally,"" Steiner said by email. ""This challenges the clinical dogma that diminished ovarian reserve is a cause of infertility.""

Women are born with a finite supply of eggs, and that supply dwindles with age. Tests for ovarian reserve biomarkers have become widely used as a growing number of women elect to put off attempting pregnancy until they're in their 30s and 40s.

Doctors use the tests to decide whether to recommend egg freezing as an option for women to preserve future fertility options, researchers note, and home-based tests are also marketed to women who want to assess fertility on their own.

The study examined tests of three biomarkers of ovarian reserve: early-follicular-phase serum antimullerian hormone (AMH), serum and urinary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and serum inhibin B.

Women with lower levels of AMH and elevated FSH, which can point to limited egg supplies, weren't significantly less likely to get pregnant within 6 or 12 months of trying to conceive than women with normal test results, the study found.

Results from tests of inhibin B levels also weren't associated with fertility.

One limitation of the study is that it assessed conception, but not whether women successfully delivered babies, the authors note. Low ovarian reserve might increase the risk of miscarriage, potentially by impacting egg quality, researchers point out.

FATAL PLAGUE OUTBREAK IN MADAGASCAR: PNEUMONIC PLAGUE HAS HEALTH OFFICIALS SCRAMBLING

The study team also lacked data on the semen quality of women's male partners, making it impossible to determine how this might have influenced the odds of natural conception.

The study also evaluated the effectiveness of the tests in women who had been trying to conceive for up to three months, and many of these women might not have had any difficulty conceiving with a little more time.

Doctors typically advise women under 35 to get fertility assessments after 12 months of trying unsuccessfully to conceive and tell older women to get fertility checked out after six months of trying.

The best use of ovarian reserve tests is to determine which patients may respond to treatments that stimulate the ovaries to produce more mature eggs, said Dr. Nanette Santoro of the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora. When ovarian reserves are too low, women may not benefit from fertility treatments.

Many women may not need these tests, or may not need to immediately act on the results, Santoro, author of an accompanying editorial, said by email.

""By the time you have come to a doctor for help getting pregnant, ovarian reserve is a large consideration,"" Santoro said.

As AnimeNewsNetwork reports, a trademark filing by Nintendo back on September 15 suggests that after the NES Classic we'll be getting a Game Boy Classic.

The trademark in question was discovered by the Twitter account @trademark_bot. It describes a ""program for home video game machine"" and includes an image of the first Game Boy originally released way back in 1989. Why file this trademark now if not to prepare for a new system?

If this is the first sign of a Game Boy Classic, then we shouldn't expect it to appear until 2019. With the NES Classic re-release happening in Summer 2018 there is really no reason for Nintendo to add another retro system into the mix next year.

As with the other Classic consoles, we should also expect this Game Boy to be smaller than the original and to include between 20-30 games. There were 1,049 games released for the handheld, so Nintendo shouldn't have any trouble choosing a couple of dozen.

I think we can safely assume all six launch titles for the system will be included. They are Alleyway, Baseball, Super Mario Land, Tennis, Tetris, and (in Japan) Yakuman. We also can't forget the first Pokemon games, Dr. Mario, Kirby's Dream land, Link's Awakening, Donkey Kong, Golf, and Metroid.

President Trump escalated his battle with pro football players protesting the national anthem by urging the government Tuesday to end use of tax-exempt municipal bonds used to build or renovate National Football League stadiums.

""We are committed to upholding an inclusive environment where our customers and our employees feel respected,"" the company wrote.

The lunar atmosphere is so thin it's not even technically an atmosphere ‚Äî instead, it's considered an ""exosphere,"" with molecules that are gravitationally bound to the moon but are too sparse to behave like a gas.

A new study from scientists at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) in Houston suggests that the moon's ancient volcanoes produced a temporary atmosphere that lingered for 70 million years before dissipating into space. [How the Moon Evolved: A Photo Timeline]

Samples of volcanic glasses collected by Apollo astronauts in the 1970s revealed that magma beneath the lunar surface billions of years ago ""carried gas components, such as carbon monoxide, the ingredients for water, sulfur, and other volatile species,"" LPI officials said in a statement.

In the new study, the researchers calculated how much gas rose from the lavas that flowed from the lunar volcanoes. They determined that enough gases accumulated around the moon to form an atmosphere, and that this atmosphere grew faster than it could escape into space.

LPI officials said that the findings may have big implications for future exploration of the moon, because it ""quantifies a source of volatiles that may have been trapped from the atmosphere into cold, permanently shadowed regions near the lunar poles and, thus, may provide a source of ice suitable for a sustained lunar exploration program.""

The study was published online Sept. 25 in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters.

Republican Ed Gillespie and Democrat Ralph Northam are duking it out in next month‚Äôs gubernatorial race in the Old Dominion commonwealth. Just one of two states electing governors this year, Virginia is a swing state contest viewed as a possible referendum on Trump's first year in office.

Northam leads Gillespie by more than 5 percentage points in Real Clear Politics‚Äô latest polling average. Trump lost to opponent Hillary Clinton by about 5 points in Virginia during the 2016 presidential election.

Here‚Äôs a look at the candidates.

Ed Gillespie, Republican

This isn‚Äôt Ed Gillespie‚Äôs first rodeo when it comes to Virginia politics. The 56-year-old ran against incumbent Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., in 2014 and nearly defeated him.

Gillespie is a former chair of the National Republican Committee and served as a counselor to former President George W. Bush for nearly two years. Gillespie touts his leadership within conservative circles on his campaign website, highlighting his time as chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia and work as a communications aide to former House Majority Leader Dick Armey.

Gillespie and his wife have three children and live in Fairfax County, Va. He graduated from Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.

GUN CONTROL ACTIVISTS TO POUR ANOTHER MILLION DOLLARS INTO VIRGINIA STATE ELECTIONS

While Trump endorsed Gillespie in a tweet in October, the establishment gubernatorial candidate hasn‚Äôt totally embraced the president or his politics on the campaign trail. And he almost lost to an ardent Trump defender in the primary race.

Still, Trump offered his support and encouraged his more than 40 million Twitter followers to ‚ÄúVote Ed Gillespie!‚Äù

Bush is expected to host a fundraiser for Gillespie in Virginia later this month.

Ralph Northam, Democrat

Ralph Northam, the lieutenant governor of Virginia, is a physician and Army veteran. On his campaign website, he said he is ‚Äúmost proud‚Äù of ‚Äúhis career fighting for children ‚Äì as a pediatric neurologist and volunteer medical director for a pediatric hospice care facility.‚Äù

While current Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is barred by state law from running for reelection, Northam, 58, is expected to govern the commonwealth much as McAuliffe did. He is for greater gun control and abortion rights. He has also promised to ‚Äúbe a brick wall against the discrimination of the Trump administration,‚Äù according to his campaign website.

VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL DEBATE TOUCHES TAXES, TRUMP, CONFEDERATE STATUES

While encouraging Virginians to vote for Gillespie, Trump accused Northam of ‚Äúfighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs [and] sanctuary cities.‚Äù

Northam responded on Twitter with a link to his campaign donations website. He has also called the president a ‚Äúnarcissistic maniac‚Äù multiple times during the primary.

Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton headlined a fundraiser for Northam in New York earlier this week.

Northam lives in Norfolk, Va., with his wife. The pair has two children, a son who is a neurosurgery resident and a daughter who is working as a web developer.

Last month, however, Facebook announced that it uncovered $100,000 in fake ad spending tied to Russian operatives during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, associated with around 3,000 ads. The ads were connected to about 470 inauthentic accounts and Pages, Facebook said.

While the vast majority of ads didn‚Äôt reference the election, voting, or a particular candidate, they did focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages such as LGBT matters, race, immigration and gun rights, according to Facebook.

The social media giant is expected to turn over the ads to Congress on Monday. Company officials will meet with the House and Senate intelligence committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee to hand over the ads, a Facebook official said. The official requested anonymity because the meetings are private.

During a Facebook Live Chat last month, Zuckerberg said that the company would strengthen its ad review process for political ads.

Twitter recently announced it has uncovered several accounts linked to the same alleged Russian activity on Facebook, as well as $274,000 spent on ads by state-owned TV network Russia Today in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Twitter‚Äôs move prompted a scathing response from Russia Today.

In an editorial she penned for The Guardian on Tuesday ‚Äî called ‚ÄúI am the woman in the ‚Äòracist Dove ad‚Äô: I am not a Victim‚Äù ‚Äî Lola Ogunyemi said she agreed with Dove‚Äôs decision to apologize for how the ad was received, but also that it was never Dove‚Äôs intention to portray her ‚Äúas inferior, or as the ‚Äòbefore‚Äô in a before-and-after shot.‚Äù

Instead, she claimed Dove‚Äôs initial objective was to ‚Äúuse our differences to highlight the fact that all skin deserves gentleness.‚Äù

DOVE APOLOGIZES FOR CAUSING 'OFFENSE' WITH BODY WASH AD

Dove‚Äôs body wash ad, which was pulled during the backlash, featured several different women stripping off their nude-colored t-shirts to reveal an entirely different woman. In screenshots of the ad, Ogunyemi, who is black, can be seen removing her shirt and transforming into a white woman. Afterward, the white woman does the same, and transforms into a completely different woman, and so on.

‚ÄúThere were seven of us in the full version, different races and ages, each of us answering the same question: ‚ÄòIf your skin were a wash label, what would it say?‚Äô‚Äù explained Ogunyemi.

Upon its release, controversy over the ad soon erupted on Twitter, with users calling it ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù and deeming it racist. Others called for a boycott of the product altogether.

And while Ogunyemi said she understands why the screenshots caused backlash, she ultimately feels that the photos were misinterpreted.

‚ÄúHaving said that, I can also see that a lot has been left out,‚Äù wrote Ogunyemi of the public‚Äôs outrage. ‚ÄúThe narrative has been written without giving consumers context on which to base an informed opinion.‚Äù

Ogunyemi, too, said she is upset about becoming the ‚Äúunwitting poster child for racist advertising‚Äù in the wake of the controversy.

‚ÄúWhile I agree with Dove‚Äôs response to unequivocally apologize for any offense caused, they could have also defended their creative vision, and their choice to include me, an unequivocally dark-skinned black woman, as a face of their campaign,‚Äù Ogunyemi wrote. ‚ÄúI am not just some silent victim of a mistaken beauty campaign. I am strong, I am beautiful, and I will not be erased.‚Äù

In an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, Ogunyemi reiterated that critics might have a different opinion of the ad had they seen the full thing, reports Reuters.

‚ÄúThe screenshots that have taken the media by storm paint a slightly different picture,‚Äù she said.

""I don't feel it was racist,"" she also said.

Quinton Tellis, 29, could face life in prison without parole if convicted of capital murder in the death of Chambers, who was found near the remains of her car along a rural Mississippi back road on Dec. 6, 2014.

The defense claims that Chambers told firefighters that she was set on fire by a man named Eric, not by Tellis. She died hours later at a Memphis hospital.

The horrific circumstances surrounding the former high school cheerleader's death garnered national attention. The trial in Batesville, Miss., about 50 miles south of Memphis, is the focus of tight security. The jury is being sequestered and spectators are being screened by metal detectors before entering the courtroom.

Prosecutor John Champion warned jurors that they will see graphic photos of a burned Chambers and they will hear from about 35 witnesses. Chambers had burns on about 93 percent of her body when she was found.

He said Tellis repeatedly lied to investigators about spending time with her in the hours before she was found. He also said that Tellis had repeatedly asked Chambers for sex, and she had told him no.

Champion said cellphone records show that Chambers and Tellis ‚Äî who had met about two weeks before her death and had become friends ‚Äî were together twice on the day she was burned.

Chambers and Tellis rode around in her car for a while that morning before Chambers dropped off Tellis at his house and she went home to take a nap, the prosecutor said. Chambers then picked up Tellis at about 5:30 p.m. and they went to a fast food restaurant, Champion said.

Citing statements Tellis made to investigators, Champion said Tellis and Chambers had sex in her car later that evening. Champion said he believes Tellis suffocated Chambers and thought he had killed her.

Tellis then drove Chambers' car with her inside it to the back road, ran to his sister's house nearby, jumped in his sisters' car, stopped to pick up gasoline from a shed at his house and torched Chambers' car and her, Champion said.

""Horrific burns,"" Champion said. ""Horrific pain.""

Chambers was found walking on the road ‚Äî wearing only underwear in 40 degree temperatures ‚Äî when a passing motorist spotted her shortly after 8 p.m., Champion said. Her car keys were later found nearby, and they had Tellis' DNA on them, Champion said.

Authorities have said previously that Chambers was on fire when she was found.

Champion said Tellis first told investigators he only saw Chambers on the morning of her death.

Tellis later acknowledged they were together in the evening, saying he met her to sell her marijuana and had sex with her in her car, Champion said. The prosecutor also said Tellis' alibi was fabricated.

Defense attorney Darla Palmer said Tellis is wrongly accused. She said Tellis was buying a pre-paid debit card miles away in Batesville at the time Chambers was burned.

Palmer also said eight first responders who treated Chambers asked her if she knew who did it.

""She said 'Eric set me on fire,'"" Palmer said. ""She didn't say any other name.""

In his opening statement, Champion acknowledged that the first responders did hear her say the name ""Eric"" or ""Derek."" Champion said she could have been saying ""Tellis,"" but the damage done to her throat made it sound different.

Palmer told jurors that Tellis never confessed to the killing.

""He insisted this is not something he would do,"" Palmer said.

About 20,000 telephone numbers were analyzed in the investigation. Witnesses will include cellphone data experts, Champion said.

Tellis faces another murder indictment in Louisiana, where he's accused in the torture death of Meing-Chen Hsiao, a 34-year-old Taiwanese graduate student at the University of Louisiana at Monroe. No trial date has been set in that case.

Hundreds of people waving Turkish and Serbian flags lined the streets of Novi Pazar, where Erdogan arrived Wednesday with Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic.

Erdogan is on a two-day visit to Serbia, pledging to boost economic and other ties as part of stepped up efforts by Ankara to increase its clout in the Balkans.

Relations between Serbia and Turkey have improved in recent years after decades of mistrust between the two nations. Serbia was ruled for almost 500 years by the Ottoman Empire.

The court‚Äôs moves largely suggest that it will step away from the controversial ban for now.

Oct. 5 ‚Äì Justice Department asks Supreme Court to drop travel ban case

Sept. 12 ‚Äì Supreme Court lifts restrictions

The Supreme Court blocked a lower court‚Äôs decision that would have allowed refugees to enter the country under certain conditions, blocking a ruling that said a resettlement agency counts as a ‚Äúbona fide relationship.‚Äù

Sept. 7 ‚Äì Appeals court limits travel ban

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld a lower court ruling that would allow for more refugees to enter the country despite the ban. The federal court ruled that refugees working with a resettlement agency would be considered to have established an approved ‚Äúbona fide relationship‚Äù with a contact in the U.S.

The Supreme Court, temporarily, allowed for the administration‚Äôs travel ban to keep a strict enforcement on its ban of refugees.

March 8 ‚Äì Hawaii sues to block the travel ban

The state of Hawaii sued in an attempt to halt the Trump administration‚Äôs travel ban from going into effect. Lawyers said the ‚Äúnew executive order is resulting in the establishment of religion in the State of Hawaii contrary to its state Constitution.‚Äù

Lawyers also argued that the ban would damage Hawaii‚Äôs ‚Äúeconomy, educational institutions and tourism industry; and it is subjecting a portion of the state‚Äôs citizens to second-class treatment and discrimination, while denying all Hawaii residents the benefits of an inclusive and pluralistic society.‚Äù

March 6 ‚Äì Trump unveils new travel ban

Trump signed a new executive order which barred travel from six predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days ‚Äì removing Iraq from the new ban.

As more women have come out with allegations of sexual harassment from Weinstein, Argento told the magazine that the film producer forcibly performed oral sex on her even though she told him to stop. She described the encounter as a ‚Äúnightmare‚Äù and said she remained silent about the alleged assault afterwards out of fear that he could ‚Äúcrush her.‚Äù

Now 42, Argento was 21 years old when she said the Weinstein encounter occurred.



Who is Asia Argento?

Born in Rome, Argento is both an actress and filmmaker, according to her IMDb page.

She starred in films ‚ÄúxXx,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMarie Antoinette.‚Äù She also wrote and directed the film ‚ÄúScarlet Diva‚Äù in 2000, which she said includes a scene about the alleged assault by Weinstein.

She has won several awards, including multiple Best Actress awards at the Golden Globes in Italy, according to her IMDb page. She won an award for Best New Director for ‚ÄúScarlet Diva‚Äù at the 2001 Brooklyn Film Festival. She also won multiple David Di Donatello awards, the Italian equivalent of an Oscar.

Argento, also an author, has written several short stories and the novel, ""I Love You, Kirk.""

She has two children and was formerly married to filmmaker Michele Civetta. She is now dating chef Anthony Bourdain.

How is she connected to Harvey Weinstein?

Argento told the New Yorker that she met Weinstein at what she thought was going to be a party in 1997. Instead, Weinstein, wearing a bathrobe, asked her to give him a massage, she said. Then, after she eventually complied, Weinstein allegedly forcibly performed oral sex on her despite her objections.

Argento admitted she would eventually have consensual sex with Weinstein over the years but said she did so because she felt as though she ‚Äúhad to‚Äù since she had a movie coming out and ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to anger him.‚Äù

""I know he has crushed a lot of people before,"" Argento said. ""That's why this story ‚Äî in my case, it's twenty years old, some of them are older ‚Äî has never come out.""

Argento has shared Farrow‚Äôs expose multiple times on social media since it was published.

With fierce competition from rival sedans and the growing popularity of crossovers, the Accord and Camry have both been completely redesigned from the ground up to keep them competitive. Sure, differences in styling are readily apparent, but what's under their skin also separates these roomy, front-wheel-drive sedans. Let's take a closer look.

Driving

The new Camry is bolder-looking and sharper-driving than ever. It now tackles corners with confidence and has responsive steering and easy-to-use brakes. The Honda Accord has always been a confident, capable handler that's more nimble than its size suggests, and the new one is no exception. Its mature, sophisticated style imbues it with a markedly premium vibe inside and out.

What's available under their hoods reveals a distinct difference in philosophy between the two. The Camry's 203-horsepower four-cylinder and optional 301-horsepower V6 engines make do without the help of turbochargers. In contrast, the Accord comes with a choice of two turbocharged four-cylinder engines with 192 and 252 horsepower, respectively.

The Camry's V6 is noticeably more urgent (and better-sounding, frankly) than the Accord's top engine, while the Honda's base engine and transmission are more refined than the Camry's four-cylinder, which can gets loud when accelerating hard. The four-cylinder engines on both cars deliver solid thrust when called upon.

Fuel economy



Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT

EPA-rated fuel economy for Accords with the base engine and the continuously variable automatic transmission ranges between 31 and 33 mpg combined, depending on trim level. The Camry, which has been in dealerships since this summer, ekes out a slim fuel economy edge with a range between 32 and 34 mpg combined with the base engine. The Camry's V6 is rated at 26 mpg combined, while the Accord's optional engine has not been rated yet.

Buyers looking to maximize fuel economy will want to check out the hybrid variants of each car. While the Camry Hybrid delivers an astounding 52 mpg combined, the final numbers on the Accord Hybrid won't be released until closer to its launch in early 2018. It's a safe bet that Honda is aiming to at least match the Toyota's impressive number.

Safety and technology

All but the bottom trim level of the Accord offer an 8-inch touchscreen user interface standard. The Camry's touchscreen measures 7 or 8 inches, depending on the trim level or options. The touchscreens in both cars are fast-acting and have intuitive screen flow, with the edge going to the Accord for its sharper display.

There is one big difference between the two worth noting. The Accord offers Apple CarPlay and Android Auto phone integration; the Camry does not. Instead the Camry uses Toyota's Entune app, which is far less intuitive.

Both the Camry and Accord offer a suite of driver assistance features as standard equipment. These include forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning and intervention, adaptive cruise control and automatic high beams. The Accord also includes traffic sign recognition as standard.

Space and utility

There's ample space in the front seat of either car, though the Accord's slimmer dashboard makes its cabin feel roomier. Even tall people will find plenty of space and comfort in both back seats, with the Accord offering more legroom and the Camry more headroom.

Cavernous cargo space is also common to both sedans ‚Äî the Camry's 15.1-cubic-foot trunk is generously sized and easy to access, and the Accord's 16.7-cubic-foot trunk is quite wide, deep and tall. A 60/40-split folding back seat is offered on all Camry trims and all Accords except the base trim level.

Both hybrid models locate the battery under the back seat and retain the seat's 60/40-split folding capability. So there is no penalty in trunk space when choosing either hybrid over its nonhybrid stablemate, though the Camry Hybrid's back seat is raised slightly.

Pricing

The base trim levels for both sedans are similarly priced, with the Camry starting at $24,380 and the Accord landing at $24,445. Starting points for models with optional engines reveal a larger difference ‚Äî $35,285 for the Camry V6 and $31,185 for the Accord 2.0T. Keep in mind when comparing the prices that Honda offers the optional engine in four of the six Accord trim levels, and Toyota reserves the V6 choice for the two most lavishly equipped trim levels.

Edmunds says:



Toyota and Honda have stepped up the mainstream sedan game in a big way with the latest Camry and Accord. The Camry has a bold look and a powerful V6 engine, while the Accord exudes the class of a more expensive car. Fuel economy is strong with either one, though the Accord boasts more space and standard driver assistance features. Both cars should be at the top of your shopping list when test-driving new sedans.

The younger Ramsey claims the network‚Äôs report ignored evidence to falsely implicate him.

The lawsuit says CBS and its featured experts set out to conduct a ""sham reinvestigation"" of the murder with ""the preconceived storyline"" that Burke Ramsey killed his sister and conspired with his parents to conceal the truth.

""The accusation that Burke Ramsey killed his sister was based on a compilation of lies, half-truths, manufactured information, and the intentional omission and avoidance of truthful information about the murder of JonBen√©t Ramsey,"" the lawsuit says.

A copy of the father's lawsuit was not immediately available, but was scheduled for a status conference Dec. 15.

The body of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey was found beaten and strangled at her family's home in Boulder on Dec. 26, 1996, just hours after Patsy Ramsey, the girl‚Äôs mother, called 911 to report her daughter missing after discovering a ransom note.

Patsy Ramsey, also a beauty pageant winner, died of ovarian cancer at age 49 in 2006.

No matter, because Steve‚Äôs beliefs about marriage were different than the city‚Äôs, and because he had the gall to state them publicly, Steve and Country Mill had to be banished.
At first, the city instructed Country Mill not to come to the farmer‚Äôs market because of possible protests.
Steve isn‚Äôt breaking any law except for the one the city officials intentionally created to exclude him from the farmer‚Äôs market.","Steve Tennes, who owns Country Mill Farms in Charlotte, Michigan, has prevailed so far in his lawsuit against the city of East Lansing after it tossed him and his family out of its farmer‚Äôs market. A federal district court ordered the city to allow him back in for now, and there‚Äôs a good reason for that: The city is unconstitutionally discriminating against Steve and his orchard, and that‚Äôs why I joined the lawsuit to fight for his freedom.

A second-generation family business, Country Mill grows apples, blueberries, peaches, cherries, sweet corn, and pumpkins. It hosts numerous community and charitable events. And it has sold its produce at the East Lansing Farmer‚Äôs Market for many years. In fact, from 2011 to 2016, the city expressly invited Country Mill to participate in the market as an ‚Äúinvitational vendor‚Äù because of its exceptional service.

Everything changed in 2016 when the city learned that Steve had posted on Facebook that he still adhered to the teachings of the Catholic Church that marriage is a sacred union between one man and one woman. Steve also adheres to the Church‚Äôs teaching that every individual, as a child of God, has immense dignity and worth and should be treated as such. Accordingly, that is how he treats all his customers and employees. No matter, because Steve‚Äôs beliefs about marriage were different than the city‚Äôs, and because he had the gall to state them publicly, Steve and Country Mill had to be banished.

It used to be a common American value that everyone had the freedom to live and speak without government coercion. But that value apparently does not extend to a person who respectfully expresses one particular viewpoint on marriage in the public square.

At first, the city instructed Country Mill not to come to the farmer‚Äôs market because of possible protests. Having broken no law, Country Mill attended the market anyway. No protest materialized, either that week or the rest of the 2016 season. So the city created a policy to exclude Country Mill by incorporating the city‚Äôs ordinance prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation. Of course, Country Mill does not discriminate based on sexual orientation; customers and employees are welcomed regardless of that. Steve simply expressed his belief in marriage‚Äôs meaning as taught by the Church.

Nonetheless, the city barred the Market Planning Committee from sending an invitation to Country Mill, as it had done for the past six years, and the city also directed the committee to send Country Mill‚Äôs application to the city if Country Mill submitted one. No other vendor had the same restriction. And when Country Mill did apply through the normal, non-invitational process, the city rejected the application and told Country Mill that it would reconsider only if Steve changed his religious beliefs and expression.

The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees every citizen the right to free speech and to freely exercise his or her religion. Yet East Lansing has denied Steve and Country Mill the ability to participate in the public square solely because the city dislikes Steve‚Äôs beliefs and his willingness to make public statements about them. That is why Steve reluctantly chose to sue and ask a federal court for an injunction ordering the city to allow Country Mill to participate once again in the farmer‚Äôs market. Reasoning that Steve is likely to prevail in his claims, the court granted the injunction on Sept. 15, meaning he can participate in the market for the remainder of the year while his lawsuit proceeds.

The city says it isn‚Äôt targeting Steve for his beliefs, but that argument fell flat with the court and fails in general. Steve isn‚Äôt breaking any law except for the one the city officials intentionally created to exclude him from the farmer‚Äôs market. They did this because he doesn‚Äôt live his life and operate his farm‚Äî22 miles outside of their jurisdiction‚Äîaccording to their beliefs about marriage rather than his own beliefs, which the First Amendment protects.

When I heard about Steve‚Äôs dilemma after his attorneys with Alliance Defending Freedom filed suit, I felt compelled to get involved. It used to be a common American value that everyone had the freedom to live and speak without government coercion. But that value apparently does not extend to a person who respectfully expresses one particular viewpoint on marriage in the public square. The city has forced Steve to change his beliefs and be silent or lose a substantial portion of his business. That is a stunning result not only for Steve and Country Mill, but for the millions of business owners and workers who believe that they have the responsibility to publicly express their faith and to practice it in their business vocation.

Whether religious, agnostic, or atheist, no individual should be forced to choose between the government‚Äôs orthodoxy and withdrawing from the public square. That is one of our country‚Äôs founding principles. And that is why Steve‚Äôs case is so important, not only to Michigan citizens, but to people everywhere. I look forward to the federal courts continuing to uphold the right of everyone to speak and act in accord with their conscience without being punished by the government for doing so.

Email correspondence revealed Monday about a July 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney at Trump Tower in New York City contradict previous reports.

The messages suggest that the meeting was not set up to pass on damaging information about Hillary Clinton on behalf of the Russian government.

Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya believed she was meeting President Donald Trump‚Äôs oldest son to discuss the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 sanction law aimed at top Russian officials, and did not have information on behalf of the Kremlin to pass on to the Trump campaign, according to the emails.

In an email chain between music publicist Rob Goldstone and Veselnitskaya, she asks to invite Russian-born lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin to the meeting, saying he was ‚Äúworking to advance these issues with several congressmen,‚Äù the Wall Street Journal reported.

SEE THE NYC TOWNHOUSE WHERE OBAMA LIVED AFTER COLLEGE

The building has been the site of two very high-profile suicides in the last 30 years, which is enough to make even a New York City real-estate agent think twice about living there.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know of any buildings with two suicides,‚Äù said Dolly Lenz, CEO of Dolly Lenz Real Estate, in a statement to the New York Post. ‚ÄúIt almost says that there is a cloud on the building.‚Äù

The first victim of these tragedies was Carter Cooper, the 23-year-old son of Gloria Vanderbilt and the older brother of CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. According to reports, Carter was acting strangely in the months leading up to his suicide, but had been in therapy. Then, on July 22, 1988, during a visit to his mother‚Äôs home, he abruptly ran out onto the terrace of his Vanderbilt‚Äôs two-story penthouse apartment, hopped over the ledge, and dangled there before letting himself drop from the 14th floor ‚Äî all while Vanderbilt watched from feet away.

""He let go, and there was a moment when I thought I was going to jump over after him,‚Äù Vanderbilt remembered during a 2011 appearance of Anderson Cooper‚Äôs talk series.

In Vanderbilt‚Äôs 1997 book, ‚ÄúA Mother‚Äôs Story,‚Äù she also alleged that Carter‚Äôs suicide may have triggered by an allergy to medication.

The second, much more recent suicide at 10 Grace Square took place in April 2017, and claimed the life of author, heiress and socialite Jean Stein. Stein, whose works include ‚ÄúEdie: An American Girl‚Äù and ‚ÄúWest of Eden,‚Äù had reportedly been suffering from depression, according to her daughter Katrina vanden Heuvel, and jumped from the 15th floor of the building on April 30, the New York Times reported in its obituary.

A fellow resident who witnessed the suicide has said it was a messy one, as Stein ‚Äúmiscalculated‚Äù the jump and landed an eighth-floor terrace. She had also severed her leg in the fall, according to reports.

10 Gracie Square, however, is also infamous for more than these two suicides: In 1982, it was also where sixth-floor resident Frances Schreuder was arrested for conspiring with her son Marco to kill Schreuder‚Äôs father, wealthy Utah businessman Franklin Bradshaw.

Schreuder had reportedly been unhappy with the amount of money Bradshaw was allotting her, and persuaded her then-17-year-old son to shoot his grandfather dead in 1978. He was eventually caught, and Schreuder was nabbed while trying to escape out the window of her 10 Gracie Square abode.

The new vehicle, known as the Chevrolet Colorado ZH2, was revealed at the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) exhibition yesterday. The truck, which uses hydrogen fuel-cells, immediately drew a crowd filled with active duty military personnel.

Based on the existing Chevrolet Colorado truck, the ZH2 has a lot of modifications for military purposes. For starters, it is reinforced inside and out. To tackle the extreme terrain the military faces, it also has a specially modified suspension.

AUSA 2017 IN PICTURES

The fuel-cell-powered electric vehicle is more than six and a half feet tall and more than seven feet wide. It has 37-inch tires and based on a stretched midsize pickup chassis. If chosen to go downrange, then it would be the very first combat vehicle powered with a hydrogen fuel-cell.

GM has worked closely with the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) on the vehicle. Testing this fuel-cell vehicle for potential military uses began in January of this year and is expected to last a year.

PODCAST: LEARN TO DRIVE YOUR CAR LIKE JAMES BOND WITH THIS SPECIAL FORCES EXPERT

Beating the heat and the noise

With wide potential, hydrogen fuel-cells could mean significantly reduced heat signatures and near silent power-train systems.

Heat signatures are a big challenge for combat. Normally, a vehicle with an internal combustion engine is going to give off a lot of heat. This heat can be detected to reveal location and compromise a team‚Äôs location.

But if the enemy is hunting for Army vehicles with infrared cameras and they scan the ZH2 while it is running, the heat this new vehicle gives off is so low that it makes the vehicle almost invisible.

Humvees give off approximately 750 degrees of heat, so they can be detected from more than three miles away. The ZH2‚Äôs fuel-cell electric drivetrain, on the other hand, only gives off approximately 140 degrees making it harder to detect and allowing the vehicle to get closer to a target before detection. Some estimates place detection at about one mile away.

Why does that matter? For starters, it means that an enemy has far less warning American forces are about to arrive and far less time to react.

PODCAST: DISCOVER THE SECRETS TO WORKING OUT LIKE SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES

Army testing

Hydrogen fuel cell tech is advancing rapidly ‚Äì but is it stable enough and safe enough for Army use?

Performance and safety are two key issues that must be proven for the military to even consider adopting a new vehicle.

Chevrolet‚Äôs view is that hydrogen fuel stored at pressure is no more dangerous than conventional fuel. The ZH2 tanks store hydrogen at 10,000 psi. So far in the military testing, it seems to be safe enough for use in ground vehicles.

To evaluate the safety of the hydrogen fuel storage, the ZH2 tank has reportedly been shot with 7.62 mm standard, incendiary and armor piercing rounds. It has also been shot with .50 caliber rounds. Buzz at AUSA suggests that a rocket-propelled grenade round penetrated, but failed to explode.

Based on testing so far, the tanks seem almost bulletproof. But if the tank does become breached, then the ZH2 is designed to vent the volatile hydrogen.

More power

In the bed of the ZH2, there is also a portable generator (known as a Exportable Power Take Off unit) that can provide power. If a military team arrives in an area without electricity, then they just have to pull the generator out of the vehicle and they‚Äôre good to go.

It could be particularly handy for teams working in remote forward operating base to power essentials like communications and surveillance tech. Or a reconnaissance team could use the generator to enable staying in place for longer, for example.

This fuel-cell-powered military vehicle also produces water as a byproduct. Eventually, the water could be captured and used by teams as well.

Providing a generator is handy, but hydrogen to power that vehicle and generator in the battlespace is currently not exactly easy to come by.

Jet Propellant 8 (otherwise known as JP8) is, however, easy to come by and is used for common things like tanks and trucks. TARDEC has a reformer that converts JP8 to hydrogen.

So if military vehicles use this sort of revolutionary fuel cell power in the future, then the H2 tanks could be filled using this reformer device.",AUSA 2017: Stealthy Chevy trucks for soldiers?,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/10/ausa-2017-stealthy-chevy-trucks-for-soldiers.html

‚ÄúThese facts, standing alone, indicate a substantial security threat."" - Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa.

Awan pleaded not guilty in September to multiple federal charges including bank fraud and conspiracy. A grand jury had returned an indictment in August in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia charging Imran Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, with a total of four charges.

Perry, a member of the Homeland Security subcommittee on cyber security, said Tuesday that the House Office of Inspector General tracked the network usage of Awan and his associates on House servers and found that a ‚Äúmassive‚Äù amount of data was flowing from the networks.

Awan and other IT aides for House Democrats had been on investigators‚Äô radar for months over concerns of possible double-billing, alleged equipment theft and access to sensitive computer systems. Most lawmakers fired Awan in February, but Wasserman Schultz had kept him on until his arrest in July.

THE DEMOCRATS‚Äô IT SCANDAL JUST GOT EVEN MORE BIZARRE

According to Perry, more than 5,700 logins by the five Awan associates were discovered on a single server within the House and 5,400 of those logins appeared unauthorized. That server, Perry said, belonged to then-Democratic Rep. Xavier Becerra, who is now attorney general in California.

Perry said a criminal investigation by Capitol Police begun after the House Office of Inspector General reported its findings into Awan and his associates last year.

The congressman said Capitol Police determined that an image they asked Imran to provide was falsified, believing it to be a ‚Äúdeliberate attempt to conceal the activities that they knew were against House policy and the law.‚Äù

Perry also discussed how Capitol Police recovered a bag with a laptop featuring Wasserman Shultz‚Äôs initials from a phone booth after midnight in the Rayburn building about two months after House investigators barred Awan and his coterie from access to House computer networks.

The indictment itself addresses separate allegations that Awan and his wife engaged in a conspiracy to obtain home equity lines of credit from the Congressional Federal Credit Union by giving false information about two properties ‚Äì and then sending the proceeds to individuals in Pakistan.

The case has put renewed scrutiny on Wasserman Schultz for keeping Awan on the payroll for months, even after a criminal investigation was revealed and he was barred from the House IT network.

In a recent interview published in the Sun Sentinel, Wasserman Schultz blamed the ‚Äúright-wing media circus fringe‚Äù for the attention on Awan. The former head of the Democratic National Committee has suggested it's all part of an effort to distract from the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign and possible ties to President Trump's team.

After Awan was arrested at Dulles airport in Virginia trying to board a plane to Pakistan, attorney Christopher Gowen told Fox News that federal authorities have no evidence of misconduct by Awan relating to his IT duties.

In the four minute video, the rapper called the president a ‚Äúracist 94-year-old grandpa‚Äù and slammed Trump's feud with the NFL.

The rapper, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, attacked Trump on his response to the deadly Charlottesville protest, the NFL anthem kneeling and response to Puerto Rico. In the freestyle called ‚ÄúThe Storm,‚Äù Eminem is seen in a Detroit parking lot with nine other people standing in the background.

‚ÄúHe gets an enormous reaction/When he attacks the NFL so we focus on that/Instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada/All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather/Cause a Twitter storm with the Packers,"" Eminem raps while also showing former NFL player Colin Kaepernick support.

‚ÄúThis is for Colin, ball up a fist,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd keep that s--t balled like Donald the B---h.‚Äù

He says later in the freestyle: ‚ÄúNow, if you're a black athlete/You're a spoiled little brat for trying to use your platform or your stature/To try to give those a voice who don't have one.‚Äù

Eminem goes on to reference the North Korean crisis and the war of words between Trump and leader Kim Jong Un. He accuses Trump of escalating the tension that would drive the countries to a nuclear war.

""We better give Obama props/'Cause what we got in office now is a kamikaze/That will probably cause a nuclear holocaust/While the drama pops/And he waits for s--t to quiet down/He'll just gas his plane up and fly around/Till the bombing stops,‚Äù he says.

The rapper also says racism is the only thing Trump is ‚Äúfantastic 4,‚Äù referencing Marvel‚Äôs comic book series and associating him to the character The Thing, because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs orange.‚Äù He also accuses the president of disrespecting the U.S. military.

""He says you're spitting in the face of vets who fought for us/Unless you're a POW who's tortured/'Cause to him you're zero 'cause he don't like his war heroes captured,‚Äù Eminem says.

He ends the barrage of with the verses: ""Any fan of mine who's a supporter of his. You're either for or against.‚Äù

""And if you can't decide who you like more and you're split/On who you should stand beside/I'll do it for you with this,"" he says.

He then concludes: ""The rest of America stand up/We love our military, and we love our country/But we hate Trump.""

Sanilac County prosecutors said the case began when the now 21-year-old mother requested state assistance this summer for her son. As a condition of receiving that financial assistance, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services required her to cooperate with pursuing paternity and support for the child, prosecutors said.

A ruling last month in the case granted the woman sole physical custody of the boy, but Christopher Mirasolo, 27, of Brown City, was also granted joint legal custody after DNA tests showed he was the biological father. He was ordered to pay child support after the tests.

In Michigan, joint legal custody enables both parents to share decision-making authority about a child‚Äôs welfare.

Rebecca Kiessling, the woman‚Äôs attorney, objected and told the Detroit News she was stunned by the ruling.

CHILD PREDATOR WHO ALLEGEDLY RAPED 12-YEAR-OLD GRANTED JOINT CUSTODY OF THEIR SON

‚ÄúThis is insane,‚Äù Kiessling told Detroit News. ‚ÄúNothing has been right about this since it was originally investigated. He was never properly charged and should still be sitting behind bars somewhere, but the system is victimizing my client, who was a child herself when this all happened.‚Äù

Mirasolo allegedly raped the girl in September 2008, when he was 18. He was arrested a month later but prosecutors eventually let him take a plea deal that allowed him to plead guilty to third-degree sexual conduct, a felony, and he was sentenced to a year in jail ‚Äì but he was cut loose early so he could help take care of his ailing mother.

MICHIGAN WOMAN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS HELD IN SHED AND SOLD FOR SEX BY COUPLE, POLICE SAY

Two years later, he was arrested again and sentenced to four years in prison for fourth-degree sexual conduct. That victim was between 13 to 15 years old, according to his sex offender registry.

It's unclear whether prosecutors handling the state assistance and paternity case knew about Mirasolo's criminal history.

Sanilac County Judge Gregory Ross, who signed last month's order, agreed Tuesday to put the order on hold. He set a hearing for Oct. 17.

Mirasolo's attorney, Barbara Yockey, said she and Kiessling spoke Monday ""and have agreed on a private resolution"" that will be presented to the judge. Yockey and the county prosecutor's office noted that Mirasolo didn't initiate the case and never sought custody or visitation.

""Mr. Mirasolo never requested any determination of paternity, visitation, or custody ... the mother was not ordered to provide any visitation of any kind,"" prosecutors said in a statement released Tuesday.

State law prohibits custody or parenting time for parents of a child conceived through sexual assault or sexual abuse, according to Kent County Clerk Lisa Posthumus Lyons, who authored the 2016 legislation when she served as a lawmaker in the Michigan Legislature.

""There will be a debate,"" added McVay, EVP of content and Programming for Cumulus Media and Westwood One. ""We'll know more in a couple of weeks how it's going to change.""

The debate has already started; Caleb Keefer, the guitarist for the Josh Abbott Band, who performed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival hours before the shooting occurred, spoke out in favor of gun control on Monday.

""I've been a proponent of the 2nd amendment my entire life,"" Keefer wrote on Twitter. ""Until the events of last night. I cannot express how wrong I was...We need gun control RIGHT. NOW.""

Echoing Keefer's statements is the daughter of country music legend Johnny Cash, Rosanne Cash, a longtime advocate for gun control, who penned an op-ed urging her fellow musicians to take action.

Cash said the National Rifle Association (NRA) ""funds domestic terrorism"" and country music artists associated with its group ""NRA Country"" must speak up against it.

""For the past few decades, the National Rifle Association has increasingly nurtured an alliance with country music artists and their fans. You can see it in 'N.R.A.

Legislators across the nation of all political persuasions are recognizing that assisted suicide is bad policy and puts people like me at risk.
But the truth is, assisted suicide affects everyone.","I‚Äôm thankful I don‚Äôt live in a state like Oregon, where assisted suicide is legal. When I was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and told I would probably be dead in four months, I went in an instant from living the American Dream with my wife and son to living a nightmare. In that moment of depression, I might have chosen to end my life.

After a seizure sent me to the hospital, the neurosurgeon told me I had a brain tumor known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and that the tumor was inoperable. In fact, three different doctors told me there was nothing that they could do.

The news was overwhelmingly depressing. As a United States Marine Corps veteran of the Iraq War, I could have lost my life on a faraway battlefield serving my country. Thankfully I survived, but I had now received a death sentence at home.

With the support of my family, I chose to fight the cancer. I have had some great success with an experimental, cutting-edge treatment and am still alive three years after I was told I had only a few months to live.

Not everyone is so lucky to have the support I do. Since my diagnosis of terminal brain cancer my wife and I welcomed our second son into the world. I would have missed out on so much if I had been given ‚Äì and had accepted ‚Äì the option of assisted suicide.

Assisted suicide laws require a prognosis of six months or less to live, but how can we let our life-and-death decisions rest on these prognoses, when even the most experienced doctors are often wrong? My own experience reveals how tragic that could turn out to be.

We also know from the 2016 Oregon Health Report that in Oregon, which 20 years ago became the first state to make assisted suicide legal, only 4 percent of patients considering ending their lives were referred for psychological evaluation.

Yet a 2008 study, published in the peer-reviewed medical journal The BMJ, revealed that 25 percent of patients requesting assisted suicide suffered from major depressive disorder. These numbers suggest that people with mental illness could well be prescribed a death-too-soon, instead of the treatment they deserve.

On top of that, the legalization of assisted suicide injects government and profit-driven insurance companies into everyone‚Äôs end-of-life decisions. Just in the last year, more cases have surfaced of patients being denied coverage for care, showing how legalizing assisted suicide results in more abuse and less choice.

Take, for example, Stephanie Packer, a California mother of four suffering from a serious case of scleroderma, a chronic connective tissue disease. She reported that her insurance company denied her coverage for chemotherapy treatment but would pay for her to kill herself.

Then there is Dr. Brian Callister, a Nevada physician who asked insurance medical directors to approve lifesaving, curative treatments for a patient in California and another in Oregon ‚Äì two states that have legalized assisted suicide. Callister‚Äôs requests were denied, and the patients were offered coverage for suicide drugs instead.

People are starting to realize the threat that assisted suicide poses. Though an onslaught of new bills has been introduced, 23 states have rejected laws designed to legalize assisted suicide this year.

And states like Alabama and Ohio recently enacted laws to strengthen the prohibition of assisted suicide. Legislators across the nation of all political persuasions are recognizing that assisted suicide is bad policy and puts people like me at risk.

Some vulnerable populations, like people with disabilities and terminal illness, are at more immediate risk to be adversely affected by the legalization of assisted suicide. But the truth is, assisted suicide affects everyone.

The recruited deputy then asks her to spin around. Once she does, she finds her soon-to-be fianc√© bent down on one knee.

She runs up to hug him and he can be heard saying, ‚ÄúIs that a yes?‚Äù and she nods in approval.

The deputy who was conducting the supposed sobriety test asked again, ‚ÄúThat was a yes? Okay just wanted to make sure‚Äù and laughs.

The agency shared the following caption with the video:

Congratulations to future Mrs. Deputy Bowes

She thought she was a suspect DUI driver but it was a traffic stop that changed her life. Watch as Deputy Bowes proposes to his future wife. We are so happy for you brother, and thank you for allowing us to be part of this wonderful moment. Welcome to the Tan & Green family, and may you have a wonderful life together. #LASD#AV411 #SheSaidYes

And, economic consequences aside, addiction has deep emotional consequences and can destroy what is an otherwise healthy family business.
How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business?
Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does.
It‚Äôs a genuine investment that will pay dividends ‚Äì for your family business, yes, but more importantly, for your family‚Äôs sense of belonging.","Just last month, the Department of Health and Human Services announced its intention to dedicate an extra $144 million towards fighting the opioid crisis ‚Äì a decision which, while helpful, is long overdue. Substance abuse, and opioid abuse in particular, continues to wreak havoc on this country. Ninety-one Americans die each day from opioid abuse, and drug offenders make up the large part of our nation‚Äôs incarcerated population.

It‚Äôs a health care problem, it‚Äôs a criminal justice problem ‚Äì but it‚Äôs also a family problem, and it‚Äôs one that is especially challenging for families who run a family business. I‚Äôve spent all of my life and much of my career observing and advising family businesses, and time and time again I‚Äôve seen that substance abuse plays a large role in the sad fact that 70 percent of family-owned businesses don‚Äôt make it past one generation. The collateral damage when a family business falls apart extends to the employees, the stockholders, the lenders, the suppliers, the customers, and even the tax base and economic health of the entire community.

And, economic consequences aside, addiction has deep emotional consequences and can destroy what is an otherwise healthy family business. A longtime friend of mine recently confided in me his sorrow over his two sons, both of whom had been doing wonderfully in college ‚Äì until they discovered alcohol and quickly become addicted.

My friend tried putting his sons in treatment programs, but it didn‚Äôt work. He tried tough love, but his kids wound up hating him. His business prospered, but today his children won‚Äôt speak to him. He can‚Äôt hand his business on to them, his hoped-for legacy is in tatters, and much of what gave his life meaning has vaporized. What good, he asks himself, does it do to succeed financially and fail as a family?

I was deeply saddened by my friend‚Äôs story, but even more saddened to learn that he‚Äôs not alone.

One study found that more than half of family businesses had or were struggling with an addiction issue within the family. This may sound shocking, but it stacks up with other statistics: One in ten Americans have struggled with some kind of drug abuse and one in eight with alcohol abuse. Many American families don‚Äôt know whether their life‚Äôs work will live beyond them into the next generation or whether addiction and substance abuse will have the final say.

So ‚Äì what to do? How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business? How to avoid heartbreaking situations like the one my friend found himself in?

There‚Äôs no one single answer, and even among healthy families, things will look different. But I‚Äôve generally found that among the families that last, three core values were emphasized:

Be clear. Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does. Parents have far more influence than they know. According to Joe Califano, former Secretary of Health Education and Welfare under President Carter and the founder of the Center on Addiction and Substance (CASA), ‚ÄúParent power is the greatest weapon we have to curb substance abuse.‚Äù

He encourages parents to emphasize that substance abuse is not simply illegal but seriously dangerous, and to take the same attitude towards it that they do towards asbestos. Most parents would be in an uproar if they found out their child‚Äôs school has asbestos, but are willing to let substance abuse in school slide. And kids respond to this kind of clear condemnation: Those who know their parents would be ‚Äúvery upset‚Äù are more likely to abstain from drugs and alcohol than those who know their parents would only be ‚Äúa little‚Äù or ‚Äúnot upset at all.‚Äù

Be together. Oftentimes, risky behaviors result from unloving homes. When children do not feel loved and valued by their parents, they are far more likely to look for love elsewhere ‚Äì and oftentimes, that means succumbing to peer pressure to win admiration and acceptance.

Simply spending time together ‚Äì without screens and without distractions ‚Äì will increase family bonding and a child‚Äôs sense of worth and belonging. CASA found that teens who eat dinner with their parents fewer than three nights each week are more susceptible to smoking, drinking and drug abuse than those who eat with their parents five nights or more each week.

Be fun. Teach kids early on that you can have fun and be creative without substances. If they see you getting creative and enjoying yourself without alcohol and drugs, they‚Äôre less likely to turn to those things as a way to have fun.

Whatever you do, whether it be sports, board games, arts and crafts, or music, it‚Äôs important to intentionally set aside time to do it.

These things are important for all families that want to develop a strong family culture ‚Äì but they are especially important for parents who themselves come from families that struggle with substance abuse. Creating a stable family is particularly hard when you have genetics and family patterns working against you ‚Äì but not impossible.

Dr. Falk Lohoff, a scholar at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, argues that ‚ÄúWhile genetic factors can increase the risk of becoming addicted, they are not deterministic. There are also protective factors.‚Äù And one of the biggest protective factors is simple delay. CASA found that with each year of delay in substance use, the likelihood of addiction drops.

By putting the hard work in now of establishing clear values, spending quality time together and having creative, clean fun, you can create the kind of culture where your children will not only be able to perpetuate the family business, but will actually want to work for you and with you. It‚Äôs a genuine investment that will pay dividends ‚Äì for your family business, yes, but more importantly, for your family‚Äôs sense of belonging. ‚Äã",Mitzi Perdue: Substance abuse is sinking America's family businesses.

This means that nearly 8 percent of boys and nearly 6 percent of girls worldwide were obese in 2016, against less than one percent for both sexes in 1975.

An additional 213 million children aged 5-19 were overweight last year, but fell below the threshold for obesity, according to the largest ever study, based on height and weight measurements of 129 million people.

The researchers called for better nutrition at home and at school, and more physical exercise to prevent a generation from becoming adults at greater risk of diabetes, heart disease and cancers due to excessive weight.

Clear food labels on salt, sugar and fat content are needed to help consumers make ""healthy choices"", the study said.

Taxation and tough restrictions on marketing of junk food should be considered, it said. WHO has already recommended a 20 percent tax on sugary drinks to reduce consumption.

RAPID TRANSITION

South Africa, Egypt and Mexico which had ""very low levels of obesity four decades ago"" now have among the high rates of obesity in girls, between 20-25 percent, Ezzati said.

""The experience of east Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean show that the transition from underweight to overweight and obesity can be rapid,"" the study said.

If current trends continue, in 2022 there will be more obese children and teenagers worldwide than underweight ones, who now number 192 million, half of them in India, the study said.

Polynesia and Micronesia had the highest rates of child obesity last year, 25.4 percent in girls and 22.4 percent in boys, followed by ""the high-income English-speaking region"" that includes the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and Britain.

Among high-income countries, the United States had ""the highest obesity rates for girls and boys"", 19.5 percent and 23.3 percent, respectively.

""Children are not getting physical activity in the school days, there is poor food opportunities in many schools, walking and cycling to school is going down in many countries, unsafe in many other countries, and parents are not being given the right, sufficient advice on nutrition,"" said Fiona Bull of WHO's department of non-communicable diseases.

""It's the changing environments, food, behaviors, portions, consumption patterns have completely changed over the last 40 years.

Abdominal pain after mealsIf you suffer from abdominal pain, note any consistencies with the time of day or activities you‚Äôre doing.
Chest painBecause the gallbladder is located in the upper abdominal area, pain caused by gallbladder problems can radiate to the chest.
However, a change in stool color may indicate a gallbladder problem, especially if it is pale or clay-colored.
Although a common symptom for other digestive conditions, it can mean that a gallbladder problem exists.","Have you ever come across someone who has experienced gallstones? Chances are that you haven‚Äôt heard much else about the gallbladder otherwise.

However, this small, inconspicuous organ can cause problems if it gets blocked or hindered from functioning. To determine if this might be the case for you, you can look for 10 common symptoms of gallbladder problems.

First, the gallbladder is a small sac that sits just below your liver. Its sole function is to release bile into the digestive tract to break down foods that you eat, especially fatty foods.

DO YOU HAVE LIVER DAMAGE?

While many healthy people can live without their gallbladder, it does help to keep the digestive system running smoothly. You may have a problem with your gallbladder if you experience:

1. Abdominal pain after meals

If you suffer from abdominal pain, note any consistencies with the time of day or activities you‚Äôre doing. You may notice that the pain begins or worsens around mealtimes, especially after eating fatty or greasy foods. If this is the case, your intestines may be having a difficult time digesting the fat from your meals.

2. Nausea or vomiting

While this symptom alone won‚Äôt give you a good indication of a gallbladder issue, you may experience the nausea and vomiting along with several other symptoms.

3. Chest pain

Because the gallbladder is located in the upper abdominal area, pain caused by gallbladder problems can radiate to the chest. Especially if you‚Äôre suffering from a blockage, you might even feel as if you‚Äôre having a heart attack.

4. Jaundice

Jaundice will occur if your gallbladder gets blocked by gallstones. Because the gallbladder cannot move the bile through the body, bile will begin to build up and leave excessive amounts of bilirubin in the blood.

5 ARTHRITIS TYPES AND HOW TO TELL THEM APART

Eventually, the extra bilirubin will cause yellowing in your skin or eyes, called jaundice. Seek prompt medical treatment.

5. Intermittent abdominal pain

Another characteristic symptom that you may experience is severe, intermittent abdominal pain. This pain may last several hours and may not happen at regular intervals. In fact, they can sometimes occur with years in between.

Again, this type of pain might be attributed to a gallstone blockage. With a blockage, the gallbladder may actually be contracting in an attempt to clear itself of build-up. Your doctor would describe this contraction as a biliary colic.

6. Fever/chills

A fever related to the gallbladder indicates that you have an inflammation. Your gallbladder can become inflamed (cholecystitis) by gallstones, bacterial infection, alcohol consumption or a tumor.

In some cases of gallstone blockage, the gallbladder may even rupture, a serious danger that requires immediate medical action. If you have any notion that your fever is related to a gallbladder problem, see your doctor.

7. Change in the color of urine or stools

When bile is flowing properly through your digestive system, you should normally have a brown-colored stool. However, a change in stool color may indicate a gallbladder problem, especially if it is pale or clay-colored. Your urine can also darken, but this symptom is more vague and can be related to other problems as well.

8. Chronic diarrhea

In the case of gallbladder disease, you may notice a general fullness in your stomach, long-term abdominal discomfort and excessive gas. In this case, you will likely suffer from chronic diarrhea as your body struggles to digest properly.

9. Heartburn and indigestion

By its very definition, indigestion suggests a disruption in the body‚Äôs ability to digest food. Although a common symptom for other digestive conditions, it can mean that a gallbladder problem exists. Check into the indigestion if it happens frequently, especially after meals with fatty foods.

10. Pain when inhaling

Finally, pain related to your gallbladder may increase when you take in a deep breath. This correlation occurs because of where the gallbladder is located in the body. The pain may indicate a blockage in the gallbladder and should be evaluated by a doctor.

Problems associated with the gallbladder can have a variety of symptoms, depending on the exact condition. However, upper abdominal pain and difficulty digesting fatty foods are good indications of a gallbladder problem. While you may not need your gallbladder for essential, everyday life, you should look into any problems that you suspect are related to this organ. Then, once you‚Äôre cleared by a doctor, you can safely forget about your gallbladder again.

The messages suggest that the meeting was not set up to pass on damaging information about Hillary Clinton on behalf of the Russian government.

Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya believed she was meeting President Donald Trump‚Äôs oldest son to discuss the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 sanction law aimed at top Russian officials, and did not have information on behalf of the Kremlin to pass on to the Trump campaign, according to the emails.

In an email chain between music publicist Rob Goldstone and Veselnitskaya, she asks to invite Russian-born lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin to the meeting, saying he was ‚Äúworking to advance these issues with several congressmen,‚Äù the Wall Street Journal reported.

‚ÄúHe has invaluable knowledge about the positions held by the members of the Foreign Relations Committee that will be important to our discussion,‚Äù she adds. Akhmetshin has worked to overturn the Magnitsky Act.

Following a New York Times report in July, Trump Jr. was accused of taking the meeting, organized by Goldstone, knowing that the attorney had damaging information on Clinton coming from the Russian government.

Goldstone said at the time that he could set up a meeting to provide ‚Äúvery high level and sensitive information‚Äù compromising Clinton‚Äôs election chances as part of ‚ÄúRussia and its government‚Äôs support for Mr. Trump.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs what you say, I love it,‚Äù Trump Jr. wrote in response to the request for the meeting.

Following the controversy, Don Jr. defended himself, saying Veselnitskaya did not have any information and in fact wanted to focus on other non-election-related issues. She echoed his view on multiple occasions, saying the Magnitsky Act -- a U.S. attempt to punish Russian officials after the death of a whistleblower -- had always been the reason for the meeting.

The emails were released by Scott Balber, an attorney for Aras Agalarov, who helped to organize the meeting with Trump Jr.

Balber said the emails were released to contradict Goldstone‚Äôs remarks and bolster the case that the meeting in fact had nothing to do with the Kremlin‚Äôs attempt to collude with the Trump campaign.

He also told the Journal that the Russian lawyer has been fighting the Magnitsky Act for years and reached out to numerous Russian authorities.

As part of her effort against the sanction law, she had a five-page set of talking points, including one reference to Clinton, suggesting a U.S. company, Ziff Brothers Investments, had avoided taxes in Russia and donated to the Democratic Party, possibly Clinton.","Trump Tower meeting wasn't about Clinton 'dirt,' emails show",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/11/trump-tower-meeting-wasnt-about-clinton-dirt-emails-show.html

A federal magistrate judge in San Francisco has scheduled a hearing Wednesday on a request filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, which accuses the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services of refusing to let the girl be taken for the procedure.

Rochelle Garza, a lawyer appointed to represent the girl's legal interests, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the teen may be up to 14 weeks pregnant. Texas state law prohibits most abortions after 20 weeks.

Garza said the teen is from Central America but declined to give the girl's name or identify the specific country where she was from, citing the girl's privacy as a minor.

With her help, the girl obtained a judicial waiver under a Texas law requiring a minor seeking an abortion to get consent from a parent. But staff at the facility where she's being held refused to take her to her appointments with a doctor to seek an abortion, or let the attorney take her, even though private groups that support abortion rights have raised money for the procedure, Garza said.

Instead, she was taken to a crisis pregnancy center. Such centers encourage pregnant women not to have an abortion.

""I feel like they are trying to coerce me to carry my pregnancy to term,"" the girl said in a declaration filed in federal court last week.

The teen‚Äôs request for an abortion has been met with harsh denials by U.S. and state officials.

U.S. lawyers representing HHS argued that the ACLU's request for a temporary restraining order allowing an abortion to go forward was wrong on technical grounds, since the original lawsuit argued HHS was violating the First Amendment by allowing religious groups to allegedly refuse access to abortion. In this case, the 17-year-old is not being held in a facility with a religious affiliation, government lawyers said.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton went further in a separate filing Tuesday. Paxton, who is a strident opponent of abortion rights like most leaders in the nation's largest conservative state, argued that people in the United States illegally without some type of established ties to the country did not have a ""constitutional right to an abortion on demand.""

If the court rules in the girl's favor, ""the ruling will create a right to abortion for anyone on earth who enters the U.S. illegally,"" Paxton said in a statement. ""And with that right, countless others undoubtedly would follow. Texas must not become a sanctuary state for abortions.""

It was not immediately known how long the girl would be held at the facility, or whether she would eventually be transferred.

Identifying quality wood furniture can be difficult these days. Many pieces look great in the store, only to prove flimsy once you get them home and start to use them. Here‚Äôs what to look for, and what to avoid, when shopping for your next piece of wood furniture.

When made with high-quality materials and solid construction, wood furniture can last for decades and sometimes even centuries. But not everything you see in stores is built to last. Buy something that‚Äôs made poorly and you‚Äôll start to see wear and tear way too soon. How can you tell the difference? It‚Äôs harder than you might think. The first thing to pay attention to is the wood itself.

Solid wood. The highest-quality material for wood furniture is solid wood. This type of furniture will be made from single pieces of wood or wood boards that are glued together to make panels ‚Äî trees are only so wide, after all. If something is described as being made with solid wood, find out if that describes the entire piece or just certain parts.

Hardwood. Solid wood can be categorized as either hardwood or softwood. Hardwood comes from slower-growing trees and the wood is denser and more resistant to dings. Common hardwoods include oak, ash, walnut, cherry and maple.

Softwood. Softwood comes from faster-growing trees and the wood is less dense. Some common softwoods are pine, fir and poplar. Since these trees grow faster, furniture made using their wood tends to be less expensive than pieces made from hardwood.

Domestic wood. Domestic wood comes from trees that are grown and processed in the United States. Common domestic wood species include oak, maple, cherry, walnut, ash, poplar and pine.

A quick note about how wood is described: The species can describe either the material or the stain color. So something described as walnut might be stained that color but actually be made from pine. This isn‚Äôt necessarily bad ‚Äî just make sure you know what you‚Äôre getting. You shouldn‚Äôt be paying walnut prices for a piece of furniture made from less-expensive wood.

Imported wood. A lot of imported furniture is made from tropical wood species such as rubberwood (sometimes known as plantation hardwood), mango, acacia or sheesham (a type of rosewood). These species can produce a sturdy piece of furniture, but they may be susceptible to cracking if they‚Äôre coming from a humid environment to a drier one.

Benefits of solid wood. Ensuring that your furniture is 100 percent solid wood is a pretty fail-safe way to know that you‚Äôre purchasing something high-quality. Solid wood construction is extremely long-lasting and can be easily refinished and repaired down the road.

Cons of solid wood. Solid wood is definitely the best choice for furniture but, as with any natural material, there can be downsides. Solid wood is more susceptible to changes in climate, which may cause it to crack or warp. It‚Äôs also more expensive than furniture made from engineered wood products.

Plywood. Plywood (sometimes called engineered hardwood) is made by gluing together thin layers of solid wood. When used in furniture construction, plywood is covered with a thin layer of stained and finished wood ‚Äî a veneer.

Pros of plywood. The main benefit of plywood is that it‚Äôs stable when the climate changes and is less likely to warp or crack in dry climates. It can also give you a sturdy piece of furniture at a lower cost than solid wood.

Cons of plywood. Sometimes the quality of plywood comes down to the quality of the veneer. Poor-quality veneers can chip, revealing the lower-quality wood underneath. Damage may also be difficult to repair since the bulk of the furniture is made using a different wood species than the veneer. Also, some plywood is made using chemicals with formaldehyde, which can affect indoor air quality, although formaldehyde-free plywood is available.

MDF. Medium-density fiberboard is made from wood waste products (basically sawdust) that have been mixed with resins. The mixture is compressed to create large, flat boards. For furniture, MDF is finished with a layer of real-wood veneer or non-wood laminate.

Pros and cons of MDF. There are more cons than pros when you‚Äôre talking about MDF furniture. Pieces made from it are less expensive than those made of solid wood or plywood, which makes them budget-friendly. However, MDF requires a lot of chemicals to make and is the highest-formaldehyde-emitting wood product out there. Other downsides: It can easily be damaged by water, it‚Äôs difficult to repair, it doesn‚Äôt hold screws very well and it‚Äôs heavy.

Particle board. Made similarly to MDF, particle board uses larger wood scraps to create boards. You can differentiate particle board from MDF by spotting the pockets of air when looking at it from the side.

Pros and cons of particle board. The one thing particle board has going for it is that it‚Äôs inexpensive. And then there are the downsides: It emits formaldehyde, requires a lot of chemicals to produce, is susceptible to moisture damage and really doesn‚Äôt hold screws well. Particle board furniture tends to loosen up quickly, resulting in wobbles.

Veneers. A veneer is a thin sheet of real wood that is applied to the outside of a piece of wood furniture. It can be added to any of the wood products mentioned above. Veneers are used when you want to match up wood grain to create a design, or to cover a lower-cost piece of furniture.

Selecting veneered furniture. Veneer quality varies widely. Look for those that are thicker, have good adhesion and are glued to solid wood or plywood as opposed to MDF or particle board. Poorly done veneers can peel and chip.

DONNA KARAN SORRY AFTER COMMENTS PRAISING HARVEY WEINSTEIN

The 56-year-old actor is one of the first prominent male Hollywood stars to speak out against Weinstein since the allegations came out. Weinstein was fired from the Weinstein Company, his own company he started with his brother, on Sunday.

Many A-listers who have worked with the producer, including Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, have stayed silent throughout the scandal. Affleck released a statement on Facebook Tuesday saying the new allegations made him ""sick.""

""I am saddened and angry that a man who I worked with used his position of power to intimidate, sexually harass and manipulate many women over decades. The additional allegations of assault that I read this morning made me sick. This is completely unacceptable, and I find myself asking what I can do to make sure this doesn‚Äôt happen to others,"" Affleck said.

He added: ""We need to do better at protecting our sisters, friends, co-workers and daughters. We must support those who come forward, condemn this type of behavior when we see it and help ensure there are more women in positions of power.""

TheWrap CEO and Editor-in-Chief Sharon Waxman claimed Damon and Russell Crowe had called her to vouch for Fabrizio Lombardo, who she said ‚Äúhad no film experience and his real job was to take care of Weinstein‚Äôs women needs.‚Äù

The Guardian also released a report on Monday stating it reached out to more than 20 actors and male directors, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Bradley Cooper, who have worked with Weinstein. They all declined to comment or did not respond.

""By the time you have come to a doctor for help getting pregnant, ovarian reserve is a large consideration,"" Santoro said.","Lab tests showing that women have low reserves of eggs in their ovaries may not necessarily mean they will struggle to get pregnant, a U.S. study suggests.

For the study, researchers examined results from blood and urine tests for so-called biomarkers that indicate ovarian reserve, or egg supply, in 750 women ages 30 to 44.

Women with test results indicating low ovarian reserve were no less likely to conceive within six or 12 months of attempts than women whose lab tests didn't point to a limited egg supply, researchers report in JAMA.

CHILD AND TEEN OBESITY RATES SOAR GLOBALLY, WHO REPORTS

""These blood tests do predict how well a woman will respond to fertility treatment,"" said lead study author Dr. Anne Steiner of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

""However, we found that they do not predict her likelihood of conceiving naturally,"" Steiner said by email. ""This challenges the clinical dogma that diminished ovarian reserve is a cause of infertility.""

Women are born with a finite supply of eggs, and that supply dwindles with age. Tests for ovarian reserve biomarkers have become widely used as a growing number of women elect to put off attempting pregnancy until they're in their 30s and 40s.

Doctors use the tests to decide whether to recommend egg freezing as an option for women to preserve future fertility options, researchers note, and home-based tests are also marketed to women who want to assess fertility on their own.

The study examined tests of three biomarkers of ovarian reserve: early-follicular-phase serum antimullerian hormone (AMH), serum and urinary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and serum inhibin B.

Women with lower levels of AMH and elevated FSH, which can point to limited egg supplies, weren't significantly less likely to get pregnant within 6 or 12 months of trying to conceive than women with normal test results, the study found.

Results from tests of inhibin B levels also weren't associated with fertility.

One limitation of the study is that it assessed conception, but not whether women successfully delivered babies, the authors note. Low ovarian reserve might increase the risk of miscarriage, potentially by impacting egg quality, researchers point out.

FATAL PLAGUE OUTBREAK IN MADAGASCAR: PNEUMONIC PLAGUE HAS HEALTH OFFICIALS SCRAMBLING

The study team also lacked data on the semen quality of women's male partners, making it impossible to determine how this might have influenced the odds of natural conception.

The study also evaluated the effectiveness of the tests in women who had been trying to conceive for up to three months, and many of these women might not have had any difficulty conceiving with a little more time.

Doctors typically advise women under 35 to get fertility assessments after 12 months of trying unsuccessfully to conceive and tell older women to get fertility checked out after six months of trying.

The best use of ovarian reserve tests is to determine which patients may respond to treatments that stimulate the ovaries to produce more mature eggs, said Dr. Nanette Santoro of the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora. When ovarian reserves are too low, women may not benefit from fertility treatments.

Many women may not need these tests, or may not need to immediately act on the results, Santoro, author of an accompanying editorial, said by email.

""By the time you have come to a doctor for help getting pregnant, ovarian reserve is a large consideration,"" Santoro said.

President Trump escalated his battle with pro football players protesting the national anthem by urging the government Tuesday to end use of tax-exempt municipal bonds used to build or renovate National Football League stadiums.

Tittle died at Stanford Hospital. The cause of death was not immediately known.

Tittle played for the Baltimore Colts, San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants in a 17-season career from 1948 to 1964 during which he played in seven Pro Bowls. He tossed 242 touchdowns, leading the league three times, in 1955, 1962 and 1963.

Yelberton Abraham Tittle was born Oct. 24, 1926 in Marshall, Tex. He became a star for LSU before he was selected with the sixth overall pick of the 1948 draft by the Detroit Lions.

Tittle was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971.

Tittle never won a championship, but came to personify the competitive spirit of football, thanks to an iconic photo taken by Dozier Mobley during Tittle's final season in 1964.

The frame caught the then-37-year-old quarterback, who looked older than his years, after throwing an interception returned for a touchdown by Pittsburgh's Chuck Hinton. Tittle is seen kneeling in exhaustion and pain from an injured rib, blood dripping down his face from a head gash.

Tittle, also called ""YAT"" by his teammates, was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971. He threw 36 touchdown passes while winning the MVP award in '63, and held the NFL record for most TD passes in a season until Dan Marino threw 48 in 1984.

Tittle passed for 33,070 yards and 242 touchdowns in two leagues during his career, including 13 300-yard passing games in an age when the running game dominated the sport. Tittle was the only quarterback of his generation to throw at least 30 touchdown passes in back-to-back seasons when he did it with the Giants.

Born Yelberton Abraham Tittle in Marshall, Texas, on Oct. 24, 1926, he led LSU to the Cotton Bowl before he was drafted by the NFL's Detroit Lions in 1948. He joined Baltimore of the AAFC instead, sticking with the Colts when they joined the NFL in 1950 until they temporarily disbanded the following year, when he was redrafted by San Francisco, another former AAFC club.

Tittle then started 78 games and earned four of his seven Pro Bowl selections during a decade with the 49ers. He even became the first pro football player to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1954.

For three seasons, he was part of the 49ers' ""Million Dollar Backfield"" with Hugh McElhenny, Joe ""The Jet"" Perry and John Henry Johnson ‚Äî the only full backfield in NFL history with every member in the Hall of Fame.

The group was broken up in 1957, and Tittle lost his job to John Brodie for most of his final three seasons with San Francisco. Tittle still teamed up with receiver R.C. Owens to create another piece of football history with the ""alley-oop"" pass ‚Äî a high-arching downfield throw with Owens' exploiting his superior jumping ability against smaller defensive backs.

Tittle's career appeared nearly finished when San Francisco traded him to New York, but the quarterback was an improbable hit in the Big Apple. He became the Giants' starter in 1961, winning over fans and teammates who had favored 40-year-old Charlie Conerly.

Tittle became one of the NFL's most dependable passers, and New York reached the league's title game from 1961-63, but lost each time, leaving Tittle agonizingly short of his only remaining goal. The Giants plummeted to 2-10-2 in 1964, and Tittle retired after one of his worst pro seasons.

Tittle established Y.A. Tittle & Associates Insurance Services during his playing days, and he ran the business in Palo Alto, California, well past the standard retirement age. He appeared briefly in the 1999 movie ""Any Given Sunday,"" playing a coach, and was a favorite presence at memorabilia shows and NFL alumni functions.

""One of the things that's really magical about virtual reality, is you can get the feeling that you're really in a place,"" Zuckerberg said. Franklin followed up, saying, ""Crazy to feel like you're in the middle of it.""

FACEBOOK, GOOGLE, TWITTER: HOW TECH GIANTS ARE INVOLVED IN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

Zuckerberg was lambasted in the comment section on the post. One user wrote, ""Is this a joke? The Puerto Ricans are suffering and you are using our tragedy for this?? Heartless billionaire.""

Another wrote that Zuckerberg ""can't let a good tragedy go to waste. He has to promote Facebook. Typical. All he talks about (is) Facebook instead of victims and their suffering.""

Zuckerberg responded, writing, ""One of the most powerful features of VR is empathy. My goal here was to show how VR can raise awareness and help us see what's happening in different parts of the world. I also wanted to share the news of our partnership with the Red Cross to help with the recovery. Reading some of the comments, I realize this wasn't clear, and I'm sorry to anyone this offended.""

When a commenter wrote that it was distracting to see avatars talking about a real natural disaster, Zuckerberg added, ""I hear that. When you're in VR yourself, the surroundings feel quite real. But that sense of empathy doesn't extend well to people watching you as a virtual character on a 2D screen. That's something we'll need to work on over time.""

Others took to Twitter to express their dismay.

Facebook and Oculus are scheduled to have a press event on Wednesday, dubbed Oculus Connect 4. Zuckerberg wrote, ""I'll be going live and announcing some of the new work we've done with the community."" Facebook purchased Oculus for $2 billion in March 2014.

FACEBOOK CEO MARK ZUCKERBERGASKS FORGIVENESS FOR WAYS HIS 'WORK WAS USED TO DIVIDE PEOPLE'

Asking for forgiveness

The apology comes after the tech exec asked for forgiveness during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur for ways his ""work was used to divide people.""

""Tonight concludes Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year for Jews when we reflect on the past year and ask forgiveness for our mistakes,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúFor those I hurt this year, I ask forgiveness and I will try to be better. For the ways my work was used to divide people rather than bring us together, I ask forgiveness and I will work to do better. May we all be better in the year ahead, and may you all be inscribed in the book of life.‚Äù

Maria's aftermath

Last month, Zuckerberg said that Facebook would work to ""get Puerto Rico back online"" after the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Maria, a category 4 storm, which ravaged the country. Facebook donated $1.5 million to NetHope and the World Food Programme, as well as donating ads ""to get critical information to people in the region"" and teams of facebook workers ""to deliver emergency telecommunications assistance to get the systems up and running.""

He has also helped raise over $120,000 for Save the Children to help support the recovery of Puerto Rico.

Three weeks after the storm, just over 10 percent of the island has power and roughly 33 percent of cell towers have been restored, according to the Puerto Rico government's website.

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they‚Äôre practically foolproof to grow. They‚Äôre perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They‚Äôre cold hardy and don‚Äôt need summer water to thrive. They‚Äôre also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don‚Äôt show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‚ÄòT√™te-√†-T√™te‚Äô and fragrant ‚ÄòTiny Bubbles‚Äô are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it‚Äôs the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky‚Äôs Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn‚Äôt drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They‚Äôre fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you‚Äôre using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they‚Äôre in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn‚Äôt while they are growing and when they‚Äôre in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don‚Äôt need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don‚Äôt need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they‚Äôve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they‚Äôre completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don‚Äôt plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they‚Äôre in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don‚Äôt get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don‚Äôt have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won‚Äôt receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they‚Äôre in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch.

‚ÄúIt is about time that Roger Goodell of the NFL is finally demanding that all players STAND for our great National Anthem ‚Äì RESPECT OUR COUNTRY,‚Äù Trump tweeted early Wednesday.

The president‚Äôs comments come a day after Goodell sent a memo to NFL executives and club presidents, aiming to move past the weeks-long feud between the White House and NFL players who have kneeled or otherwise protested during the national anthem at the start of NFL games.

‚ÄúWe live in a country that can feel very divided. Sports, and especially the NFL, brings people together and lets them set aside those divisions, at least for a few hours,‚Äù Goodell wrote. ‚ÄúThe current dispute over the National Anthem is threatening to erode the unifying power of our game, and is now dividing us, and our players, from many fans across the country.‚Äù

Goodell added: ‚ÄúLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem. It is an important moment in our game. We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.‚Äù

He noted that the NFL ‚Äúcares deeply‚Äù about players and ‚Äúrespect‚Äù their ‚Äúopinions and concerns about critical social issues.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe controversy over the Anthem is a barrier to having honest conversations and making real progress on the underlying issues,‚Äù Goodell wrote. ‚ÄúWe need to move past this controversy and we want to do that together with our players.‚Äù

Goodell and NFL team owners will meet in New York City next week for their annual fall meeting, where the protests will apparently be discussed.

Vice President Pence got involved in the feud last weekend, when he traveled to his home state of Indiana to attend the Indianapolis Colts vs. San Francisco 49ers game on Sunday. The vice president left the game when players did not stand for the anthem.

Trump on Wednesday also slammed ‚Äúfake news‚Äù and Democrats, ahead of his tax reform speech in Middletown, Pa., Wednesday evening.

‚ÄúIt would be really nice if the Fake News Media would report the virtually unprecedented Stock Market growth since the election. Need tax cuts,‚Äù Trump tweeted.

A German journalist who was arrested in Turkey denied terror-related accusations as a trial against her opened in a Turkish court Wednesday.

Mesale Tolu, a German citizen with Turkish roots, stands accused of engaging in terrorist propaganda and being a member of a banned left-wing group, the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party.

The 33-year-old was on trial at a courthouse in the outskirts of Istanbul together with 18 other defendants. She was the first of 11 German or German-Turkish citizens arrested in Turkey over the past year to go on trial. Berlin considers them to be ""political prisoners.""

Dozens of reporters, including several foreign journalists, have been jailed in Turkey following last year's failed coup.

The case against Tolu and other German citizens are among issues that have soured relations between Turkey and Germany in recent months.

Tolu's lawyer told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle the prosecutors considered her attendance at the funerals of several members of the outlawed group as evidence of her membership.

In her testimony on Wednesday, Tolu rejected the accusations and said she attended the funerals ""out of conscience.""

She also said her trial was an attack on the press in Turkey, and appealed for sympathy for her three-year-old son, who has spent the past five months in prison with her.

Before her arrest in May, Tolu worked as a translator and journalist for the Turkish ETHA news agency.

German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told daily newspaper Bild that Germany is following Tolu's trial very closely.

""We demand a fair trial based on the rule of law,"" he said. ""Most of all, it has to be fast so that Mesale Tolu will be released as soon as possible and can come back to Germany.""

Gabriel also said that Tolu's case touches him on a personal level, ""because her little child is directly affected by the imprisonment.""

He vowed that the German government would continue to do everything to stand behind her.

German Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Adebahr told reporters in Berlin that a member of the German embassy's legal department was inside the court and monitoring the trial.

Tolu was last visited by members of the German embassy on Monday, who found she was ""doing fine,"" the spokeswoman added.

Deniz Yucel, a German-Turkish journalist for German newspaper Die Welt was arrested Feb. 14. Turkish authorities accuse him of disseminating terrorist propaganda and inciting hatred, as well as espionage. Yucel denies the allegations.

On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that a Turkish court convicted its reporter Ayla Albayrak of engaging in terror propaganda for an article she wrote and sentenced her to two years and one month in prison. Albayrak, who is in New York and convicted in absentia, will appeal her conviction.

Like the Vegas attack, the tragic outcomes of most large domestic attacks that have occurred in the U.S. could have been mitigated using military defensive tactics in and around special events and populated areas.
What is needed now is a more robust and well-trained police force capable of outside the box thinking and unconventional tactics.
Patrol officers should be outfitted and armed with long guns and body armor and trained in tactics that mimic the effective direct action techniques used by military Special Forces.
As a U.S. Navy SEAL and FBI Special Agent, I have seen how effective unconventional military tactics can be against an enemy, and how they are desperately needed in police departments across the country.","The recent attack in Las Vegas once again demonstrated how vulnerable special events actually are and how little police tactics have advanced to mitigate potential threats. Also, the attack displayed our citizenry‚Äôs continuing unawareness of the possibility they could be caught up in a violent attack anywhere large crowds gather. Like the Boston Bombing in 2013, the Vegas attack was carried out on an open-air location that does not have the benefit of a controlled space surrounded by stadium walls that protect the patrons from an outside attack.

Like the Vegas attack, the tragic outcomes of most large domestic attacks that have occurred in the U.S. could have been mitigated using military defensive tactics in and around special events and populated areas. Likewise, with just a little effort, most people could have dramatically improved their survival rate by increasing their awareness before attending. Utilizing the same information as the bad guys, the patrons themselves could have made educated predictions of where, when and how an attacker may strike.

Consider the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England on May 22 of this year. The attackers knew that getting a bomb inside the moderately secured (hardened) stadium would be a very difficult procedure. Instead, the attackers determined the most effective place to carry out their attack would be the critical area outside the stadium at the main location for patron pick up and drop off at the end of the concert. Tragically, most of those killed would likely still be alive if they had understood it was possible to conduct the same target analysis as the bad guys, utilizing the same internet information, same venue schedules and same understanding of the location at event time to determine the critical areas and critical times of that venue that should be avoided.

If citizens and law enforcement officials start to understand this attacker mindset and their methods of information collection and mission planning, they will start to ask the proper questions.

If citizens and law enforcement officials start to understand this attacker mindset and their methods of information collection and mission planning, they will start to ask the proper questions. For instance: Why aren‚Äôt there counter snipers on the roofs of buildings around Las Vegas when large open-air events occur? Why were unchecked backpacks and duffle bags allowed in and around the most populated area of the Boston Marathon in 2013? Why do stadiums and arenas funnel tens of thousands of people through the same few exits at the end of every event? Why are civilians and law enforcement officials always caught off guard when an attack happens as if it were the first time evil has visited our nation? The answers to these questions lead back to the same issue in that we as a nation have failed to evolve in our awareness and defenses as fast as the attackers have advanced in their targeting and attack planning.

The days of traditional SWAT teams are over. Police departments should shift to training the total officer capable of engaging an enemy as effective as the military would in a warzone. What is needed now is a more robust and well-trained police force capable of outside the box thinking and unconventional tactics. Patrol officers should be outfitted and armed with long guns and body armor and trained in tactics that mimic the effective direct action techniques used by military Special Forces. As a U.S. Navy SEAL and FBI Special Agent, I have seen how effective unconventional military tactics can be against an enemy, and how they are desperately needed in police departments across the country.

With the advent of technologies such as Airsoft weapons that mimic real life firearms in size and weight, but shoot small plastic pellets, the cost of department tactical training should have plummeted. Yet departments continue to train their street officers on static ranges with very little real world scenarios, keeping costs high due to expensive live ammunition. The result is money wasted and officers still lacking effective skills and ineffective battle plans.

Likewise, in order for our citizenry to remain safe and alive on a daily basis as well as at special events, it is imperative that changes occur in awareness and in the way people forward think their personal defensive tactics and response procedures.

The bottom line is that we are involved in a war that has never been encountered in modern recorded history. It is a war that involves growing numbers of the mentally ill and people that have been brainwashed by extreme ideologies. Combine those warfronts with the plague of learned helplessness sweeping our citizenry and you can start to get a picture of how real this new type of war actually is and how violent it has become.

It is time for law enforcement to advance forward and take some lessons from the military and at the same time, our citizenry must start anticipating the worst so they can understand the threat they are facing and be more adequately prepared to act.",Former Navy SEAL and FBI Special Agent: Terror tactics are advancing faster than police tactics,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/11/former-navy-seal-and-fbi-special-agent-terror-tactics-are-advancing-faster-than-police-tactics.html

In their years on HGTV‚Äôs show, ""Fixer Upper,"" hosts Chip and Joanna Gaines achieved far more than merely getting Americans to embrace open floor plans and shiplap; they made marriage look fun again.

The Texas couple‚Äôs decision to end the show after soon-to-be-aired Season Five ensures it won‚Äôt devolve into them simply playing certain roles, trying to recapture the magic of earlier seasons.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna‚Äôs gift for interior design and Chip‚Äôs skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes‚Äîshowing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

‚ÄúThis is just us recognizing that we need to catch our breath for a moment,‚Äù the Gaineses wrote on their blog. ‚ÄúOur plan is to take this time to shore up and strengthen the spots that are weak, rest the places that are tired and give lots of love and attention to both our family and our businesses.‚Äù In a video accompanying their blog post, Joanna spoke specifically about how quickly the couple‚Äôs four children were growing, noting that their eldest was almost a teenager and expressing how they were ready to ‚Äúhunker down with our kiddos‚Äù for a time.

This is exactly what made the Gaineses so appealing. They do care about time with their family‚Äîand they‚Äôre not the kind of reality TV professionals who want to turn their family into a permanent fixture on the screen by being ‚Äúon‚Äù all the time. Part of the couple‚Äôs appeal has always been their family-friendliness, their down-to-earth qualities, and the clear priority they give to living in accordance with their values.

But their decision to end the show is also appealing because the Gaineses themselves have changed: in the years since ""Fixer Upper"" began, they‚Äôve become involved in multiple home goods lines, launched a magazine, written a book, and even opened a bakery in their hometown of Waco, Texas. While I‚Äôm happy for the Gaines‚Äô success, the fact is they‚Äôre not the same couple facing regular problems that they were when the show launched‚Äîand frankly, yes, a reality show true to their own current reality (exploring questions like what mega chain is worth trusting for a home goods line partnership, for example) would simply not be as relatable or enjoyable to watch.

But I‚Äôm grateful for the years they gave us on ""Fixer Upper.""

There‚Äôs a real dearth of shows or, frankly, any entertainment that depicts marriage as fun. And while no doubt the Gaineses amped it up a little for the camera, the dynamics under-girding the show‚Äîthe push and pull between the goofy Chip and the more serious Joanna‚Äîcertainly seemed authentic, as did the joy they had in just hanging out with each other, occasionally trying to get a rise out of one another.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna‚Äôs gift for interior design and Chip‚Äôs skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes‚Äîshowing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

In her 2011 book, ""Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?"" TV writer and actress Mindy Kaling included a section, ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, Married People,‚Äù in which she wrote:

""I don‚Äôt want to hear about the endless struggles to keep sex exciting, or the work it takes to plan a date night. I want to hear that you guys watch every episode of The Bachelorettetogether in secret shame, or that one got the other hooked on Breaking Bad and if either watches it without the other, they‚Äôre dead meat. I want to see you guys high-five each other like teammates on a recreational softball team you both do for fun. I‚Äôm not saying that marriage should always be easy. But we seem to get so gloomily worked up about it these days.""

Kaling, whose own show ""The Mindy Project"" unfortunately devolved into a gloomy look at the hardships of relationships these days, concluded with the following plea:

‚ÄúMarried people, it‚Äôs up to you. It‚Äôs entirely on your shoulders to keep this sinking institution afloat. It‚Äôs a stately old ship, and a lot of people, like me, want to get on board. Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.‚Äù

And that‚Äôs exactly what the Gaineses have done on ""Fixer Upper."" In an era when marriage rates are down, people flirt with notions of open marriages and polygamy, and singles scour Tinder for one-night-stands, a show about home renovation unexpectedly became a celebration of how a husband and wife could be friends and partners, could complement each other and have a genuinely good time just hanging out with each other. In their interactions with each other and their four children, the Gaineses proved happiness isn‚Äôt impossible for an old-fashioned family in our modern era.",What Chip and Joanna Gaines teach us about marriage,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/05/what-chip-and-joanna-gaines-teach-us-about-marriage.html

How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business?
Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does.
It‚Äôs a genuine investment that will pay dividends ‚Äì for your family business, yes, but more importantly, for your family‚Äôs sense of belonging.","Just last month, the Department of Health and Human Services announced its intention to dedicate an extra $144 million towards fighting the opioid crisis ‚Äì a decision which, while helpful, is long overdue. Substance abuse, and opioid abuse in particular, continues to wreak havoc on this country. Ninety-one Americans die each day from opioid abuse, and drug offenders make up the large part of our nation‚Äôs incarcerated population.

It‚Äôs a health care problem, it‚Äôs a criminal justice problem ‚Äì but it‚Äôs also a family problem, and it‚Äôs one that is especially challenging for families who run a family business. I‚Äôve spent all of my life and much of my career observing and advising family businesses, and time and time again I‚Äôve seen that substance abuse plays a large role in the sad fact that 70 percent of family-owned businesses don‚Äôt make it past one generation. The collateral damage when a family business falls apart extends to the employees, the stockholders, the lenders, the suppliers, the customers, and even the tax base and economic health of the entire community.

And, economic consequences aside, addiction has deep emotional consequences and can destroy what is an otherwise healthy family business. A longtime friend of mine recently confided in me his sorrow over his two sons, both of whom had been doing wonderfully in college ‚Äì until they discovered alcohol and quickly become addicted.

My friend tried putting his sons in treatment programs, but it didn‚Äôt work. He tried tough love, but his kids wound up hating him. His business prospered, but today his children won‚Äôt speak to him. He can‚Äôt hand his business on to them, his hoped-for legacy is in tatters, and much of what gave his life meaning has vaporized. What good, he asks himself, does it do to succeed financially and fail as a family?

I was deeply saddened by my friend‚Äôs story, but even more saddened to learn that he‚Äôs not alone.

One study found that more than half of family businesses had or were struggling with an addiction issue within the family. This may sound shocking, but it stacks up with other statistics: One in ten Americans have struggled with some kind of drug abuse and one in eight with alcohol abuse. Many American families don‚Äôt know whether their life‚Äôs work will live beyond them into the next generation or whether addiction and substance abuse will have the final say.

So ‚Äì what to do? How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business? How to avoid heartbreaking situations like the one my friend found himself in?

There‚Äôs no one single answer, and even among healthy families, things will look different. But I‚Äôve generally found that among the families that last, three core values were emphasized:

Be clear. Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does. Parents have far more influence than they know. According to Joe Califano, former Secretary of Health Education and Welfare under President Carter and the founder of the Center on Addiction and Substance (CASA), ‚ÄúParent power is the greatest weapon we have to curb substance abuse.‚Äù

He encourages parents to emphasize that substance abuse is not simply illegal but seriously dangerous, and to take the same attitude towards it that they do towards asbestos. Most parents would be in an uproar if they found out their child‚Äôs school has asbestos, but are willing to let substance abuse in school slide. And kids respond to this kind of clear condemnation: Those who know their parents would be ‚Äúvery upset‚Äù are more likely to abstain from drugs and alcohol than those who know their parents would only be ‚Äúa little‚Äù or ‚Äúnot upset at all.‚Äù

Be together. Oftentimes, risky behaviors result from unloving homes. When children do not feel loved and valued by their parents, they are far more likely to look for love elsewhere ‚Äì and oftentimes, that means succumbing to peer pressure to win admiration and acceptance.

Simply spending time together ‚Äì without screens and without distractions ‚Äì will increase family bonding and a child‚Äôs sense of worth and belonging. CASA found that teens who eat dinner with their parents fewer than three nights each week are more susceptible to smoking, drinking and drug abuse than those who eat with their parents five nights or more each week.

Be fun. Teach kids early on that you can have fun and be creative without substances. If they see you getting creative and enjoying yourself without alcohol and drugs, they‚Äôre less likely to turn to those things as a way to have fun.

Whatever you do, whether it be sports, board games, arts and crafts, or music, it‚Äôs important to intentionally set aside time to do it.

These things are important for all families that want to develop a strong family culture ‚Äì but they are especially important for parents who themselves come from families that struggle with substance abuse. Creating a stable family is particularly hard when you have genetics and family patterns working against you ‚Äì but not impossible.

Dr. Falk Lohoff, a scholar at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, argues that ‚ÄúWhile genetic factors can increase the risk of becoming addicted, they are not deterministic. There are also protective factors.‚Äù And one of the biggest protective factors is simple delay. CASA found that with each year of delay in substance use, the likelihood of addiction drops.

By putting the hard work in now of establishing clear values, spending quality time together and having creative, clean fun, you can create the kind of culture where your children will not only be able to perpetuate the family business, but will actually want to work for you and with you. It‚Äôs a genuine investment that will pay dividends ‚Äì for your family business, yes, but more importantly, for your family‚Äôs sense of belonging. ‚Äã",Mitzi Perdue: Substance abuse is sinking America's family businesses.

I personally think he was sincere in thinking Frank needed to back away from the lawn mower.
My guess is that if this had taken place under former President Obama‚Äôs watch, Mr. Greenhouse would have refrained from said tweet.
I also have no idea if Mr. Greenhouse has boys of his own.
And I have no idea if he owns a lawn mower.","My pop, a WWII veteran, devoted husband and the sort of father I aspire to be, didn‚Äôt raise no fools. Except me.

I know I‚Äôm a fool because back when I was 9 years old and sporting a flat top and a pair of black Converse All-Stars, my pop advised me that I was now taking over the lawn mower duties from one of my older brothers. That brother was being promoted to the job of painting the house for the summer. So, head room being what it is, Pop handed the keys to the mower to his youngest boy.

Actually, no keys were involved. The mower was an old Sears model. For those of you too young to know your American history, Sears was the Amazon of the 20th century. Anytime between 1893 and ‚Äôround about 1985, if you wanted pants, a dishwasher, football pads, a lava lamp or a reciprocating sprocket wrench with detachable sprockets, then by damn you got it at Sears.

The lawn mower I inherited as a 9-year-old that early summer afternoon was a late-‚Äô60s gas-powered Sears model my brothers called ‚ÄúChopper.‚Äù Chopper ate anything that got too close to its massive rotating semi-sharp blades. It belched smoke as clumps of grass, rocks and half-chewed army men flew out from all sides. As a 9-year-old, I calculated Chopper‚Äôs weight to be somewhere between 160 pounds and a two-door Buick. It took all 85 pounds of me, and about three hours, to push that beast around our yard.

Now I know Pop raised a fool, because when he announced solemnly that Chopper was my responsibility, I looked him in the eye and said what I typically said back then: ‚ÄúYes sir‚Ä¶ you bet.‚Äù What I should have said was, ‚ÄúPop, I don‚Äôt mean to tell you your business, but do you have any idea how dangerous lawn mowers are to kids?‚Äù And then I would have handed him a couple of articles detailing those dangers, and for good measure recited current regulations related to child labor laws and how he just might be in violation of said laws.

Yes sir, that‚Äôs what I should have done. I know that now because that‚Äôs what former New York Times labor reporter Steven Greenhouse recently suggested following the curious case of Frank the Amazing Mowing Boy.

By now you‚Äôve likely heard the heartwarming tale of Frank Giaccio, the 11-year-old kid from Virginia. Frank has himself a lawn mowing business. According to reliable sources, he charges $8 a lawn. I‚Äôm not that good at math, but I believe that‚Äôs approximately 8 clams more per yard than I made during my mowing career, so I think it‚Äôs safe to say that Frank is some kind of business genius.

Anyway, one day Frank reached out to the White House Office of Lawns and Shrubbery, which is overseen by the Department of Landscaping over at the Ministry of the Interior I believe, and said it would be his honor to mow the White House lawn. Apparently realizing the lawn in fact did need mowing, they reached out to Frank and Bob‚Äôs your uncle. I do not know if Frank was also tasked with picking up dog poop prior to mowing. That may well fall under a different department.

Bottom line, Frank got his wish, and by all accounts he did a very fine job mowing the White House lawn. President Trump came out to greet and thank him. In the video of the encounter, Frank almost looks too busy to stop and shake hands. Clearly he‚Äôs worried about keeping the mowing line straight. And to be honest, he probably had a couple more lawns to get to that day. And as if this story needed any more of a kick in the pants, Frank apparently told the president that when he grows up, he wants to be a Navy Seal.

I don‚Äôt know about you, but after my experience as a kid, and now as a father raising three young boys, I wanted to shake Frank‚Äôs hand and tell him well done, keep it up.

But then, Steven Greenhouse came along and rained on my freshly cut lawn. He sent out a tweet that read, in part: ‚ÄúNot sending a great signal on child labor, minimum wage & occupational safety.‚Äù Now there‚Äôs a good chance that all Mr. Greenhouse was doing was pointing out that children and lawn mowers can be a dangerous combination. He is, after all, a writer on a wide variety of labor topics.

I don‚Äôt believe he was making any statement about the need to teach kids responsibility and the value of hard work. I personally think he was sincere in thinking Frank needed to back away from the lawn mower. But, frankly, children and anything else can be a potentially dangerous combination. My boys Scooter, Sluggo and Muggsy could take a cantaloupe, two mini marshmallows and a feather duster and turn it into a deadly weapon. Just the other day, Muggsy broke his nose while using a cardboard tube as a pirate sword.

Given that I‚Äôm a bit of a cynical sort, there is also the chance that Mr. Greenhouse didn‚Äôt vote for the current president and saw this as an opportunity to creatively take a dig at him. My guess is that if this had taken place under former President Obama‚Äôs watch, Mr. Greenhouse would have refrained from said tweet. That‚Äôs just speculation, folks.

I also have no idea if Mr. Greenhouse has boys of his own. My research staff is off on another team-building exercise at an all-inclusive resort, and I can‚Äôt remember the Wi-Fi password in the office. And I have no idea if he owns a lawn mower. If he resides in New York City, another fact I can‚Äôt be bothered to check, there‚Äôs a good chance that he has limited experience with yard implements.

What‚Äôs my point? When I started writing, I was going to take an easy potshot at Mr. Greenhouse and talk about how we all spend way too much time coddling our kids and trying to reduce life‚Äôs risks down to zero, and how mowing lawns teaches kids responsibility and the value of hard work. But Mr. Greenhouse has already been lambasted for his tweet in social media circles ‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt have the energy to leap on that dog pile.

Speaking of dog piles, I can look out my kitchen window and see my boy Scooter picking up after our dog Hendricks in the back yard. Scoot‚Äôs only 10, but sitting inside the garage is a gas-powered mower with fairly dull blades, and it‚Äôs now become his responsibility.

Not to worry, Mr. Greenhouse, I gave him a safety briefing‚Ä¶ told him to watch out for flying rocks and chewed-up action figures, advised him not to stick his fingers where they don‚Äôt belong and, when pushing it up hill, don‚Äôt let it roll back on you. It was the same briefing I got from my pop. Scooter listened attentively, and I‚Äôm proud to say his response was, ‚ÄúYou bet.‚Äù He‚Äôll be just fine.","Frank, the lawnmower boy, still has liberals all worked up.

""So long as we're looking at North Korea, we're not looking at problems in our own backyard.","North Korea's nuclear weapons development is spooking most Americans, and two-thirds of them say President Donald Trump's war of words with the isolated nation's leader is making the situation worse. Less than one in 10 think Trump's comments are making it better.

Those are the findings of a new poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, as tensions between the adversaries escalate and North Korea comes closer to its goal of having a nuclear-tipped missile that could strike the continental U.S.

The poll was conducted about a week after Trump intensified rhetorical exchanges with his counterpart Kim Jong Un, dubbing him ""Rocket Man"" and threatening in a Sept. 19 speech at the U.N. to ""totally destroy"" North Korea if the U.S. is forced to defend itself and its allies. Kim responded with dire threats and insults of his own, calling Trump ""deranged"" and a ""dotard.""

""The instability of it all makes me very nervous,"" said Diana Egan, 34, of Los Angeles. She described herself as a moderate Republican but voiced anxiety about how North Korea might respond to Trump's tough talk and tweets. ""You don't know where the line is for them, and where they say, 'I'm going to push this button.'""

The poll found that 65 percent of Americans think Trump's comments have made the situation between the U.S. and North Korea worse, including 45 percent who think he's made the situation much worse. Only 8 percent think he's making the situation better.

Eighty-nine percent of Democrats, 59 percent of independents and 38 percent of Republicans think Trump's comments have made things worse.

Although North Korea's ability to wed a nuclear warhead with a long-range missile and strike a target in the U.S. remains uncertain, most respondents are worried about Kim attacking America. In July, North Korea tested for the first time a missile that could potentially strike most of the continental U.S.

Some 67 percent of Americans are very or extremely concerned about the threat North Korea's nuclear weapons program poses to the United States. Four in 10 are concerned about the threat posed to where they live specifically, more so if they live in urban areas.

""He (Trump) will be somewhere safe. We got nowhere to go,"" said Anthony Leroy Waters, 61, of Wilmington, North Carolina. He said he lives 30 miles from a nuclear power plant and fears the impact an attack could have on his locality. ""It's scary,"" he said.

According to the poll, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to be concerned about where they live, 50 percent to 32 percent.

Overall, 68 percent of respondents say they are concerned about the threat posed to U.S. territories like Guam, and 69 percent are concerned about the threat to U.S. allies, such as Japan and South Korea ‚Äî North Korea's neighbors. That concern registered higher among older Americans than younger ones.

Some 75 percent of Americans also think comments made by North Korean leaders have made the situation between the two countries worse. Eighty-three percent of Democrats and 70 percent of Republicans agree.

Mui Baltrumas, 67, of Evanston, Illinois, dissented. He said the North Korean threat is being blown out of proportion and Kim Jong Un is more calculating and ""not nearly as crazy as everyone thinks he is."" Baltrumas, who leans Democrat, said he was more concerned by the ""John Wayne-style machismo coming out of the White House.""

""So long as we're looking at North Korea, we're not looking at problems in our own backyard. I think it's a nice, cheap political diversion,"" he said.

The AP-NORC poll of 1,150 adults was conducted Sept. 28-Oct. 2 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.

Respondents were first selected randomly using address-based sampling methods, and later interviewed online or by phone.

A prototype for the U.S. Postal Service‚Äôs next-generation delivery vehicle has been spotted making the rounds in the city of Leesburg.

A Trucks.com reader snapped a photo of the van, which is one of five proposals contending for the multi-billion dollar contract to replace the iconic Grumman LLVs that have been in service since 1987.

Commercial truck builder Workhorse confirmed on Twitter that it is the vehicle the company jointly-developed with truck body specialist V.T. Hackney. Workhorse didn‚Äôt reveal any details about the truck, but has previously said that it would be a hybrid. The company sells several hybrid commercial trucks and recently unveiled a plug-in hybrid pickup that‚Äôs scheduled to go on sale next year.

Requirements for the mail truck call for a 1,500-pound payload rating, 155 cubic-feet of cargo space, right-hand-drive, a sliding curbside door or doors, a maximum length of 230 inches and a six-foot four-inch cabin height. Workhorse‚Äôs snub-nosed creation appears to check all of those boxes.

Previously a devoted pro football fan, Limbaugh told Sean Hannity that he did not watch Sunday's slate of games after hearing of the planned protests by players and vowed ""I'm going to be playing golf on Sundays now.""

The act of taking a knee during the pregame playing of the national anthem was started by then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick last year. Kaepernick said his action was a protest of racial inequality and police brutality.

President Trump brought the protests back into the national spotlight Friday when he asked the crowd at an Alabama rally, ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say 'get that son of a b---- off the field right now, out, he's fired?'""

Following this summer‚Äôs reveal of the retro-style Bollinger Motors B1 battery-powered truck concept, Georgia-based Green4U Technologies has announced plans to put a six-door, 4x4 electric SUV into production next year.

The MTU-6 bears a striking resemblance to a classic Land Rover Defender, with a rugged utilitarian style. It rides on an aluminum truck chassis designed by Green4U, an electric vehicle company that was launched last year by Don Panoz, the founder of namesake sports car builder and engineering firm Panoz LLC.

Green4U CEO Jack Perkowski tells Fox News that the MTU-6 has a projected range of up to 230 miles per charge and is being targeted at commercial customers looking for a zero-emissions, off-road capable truck. The company brought it to the Association of the U.S. Army‚Äôs annual meeting in Washington, D.C., this week to gauge interest in it for military applications.

The platform is modular and can accommodate many vehicle types, including a pickup version of the MTU-6. Green4U has also built a street-focused prototype called the Enova with taxi services in mind that‚Äôs based on the same chassis as the MTU-6 but looks more like a crossover.

The bodies of both vehicles are reboots of existing designs and come from a Chinese supplier, allowing Green4U to keep costs down as it focuses on the drivetrain and chassis technologies, drawing on Panoz‚Äôs extensive expertise with aluminum and composites.

The $50 costume ‚Äî like other unauthorized costumes ‚Äî does not officially use ‚ÄúStranger Things‚Äù in the title, but the likeness to Eleven, played by 13-year-old Millie Bobby Brown, is indisputable. Brown, as Eleven, appeared on the Netflix series wearing a blonde wig, a pink dress with a high collar, and a jacket. The character also had a fondness for frozen waffles. The costume, called the Upside Down Honey ‚Äî a reference to the show's alternate ""Upside Down"" universe ‚Äî consists of a blonde wig, a pink dress, a jacket and a waffle-shaped purse.

The model in the costume also suffered from Eleven's same affliction: a bloody nose.

The costume's pink dress, however, has been shortened significantly, and the high collar has been lowered. The tennis shoes Brown wears have also been replaced with tan pumps, though the shoes themselves are not included with the costume.

A wildfire tearing through California's wine country continues to expand unabated, prompting authorities to order more evacuations.

The Sonoma County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday it ordered mandatory evacuations for several areas of Sonoma Valley after a blaze grew to 44 square miles (113 square kilometers).

After a day of cooler weather and calmer winds, officials say dangerous gusty winds will return to the region Wednesday afternoon, complicating firefighters' efforts.

The blaze in Sonoma County is one of a series of fires that flared up north of San Francisco on Sunday night and continue to burn with little to no containment. Seventeen people have died in the blazes, 11 of them in Sonoma County.

The fires have also left at least 180 people injured and have destroyed more than 2,000 homes and businesses.

Garnica's house was among more than 2,000 homes and business destroyed by the fires that have also killed 17 people.

He moved to the U.S. from Mexico more than 20 years ago, and after saving money from his steady job with a garbage company he fixed up his Santa Rosa house with new flooring and stainless steel appliances.

All of it burned early Monday when the fires broke out. But Garnica says he's still better off than when he came to America.

‚ÄúThese firms and aggregators have set a tone that is hostile to serious filmmakers ‚Äî even the actual name Rotten Tomatoes is insulting. And as film criticism written by passionately engaged people with actual knowledge of film history has gradually faded from the scene, it seems like there are more and more voices out there engaged in pure judgmentalism, people who seem to take pleasure in seeing films and filmmakers rejected, dismissed and in some cases ripped to shreds,‚Äù Scorsese wrote.

Scorsese went on to defend Darren Aronofsky‚Äôs controversial film ‚ÄúMother!‚Äù and called it ‚Äútactile, beautifully staged and acted‚Äù despite the ‚Äúsevere judgments of it"" that the director said ‚Äúdisturbed‚Äù him.

Scorsese believed critics ‚Äúseemed to take joy‚Äù in film's critical reviews.

‚ÄúAfter I had a chance to see 'Mother!,' I was even more disturbed by this rush to judgment, and that's why I wanted to share my thoughts. People seemed to be out for blood, simply because the film couldn't be easily defined or interpreted or reduced to a two-word description,‚Äù Scorsese wrote.

Scorsese explained that ‚Äúgood‚Äù movies were not meant to be ‚Äúinstantly liked‚Äù or even understood right away. The ‚ÄúGoodfellas‚Äù director mentioned classics such as ‚ÄúThe Wizard of Oz‚Äù and ‚ÄúVertigo‚Äù were both panned when they were released but went on to be considered some of the greatest films ever made.

Scorsese said he hoped the websites' movie scores would be ‚Äúgone soon enough‚Äù and other films such as ‚ÄúMother!‚Äù would ‚Äúcontinue to grow in our minds.""","Martin Scorsese slams Rotten Tomatoes, defends controversial film 'Mother!'",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/11/martin-scorsese-slams-rotten-tomatoes-defends-controversial-film-mother.html

ROME ‚Äì The head of Iran's nuclear agency warned the United States on Tuesday against undermining the 2015 nuclear deal, saying international nonproliferation efforts as well as Washington's international standing would suffer as a result.

Iranian nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi told an international conference on enhancing nuclear safety that Washington's recent ""delusionary negative postures do not augur well"" for keeping the deal intact.

He said Iran didn't want to see the deal unravel but that ""much more is at stake for the entire international community than the national interests of Iran.""

The AMG Vision Gran Turismo and E-Class Cabriolet will star alongside the superheroes in the upcoming blockbuster.

A lime green G-Class off-roader will also feature as part of the movie, Mercedes announced.

The AMG Vision Gran Turismo will be the ""civilian Batmobile"", driven by Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) on his job to recruit The Flash.

The car first featured in 2013 as a concept car but has been given a design overhaul and fresh interior for the big budget movie.

Included are a virtual dashboard and racing seats - plus it's larger than the original to allow 6ft 2in Affleck to get in easily.

There are futuristic illuminated panels inside, incredible gullwing doors and the wing mirrors are replaced by cameras.

A supercar for a superhero.

And Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) will go topless in the new movie with her choice of a car - a Mercedes E-Class Cabriolet.

She takes the ¬£45,000 drop top model on her mission to visit Cyborg.

The Mercedes G-Class will play ""an integral role"" in the movie, too, although its exact job has been kept under wraps.

Dr Jens Thiemer, vice president of marketing for Mercedes, said: ""With Justice League, we found the perfect partner to highlight our current vehicles as well as communicate the fascination of our brand.

""The E-Class Cabriolet is a natural fit for Wonder Woman. And who other than Bruce Wayne, aka Batman, would be more inclined to drive a car like the Mercedes-Benz AMG Vision Gran Turismo?""

Others, while agreeing on some type of cereal-based flavor, have also hinted that the new ‚Äúmystery flavored cr√®me‚Äù doesn‚Äôt quite lend itself to a cookie.

Several websites who reviewed the cookies are also putting their money on some type of fruit cereal. Over at Food & Wine, the taste-testers‚Äô results were ‚Äúalmost unanimously ‚ÄòFruity Pebbles‚Äô‚Äù; Foodbeast, meanwhile, guessed ‚ÄúFroot Loops‚Äù; and one editor at Delish pegged the flavor as fruity, but ‚Äúlike the Axe Body Spray of Fruity Pebbles kind of fruity.‚Äù

Consumer review site The Impulse Buy, meanwhile, seems to be torn between fruit cereal or creamsicle, but lamented that both were already flavors of Oreo in recent years.
